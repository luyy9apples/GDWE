every once in a while as a journalist you see a scene that grips you and will not let go , a scene that is at once so uplifting and so cruel it s difficult to even convey in words i saw such a scene last weekend at the college of notre dame of maryland in baltimore it was actually a lottery , but no ordinary lottery the winners did n't win cash , but a ticket to a better life the losers left with their hopes and lottery tickets crumpled the event was a lottery to choose the first 80 students who will attend a new public boarding school the seed school of maryland based in baltimore i went along because my wife is on the seed foundation board the foundation opened its first school 10 years ago in washington , dc , as the nation s first collegeprep , public , urban boarding school baltimore is its second campus the vast majority of students are africanamerican , drawn from the most disadvantaged and violent school districts seed maryland was admitting boys and girls beginning in sixth grade they will live in a dormitory insulated from the turmoil of their neighborhoods in washington , nearly all seed graduates have gone on to fouryear colleges , including princeton and georgetown because its schools are financed by both private and public funds , seed can offer this onceinalifetime , smallclasssize , prepschool education for free , but it ca n't cherrypick its students it has to be open to anyone who applies the problem is that too many people apply , so it has to choose them by public lottery seed maryland got more than 300 applications for 80 places the families all crowded into the notre dame auditorium , clutching their lottery numbers like rosaries on stage , there were two of those cages they use in churchsponsored bingo games each pingpong ball bore the lottery number of a student applicant one by one , a lottery volunteer would crank the bingo cage , a pingpong ball would roll out , the number would be read and someone in the audience would shriek with joy , while everyone else slumped just a little bit lower one fewer place left it was impossible to watch all those balls tumbling around inside the cage and not see them as the people in that room tumbling around inside , waiting to see who would be the lucky one to slide out and be blessed no wonder a portrait of hope and anxiety was on every face i am so hopeful about the school and just so overwhelmingly anxious about what happens to the students who do n't get in , said dawn lewis , the head of the seed maryland school during the six or seven months of recruiting , we heard all the stories of all the problems these kids are confronting in their schools , and each time parents would tell us , this kind of school is the answer the thing this child needs to be successful' when we were completing the applications , we received so many letters from guidance counselors and teachers and principals and even pastors saying , please , just exempt this kid from the lottery because without this , there is no chance for this kid , there may not be another opportunity' if you think that parents from the worst innercity neighborhoods do n't aspire for something better for their kids , a lottery like this will dispel that illusion real fast ms lewis said she s seen people on crack walking their kids to school we had parents who came into our office who were clearly strung out , she added they could not read or write , but they got themselves there and said , i need help on this application' for their son or daughter families do want the best for their children if they have a chance , they do n't want their kids to inherit their problems these aspirations are so underserved ms lewis said that she and her colleagues would meet with parents begging to get their kids in , help them fill out the applications and then , after the parents left , go into their offices , shut the door and cry tony cherry s son noah , an 11yearold from baltimore county , was one of the lucky ones whose number got pulled his teacher said if he got picked they 're going to have a party for him , said mr cherry this is a good opportunity it s going to give him a chance wish they could take all of them not everyone selected was in attendance , said carol beck , seed s director of new schools development so , on monday seed notified those who had won we called one school counselor the next day and told her that soandso was chosen , said ms beck , and she said thank you you have just saved this child s life' there are so many good reasons to finish our nationbuilding in iraq and resume our nationbuilding in america , but none more than this there s something wrong when so much of an american child s future is riding on the bounce of a pingpong ball
bongha , each day , a stream of cars and buses pulls into this hamlet of 121 people , disgorging thousands of tourists on a typical weekday and up to 20 , 000 on sundays they all come to see one man , the village s newest resident when that man takes a walk to a hill behind his house or to a nearby marsh , they follow him in droves , fathers carrying small children on their shoulders , homemakers snapping pictures with cellphones and those who get close to him thrusting their babies out to be blessed by him when he is holed up in his house , they pile up at the gate and shout in unison , mr president , please come out ! since left office on feb 25 and returned to this village in the country s southeast where he was born , he has become something south koreans have never seen before a former president as tourist attraction today , people were yelling outside from 9 am , mr roh , 61 , told a group of tourists gathered outside his home on a recent day whether in office or retired , a president needs some privacy all of you coming all the way to see me puts a big burden on me i feel grateful but i also feel sorry that i ca n't shake hands with each one of you or invite you all in for tea cameras flashed people cheered , jostling to get closer hey , president ! blurted an old man where is the first lady \? can we see her too \? mr roh s wife , kwon yangsook , sometimes joins him to greet the crowds otherwise , he fends off the common request with a joke she is washing dishes , he says , or she is putting on makeup and does n't want you to wait around because , you know , it takes a while this ritual repeats itself up to eight times a day , said kim minjeong , a tour guide in bongha he ca n't get away from it , ms kim said when one group leaves , another group quickly gathers at his gate if he does n't come out , it gets noisy outside and he ca n't work inside it s not easy being a former president mr roh was unpopular in office toward the end of his term , his approval rating fell below 30 percent , according to surveys but in the weeks since lee myungbak succeeded him , he has been establishing himself as a new kind of retired president in the past , if south koreans marched on a former leader s home and shouted outside his gate , they were demonstrators , not tourists of mr roh s predecessors , one was ousted in a popular uprising , one was assassinated and two were imprisoned for sedition and corruption his two immediate predecessors saw their names tarnished in the public eye by way of their children a son of kim youngsam went to prison for bribery , and all three of kim daejung s sons were convicted of corruption and while past presidents have , like mr roh , hailed from rural areas , they chose to make their homes in seoul upon leaving office the other four surviving former presidents now live under heavy police guard in the capital , where some meddle in domestic politics but none mingle with ordinary people mr roh , in contrast , rides his bicycle through bongha , a village near the city of kimhae he plants trees and cleans ditches with farmers he keeps a blog and he has visitors , thousands of them , every day his move into a newly built , lowslung house has brought a swirl of change to bongha , where residents , when asked what besides mr roh their town is famous for , give you a sheepish smile and cite its abundant persimmon trees banners welcoming mr roh flutter everywhere a road has been widened , and new parking lots built nevertheless , on weekends the snarled traffic forces tourists to abandon their cars outside the village and walk , creating the incongruous scene of throngs making a pilgrimage on foot to a noname hamlet in a sea of rice paddies villagers have turned their town hall into a thriving restaurant for tourists outsiders have moved in and are selling steamed ears of corn , roasted chestnuts and herbs along the narrow alley leading to mr roh s 43 , 000squarefoot residential compound i did n't particularly like him when he was president , said lee sooin , 22 , a college student but it really feels good to be able to see a former president up close and see where he lives he feels like an uncle next door we do n't have such intimacy with other former presidents they all maintain an authoritative , boring persona shin jeongsook , 30 , a kindergarten teacher , brought 67 children with her so they can have inspiration from the president s ragstofame career , she said \( born into a family too poor to send him to college , mr roh educated himself and passed the bar exam without having attended law school \) at the entrance to mr roh s boyhood home , now occupied by another family , a plaque tells a story guaranteed to pique a korean mother s interest that of mr roh s mother s dream of the womb , in which a pregnant woman is said to see her child s future when she was pregnant with mr roh , the plaque says , an old man with snowwhite hair showed up in a dream and gave her a large horse when she rode it , the plaque says , its hooves sounded like thunder mr roh says he has no intention of getting back into politics skeptics , however , question how long the former firebrand will remain aloof though he lives in the countryside now , he remains connected by way of the internet , as well as a network of diehard supporters who call themselves nosamo , short for people who love roh moohyun mr roh said he was busy beefing up his web site , another first for a former president , which he wants to turn into a wikipedialike database on social and environmental issues i am extremely busy , he said i 've got lots of things to do when i was president , i slept at least six hours a day , no matter what , because it was my duty as head of state to keep in good health but last night i slept less than five hours , staying up until 1 am working i feel free
kabul , afghanistan most of the additional american troops arriving in afghanistan early next year will be deployed near the capital , kabul , american military commanders here say , in a measure of how precarious the war effort has become it will be the first time that american or coalition forces have been deployed in large numbers on the southern flank of the city , a decision that reflects the rising concerns among military officers , diplomats and government officials about the increasing vulnerability of the capital and the surrounding area it also underscores the difficult choices confronting american military commanders as they try to apportion a limited number of forces not only within afghanistan , but also between afghanistan and iraq for the incoming obama administration , a first priority will be to weigh which is the greater risk drawing down american forces too quickly in iraq , potentially jeopardizing the gains there or not building up troops quickly enough in afghanistan , where the war effort hangs in the balance as security worsens the new army brigade , the third brigade of the 10th mountain division from fort drum , ny , is scheduled to arrive in afghanistan in january and will consist of 3 , 500 to 4 , 000 soldiers the vast majority of them will be sent to logar and wardak provinces , adjacent to kabul , said lt col rumi nielsongreen , a spokeswoman for the american units in eastern afghanistan a battalion of at least several hundred soldiers from that brigade will go to the border region in the east , where american forces have been locked in some of the fiercest fighting this year in all , the pentagon is planning to add more than 20 , 000 troops to afghanistan in response to a request from gen david d mckiernan , the top commander in afghanistan those troops are expected to be sent to violent areas in the south but they are expected to be deployed over 12 to 18 months nearly all would be diverted from iraq , officials say the plan for the incoming brigade , then , means that for the time being fewer reinforcements or none at all will be immediately available for the parts of afghanistan where the insurgency is most intense it also means that most of the newly arriving troops will not be deployed with the main goal of curbing the crossborder flow of insurgents from their rear bases in pakistan , something american commanders would like and president hamid karzai of afghanistan has recommended in recent months , amid a series of american military operations that caused civilian casualties , mr karzai has repeatedly said that the fight against the insurgents should not be waged in the villages of afghanistan but rather in the rugged borderlands to the east and south in an interview , the president s spokesman , humayun hamidzada , said there was no conflict between the january deployment and mr karzai s declarations while mr karzai had requested a focus on border areas , the spokesman said , additional reinforcements were also needed throughout the country , including in wardak and logar there are about 62 , 000 international troops currently in afghanistan , including about 32 , 000 americans , a military spokesman said , but they are spread thinly throughout the country , which is nearly the size of texas american commanders say they desperately need more military officials say that if general mckiernan s requests are met , deployments in the next year and a half or so will include four combat brigades , an aviation brigade equipped with attack and troopcarrying helicopters , reconnaissance units , support troops and trainers for the afghan army and the police , raising american force levels to about 58 , 000 the united states and nato forces are hoping to expand the afghan army to 134 , 000 from nearly 70 , 000 over the next four or five years col gregory s julian , a top military spokesman , said that for security reasons he could not say where exactly those troops would go , but nato s southern command in afghanistan includes kandahar , helmand , oruzgan and zabul provinces of immediate concern , american and nato commanders say , is the need to safeguard the capital , to hit new strongholds in wardak and logar , and to provide enough security in those provinces for development programs , which are essential to maintaining the support of afghan villagers unlike in previous winters , when there was a lull in fighting as many taliban fighters returned to pakistan , american commanders expect more taliban fighters to remain in afghanistan and continue the fight if so , the change would seem to reflect an effort by the emboldened insurgency to maintain its momentum and hold newly gained territory wardak and logar had been relatively secure until late last year but by most accounts , taliban activity has soared in the two provinces in the past year , as the insurgents have stepped up attacks against afghan and foreign forces , sometimes even controlling parts of major roads connecting kabul to the east and south the number of attacks in wardak by the taliban and other insurgent groups has increased about 58 percent since last year , and in logar about 41 percent , according to statistics collated by sami kovanen , a security analyst in kabul insurgents now have significant influence , if not control , in much of the two provinces , said mr kovanen , who draws his information from a wide range of government , nongovernment and private sources the american military command said it had incomplete statistics for the level of violence in those provinces frankly , in wardak and logar , we do n't know what we do n't know , colonel nielsongreen said in an email message there are few of our forces present in those areas , hence the reason for the incoming brigade there i suspect that violence will increase as we place this unit but will go down over time , she added , because we assess that there are considerable enemy support areas in both provinces and we will be going after them in june , three american soldiers and their afghan interpreter were killed in an ambush when their vehicles were hit by mines and rocketpropelled grenades as they drove through wardak province in august , three western women and an afghan driver , all working for the international rescue committee , a relief group based in new york , were killed in logar the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack the next month , the governor of logar province and three of his guards were killed in the explosion of a mine buried in a road american and nato military commanders eventually hope to turn over the country s security to afghan forces , but the afghan police and military are nowhere near ready to assume that responsibility , officials say the afghan government has already begun to work with local and provincial elected officials to extend the influence of the central government in the region , improve public services and gain the support of residents but the government s efforts have been continually hampered by criminal gangs and insurgent groups sediqa mubariz , a member of parliament from wardak , said in an interview that she would welcome any additional american troops in her province ms mubariz said security had been so poor that since last year she had not been able to travel from kabul to her home district in wardak , only 50 miles away
new haven in the spring of 1837 , a great depression afflicted the northeastern united states all the banks in new york city , philadelphia and baltimore suspended cash payments , as did many in boston of the 850 banks in the united states , nearly half closed or partly failed if the crisis of 2008 was caused by poor lending , the panic of 1837 , too , featured speculation and inflation the bank failures of 1837 were followed by high unemployment that lasted into 1843 foreign overinvestment \( chiefly british \) had augmented the bubble , which burst when the wily english pulled their money out president martin van buren , a jacksonian democrat , refused any government involvement in a bailout , and so was widely blamed for the panic van buren was defeated in his reelection bid in 1840 by his whig opponent , william henry harrison the similarities between the crashes of 1837 and 1929 are evident again today i am not an economist or a political scientist , but having been born in 1930 , i retain poignant early memories of the impact of the great depression upon my father , a working man who struggled to maintain a family with five children in a very hard time i am a scholar of literature and religion , and would advise whoever becomes president to turn to ralph waldo emerson , whose influential vision of america was deeply informed by the crisis of 1837 it may shock that the sage of concord should react to catastrophe with such idealistic glee most americans the governor of alaska , who never blinks , doubtless among them would be startled by the admonition to begin anew and ascend above our fate there is little disagreement that emerson was the most influential writer of 19thcentury america , though these days he is largely the concern of scholars walt whitman , henry david thoreau and william james were all positive emersonians , while herman melville , nathaniel hawthorne and henry james were emersonians in denial while they set themselves in opposition to the sage , there was no escaping his influence to t s eliot , emerson s essays were an encumbrance waldo the sage was eclipsed from 1914 until 1965 , when he returned to shine , after surviving in the work of major american poets like robert frost , wallace stevens and hart crane beyond literary tradition , emerson has maintained an effect upon american politics and sociology the oddity of emerson in the public sphere is that he has the power to foster fresh versions of the two camps he termed the party of memory and the party of hope the political right appropriates his values of remembering private interests as part of the public good , while the left follows his exaltation of the american adam , a new man in a new world of hope the rivalry between these polarized camps is very much apparent in this election emerson was electrified by financial storms the depression beginning in 1837 spurred his famous oration at harvard , the american scholar emerson would have understood our current raging polarities that american cultural nationalism should have been stimulated by a banking disaster is a wholly emersonian paradox another enigma is the direct link between the lingering financial crisis and emerson s formulation of his mature religious stance , crucially in his essay , selfreliance , of 183940 by selfreliance emerson meant the recognition of the god within us , rather than the worship of the christian godhead \( a deity that some americans cannot always distinguish from themselves \) whether they know it or not , john mccain and barack obama seek power in just this ultimately serious sense , although that marvelous passage means one thing to emersonians of the right and something very different to emersonians of the left senator obama s mantra of change celebrates the shooting of the gulf , the darting to an aim , setting aside the having lived senator mccain s change reflects what remains most authentic about him , the nostalgia of the party of memory barack obama emanates from the tradition of the black church , where the little me within the big me is part or particle of god , just as the emersonian self was but he is a subtle intellectual and will not mistake himself for the divine , and he has the curbing influence of senator joseph biden , a conventional roman catholic , at his side john mccain s religiosity is at one with the party of memory , but he has aligned himself with gov sarah palin , who , as an assemblies of god pentecostalist , presumably enjoys closer encounters with the comforting holy spirit regardless of these differences , whoever is elected will have to forge a solution to today s panic through his own understanding of selfreliance as emerson knew in his glory and sorrow , both of himself and all americans the wealth of the universe is for me every thing is explicable and practical for me i am defeated all the time yet to victory i am born

long pond , pa a shower swept over pocono raceway on sunday , stopping the sprint cup race just long enough for carl edwards to hop out of his car and visit his crew chief , bob osborne their conversation was angry and brief osborne had talked edwards into making a pit stop just before the pennsylvania 500 was redflagged edwards was not as sure that giving up the lead at that point of the race was smart , especially when it began to rain harder but the skies cleared and the race was restarted , and edwards s fuel strategy enabled him to win his fourth sprint cup race of the season , by nearly four seconds over edwards rose two places , to third , in the series standings , with five race remaining before the 10race chase for the sprint cup it was a stressful day , but it worked out for us , osborne said edwards said his conversation with osborne during the 41minute redflag period was so contentious that he had to walk away had the race not resumed , he and osborne were set to blame each other for losing it i was worried that bob was going to punch me in the neck or something , edwards said after the race he was kind of angry the ill will disappeared because edwards had the fastest car at pocono he led the race six times for a total of 53 laps , taking the lead from mark martin with 13 laps left in yet another long race on pocono s twoandahalfmile trioval edwards s average speed was 130567 miles per hour martin and kasey kahne had elected not to make pit stops before the rain delay , and kahne would have won the race had it ended then but it did not , and kahne had to make two pit stops instead of one to have enough gas to finish if it keeps on raining , we win , kahne said it did n't , and we got seventh we took a chance , and it did n't work out like we wanted it to edwards had just enough gas to finish , as did stewart and jimmie johnson , who was third like edwards , stewart and johnson made pit stops before the race was redflagged stewart , grinding through a winless season , said he did much better than he expected days like today remind you of how it feels to have a good day , he said johnson started on the pole , but martin took the lead on the first lap martin , who started second , led 53 of the first 67 laps , but he fell back because his crew had problems changing his right front tire on consecutive pit stops edwards charged into the lead for the first time on the 69th lap and held it for 21 laps johnson made a quick pit stop on the 90th lap and took the lead , but edwards darted inside him on the 111th lap to grab it back as rain began to fall , edwards and johnson were among 23 drivers to make pit stops on the 129th lap , ceding the lead to kahne , who won the previous race here on june 8 the race was redflagged after 131 laps bob made a courageous call , jack roush , the owner of edwards s car , said of osborne the thing i probably would have done if i had made the call , and i think most of our other crew chiefs had done , is protected what they had edwards said he was not as upset with osborne s decision as he was that osborne seemed to announce it timidly over the radio as if he were deferring to edwards during the rain delay , they argued about who would be to blame for the pit stop if edwards lost i do n't know what the perception is , osborne said , but we argue on a regular basis after a round of greenflag pit stops , kahne was in the lead with 29 laps to go , with martin behind him but they had pitted 10 laps earlier than edwards , stewart and dale earnhardt jr because of that , they were well outside the typical limit of 35 greenflag laps per tank of gas kahne pitted , then martin edwards rocketed into the lead meanwhile , kyle busch , the points leader , ran out of gas he finished 36th , and his lead over earnhardt dwindled to 176 points from 253 edwards trails busch by 185 points at least there were none of the tire problems that hampered the teams the previouse week during a race in indianapolis this race was won by shrewd strategy , even if it did not seem so shrewd at first going into the chase , you 're going to see a lot of heated moments , johnson said
change is out , and comeback has taken its place as the hot political buzzword , at least as far as new hampshire voters would have you know the democratic primary results out of the granite state surprised many observers last night , as hillary rodham clinton eked out an unexpected victory over barack obama , who had a solid lead in the latest surveys before the polls opened even before the race was called for mrs clinton , her supporters were calling her the comeback kid a reference to bill clinton s famous line after he placed second in new hampshire in 1992 despite a considerable amount of negative press new hampshirites , known for their independent spirit , also disagreed with iowa s choice for the republican nominee as the late surveys predicted , john mccain outpolled mitt romney , who until recent weeks had dominated the state john distaso of the manchester unionleader summed up his state s results it was greatest hits night in new hampshire last night mccain and clinton clinton and mccain sound familiar \? no , it s not 1992 , and it s not 2000 but , as veteran republican analyst patrick griffin said after the dust settled , there is obviously some sort of clintonian franchise in new hampshire and there is a mccain franchise wellknown brands got dusted off and that is where people wound up mccain s largerthanexpected win in the firstinthenation primary , after teetering on the edge of political extinction just last summer , allows him to argue that he is the gop frontrunner and sets him up to battle iowa caucus winner mike huckabee in south carolina and possibly finish off mitt romney in michigan hillary clinton s upset win after being written off by the polls and national media set the democratic race on an entirely new course there will be no quick tidal wave for barack obama s national movement it is now a twoperson race as the battle moves on in what is sure to be a bitter , hardfought battle for the democratic nomination the candidates , staff members and journalists who ve raced from iowa to new hampshire finally can exhale , if only for a day or so the gop s next focus is the michigan primary on jan 15 , and both parties are looking toward nevada and south carolina now s the time for fundraising and major strategy sessions usa today picked up some signals about how mrs clinton s team might be shuffled  several new faces were expected to come aboard , including maggie williams , a longtime confidante to the former first lady , and doug sosnik , who served as white house political director under bill clinton , according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity while none of the current team of advisers were expected to be replaced including strategist mark penn and campaign manager patti solis doyle aides acknowledged clinton s message needed to be sharpened and improved to run more effectively against barack obama and his theme of change john edwards , the democratic runnerup in iowa , didn t achieve the same success in new hampshire he placed third , with only about half the votes of his top two rivals in his speech tuesday night , mr edwards emphasized that there are 48 more states to go , but the los angeles times says his campaign funds might not stretch that far  edwards campaign has not been able to raise the kind of money that his top rivals , sens hillary rodham clinton of new york and barack obama of illinois , have pulled in with every failure to win a primary , he diminishes his chances of overtaking his opponents , said political analyst bruce cain , director of uc berkeley s washington center my view is that normally this would be the end , but i think it comes down to what labor wants , said cain , referring to the organized labor movement if they think it s good having his voice , bringing up the issues that force the other candidates to respond , they may see it as worth their while to keep him in it until feb 5 it really depends on whether the money is there both iowa and new hampshire are states that can be won the oldfashioned way with doorknocking , handshaking and a grueling pace of public appearances edwards has a disadvantage in large states like california , new york and illinois those states are usually won by gaining attention in the news media , which often focus on which candidate has momentum and has captured the voters interest , and by airing expensive television ads it s clear that the race is coming down to two candidates , and edwards isn t one of them , cain said mr obama carried both the youth vote and the female vote in iowa , but mrs clinton defied expectations and won back women in new hampshire , the new york times reports in analyzing some of the hard data  in contrast to polling results in the iowa caucuses , half the women who voted in the democratic primary gave her their support , the polls showed four in 10 voters said mrs clinton was most qualified to be commanderinchief , while 3 in 10 said the same of mr obama it s assumed that people vote for her because of superficial things , but she has the depth and strength and has been through a lot , said maryjo cassidy , 57 , of manchester , explaining why she cast her vote for mrs clinton at the same time , however , democratic voters viewed mr obama as more likely than mrs clinton to beat the republican nominee in 2008 , a reversal of the previous trends in national polls what was it about last night that made so many new hampshirites apparently change their minds and support mrs clinton or rethink their faith in mr obama \? dan balz of the washington post tries to make sense of it all what arrested obama s surge was not clear some strategists speculated that it was clinton s performance in saturday s debate , in which she declared that words are not actions and sought to refocus voters attention from the soaring rhetoric and energy of obama s candidacy and back to the nutsandbolts question of what it takes to produce real change and who is better equipped to do so others suggested that it was her emotional moment at a new hampshire diner on monday , when her voice cracked as she talked about what kept her going that moment , played and replayed on television over the final hours of the campaign , revealed a side of her rarely seen before , a more vulnerable clinton than the one described by her own campaign as one tough woman michael luo notes in the times that with victories thus far by mr mccain in new hampshire and mike huckabee \( who finished third last night \) in iowa , the republican race is still a tossup as well a wild card is mike huckabee , who has surged to the lead in some national polls he hopes to be competitive in michigan but is looking more toward the jan 19 primary in south carolina , a state with many evangelical christians who are drawn to this former baptist pastor waiting in the wings is a weakened rudolph w giuliani , who is now focused almost exclusively on a victory in florida s primary on jan 29 to slingshot him to the nationwide contests on feb 5 it s a war of attrition , said dan bartlett , a former top adviser to president bush former senator rick santorum said the results were the latest indication that republicans were in for an epic battle among a field of imperfect candidates for the party s conservative base it comes back to , ok , romney can t win , huckabee can t win , mccain can t win , giuliani can t win the dynamic is you have a bunch of candidates who can t win , mr santorum said i don t see how we don t come down to a convention that is going to decide this thing fred thompson , another gop contender , invested little in new hampshire and spent yesterday in south carolina , where he kicked off a 10day bus tour across the state , the greenville news reports to a question about whether his campaign could survive anything less , thompson said , it very well could turn out that my political future depends on south carolina ron paul received less than 10 percent of the republican primary vote in new hampshire , but he said he s got the war chest to continue his campaign anyway , the houston chronicle reports his campaign aides believe the same pitches will bring out new voters when the houstonarea congressman moves on to the next primaries in michigan , south carolina and florida but paul s overriding goal is to make it through super tuesday , when voters in 21 states , including california and new york , hold their elections paul suggested tuesday he has the ability to keep going because his supporters raised nearly 20 million in the last quarter , an amount expected to exceed anything raised by the top gop candidates we are in pretty good shape to go through feb 5 , said paul , who added that he will reevaluate his position after the super tuesday primaries roundup hillary clinton does media interviews in new york john edwards flies to south carolina , where he attends homecoming rallies in clemson and columbia rudy giuliani speaks to voters in melbourne , fla , and meets with supporters in west palm beach mike huckabee heads to south carolina , where he attends a rally in spartanburg and stops by the carolina crisis pregnancy center there , then attends a rally and jam session at furman university in greenville , and travels to myrtle beach in the evening john mccain attends rallies in grand rapids and waterford , mich , before heading to charleston , sc for another campaign event barack obama attends a rally in jersey city , nj , and a fundraiser in new york city mitt romney holds the romney for president national call day 2008 in boston later , he meets with voters in grand rapids , mich , and reporters in east grand rapids

mumbai , in the wake of last week s devastating terrorist attacks here , one thing has become clear india s security forces are so spectacularly unprepared , its intelligence agencies so riven by conflict and miscommunication , that it lacks the ability to respond adequately to such attacks , much less prevent them this nation of 12 billion has only a few hundred counterterrorism officials in its intelligence bureau its tiny , illpaid police force has little training , few weapons and even less ammunition the coast guard has fewer than 100 working boats for a shoreline nearly 5 , 000 miles long in the latest revelation of india s lack of preparedness , on wednesday , a full week after the attacks , sniffer dogs discovered a bag with a 17pound bomb that was left by the terrorists in the city s central train station and that was later deposited in a pile of lost bags , police officials said the police defused the bomb on the spot and never bothered to clear the station , victoria terminus it is also known as and is mumbai s busiest train station long before last week s attacks on mumbai , which stunned the world and left 173 people dead , indian intelligence officials and their western counterparts had passed on various tips about the possibility of such assaults but the indians utterly lacked the ability to assess the significance of those tips or respond to them as a result , a group of just 10 attackers , according to the police , took the city by surprise on nov 26 they easily killed the police officers who opposed them and seized control of some of the city s bestknown landmarks , as all of india watched in horror on television the scale of the task before us is colossal , said ajai sahni , the executive director of the institute for conflict management in delhi we are looking at a system which does not have the capacity to either generate adequate intelligence , or to respond to it although india s prime minister , manmohan singh , has promised farreaching reforms , earlier efforts to improve police training and effectiveness have gone nowhere in any case , such efforts are unlikely to occur quickly in india s vast , corruptionriddled bureaucracy that could leave india , a key american ally and one of the engines of global economic growth in the past decade , dangerously vulnerable to more terrorist strikes the mumbai attacks have pushed tensions between india and pakistan , where the gunmen are said to have been trained , to their highest level in years secretary of state condoleezza rice flew to new delhi on wednesday and to islamabad , pakistan s capital , on thursday in an effort to calm the situation the violence has also fed an unprecedented and broadbased rage at the indian government for not having done more to protect its people on wednesday evening , tens of thousands in mumbai marched near the attacked sites , chanting slogans that made their anger clear similar rallies were held in new delhi and in the southern technology hubs of bangalore and hyderabad many indians were stunned to discover how easily , and thoroughly , the group of militants initially overpowered the police who tried to stop them \( all but one of the militants were eventually shot dead \) the attackers all had ak47 rifles and pistols , and plenty of ammunition far more firepower than any of the officers who confronted them none of the police officers who initially encountered the terrorists had bulletproof vests , allowing the attackers to kill a number of them quickly , despite some heroic efforts at resistance scenes from closedcircuit cameras , played endlessly on tv in the days after the attacks , showed police officers running from the gunmen alongside terrified civilians in all , 20 police officers and commandos were killed after the assault began on the night of nov 26 , it took hours for the indian commando squad to arrive in mumbai because it is based near delhi , hundreds of miles away , and does not have its own aircraft even after the commandos , who are better armed and trained than police officers are , began fighting the terrorists holed up in the taj mahal palace tower hotel , they lacked a floor plan , whereas the militants seemed to know the hotel s layout well in a sense , none of this was a surprise india s national security guards force has only about 7 , 400 commandos , and it has often taken hours to respond to crises in the past , mr sahni said as for the city and state police forces , their equipment and training are far more meager , and they are lightly scattered across a vast population india has 125 police officers for every 100 , 000 residents , one of the world s lowest ratios intelligence failures also played a role in india s inability to deal properly with the mumbai attacks the united states warned indian officials in midoctober of possible terrorist attacks on touristy areas frequented by westerners in mumbai , echoing other general alerts by indian intelligence in the past week , reports of other , far more detailed warnings have been rife in the indian news media , though government officials have disputed them but the debate masks a broader problem , mr sahni said neither the intelligence agencies nor the government has the ability to prioritize or assess those threats , or to act on them the various wings of india s intelligence apparatus , like their american counterparts before the sept 11 attacks , are famous for failing to communicate and share intelligence in the wake of the attacks , some police officials have become remarkably outspoken and even angry about their inability to defend the citizenry or even themselves you see this old musket \? it is useless , said ankush hotkar , a police officer , as he stood wednesday in the cavernous hall of the main train station he was pointing to a battered old hunting rifle in the hands of one of his fellow officers mr hotkar himself , despite his 26 years in the mumbai police force , carried only a lathi , the wooden or lucite pole that most police officers here carry as their only weapon the weapons they give us are no good , so policemen died , he said , his voice thick with anger the mumbai police are given scarcely any training and no opportunities to fire their weapons , mr hotkar said starting salaries are 3 , 050 rupees a month , just over 60 not enough to live on , he added maximum corruption is going on , mr hotkar said wearily mumbai s beat officers are not even issued individual radios to communicate with one another instead , they must find a nearby beat marshal , an officer on motorcycle who is equipped with a radio to report incidents , said police inspector maniksingh p patil , an officer at a station house near the hotels that were attacked the police officers who are assigned to guard political figures are generally much better trained and equipped , a point that has been the focus of outraged commentary in local newspapers here in the past week on wednesday evening , a throng of angry people gathered near the taj mahal hotel , one of the buildings seized by the terrorists as the demonstrators marched through the streets , many held up banners with slogans like no protection , no security and no protection , no vote there were chants of enough is enough ! and promises that they would demand real change but as night fell , the rally dissolved , with many of the marchers straying away one observer , dezadd dotiwalla , 24 , seemed dismayed and said she saw the protest s disintegration as a symbol of the very complacency that the marchers were promising to overcome i sometimes wonder whether we deserve any better , he said
we skated last night and we were talking on the bench about players who make the guys around them better and players who , conversely , play down a level when they are with lesser skaters and that seems to be the story on last night s hockeyville 2008 telecast of the sabrescanadiens game from roberval we recorded it and only watched the first period before sitting down at the keyboard this morning but the nhl network , which produced its own telecast of the game , contained none of the sense of occasion that was required most likely it was contractually impossible , but the cbc show \( which was streamed live on their website but will be shown on tv saturday \) would certainly have been preferable this was a unique game , nhlers \( and guys trying to be nhlers \) skating in a farflung community barn that seats just over 1 , 200 fans the facilities were undoubtedly cramped but we expected the small crowd , small building and smaller number of actual nhlers playing to be met with a big effort and some pageantry instead , we got a small effort and blandness brian duff , who joined the nhl network last year after working on leafs tv , and is a good host behind the desk was terribly unexciting doing play by play his voice contained no drama and his staid delivery sounded as much like it would if he were reading copy during nhl on the fly gary green doing color was , well , what gary always is and has been for decades we noticed last season during the stanley cup playoffs when nhl on the fly added a second analyst at the desk that gary was energized , but paired with duff , he played to duff s level and added little color to what was certainly a colorful event the cameras were close and couldn t follow the play very well , but that s understandable in such a tiny venue but the use of replays was nonexistent at the start of the game and didn t pick up until the end of the first period \( perhaps there were problems in the truck \) the audio signal didn t convey the sound of a full arena but only a few screaming voices the first intermission consisted of green interviewing new hab alex tanguay and it was probably taped and not live yes , this setting had serious limitations , and perhaps the nhl network s budget was limited , too \( there were no commercials in their breaks during play \) , because a third announcer in the stands or outside in the parking lot looking for stories would have been a welcomed addition and provided the telecast some needed juice so much could have been done and so little was instead of a big league production , the game came off like something from the low minor leagues this was a special game and it required a special show we didn t get it new site in sight nhlcom is supposedly debuting a redesign today , according to eric fisher tripp mickle of sports business journal \( via yesterday s sports business daily \) , although we checked this morning and it still had the same old busy design we once compared to juan o gorman s mosaic on the central library of the national autonomous university of mexico  according to sports business daily , both the new nhlcom and the prior iteration of the site will remain accessible for the next week or so , following which the old version will be disbanded but if the new one is up , we can t figure out where it is update here it is , looking very 21st century the redesign employs a predictably heavy use of video content , getty still photos , and usergenerated content , sports biz daily says navigation and search functions were completely rebuilt , and nhl executives are also vowing a more assertive editorial voice other areas greatly expanded in the new site include historical data and statistics , much of which has been tagged with relevant video , and fantasy content in part through a new deal with yahoo sports in yesterday s wall street journal , stephanie kang reported , the league has signed a deal with yahoo inc to launch a new game that allows users to create their own fantasy hockey teams and see video of the players one of the features of the redesign is a new service , called gamecenter and also gamecenter live , which clearly aim to make nhlcom more contemporary and draw it closer to its shadow website , nhl network online gamecenter which will feature a gametracker service , live score updates , video highlights , photos , and radio broadcasts for both home and away teams gamecenter live is where live streaming game video will be found kang in the wall street journal described gamecenter live as a way for the nhl to serve its young , techsavvy fans , many of whom don t live in the hometown of their favorite hockey team , and can t catch its games on television gamecenter live will stream as many as 40 games a week starting in october subscribers can watch as many as four games at once , or watch a single game from several different camera angles the league will offer free preview nights oct 1012 kang reported in the wsj that the nhl will charge online subscribers a relatively steep 169 a season year for the streamingvideo service league executives say they can justify that price because of the large number of outoftown fans who follow its teams and are desperate for the chance to watch their favorites play kang compared the nhl s price to mlb s 120 annual charge for more games , the nba s streaming of games which she said is included in the price of the nba league pass tv package \( their version of center ice \) the nfl is streaming its sunday night football game for free , its first foray into streaming games we tried watching two preseason games monday night from nhl team websites the devilsflyers webcast continually froze the action every five seconds or so , making it impossible to watch the sabresleafs webcase never loaded presumably , gamecenter live won t have those problems this is the second redesign of the league s site in two years is the work of a team headed by andre mika who is nhl vp broadband new media , along with san francisobased interactive marketing firm akqa , which the wall street journal says has worked with nike and espn s website and neulion , which builds and manages internet tv broadcasting networks this is such a big change , a massive change really , said mika the video content we began with in the spring was the start of our actually programming to our fans this is the next huge step where we ve got a full destination hockey fans will feel they re going to get a lot out of it the video content he speaks of is nhl network online , which has nothing to do with the nhl network digital tv channel but is a sort of shadow site to nhlcom which launched in april as what the league s press release called a multimedia destination \( ie it s got lots of its own digital content \) and employs a separate staff from nhlcom it produces and runs a daily program the hockey show during the season as well as featuring podcasts and other audio and video content apart from the obligatory statistical information , nhlcom s editorial content has for years featured excessively long written pieces which read like small to middlemarket newspaper feature stories in desperate need of trimming , verve and even a reason for being written there s been very little use of complimentary video or audio curiously , some stories have not always focused on the nhl , but other hockey leagues in addition , the judgment of what constitutes news seems badly flawed around the anniversary of the wayne gretzky trade , for example , nhlcom was out of sync with the league s pr effort pushing this story more recently , they didn t do much in advance to publicize the traverse city rookie tournament and covered it only via a hidden , disorganized blog and when the preseason schedule began , the first games played were treated like an afterthought and coverage now is largely confined to a statistical link and brief wire service stories right now , with the preseason underway , their home page contains stale content , stories analyzing player transactions that were written as long as three weeks ago they did do a ver ygood job \( well , their one writer did \) covering the 2008 hockeyville events from roberval , quebec kang writes , the web makeover is one way the nhl is trying to rebrand itself after a debilitating lockout that forced it to cancel its 20042005 season the nhl is hoping for an overall increase in digital traffic its web site received a monthly average of 24 million unique visitors for

trophy not after victoria beckham or victoria s secret but after the victoria skating rink in montreal which was considered to be the largest and best skating rink in europe or america and where the first organized hockey game was played on march 3 , 1875 between two nineman teams of mcgill university students in 1889 , victoria rink was where lord frederick arthur stanley of preston and his family saw their first hockey game and he later dreamed up the idea of creating a trophy for the best team in the dominion it was also the site of the first stanley cup game on march 17 , 1894 between the host victoria hockey club and the montreal hockey club , who became the first stanley cup champions five days later when they defeated the ottawa senators ray emery was not in goal for ottawa the rink was located between rue sainte catherine and boulevard dorchester \( now boulevard rene levesque \) west of dominion square and has been for a while , at least the last time we checked , a parking lot we didn t get to the point in the hockeyville telecast where duff and green discussed this new rule \( and we weren t aware of it \) but according to david lee blogging on red and black hockey at kukla s korner , the nhl has decided that tv timeouts will be delayed if the play stops for an icing infraction there have always been tv timeouts at stoppages of play closest to 6 00 , 10 00 and 14 00 of every period this season , they will not allow a tv timeout to occur after a stoppage of play brought about by icing , lee writes this is simple , obvious , and brilliant i love it

bradley harrison was driving a rented dodge durango from vancouver to toronto in the fall of 2004 with 77 pounds of cocaine in the trunk when a police officer pulled him over , found the drugs and arrested him a year and a half later , an ontario trial judge ruled that the officer s conduct was a brazen and flagrant violation of mr harrison s rights the officer s explanation for stopping and searching mr harrison confusion about a license plate was contrived and defied credibility , the judge said , and the search was certainly not reasonable in the united states , that would have been good news for mr harrison under the american legal system s exclusionary rule , the evidence against mr harrison would have been suppressed as the result of an unlawful search but both the canadian trial judge and an appeals court refused to exclude the evidence mr harrison was sentenced to five years in prison without minimizing the seriousness of the police officer s conduct or in any way condoning it , the court of appeal for ontario in mr harrison s case in february , the exclusion of 77 pounds of cocaine , with a street value of several millions of dollars and the potential to cause serious grief and misery to many , would bring the administration of justice into greater disrepute than would its admission the is now before the canadian supreme court the united states is the only country to take the position that some police misconduct must automatically result in the suppression of physical evidence the rule applies whether the misconduct is slight or serious , and without regard to the gravity of the crime or the power of the evidence foreign countries have flatly rejected our approach , said craig m bradley , an expert in comparative criminal law at indiana university in every other country , it s up to the trial judge to decide whether police misconduct has risen to the level of requiring the exclusion of evidence but there are signs that some justices on the united states supreme court may be ready to reconsider the american version of the exclusionary rule writing for the majority two years ago , justice antonin scalia said that at least some unconstitutional conduct ought not require resort to the massive remedy of suppressing evidence of guilt the court will soon have an to clarify matters the justices will hear arguments on oct 7 about whether and a gun belonging to bennie dean herring , of brundidge , ala , should be suppressed because the officers who conducted the search mistakenly believed he was subject to an outstanding arrest warrant as a result of careless recordkeeping by another police department elsewhere in the world , courts have rejected what the ontario appeals court in mr harrison s case called the automatic exclusionary rule familiar to american bill of rights jurisprudence australia also uses a balancing test it considers the seriousness of the police misconduct , whether superiors approved or tolerated it , the gravity of the crime and the power of the evidence any unfairness to the particular accused in most cases , the high court of australia in 1995 , will be of no more than peripheral importance the european court of human rights , a notably liberal institution , refused in 2000 to require the suppression of illegally obtained evidence using such evidence to convict a man charged with importing heroin into england , the court , did not make his trial unfair in the united states , by contrast , evidence against criminal defendants is routinely and automatically suppressed when police misconduct is found in the last week of june , for instance , courts in georgia , ohio , pennsylvania , virginia and washington state suppressed evidence in cases involving drugs , guns , burglary and under the mandatory version of the exclusionary rule some specialists in comparative criminal law say that the decentralized nature of american law enforcement , with thousands of local police departments around the nation , requires a more rigorous and consistent approach to deterring misconduct the law enforcement systems in canada and england , by contrast , are notably less fragmented and may be subject to more stringent professional discipline but not always the officer who pulled over mr harrison s car in ontario thought the car should have had a front license plate , even though the car was from alberta , which does not require one we respect the decision of the courts , said sgt pierre chamberland , a spokesman for the ontario provincial police , but their criticism alone does not by default lead to an internal complaint supporters of the american practice say that only strict application of the exclusionary rule can effectively address violations of the fourth amendment , which bans unreasonable searches and seizures the exclusionary rule deters police misconduct in a straightforward and effective way , said a supporting filed by the national association of criminal defense lawyers in the case the supreme court will hear in october it reduces the value of evidence obtained as a result of fourth amendment violations , and thus eliminates what would otherwise be a powerful incentive for police to engage in such violations several justices have in recent years questioned whether the rule still makes sense in light of what they called the increased professionalism of the police and the availability of alternative and arguably more direct ways to punish misconduct , including internal discipline and civil suits opponents of the rule say it is indirect , incomplete and in a way perverse even if it deters unlawful searches , exclusion of evidence , for instance , offers no remedy to innocent people whose rights were violated by unlawful searches more important , as justice robert h jackson in 1954 , the exclusionary rule deprives society of its remedy against one lawbreaker because he has been pursued by another or , in judge benjamin cardozo s famous mocking formulation in a 1926 decision for new york s highest court rejecting the rule the criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered that reasoning continues to resonate with some experts lots of scholars argue that the mandatory exclusionary rule ought to be reexamined , said david a sklansky , a law professor at the university of california , berkeley those scholars are not all on the right of the political spectrum professor sklansky said he believed that the rule s benefits continued to outweigh its costs most specialists continue to support the rule , said orin s kerr , a law professor at george washington university the us experience is a consequence of history , professor kerr said it s a response to the police not following the law in the absence of this remedy the idea that exclusion is the proper response to police misconduct is of relatively recent vintage supporters of the exclusionary rule cannot point to a single major statement from the founding or even the antebellum or reconstruction eras supporting fourth amendment exclusion of evidence in a criminal trial , akhil reed amar , a law professor at yale , in the harvard law review in 1994 according to professor amar , the framers of the fourth amendment assumed that the right it guaranteed would be enforced through civil lawsuits , not exclusion both before and after the revolution , he wrote , the civil trespass action tried to a jury flourished as the obvious remedy against haughty customs officers , tax collectors , constables , marshals and the like these days , law professors and defense lawyers say , civil suits are less likely to be effective criminals whose rights have been violated are not attractive plaintiffs , and they may not have the resources to litigate , particularly from behind bars civil suits must , moreover , overcome various legal doctrines limiting the liability of police officers and their employers the supreme court started the exclusion of improperly obtained evidence in 1914 but only in federal cases for many decades afterward , the supreme court refused to apply the principle to states , saying they could choose the appropriate remedy for police misconduct including civil suits and criminal prosecutions and were not required to suppress evidence in a 1949 , the court justified that position in part with a rationale now disfavored in some circles a survey of foreign law of 10 jurisdictions within the united kingdom and the british commonwealth of nations , justice felix frankfurter wrote for the majority , none has held evidence obtained by illegal search and seizure inadmissible the right to be free of arbitrary police intrusion is fundamental , justice frankfurter wrote , but the legal remedy for the violation of that right can vary it was not until 1961 that the warren court , in one of its signature decisions , concluded in that only the mandatory suppression of evidence could adequately address wrongdoing by the police in all cases , state and federal seven cleveland police officers had broken into and searched dollree mapp s home without producing a warrant , manhandling her and rummaging through her personal papers though the ohio supreme court concluded that the search had been unlawful , it affirmed ms mapp s conviction on obscenity charges based on materials the police found in her home that was too much for a majority of the supreme court to stomach the state , by admitting evidence unlawfully seized , serves to encourage disobedience to the federal constitution which it is bound to uphold , justice tom c clark wrote for the court only the exclusion of evidence could do the job , he said other remedies had proved worthless and futile the supreme court has in recent years whittled away at the exclusionary rule by limiting its applicability and creating exceptions to it and , neither of whom is enamored with citing foreign law , each noted in recent decisions that the american approach in this area is unique and has been universally rejected elsewhere in a third decision two years ago , , justice scalia seemed to say that the exclusionary rule had outlived its original purpose the case involved a conceded violation of a rule requiring police executing a search warrant to knock and announce themselves much had changed since the exclusionary rule was applied to states in 1961 , justice scalia wrote police departments had become more professional , he said , and various kinds of civil suits against officials and the government had become available as far as we know , justice scalia wrote for the court , civil liability is an effective deterrent justice stephen g breyer , writing for the four dissenters , said that exclusion remains the best and most reliable deterrent he added that the logic of the majority s objections was not limited to knock and announce violations but was an argument against the fourth amendment s exclusionary principle itself
scottsdale , ariz clad in a black leather jacket over a collarless shirt , oozing a relaxed casual chic , the united states ryder cup captain again shook up the status quo for september s ryder cup by sending a clear message to the european team earlier this week expect a different ballgame in seven months at valhalla golf club in louisville , ky azinger , 48 , is driven by a burning desire to reverse the recent downward trend of three straight losses , the last by a record margin , and a 15 record in the past six ryder cups and though the change he announced on wednesday is essentially minor foursomes matches will precede fourballs on each of the first two days for the first time since the united states last won in 1999 his intent is to engineer a major overhaul of american golf fortunes i just want to make a change , azinger said they 've killed us the last two ryder cups playing fourballs before foursomes for whatever reason why not try something different \? the pga of america decided to try something different in november 2007 when it made azinger the 24th united states captain since 1927 he attacked the job the same way he went after pins with a wedge in his heyday , which is to say , aggressively he upended the team selection process before the sun had set on his first official day as captain slashing away like a turnaround specialist at a slumping corporation , azinger took aim directly at the spot where competition was killing his new company he doubled the number of 2008 captain s selections from two to four and streamlined the process by which the remaining eight players would earn their way onto the 12man roster , dumping the old points system in favor of a straight money earnings yardstick i just felt like there s only two things that ever made me nervous or that i ever choked for in my life , and that was cash and prestige , azinger said i felt like i would rather let money be the barometer it s the barometer for everything we do , and the most prestigious events are the ones you 're dealing with the most pressure azinger did not unilaterally make the changes he vetted them with fellow touring pros , the former and current pga of america presidents , members , directors and staff , past captains and even , he said , some friends in the media should all the changes come to little or naught , azinger will be secondguessed just as surely as the throatgripping pressure of the ryder cup will suffocate some victims over three days in september with the avalanche of debate generated by this biennial competition , any fault will be found and endlessly dissected everything will be scrutinized , from the identity of his assistant captains he has chosen the former captains dave stockton and raymond floyd and the active tour player olin browne to his choices for the team uniforms and each day s pairings azinger seems prepared for it all clever , quick with a quip , acerbic at times , he has shown himself to be the verbal sparring equal of nick faldo , his old abc broadcast mate and opposite number as the european ryder cup captain a fierce ryder cup competitor , azinger achieved a 202 record against faldo and a 573 overall record in four cup appearances faldo has a distinct edge in experience , with a 23194 record in 11 ryder cups but azinger will stop at nothing to gain an advantage he has already had discussions with mark wilson , the superintendent at valhalla , about how best to set up the golf course to give the american side every advantage and he will factor in everything from the width of the fairways to speed of the greens when he makes his captain s picks another thing he will not tip his hand early by revealing his captain s picks the day after the pga championship in august , as the american captain traditionally has done i would like to wait , like europe waits , and pick at the same time they do , or even later than they do , said azinger , stonefaced , just as he was when he played in the world series of poker in 2006 just as in the current political arena , change is the operative buzzword in the ryder cup and azinger is not revealing any secrets , because he believes there are none the secret , he said , is you get the hottest players to show up and hope they play great tiger woods struggled and ernie els took advantage , surging into the lead of the dubai desert classic with a sevenunder 65 els has a oneshot lead over henrik stenson with woods three strokes back going into sunday s final round probably need a really low one tomorrow , els said i ca n't see henrik with tiger and the other guys not shooting low , so just got to keep going tomorrow woods , who led after the first two rounds , missed putts , hit wayward drives and yelled at a photographer en route to a 73 he is at sevenunder 209 , tied for fifth with five others i did n't play well today , said woods els had a bogeyfree round , making an eagle on the 10th and adding five birdies to rise from fifth to first at 11under 205 he won the event in 1994 , 2002 and 2005 the defending champion stenson shot a 68 the european tour money leader lee westwood \( 68 \) and graeme mcdowell \( 69 \) are tied at third at 208 j b holmes shot a fiveunder 66 to build a twoshot lead through three rounds of the fbr open in front of a record 170 , 802 fans holmes , who won the fbr as a rookie in 2006 but has not won since , took a 14under 199 total into sunday s final round with just over 1 million at stake for the winner on the desert layout at tpc scottsdale charles warren , who was the coleader after the first round , shot a 67 , bogeying the final hole , to match jonathan byrd at 12 under phil mickelson was in a group of six at 10 under the turnout , which featured gridlock in front of concession stands , broke the singleday record of 168 , 337 set in 2006
updated , 6 18 , 8 am for the first year of this long presidential race , there was little focus on energy , climate and the environment , presumably because polls and focus groups showed scant public concern about these issues the last few weeks , and today in particular , have shown the power of high oil and gasoline prices to get politicians attention senator john mccain , speaking in the heart of oil country \( refining , not drilling , these days \) , gave an update to his may speech on climate and energy , trying to reconcile calls for fewer greenhouse gas emissions and more domestic oil drilling in offshore waters that have been off limits for several decades president bush has echoed the call  mr mccain has been criticized on his drilling proposal by environmental commentators senator barack obama commented on the drilling idea on tuesday , saying much like his gastax gimmick that would leave consumers with pennies in savings , opening our coastlines to offshore drilling would take at least a decade to produce any oil at all , and the effect on gasoline prices would be negligible at best since america only has 3 percent of the world s oil it s another example of shortterm political posturing from washington , not the longterm leadership we need to solve our dependence on oil mr obama has not made climate and energy a fronttier issue for the most part , although his proposals are laid out in detail on his campaign site his stance on climate is similar to mr mccain s , with both seeking legislation involving capandtrading mechanisms to cut greenhouse gas emissions \( with slightly different targets and timing \) \( update the cunctator at hillheatcom admonished me to make clear that mr obama calls for a much broader suite of mandatory steps on efficiency and the like , and i agree that s an important distinction \) but they differ deeply on oil and on nuclear power , with mr obama calling for no expansion until the familiar issues , including waste disposal , are sorted out , while mr mccain would try to accelerate the construction of new plants on offshore drilling , i checked in with peter maass , a contributing writer for the new york times magazine who is working on a book on oil and who wrote a provocative column in 2005 calling for resumption of american coastal drilling but not for the reasons mr mccain is pushing for it mr maass decried the environmental and social messes that have resulted in other parts of the world as oil companies drilled elsewhere from the amazon to africa when the american public turned against drilling here after a spill off the coast of california i asked if he still feels that way here s what he said andy , i still feel the same way , but my rationale for allowing drilling wasn t \( isn t \) the same as mccain and others , who support it to increase oil supplies and reduce our dependence on foreign oil the increments offered by anwr and offshore are useful but aren t going to do much to bring down the price of oil or lessen our dependence on the saudis and russians certainly not now , and probably not much in the future , when those increments come online and do little more , probably , than offset declines in older american fields so let s not fool ourselves into thinking that opening up anwr and the coasts of florida and california would be a big deal in terms of addressing the oilsupply problem we face it s useful , but a very small wedge my main reasoning is that there s no justification , other than selfishness , for tearing up the rest of the world s habitats in our search for oil and gas while preserving our own taking a global view , there s an advantage to drilling in our backyard , if drilling must be done it will be carried out with a level of environmental care that does not exist in africa and many other places where regulatory oversight is not as strict as here \( which is not to say that american regulators are as strict as they can and should be \) and maybe , by being forced to suffer some of the environmental harm and inconvenience of our dependence on oil , we ll have yet another reason to quicken our transition toward conservation and renewable energy is it fair to outsource our environmental problems banishing even debate about drilling here while still drilling elsewhere \( even as we start to find ways to use less oil , and eventually none \) \?

a highranking usa judo official has been accused of drugging and sexually molesting teenage competitors he coached in the late 1970s , accusations that resurfaced last month in internet postings by one of the sport s top athletes on friday , the announced that it had begun a formal inquiry upon learning of the accusations in recent weeks and that it would have an independent counsel investigate the claims these are serious allegations , and they will receive the attention and priority they deserve , said darryl seibel , a spokesman for the usoc one of the sport s national groups , the united states judo association , has suspended the official , fletcher thornton but the sport s most prominent organization , usa judo , which oversees 8 , 000 athletes and the olympic team , has taken no action thornton is on the executive board and his duties have included overseeing the board s standards he is not paid by usa judo thornton , 69 , of middletown , calif , was never charged with a crime and labeled the accusations false the allegations were common knowledge for years in the elite judo community in june , ronda rousey , a 21yearold who is considered the nation s best hope for a judo medal at the beijing olympics , chastised thornton and the sport s leaders on her blog and a judo message board she wrote that usa judo did n't bat an eyelash at the claims the claims were detailed by young athletes in sworn affidavits signed in 1981 , a few years after the incidents were said to have occurred , and again by a new accuser in 2005 in both cases , the affidavits were given to top officials of usa judo , and no action was taken against thornton thornton is in orlando , fla , where he is refereeing matches at this weekend s usa judo national junior olympic championships reached by telephone thursday night and asked about the accusations , he said he had no desire to discuss 30yearold allegations to tell you the truth , i do n't think you want to know the truth , he said i have nothing more to say to you jose h rodriguez , the chief executive of usa judo , said he was standing by thornton , who served as part of the referee commission at the olympic trials in june rodriguez said he found it conspicuous that the affidavits reemerged in election years for usa judo executive board positions he said he welcomed any of the accusers to come forward do n't you find that something is missing here \? he said should someone have written a letter or made a phone call and say , wait a minute , i did n't get a chance to be heard , this is n't fair' one of the accusers who gave an affidavit in 1981 said in a telephone interview this week that she had never spoken with anyone from usa judo and did not know they wanted her to be heard i would have loved to talked to someone , she said i wanted someone to hear me and believe me at least three athletes have given sworn statements , saying they were molested or inappropriately touched by thornton , who was their judo coach and who was more than 20 years older than they were at the time two of the women said thornton had sexual intercourse with them after they smoked marijuana he had provided them another woman said that thornton routinely watched as she took off her clothes for weighins before judo matches and that he groped her in training sessions other athletes gave sworn statements saying that thornton regularly provided them with marijuana and alcohol , mostly on trips for judo the parents of a judo athlete in the spokane , wash , area , where thornton coached at a club , learned about the accusations , hired a lawyer and encouraged the athletes to put together a series of sworn statements in 1981 but their case never got any traction with the authorities the main issue , according to paul burney , who served as a spokesman for that group , was that the spokane police struggled to determine jurisdiction because the suspected incidents were said to have occurred on the road and at tournaments in different cities today s attitude about these things is not the same , burney said in a telephone interview no one wanted it then in a telephone interview this week with the new york times , one of the accusers who gave a sworn statement confirmed what she originally reported for two decades this haunted me , she said i made some bad choices he was the adult in that situation and took complete advantage of me and my family it changed the way i lived my life and looked at people and the way i had relationships with people kris thomfohrde was part of the larger group in the spokane area who gathered the sworn statements she said she was not sexually molested by thornton in her sworn statement and in a telephone interview , however , she said thornton had acted inappropriately around her for years her statement recalled a roaring pot party , and that when she and thornton were doing judo workouts , he would often put his hand through her robe and grab her breast she also said thornton required her to strip in front of him , including taking off her bra , for weighins before many matches the accusations by those two women , and by a handful of other teenagers , were forwarded to usa judo for a hearing in october 1982 in colorado springs but the lack of police action and the fact that none of the accusers were present to testify prompted usa judo officials to dismiss the claims against thornton in january 1982 , thornton was suspended from the community center in spokane where his club practiced the center reinstated him 10 months later , after finding questions of judgment but no criminal wrongdoing a letter provided by don higgins , the west central community center s executive director , attributed the allegations to an apparent political rivalry with another judo club after being reinstated , thornton moved to alaska from spokane , and many of the athletes and their friends assumed he had exited the judo world rousey s mother , the former world champion annmaria de mars , said she could not believe it when she spotted thornton at a tournament a few years ago in a sworn statement in 2005 that she provided to usa judo , de mars said she recalled beating a member of thornton s judo club to win a tournament , and how he had put his arms on her bare shoulders and said , she s still prettier than you as her daughter , rousey , emerged as one of the country s top judo athletes , de mars would not let her go on a foreign trip in 2002 , at age 15 , because she did not know who would be supervising it thornton ended up overseeing the group in 2004 , de mars said she received an email message from a young woman at her former judo club , saying she had been molested by the coach as a young girl , contacted usa judo and they discouraged her from pursuing the case that response from usa judo pushed de mars to encourage a friend who had raised similar claims to give usa judo a statement that woman did so in 2005 and confirmed the contents of her statement in a telephone interview this week the statement said that thornton had intercourse with me several times and that she personally witnessed him have oral sex with another girl who was younger than she was the woman said she went to the olympic trials in las vegas in june , hoping to hear of progress made on her complaint instead , she saw thornton helping run the event as part of the referee commission despite the formal complaints , it was rousey s recent blog and message board post that prompted the latest attention she said she raised the issue because thornton had written a letter to a friend of hers , demanding an apology for his behavior after a match she said she found it hypocritical , so she posted the blog on on june 20 and pasted a copy on her blog other bloggers picked up the post , although rousey removed it from her own blog because she said her coaches did not want it to distract from her training

badui , china china s biggest health disaster is n't the terrible sichuan earthquake this month it s the air the quake killed at least 60 , 000 people , generating a response that has been heartwarming and inspiring , with even schoolchildren in china donating to the victims yet with little notice , somewhere from the effects of outdoor air pollution , according to studies by chinese and international agencies alike in short , roughly as many chinese die every two months from the air as were killed in the earthquake and the problem is becoming international just as californians can find chinesemade shoes in their stores , they can now find chinesemade haze in their skies this summer s beijing olympics will showcase the most remarkable economic explosion in history , and also some of the world s thickest pollution in both air and water so i 've returned to the yellow river in western china s gansu province to an isolated village that has haunted me since i saw it a decade ago badui is known locally as the village of dunces that s because of the large number of mentally retarded people here as well as the profusion of birth defects , skin rashes and physical deformities residents are sure that the problems result from a nearby fertilizer factory dumping effluent that taints their drinking water even if you 're afraid , you have to drink , said zhou genger , the mother of a 15yearold girl who is mentally retarded and has a hunchback the girl , kong dongmei , mumbled unintelligibly , and ms zhou said she had never been able to speak clearly ms zhou pulled up the back of her daughter s shirt , revealing a twisted , disfiguring mass of bones a 10yearold neighbor girl named hong xia watched , her eyes filled with wonder at my camera the neighbors say she , too , is retarded none of this is surprising rural china is full of cancer villages caused by pollution from factories beijing s air sometimes has a particulate concentration that is four times the level considered safe by the world health organization scientists have tracked clouds of chinese pollution as they drift over the pacific and descend on america s west coast the impact on american health is uncertain in fairness , china has been better than most other countries in curbing pollution , paying attention to the environment at a much earlier stage of development than the united states , europe or japan most impressive , in 2004 , china embraced tighter fuel economy standards than the bush administration was willing to accept at the time the city of shanghai charges up to 7 , 000 for a license plate , thus reducing the number of new vehicles , and china has planted millions of trees and hugely expanded the use of natural gas to reduce emissions if you look at what china s leaders are doing , you wish that president bush were half as green but then you peer into the chinese haze and despair the economic boom is raising living standards hugely in many ways , but the toll of the resulting pollution can be brutal the filth is prompting public protests , but the government has tightly curbed the civil society organizations that could help monitor pollution and keep it in check an environmental activist named wu lihong warned for years that lake tai , china s thirdlargest freshwater lake , was endangered by chemical factories along its banks mr wu was proved right when last summer shortly after the authorities had sentenced him to three years in prison here in badui , the picture is as complex as china s development itself the government has taken action since my previous visit the factory supposedly is no longer dumping pollutants , and the villages have been supplied with water that , in theory , is pure the villagers do n't entirely believe this , but they acknowledge that their health problems have diminished moreover , economic development has reached badui it is still poor , with a percapita income of 100 a year , but there is now a rough dirt road to the village on my last visit , there was only a footpath the road has increased economic opportunities farmers have dug ponds to raise fish that are trucked to the markets , but the fish are raised in water taken from the yellow river just below the fertilizer factory when i looked in one pond , the first thing i saw was a dead fish we eat the fish ourselves , said the village leader , li yuntang we worry about the chemicals , but we have to eat he said that as far as he knew , the fish had never been inspected for safety now those fish from this dubious water are sold to unsuspecting residents in the city of lanzhou and the complexities and ambiguities about that progress offer a window into the shadings of china s economic boom

if ever worried that her roles in juno and smart people would too securely set her image as a feisty knowitall , she chose well to appear in an american crime , a film that manages to wrench all the placid innocence from her bones the movie , which appeared at the last year and which makes its debut on showtime on saturday , calls for none of her verbal wood chopping indeed , it demands a listless opposite , turning ms page s body into a cadaver long before her character becomes one , speaking to us softly , phlegmatically and from the grave ms page is all dreamy , spectral passivity she mesmerizes but so much is done to her that it is hard to know what she is actually doing children are victimized so frequently on television these days the babies left in dumpsters on law order svu , the boys or girls raped or chained up on medium that we may think we 've become inured to depictions of such abuse but an american crime is such a shocking study of the will to defile , so forensic in its details , that it arrives as an act of vengeance against our habituation based on the true story of sylvia likens , a teenage girl in indianapolis in 1965 who found herself subjected to cruelties any adjectives applied here would only cheapen , the film almost begs us to look anywhere else her parents , carnival workers , leave her and her younger sister in the temporary care of a local laundress named gertrude baniszewski sylvia is burned , bruised , beaten and sodomized , the horrors magnified by the viral quality of her steward s sadism before long , it is n't merely baniszewski drawing the blood , but her lot of vacantlooking children and a whole neighborhood of young novices bored into violence tommy o'haver , the film s director and cowriter , tips us to its agenda in the economy of his title sylvia had the misfortune to be born to parents who were comfortable leaving her with a stranger , but she also had the bad luck to grow up in a time and a place where ignorance was understood as its own brand of wisdom the 1960s have n't yet sounded the nation s social alarm clock images of vietnam flicker on television sets \( mr o'haver gives us president johnson making a speech about general westmoreland \) but no one in an indianapolis of church picnics and girlgroup pop is paying heed sylvia s community , we learn , did nothing to save her an older neighbor of baniszewski s , in cheap makeup that she seems to think will dignify her , had a faint hint of what was going on , but testifies at baniszewski s murder trial that she simply could n't judge a hardworking woman who seemed to be struggling despite all the visual terror in an american crime , the single most disturbing moment is aural sylvia explaining in postmortem voiceover , quite matteroffactly , that her parents kept working , leaving her younger sister behind again , after the trial , this time with a local district attorney mr o'haver understands the inexplicable nature of horrors like this one and he never panders to our reductive wish for clear answers gertrude baniszewski , portrayed brilliantly by , was clearly a woman who struggled she had respiratory problems , multiple children with different men and virtually no money but mr o'haver does n't redeem her with a more extensive biography , a litany of whatever deeper mistreatments she surely endured ms keener takes on the role as if she were built on a skeleton of rusty needles looking at her , we know plenty baniszewski hates the purity of sylvia , a quality she can neither reclaim for herself nor bequeath to her daughters , whose young lives already seem destined for similar miseries an american crime is the most brutal evocation of wrongdoing to appear in quite a while it is hardly a pleasure to watch but it is also one of the best television movies to appear in years
jerusalem , s defense minister and the leader of the labor party , announced sunday that he would remain in the government , stabilizing prime minister s coalition despite last week s harsh report on the political and military leaders' handling of the lebanon war in 2006 also sunday , egyptian troops closed the border with the gaza strip , ending 11 days of free movement and frenzied buying by residents of the blockaded territory at least for the time being egyptian forces were allowing gazans and egyptians to cross the border to return home , but prevented any new crossborder movement egypt had made earlier unsuccessful attempts to close the border , but was thwarted by gunmen affiliated with hamas , the militant islamic group that took control of gaza last summer but after a visit to cairo by senior hamas officials , the hamas gunmen apparently were cooperating with the egyptians on sunday with regard to mr olmert , mr barak said during party primaries last may that he would seek to form a new government or to set a date for early elections if the prime minister did not resign by the time the governmentappointed commission , looking into the conduct of the war against the lebanese hezbollah militia , issued its final report a scathing preliminary report on april 30 assigned personal responsibility to the prime minister , the former defense minister and the former army chief of staff for flawed conduct during the war of the three , only mr olmert did not resign mr barak replaced the wartime defense minister , amir peretz , in june explaining his decision to stay on , mr barak cited the challenges facing israel , among them the continued threat from hezbollah , which , israeli officials contend , has fully rearmed since the war mr barak also mentioned threats from the gaza strip , syria and iran , as well as the need to improve operations of the army and the negotiations , which the centerleft labor party supports , with the west bankbased palestinian authority led by president mahmoud abbas i promised i would do what i think is good and right for the country , mr barak told reporters before the weekly cabinet meeting , and i think at this moment this it what is good for the country analysts here had assumed that mr barak , a former prime minister who is likely to run for the post again , would not want to leave government for the political wilderness right now polls over the weekend also suggested that a majority of labor supporters did not want mr barak to quit mr olmert s term is supposed to end in november 2010 , though few expect it to last that long there are differences within the government over the peace talks with the palestinians , and the prime minister under criminal investigation for various possible violations is generally unpopular mr barak said sunday that he would deal with the harsh conclusions of the war report , named for the retired judge eliyahu winograd , who headed the commission , at the proper time and set a time for elections but he did not suggest a date members of the opposition excoriated mr barak for propping up mr olmert , who leads the centrist kadima party there were some critics in labor , too this was an opportunity for the labor party and its leader to rectify the situation in the eyes of the public , which expects leadership , morality and ethics , eitan cabel , a member of parliament and the party secretary , told army radio still , as a former army chief of staff and israel s most decorated soldier , mr barak is considered by many here to be well equipped to fix problems in the country s military though famed for past victories , the army was castigated by the winograd commission for its poor performance in the 2006 conflict yet mr peretz , the former defense minister and trade union leader , said thursday that figures who had served in major posts in the past , like mr barak , were largely to blame for policies and failures that had built up over years the political echelon also came in for criticism in the final winograd report , though the most hotly debated wartime decision , regarding the start of a ground campaign in the last days of the war , was deemed reasonable by the commission , taking some of the heat off mr olmert mr olmert said sunday that the report was not a source of joy there was none anywhere , certainly not with me but there were achievements alongside the failures , he said , adding we must neither exaggerate the achievements nor understate the failures rather , we must treat them with all due seriousness and gravity israel s border with lebanon has been mostly quiet since the monthlong war , but on sunday evening israeli soldiers exchanged fire with a number of people near the border who turned out to be lebanese drug smugglers , an army spokesman said reports from beirut said that one lebanese man had been killed and another seriously wounded in gaza , ahmed youssef , an adviser to the hamas administration , said that the breach of the border with egypt on jan 23 was a wakeup call to those avoiding listening to the people s cry hamas militants blew up sections of a wall along the egyptian border days after israel sealed its own border crossings with gaza in response to intensified rocket fire from the strip hundreds of thousands of palestinians are thought to have crossed into egypt to stock up on supplies in a veiled threat directed at israel , mr youssef said this time we moved toward egypt next time we do n't know where to maybe erez , maybe karni , naming two of the closed crossings between gaza and israel
hillary clinton s presidential campaign intends to go after delegates whom barack obama has already won in the caucuses and primaries if she needs them to win the nomination , reports roger simon at the politico this strategy was confirmed to me by a highranking clinton official on monday what \? isn t that impossible \? a pledged delegate is pledged to a particular candidate and cannot switch , right \? wrong pledged delegates are not really pledged at all , not even on the first ballot this has been an open secret in the party for years , but it has never really mattered because there has almost always been a clear victor by the time the convention convened cue the outrage  if the clinton campaign seriously goes after pledged delegates , delegates explicitly chosen by voters to support another candidate , the uproar would \( rightly \) make the old targetthesuperdelegates strategy look like a minor faux pas among friends , writes christopher orr at the plank the reason all the democrats quoted in simon s article are focusing on how bad the superdelegate strategy would be for the party isn t because they think it would be better if one of the candidates instead tried to pry away the other s pledged delegates it s because none of them imagined a campaign would be brazen enough to publicly announce that this was its plan i mean , honestly , is there any more explicit way of overruling the voters than pressuring the delegates they elected to switch sides and violate their written \( though evidently nonbinding \) pledge \? mark kleiman at the reality based community finds the idea , well , positively republican planning to win the nomination by inducing pledged delegates to break their word isn t at the same level of gravity as denying that congress has the power of the purse , but it s based on the same winningiseverything principle i m willing to believe that hrc herself is a decent person but she has surrounded herself with people who cannot be trusted with power ana marie cox at swampland , uncharacteristically , calls for calm though this ploy seems perfectly in keeping with every thing else we ve heard from the clinton camp , it s worth noting that simon s scoop is not exactly the declaration of war it seems to be on first read a highranking clinton official said that clinton would target pledged delegates if she needs them unpacked , i think the news here isn t that clinton will go after pledged delegates , it s that one or two people on the clinton campaign assume that there will be a nasty , delegatebydelegate fight if she fails to gain the nomination via primary contests

those political aficionados wondering whether senator barack obama looks better from the right or left , take note in august visitors to the official web site of the democratic national convention will be able to choose from a menu of camera angles as they tune in live , highdefinition video streamed from the party gathering in denver other viewers who prefer to leave the direction and analysis of their convention coverage to the broadcast and cable networks will have plenty of options too in the days since mr obama solidified his standing as the presumptive democratic nominee , television news executives have begun to set their plans for covering the fourday democratic convention , which begins on aug 25 , and its republican counterpart , which opens in st paul on sept 1 , labor day abc , cbs and nbc all intend to show at least three hours of live , primetime coverage of both conventions , which is about what the networks did four years ago , though this year they are expected to broadcast in highdefinition the cable news channels expect to offer many more hours than that , perhaps none more so than msnbc , which is seeking to swamp the efforts of its principal competitors , cnn and fox news , by showing 20 hours of live convention programming each of the four days that the conventions are in session to put that figure in perspective , consider that much of the official party business is conducted over the course of about four hours a night for msnbc , which has scheduled its marathon coverage from 6 am to 2 am eastern time , the challenge of having enough for keith olbermann , chris matthews and joe scarborough , among others , to discuss during all those hours would seem to be especially formidable as television programs , conventions long ago made the transition from smokefilled gatherings with more suspense than a csi episode to gleaming , readymade infomercials where the audience knows the ending from the beginning \( among those to be featured on msnbc is john harwood , a cnbc correspondent who also reports for the new york times , which pools some political newsgathering efforts with nbc \) but in interviews this week broadcast and cable executives said that there were many reasons to believe that this year s gatherings would be the most compelling in decades they cited the unexpectedly protracted nature of the democratic and republican primary seasons this year , as well as back stories like mr obama s standing as the first black presidential nominee of a major american political party the age of the presumed republican nominee , senator john mccain , 72 the looming specter of the iraq war and the sputtering economy and the lingering question of how bill and hillary rodham clinton will carry themselves this is great stuff , said phil alongi , executive producer of political and other special programming for nbc news on the democratic side , i'm dying to see how they handle the party unity i'm dying to see how they handle the clintons on the republican side , how are they going to handle bush and cheney there s a lot there mr alongi will oversee convention coverage on both nbc and msnbc , though each will have a different mission on nbc mr alongi expects to devote an hour each on the evenings of wednesday , aug 27 , and thursday , aug 28 , for the democratic convention , as well as on the following wednesday and thursday for the republicans , to live coverage and analysis of the acceptance speeches of the vice presidential and presidential nominees leading that coverage will be brian williams , the anchor of nbc nightly news , with analysis from tim russert , the host of meet the press , among others on monday or tuesday of each week nbc also expects to put on at least one more hour of live programming , to be determined as the convention schedule becomes more clear mr alongi said he had also been assured by his bosses , including jeff zucker , the chief executive of nbc universal , that the network will consider breaking into its regular programming for more live coverage if events warrant it during each of those two weeks , the nightly news and the today show will originate in the convention cities no mean trick , since both programs will have broadcast at least partly during the previous two weeks from beijing , where nbc will be covering the summer olympics abc has committed to at least four hours of primetime coverage of each convention , to be led by charles gibson , anchor of world news he will be joined by george stephanopoulos , the host of this week , as well as a team of political reporters , said marc burstein , executive producer of special events for abc news while good morning america will also originate from each host city , mr burstein said he did not yet know which of the show s hosts would be dispatched where \( diane sawyer , coanchor of good morning america , shared top billing with mr gibson for the network s primetime coverage of the primary season s super tuesday on feb 5 \) abc does not have a basic cable channel , but it does have abc news now , a digital cable channel started at the urging of peter jennings during the last conventions it intends to provide gavel to gavel coverage of the convention sessions , with some network correspondents doing double duty at least partly as a way to save money in an economically challenging year for all the news divisions a cbs spokeswoman said the network planned to broadcast about three hours of live , primetime coverage from each convention , with katie couric leading a crew that would include jeff greenfield and bob schieffer ms couric s cbs evening news , along with the early show and face the nation will also have a base in the convention cities a fox news spokeswoman , dana klinghoffer , refused to discuss the channel s plans cnn , which saw its ratings surge on nights like super tuesday , has yet to resolve how much of the conventions it will present , said david bohrman , who directs the coverage in his capacity as washington bureau chief it has also not decided which of its highprofile hosts including larry king , anderson cooper , wolf blitzer and campbell brown will travel to the convention cities to anchor the channel s coverage from a desk on the convention floor , mr borhman said while he said he wanted to see a more detailed convention schedule before committing resources , he appeared confident cnn would not devote as many hours to the task as msnbc we 'll find a nice mix in our regular daytime programming , get a sense of what else is happening in the world , and be in the conventions when they 're really in session , he said the conventions will clearly be the centerpiece of the week but the rest of the world continues
the hockey hall of fame induction ceremonies are tonight \( nhln 7 30 pm eastern time \) , and while some might say this group lacks the star power of some previous years or next year when those eligible include steve yzerman , brett hull , luc robitaille and brian leetch the four men to be inducted as honored members and the two going into the media wing all richly deserve their place in the hall if you watched nhl hockey , especially playoff games , almost anytime from the mid 70s until 2004 , you likely saw ray scapinello working as a linesman you couldn t miss him , the little bald guy who rushed around the ice , puck in hand on an icing , or diving in to break up fighters who seemed twice his size and he did it without ever missing an assignment , working 2 , 508 consecutive games , 426 playoff games and 20 stanley cup finals in 33 years scampi worked the playoffs and the stanley cup final every year because the best officials work the biggest games he did it with a big smile and a bigger heart no one on the officiating staff was more respected by the coaches and players we don t tend to think of the referees and linesmen as exceptional athletes , but ray was still at the top of his profession , speeding around the ice and separating even bigger heavyweights into his 50s as anyone around the game will tell you , he was always a friendly face down in the officials dressing room before and after games and he may have been the bestdressed guy on the staff here are some good articles on him from jim matheson of the edmonton journal , eric duhatschek of the globe and mail , a great qa by john f molinaro of cbc sports and a lengthy piece by john mcgourty at nhlcom  scotty bowman called igor larionov the smartest player he ever coached that should be good enough credentials right there , but the professor , as he was called by teammates , was a truly historic figure he centered the famed green unit of cska and the soviet national team \( along with wingers sergei makarov and vladimir krutov and defensemen slava fetisov and alexei kasatonov \) , for whom he played a major role in numerous championships \( eight domestic , two olympic , four world and one canada cup \) , and was a leader in the push for soviet players rights , part of the first wave of soviet players to join the nhl and a threetime stanley cup champion with the red wings here s a good long mlive snapshot blog post by george james malik on igor , plus a hnic radio interview and tribute , an excellent piece by pierre lebrun of espncom , another good piece by wes goldstein of cbs sportscom , one by al strachan on foxsportscom and igor s views on the current khlnhl tensions from by joe o connor of the national post  we always liked glenn anderson as a player he was an exceptional skater on hockey s best skating team , the mid 80s oilers he had a terrific scoring touch and he was tough out there , willing to do anything to win andy was a fivetime cup champ , four with the oilers and in 94 with the rangers he finished his nhl career two goals shy of 500 , was dynamite in the playoffs with 93 goals \( fifth on the alltime list \) and 214 playoff points \( fourth alltime \) anderson should have been in long ago , which kevin lowe said in today s edmonton sun to robert tychkowski  this was really important for all the \( other oilers \) who are in , lowe said we all felt like he was in the same category they were in , but for some reason he was being snubbed it was getting to the point that it was pretty embarrassing for everybody that knew him in the nhl the injustice to anderson is also the thrust of red fisher s story in the montreal gazette and a similar story from eric duhatschek in the globe and mail , a scott burnside piece on espncom and a hnic radio interview with anderson as well ed chynoweth was one of canadian junior hockey s most influential figures as longtime president of the western hockey league and was founder of the umbrella organization the canadian hockey league , which unites the three major junior circuits he died last april \( he ll be represented tonight by his son , former islanders defenseman dean chynoweth , who remembers his father for nhlcom \) and when he did , tributes to this largerthanlife figure filled the canadian press like this one by rob vanstone of the saskatoon leaderpost , this one by john down in the calgary herald and this one by ben kuzma of the vancouver province  bob mckenzie of tsn had a remembrance , too you know mike emrick , who will receive the foster hewitt award , as the voice of the devils and the lead playbyplay man for most national network hockey telecasts we also know him as a longtime coworker doc is a hockey lifer who rode the buses and breathed diesel fumes in the minors , who worked terrifically hard to become an nhl broadcaster and continued to work hard once he made it he s every bit erudite and innovative as he is dedicated and in a profession marked by great insecurity that often breeds outsized egos without the talent to match , he has the talent and none of the ego what he loves most after his family is the game it s not an accident that mike is regularly the guy called to host league events john mcgourty of nhlcom has this story on doc rich chere of the starledger has a long one too , filled with deserving tributes steve lepore on the blog puck the media has an excellent personallytinged post on doc neil stevens , the former canadian press correspondent whose byline was rarely seen on the wire service copy he wrote but whose precise reporting on the game both on and off the ice informed millions daily , will receive the elmer ferguson award for contributions to print journalism mark spector , the lead columnist for sportsnetca has this tribute for stevens today neil stevens of the canadian press will be officially inducted into the hockey hall of fame tonight , presented with the elmer ferguson award for decades of fine copy generated for the outfit he always refered to as the people s wire service while most folks this craft strived to make a name for themselves in local markets , neil was that guy whose copy ran below the columnists and inside in sports sections from coast to coast he covered the maple leafs , the rest of the nhl , his beloved lacrosse , figure skating and countless other topics with an eye for an angle that few of the rest of ever spotted you have read him for decades , even if the name only rings a distant bell in the back of your memory but that s ok with neil , who always reminded us that he was only a humble wire servant humble , certainly servant , indeed but there are writers across canada who have far more ego than stevens , far less talent , and will only find their way into the hockey hall of fame the traditional way by purchasing a ticket

pittsburgh on sundays , willie parker sat in front of the television with his father , their home in tiny clinton , nc , turned over to a love of the dallas cowboys one day , when the boy was about 5 , he turned to his dad , willie sr , and said , me going to play that one day this was before little willie parker became fast willie , so his father told him to sit down but just a few years later , willie sr did not even recognize the blur on the field during a recreation league game because his son was running so fast a few years after that , willie sr watched in front of his house on royal lane and saw willie , by then in high school , lining up against tyson , a pit bull that belonged to a family member at the sound of a whistle , the dog took off at full gallop so did willie , in his latest scheme to hone his speed willie did not beat the dog , perhaps the last race he lost i knew there was something special since he was 5 years old it always lingered in my mind , willie sr said he prophesized it from the time he was 5 it s amazing as long as i live , i 'll never forget it willie sr spends sundays at heinz field now , where fast willie parker is reshaping the image of the ' running game franco harris and were perfect , hulking stars for pittsburgh , a city built on a muscular , industrial image but they have been replaced by parker , a compact symbol for a highspeed age since 2006 , parker is second in the nfl with 3 , 053 rushing yards , behind only san diego s ladainian tomlinson \( 3 , 412 \) and parker led the league in rushing through 15 games last season , until he broke his leg in the regularseason finale he opened this season with two consecutive 100yard games still , he is not among the nfl s most heralded runners even his comingout moment an electrifying 75yard touchdown sprint in xl was overwhelmed by the prospect of bettis s winning the championship in his hometown of detroit in his final game he s made a name for himself , receiver hines ward said if people are not taking notice of that , i do n't know what film they are watching perhaps they are stuck in the endless loop of parker s screechtoahalt college career parker led clinton high to the state championship in his junior year he gave his father the ring by then , his 118 yards a carry and 20 touchdowns had drawn the attention of a regional scout named dan rooney and of the university of north carolina , which gave him a scholarship in his freshman year , he had 84 carries for 355 yards then the coaching staff changed , and so did parker s fortunes john bunting , a former linebacker for the philadelphia eagles the steelers' opponent on sunday preferred a power running game for his tar heels so his staff asked parker , who has long carried 209 pounds on his 5foot10 frame , to bulk up parker , already burdened by the killing of his best friend back home during his sophomore year , balked and spent the bulk of the remaining three years on the bench i take the blame 5050 for letting it go the way it went , parker said i should have showed how i love the game but when they made me mad , i was like , whatever , i know i'm the best you 've got anyway to be honest , i just could n't stand those coaches parker was right about one thing he was the best they had that is what his father , struggling to keep willie from quitting , kept reminding him parker would tell his parents they did not have to attend the games , because he was not going to play when i wanted to go in there and blow up the building , i would breathe really deep and said a little prayer and held back , parker said my dad was always thinking positive he 'd say you 're going to play this game i feel it' he had me thinking , i probably will play he 'd play mind games with me the whole season parker has not spoken to the coaches since bunting was fired from north carolina in 2006 at the tar heels' pro day , parker ran the 40 in a mediocre 451 seconds , according to gil brandt , the former cowboys personnel chief he has since run it in 428 but rooney , the son of the chairman of the steelers , had kept tabs on parker all those years and after parker was not one of the 16 running backs drafted in 2004 , the steelers signed him as an undrafted free agent as a lowrung rookie , he was practice fodder for the starting defense , whose players started complaining about how tiring it was to chase him around when the steelers' former coach bill cowher first saw parker in camp , he wondered aloud why he had not played in college the more we saw his ability to get to the corner , you were waiting to see what the kid s weakness was , said cowher , who told parker that all those hits he had saved in college were a blessing in disguise from that time on , i did n't look at the north carolina stars i looked at the backups parker , 27 , has lost none of the ebullience of an undrafted player who suddenly finds himself at the center of one of the nfl s most successful teams like the 5yearold , he still makes bold proclamations , looking at himself in the mirror on game day to announce what he wants to accomplish run hard , score a touchdown he thrives on people doubting if he can run between the tackles the way bettis did he can , cowher said , after learning to be patient by watching bettis play and he keeps all the slights in a mental bag that he delves into when he needs to get mad and motivated this offseason , people wondered if he would lose speed after his first major injury if you gameplan the pittsburgh steelers , it would be smart to seal off the edges , parker said at the same time , you have to seal off some gaps , too i love being fast willie i'm not fat like jerome was i'm not a 240pound running back parker laughs when he needles bettis , but as he walks the hallways of the steelers' offices , replete with oversized photographs of the team s great players , parker jokingly wonders where the pictures of him are in at least one way , parker is very much like them harris , a hall of fame runner , was prized more for his blocking at penn state i never would have painted this picture , parker said when i won that super bowl , i still did n't believe it was true and real until a month later a few months after that , parker went home to clinton to give his father a cadillac he told him to look in the trunk there was his super bowl ring , glittering in the hot sun wow i never suspected he would really give it to me , willie sr said i could n't take what was happening , it was too much me and my friend , i said , let s take a ride' i always say we rode off into the sunset
slope of grain is a common term among wood experts it is unknown among most baseball fans but the wood terminology intersected with the baseball world on tuesday when major league baseball explained why it believed so many bats broke last season and how it will try to address the problem after collecting and analyzing 2 , 232 broken bats from two months of games , mlb and the players' union have adopted nine recommendations from baseball s safety and health advisory committee the recommendations require manufacturers to produce better , safer bats and will be implemented for the 2009 season the committee s fourmonth study found that 756 of the 2 , 232 bats broke into multiple pieces , most frequently because of poor quality slope of grain and ruptures created by too much bending slope of grain refers to how straight the grain is along a bat when the straightness decreases , so does the durability of the bat basically , some manufacturers were using inferior wood among the multiple breakages , the study found that maple bats were three times more likely than ash bats to shatter the broken bats showed that maple bats were four times more likely to have splintered from slopeofgrain issues than the ash bats that broke similarly i think we expect that there will be a significant reduction in broken bats , said sandy alderson , the chief executive of the san diego padres and the spokesman for the committee but regardless of the reduction , whether it s 50 percent , 75 percent or 90 percent , the charge of the committee is to continue to do our research to improve that number the committee recommended that all bats , not only maple ones , conform to stricter slopeofgrain wood requirements manufacturers will be required to place an ink mark on the bats , which will enable the grain to be detected more easily , and the bats' handles must be left clear to see the grain the hitting surface will be rotated , away from the weakest part of the bat , by rotating the location of makers' logos 90 degrees in addition , manufacturers must track each bat they supply to players representatives from manufacturers must participate in an mlbsponsored workshop about wood baseball officials will visit manufacturers regularly to audit each company s manufacturing processes there will also be random audits of player s bats at ballparks , and a thirdparty bat certification and quality control program will be established there were 32 approved batmakers last year , none of whom were barred from continuing to supply bats but the suppliers will have to pay a 10 , 000 administration fee , doubling what they paid last year in addition , the minimum umbrella insurance for suppliers rose to 10 million from 5 million the safety committee will continue to study other possible reasons for broken bats , including the drying methods of maple and the bats' geometry that refers to how the barrel tapers to the handle players prefer having more weight in the barrel of their bats , but that requires batmakers to produce them with narrower handles that break more easily since the regulations will take effect on opening day , any leftover bats must be cleared for use i am hopeful that the implementation of these recommendations will do much to resolve the issues posed by the brokenbat episodes we saw last season , most importantly to assure the safety of our onfield personnel and fields , commissioner bud selig said in a statement photo manufacturers will be required to produce safer bats , beginning next season baseball analyzed 2 , 232 bats broken last season \( photograph by isaac brekken for the new york times \)
ra ra riot the rhumb line \( barsuk \) the sweet , sad quality in the music of the syracuse band ra ra riot can be attributed to various factors the earnest ache of the vocal melodies , perhaps , or the presence of cello and violin like more than a few other bands to emerge in recent years , this one takes generous cues from the most melodic precincts of indie rock , where melancholy reigns but there s one specific cause for the elegiac tone on the rhumb line , ra ra riot s selfassured debut in june 2007 the band lost its original drummer , john pike , whose body was found in a massachusetts bay one day after he went missing it s striking , then , that the rhumb line adopts a nautical theme and that it features a handful of faintly mordant songs , including some with lyrics by mr pike this might all feel gothic or claustrophobic if not for the lightness of touch exercised by the band wesley miles , its frontman , sings in a thin but appealing tenor not unlike james mercer of the shins or ezra koenig of vampire weekend and he brings airy clarity to a succession of catchy choruses it all falls apart , he sings in st peter s day festival , sounding none too bothered as his voice trails down the scale in a major key buoyancy equally suits the rest of the band the guitarist milo bonacci and the bassist mathieu santos favor a cleanness of tone and line , while the string players , rebecca zeller on violin and alexandra lawn on cello , add texture without thickness a guest drummer manages a bright sense of propulsion \( a different guest drummer will join the band on tour , and at the union square virgin megastore on tuesday \) there are moments on the rhumb line that feel precious or derivative winter '05 could do without the sleigh bells , and each year suggests a smiths lp played at 45 rpm but the album holds together , not only as a memorial to past tragedy but also as a testament to whatever emotional terrain lies ahead nate chinen photo

to the casual western eye african art equals african sculpture masks , headdresses and ritual figures as two new exhibitions make clear , this picture is laughably outdated many contemporary african artists would point to textile , rather than sculpture , as the tradition with the strongest impact on their work the nigerianborn , londonbased artist yinka shonibare , for one , has extrapolated an entire career from the fascinating colonial history of the fabrics known as dutch wax prints the essential art of african textiles design without end , at the , presents 19thcentury fabrics alongside a few relevant contemporary artworks flipping the scales , the poetics of cloth african textiles recent art , at new york university s grey art gallery , emphasizes the place of traditional textiles in works by contemporary african artists the exhibitions were conceived and organized independently , and there is considerable overlap on the contemporary end both , however , are worth a visit the older textiles at the met are rare , exceptional pieces , many on loan from the british museum they contain the dna , in the curator alisa lagamma s words , of contemporary works by el anatsui and others but the 20thcentury textiles and contemporary artworks at the grey , organized by the gallery s director , lynn gumpert , offer a more generous swath \( so to speak \) of africa s current visual culture the met s 2005 exhibition matisse the fabric of dreams hinted that textiles had been undervalued in the western canon , offering ample proof that north african cloths were as important to matisse as gabon figures and grebo masks were to picasso the museum s current show may not have the same blockbuster appeal , but it goes deeper into the techniques and traditions that make the fabrics so striking and seductive the patterns of african textiles fall into three categories woven , dyed , and printed or painted in many woven fabrics , like kente cloth , narrow handloomed bands are joined together curiously , the designs of many dyed fabrics echo the structure imposed by the loom , conveying a sense that the strip , or band , is to african art as the grid is to western postwar painting one of the met show s most spectacular pairings matches mr anatsui s between earth and heaven , a recent acquisition , with a kente prestige cloth from ghana \( in the collection of the british museum \) using folded and linked aluminum caps from liquor bottles , mr anatsui echoes the rhythmic tension between warp and weftface stripes exemplified in the kente the works also share a palette of red , indigo and gold , although gold dominates in mr anatsui s shimmering metal tapestry as the son and brother of ewe weavers in ghana , mr anatsui has clearly internalized some of the principles of kente cloth design this easy , familial relationship to fabric is typical of the contemporary artists in the exhibition another ghanaian , atta kwami , is the son of the noted textile designer grace salome kwami in a statement that accompanies his small paintings and prints , mr kwami mentions his mother s work in the same breath as the paintings of sean scully and piet mondrian with none of the artcraft , insider outsider hangups westerners so often display an alternative to weaving can be seen in several adinkra and adire wrappers \( yoruba textiles made by stamping fabric

kiwanja , at last the bullets had stopped , and fran ois kambere siviri made a dash for the door after hiding all night from firefights between rebels and a governmentallied militia over this small but strategic town , he was desperate to get to the latrine a few feet away pow , pow , pow , said his widowed mother , ludia kavira nzuva , recounting how the rebels killed her 25yearold son just outside her front door as they abandoned his bloodied corpse , she said , one turned to her and declared , voil , here is your gift in little more than 24 hours , at least 150 people would be dead , most of them young men , summarily executed by the rebels last month as they tightened their grip over parts of eastern congo , according to witnesses and humanrights investigators and yet , as the killings took place , a contingent of about 100 peacekeepers was less than a mile away , struggling to understand what was happening outside the gates of its base the peacekeepers were short of equipment and men , united nations officials said , and they were focusing on evacuating frightened aid workers and searching for a foreign journalist who had been kidnapped already overwhelmed , officials said , they had no intelligence capabilities or even an interpreter who could speak the necessary languages the peacekeepers said they had no idea that the killings were taking place until it was all over the executions in kiwanja are a study in the unfettered cruelty meted out by the armed groups fighting for power and resources in eastern congo but the events are also a textbook example of the continuing failure of the world s largest international peacekeeping force , which has from brutality in this instance , the failure came from a mix of poor communication and staffing , inadequate equipment , intelligence breakdowns and spectacularly bad luck , said lt col h s brar , the commander of the indian peacekeepers based in kiwanja but the killings and the stumbling response to the rebel advance were symptomatic of problems that have plagued the united nations peacekeeping force in congo for years , said anneke van woudenberg , a senior researcher for human rights watch , who investigated the slayings this month the rebel onslaught was even led by a commander who is wanted on war crimes charges by the international criminal court kiwanja was a disaster for everyone , ms van woudenberg said the people were betrayed not just by rebels who committed terrible war crimes against them but by the international community that failed to protect them in the past year alone , hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes as the rebels , led by a renegade army general , have waged a fierce insurgency against the government and its allied militias in an interview , the rebel general , , denied that his troops had executed civilians here , accusing militias allied with the government of trying to make his rebel movement look bad we cannot kill the population , he said it is not in our behavior to kill and to rape but extensive interviews with victims , aid workers and humanrights investigators showed that mr nkunda s men carried out a doortodoor military operation over two days in which young men and others were executed the trouble began on oct 28 , when congolese army troops fled the town , fearful of the advance of mr nkunda s troops the soldiers , who had already been routed by mr nkunda s men farther south , looted and raped as they ran , taking everything of value and even forcing some residents to help them carry the spoils , according to witnesses and investigators fearful residents had to choose between two bad options follow the rampaging army or wait to see what the rebels might bring with the soldiers long gone , mr nkunda s troops took the towns of kiwanja and rutshuru without firing a shot immediately , they ordered the residents who remained to torch sprawling camps that held about 30 , 000 people displaced by earlier fighting , proclaiming that it was now safe for the camp dwellers to return to their villages , witnesses said they said there was security , so everyone should go home , said fran ois hazumutima , a retired teacher who had been living in a nearby camp but none of us felt safe a week later , on nov 4 , a group of militia fighters known as the mai mai carried out a surprise attack on kiwanja but the rebels soon routed the mai mai and ordered all residents to leave the soldiers then went house to house , saying they were searching for militia fighters who stayed behind to fight but many residents who stayed were scared their houses would be looted or were too old or infirm to flee , according to witnesses others had simply not gotten the message to leave the rebels came to the door of a 25yearold trader , banging and threatening to shoot their way in there were gunshots everywhere , he said , speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution they asked for money i gave them 200 he then watched in impotent horror as the rebels went to his 22yearold brother s house next door the man , a student , had no money to offer them the soldiers ordered him to lie on the ground they stabbed him in the neck with their bayonets and shot him in the head , he said they said , if you do n't have money , you are mai mai , ' he said everyone who was young was destined to die muwavita mukangusi said she was out in the fields farming with her husband when the shooting started their three young daughters were at home , so ms mukangusi ran back her husband hid in the fields , returning only at nightfall the next morning the rebels came they took my husband , she said , her eyes rimmed in red because i had 50 in the house , i took 25 to them but it was not enough i added 25 it was still not enough they accused him of being mai mai the rebels beat him , she said , then forced him to the ground and shot him in the back of the head according to witnesses and clips of video shot at the time , jean bosco ntaganda , mr nkunda s chief of staff , commanded the troops that carried out the killings mr ntaganda , whose nom de guerre is the terminator , committed while he was commanding a different armed group earlier in the war meanwhile , confusion reigned at the nearby peacekeepers' base the company of soldiers sits in a spot that is decidedly not strategic , nestled in a valley that is highly vulnerable to incoming fire and has a poor vantage point from which to keep tabs on the surrounding area the company s only translator left the base on oct 26 and was not replaced until more than two weeks later but even in normal times , communications are limited to make logistical arrangements , the peacekeepers depend largely on civilian staff members who work normal business hours and have weekends off unable to speak to most of the population and with almost no intelligence capabilities , colonel brar groped his way through a fog of rumor , speculation and misinformation during this whole time , there was an informational vacuum , colonel brar said with just one company of soldiers and three armored vehicles , the colonel s peacekeepers were overmatched , he said patrols had to be aborted because rebels and militia fighters opened fire with heavy weapons that could pierce the vehicles' cladding the peacekeepers said they could not tell the difference between the different armed groups and were fearful of firing on civilians the colonel said he was juggling orders from headquarters in goma to rescue stranded aid workers and search for a kidnapped foreign journalist sending out too many patrols would leave no one to protect the thousands of civilians gathered around the base , trapped in the vulnerable valley making matters worse , the peacekeepers' armored vehicles are largely unable to handle the muddy terrain of the neighborhoods hit hardest by the violence it was not until the fighting was over that the full horror of the killings was discovered in houses stuffed with dead bodies we launched patrols in areas we thought there would be clashes , he explained but we could not be everywhere at once as the shooting died down , residents said they found streets littered with bodies most , but not all , were young men and boys one health care worker , who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisals , helped the red cross recover the bodies some were killed with bullets , others bayoneted , the worker said among the injured sent to the regional hospital , the worker said , were two women , one small girl of 9 years and one boy of 11 years witnesses said the rebels ordered that the bodies be buried quickly and far from the cemetery , to avoid leaving evidence for war crimes investigators they did not want any mass graves , said another man , who participated in the burials the worker said that by the end of nov 6 , they had collected 150 bodies , the same toll reached by human rights watch the count could be higher still , he said , since the rebels have hampered efforts at a fuller accounting of the dead and missing mr nkunda s men continue to hold the town , as well as neighboring rutshuru outwardly , calm has returned to the streets but mothers have sent their sons packing because the rebels have been forcing men and boys to join them mujawimana nyiragasigwa said her 15yearold son jimia was snatched by soldiers in broad daylight last month he had been out looking for work when the soldiers rounded him up , she said , and he has been missing for two and a half weeks if i ever see him again , it will be by the grace of god , she said colonel brar was clearly troubled by what happened here but said he and his troops did their best in an awful situation we did what we could , he said imagine if we had not been here many more could have died ms kavira nzuva , whose son fran ois was killed , said his death had hollowed out her life gaunt and hobbled at 67 , she was forced to return to the fields to farm fran ois had supported her with his photography business he had wired her mudwalled house for electricity and paid the monthly bill he had built her a new kitchen she kept a thick album of pictures of him , a tall man always eager to strike a pose for the camera he was my youngest child , she said i do n't know how i will live without him
hong kong after a year marred by fatal accidents , the sport of eventing received a muchneeded reprieve monday at the olympics when the hazardous crosscountry portion of the event concluded with no riders or horses seriously injured the german team took the lead in eventing , which consists of dressage , crosscountry and show jumping australia had the best score in dressage over the weekend but fell behind in the overall score on monday as its riders consistently took slightly longer than the germans to complete the crosscountry course the final stage , show jumping , will be held tuesday one of the swedish team s horses , keymaster , was limping a little afterit returned from the course an xrayexamination subsequently turned up a hairline fracture in the pastern of its right foreleg the bone that connects the hoof to the fetlock veterinarians put ice on it and planned surgery on tuesday but were confident that the horse would recover this is not an uncommon injury for competing horses , dr leo jeffcott , the senior international veterinarian for the hong kong olympic equestrian events , said in a statement the horse and its rider , magnus gallerdal , had finished the course without incurring any penalties for missing jumps or falling in the individual standings , two german riders , hinrich romeike and ingrid klimke , were first and second after the crosscountry megan jones of australia was in third the united states , which was third after the dressage , plunged to seventh place on monday an american rider , amy tryon , and her horse fell and were disqualified , and two other american riders , rebecca holder and karen o'connor , were penalized for each failing twice to clear jumps on the first try the hazards of crosscountry riding were underlined on saturday when a 23yearold woman died in a fall during an international eventing competition in britain not connected to the olympics more than a dozen riders have died or been paralyzed in the past year , in a spate of falls that experts have attributed partly to demanding crosscountry courses designed in response to public demand for ever greater challenges at each of the past two olympics , a horse was injured during the crosscountry competition and had to be destroyed high rates of injury have contributed to periodic suggestions over the years that eventing be dropped as an olympic sport martin plewa , the president of the ground jury for the eventing competition , said the riders monday were very responsible , very aware of the welfare of the horses he added , that s a very good sign for the olympic future of eventing at 28 miles , the course here was one of the shortest ever used at the olympics for an activity originally designed to test horses' endurance as well as their speed and jumping ability the course designer , mike etheringtonsmith , said his top priority had been to protect the welfare of horses and riders , and hong kong s heat and humidity were a particular concern to avoid overtiring the horses , the course was shortened last thursday from 35 miles , already short by olympic standards the base of one of the obstacles was then changed from rocks to bushes on sunday afternoon to further reduce the risk etheringtonsmith said in an interview that others , whom he declined to identify , had raised safety concerns about the original obstacle , but that he still believed the last change had been unnecessary making up for the shorter distance was the frequency of obstacles , with 29 of them packed into the course some of the obstacles were designed to reflect hong kong s chinese heritage horses and riders leaped a wooden barrier carved and painted to resemble a dragon , jumped a miniature great wall and passed under a gate faintly resembling the entrance to a chinese temple clayton fredericks of australia said the heat and number of obstacles made it a challenging course , and that he was not troubled by the shortened length of the course i think they judged the distance well , he said after the competition the hong kong jockey club designed and built oversized golf carts fitted with portable generators , hoses and bathtubsized red plastic tanks full of cold water , ready to be driven to overheated horses but the carts were not needed as a warm drizzle fell before the start , the sun stayed behind the clouds during the warm and humid early hours of the competition and then a heavy rain fell on the last horses and riders shortly before noon two of the 69 horses that started the race fell , but both sprang up without any immediate sign of injury two riders also fell while their mounts stayed upright , including alex hua tian , the first rider to wear china s flag in an olympic equestrian event born in britain to a british mother and a chinese father , hua was raised partly in china and now studies at eton he was the clear hometown favorite among the crowd of 10 , 000 spectators , who heartily cheered his start and groaned when he mistimed the strides of his horse on the approach to one of the most challenging fences on the course i'm just so disappointed , he said , adding that his horse had been lightly grazed above one knee but would be fine drenched in perspiration and later by rain , the mostly hong kongraised spectators were enthusiastic in interviews with a half dozen spectators , none turned out to have ever ridden a horse not surprising given that hong kong has one of the world s highest population densities i petted a horse at a zoo in china once , said tsang kit yee , a 17yearold student who went to the crosscountry portion with her boyfriend , chan yik lung , who also had never ridden a horse
the feb 25 issue of new york magazine welcomes this spring fashion season with a cover image that does n't bother trying to promote the opart prints of miuccia prada or the freeform gowns of missoni or lanvin the marketing of fashion has had little do with clothes for a long time , after all at play instead is a commercialism that is both creepier and more compelling a picture of a nude , less than a year out of her third go at rehab the image is causing a ruckus in the blogosphere , and not because her nipples can be ogled through the thin triangle of pink chiffon she clasps with her mouth like a schnauzer the photo and eight more inside the magazine mimic , frame for frame , a handful of the fabled and ubiquitous pictures known as the last sitting that the photographer bert stern took of in 1962 , six weeks before she died of an overdose to make the echo that much more macabre , mr stern has taken these pictures as well as an editor s note explains , he volunteered for the duty like a star quarterback who has never moved on , mr stern has apparently been hankering to relive the old days to find just the right sad beauty with whom to recreate his erotic and melancholy images how did it come about \? the editor s note asks stern had decided that lohan was the perfect actress for this project , and when he asked if we might be interested in working with him on it , we were naturally more than enthusiastic a cover line that hangs to the right of ms lohan s freckled leg heightens the unseemliness of the project it reads , heath ledger s double life in a short profile of ms lohan that precedes mr stern s pictures , she talks about the tragedy of monroe s death as well as mr ledger s , announcing that no comparisons hold i sure as hell would n't let it happen to me , she says no matter ms lohan s protestations , the pictures ask viewers to engage in a kind of mock necrophilia they are sexual , funereal images given the context and the specter of mr ledger s death , you ca n't help but feel you are looking at someone all made up for the grave for the 10 , 000th time we are forced to ask lindsay , what were you thinking \? ms lohan surely consented to these pictures in an effort to resurrect her career , in bad shape if not tatters after her difficulties with the production schedule of georgia rule but all they do is tell us what we already know ms lohan is a spacedout head atop a singularly wellarticulated form the celebrity fashion shoot has become a vital tool in recasting a tainted or toostaid image the good girl dresses up as if charlotte rampling in the night porter , the bad girl puts on a cocktail suit ms lohan could have seized this moment to rebrand herself a few pages in which she would be costumed to look like margaret thatcher but here all she manages to accomplish is to remind us of her tendencies toward selfdestruction regardless , she appears dramatic doing it ms lohan looks narrowhipped and voluptuous in the pictures , taut and soft at 21 she seems even older than monroe , who was 36 in the originals , and hardened by her excesses the photographs bear none of monroe s fragility in the first picture ms lohan wears a platinum wig and false eyelashes for all the images , by the way she drapes the pink chiffon across her torso diagonally , and if she looks like anyone at all , it is madonna monroe looked available in her stern photos ms lohan looks available for sale ms lohan has spoken freely about her obsession with monroe over the years , but it is madonna s strategy of managing the image of her own sexuality that perhaps ms lohan hopes to reproduce there is a chance this approach could work for her if she is willing to offer the world more than her bust line and if , in her recreational hours , she is prepared to turn simply to yoga
for 17 months , they tracked one another s movements like prey but senators and came together here thursday evening to pull off a secret rendezvous they ditched their traveling entourages , eluded camera crews across town and startled many of their own advisers as they held their first private meeting since becoming archrivals for the democratic presidential nomination it was a political scavenger hunt like this capital had seldom seen before at least in the current frenzied climate where the two rivals huddled at an undisclosed location only hours earlier , she sought to cool speculation that she was clamoring to be his running mate , but suddenly the city s media was awash in rumor as word spread of their meeting the evening began in routine fashion , with mr obama holding a large rally in northern virginia then , he was scheduled to travel by motorcade to dulles international airport and fly to chicago the motorcade arrived , but mr obama did not , stirring alarm among reporters who had been aboard the campaign plane for 45 minutes as it sat on the tarmac shortly before takeoff , one part of the secret was divulged robert gibbs , the campaign s communications director , said mr obama would not be flying to chicago as previously scheduled he gave no reason for this mysterious pronouncement and there was little time for questions , considering that the engines had started to whir sunlen miller , who covers the obama campaign for abc news , filed an urgent dispatch via blackberry to report that the senator had abruptly changed plans and had given the slip to those who were traveling with him all day i sent it as the wheels were going up , ms miller said of her message , recounting the agitation and confusion among her fellow travelers as the 757 lifted off it was n't until after the plane landed in chicago sans the presidential candidate that mr gibbs confirmed a meeting had taken place between the rivals details \? none given the facetoface meeting , initiated by mrs clinton , illustrated how the hierarchical roles of the candidates' relationship suddenly were changing while mr obama agreed to meet mrs clinton on her terms at the location and time of her choosing he was doing so wearing the title of a presumptive nominee , eager to get their first session out of the way and move onto the general election several early reports suggested that mr obama and mrs clinton were holding the secret session at her home on whitehaven street , which sits in the shadow of the vice president s residence in northwest washington in the end , aides said , the meeting did not take place there , a development that for hours injected a cloakanddaggerlike element into the drama and set off a mad scramble for reporters to find the secret location for a time , the search took place live on cable television , unfolding like a washington spy thriller , with the two leading characters sneaking around with the help of decoys and diversions was it taking place at the home of senator dianne feinstein , a california democrat , who supported mrs clinton but is also friendly to mr obama \? \( if so , where does she live \? property records indicated an address on nebraska avenue , which turned up nothing \) or was it happening at mr obama s small duplex on capitol hill \? or , perhaps , the congressional picnic that was underway at the white house on thursday evening \? those questions not to mention the substance of the meeting went largely unanswered advisers to both candidates did not respond to questions by telephone or email , saying the senators demanded that the session be kept secret throughout the long primary season , chuck todd , the political director of nbc news , turned to maps and charts to help explain the statebystate and delegatebydelegate maneuverings no visual aids could help explain this mysterious clintonobama story this is only a taste of the media deception to come , the granddaddy of them all when it comes to secret meetings is the vice presidential search , mr todd said , after calling an end to the hunt for information it s a frustrating game campaigns play when it comes to these private meetings but they rarely pay a real price because secretly the press corps enjoys the chase finally , as mr obama was headed back to chicago on a private plane and mrs clinton had returned to her home , another rarity took place a joint statement was issued by representatives of the two senators , but sent out by mr obama s staff those words , perhaps , were the first cooperative undertaking since the presidential race began six seasons ago senator clinton and senator obama met tonight and had a productive discussion about the important work that needs to be done to succeed in november , the statement said mrs clinton s farewell from the race comes saturday when she offers her endorsement , mr obama said he intends to be in chicago with his family unless , of course , he is n't
doc rivers had a frontrow seat when the hit rock bottom two months ago he has recently seen them only on tape , but the contrast is striking the first thing you see is their spirit , rivers , the ' coach , told boston reporters they seem like they like each other they 're getting along it s nice to see the knicks who stumbled through the td banknorth garden on nov 29 displayed none of those qualities , and left with a humiliating 10459 loss as a result at best , they seemed to be tolerating one another a different knicks team has apparently emerged over the last eight days but its newfound unity will be seriously tested when the mighty celtics visit madison square garden on monday boston has breezed through the season s first half and takes a 326 record by far the nba s best into the game the knicks just completed their best week of the season , four victories in five games , but their 1327 record is the fifth worst in the league now , just as the knicks begin to reclaim their selfworth , the celtics show up on their doorstep , forcing everyone to confront repressed memories of the unpleasant notsodistant past the knicks of november lost eight consecutive games while coach isiah thomas feuded with stephon marbury and the locker room filled with resentment and frustration then came the 45point rout in boston , the knicks' worst loss in nearly 27 years the most embarrassing game of the season , jamal crawford said saturday night after the knicks won in miami by far definitely that was something people talked about for a little while , but that s in the past for us and it s a new beginning so hopefully we 'll just continue to build on what we 've been doing that fresh start has coincided with marbury s exit from the lineup he shut himself down after a jan 11 loss to toronto , complaining of pain in his left ankle two days later , the knicks staged a stunning rout of detroit then came victories against washington , the nets and the heat , all of them built on better ball movement , improved defense and a sense that the knicks actually care about one another it may be too soon to link the surge to marbury s departure but his dour demeanor and tendency to dominate the ball have long been a drag on the knicks' push for team unity the knicks' collapse in boston came 16 days after marbury , angered by thomas s decision to bench him , abandoned the team in phoenix the loss to the celtics showed just how fragmented the knicks had become thomas immediately blasted his players for being selfish , a charge he had never leveled before the knicks' new personality is decidedly selfless they averaged 226 assists over five games last week , after averaging 173 assists in their first 35 games nate robinson , a main beneficiary of marbury s absence , and a major force in the knicks' recent victories , poignantly noted saturday that the knicks are now doing it for each other , instead of themselves the ghosts of november , however , are never far away thomas gave his players the day off sunday , sparing them from an unwelcome filmreview session but the nationally televised debacle in boston will be replayed endlessly as the knicks prepare for the nationally televised rematch another crushing defeat could split the knicks' newfound spirit at the seams a sturdy performance against boston could further embolden them either way , this is as good a time as any to play the celtics boston has lost three of its last six games , which qualifies as a slump the knicks are 42 over the same stretch david lee listed the knicks' goals as compete and not get embarrassed thomas said we 're playing a little bit better than we were the last time we saw them but they 're capable of making you look bad , because they 're that good
my sunday column praising evangelical christians for their humanitarian work attracted a broad range of comments generally , readers in south dakota were more enthusiastic than those in manhattan let me try to respond to some of the most frequent criticisms and i invite you to have a swipe at me again in the comments if you think my responses don t cut it i ll put the reader comments in bold and my responses in regular type it s disingenuous to compare pejorative comments about race or gender to pejorative comments about religion after all , we have no control over our race or gender granted , that is a difference , and it s probably worse to insult someone whose face was scarred in a car accident than voluntarily as part of an african tribal rite but why insult either person \? indeed , most liberals are respectful of people s life choices and nonjudgmental of others , and liberals have generally been far more tolerant of muslims than conservatives have yet even in temples of liberal tolerance such as university campuses , one of the few groups it s still acceptable to deride is evangelical christians mormons , too , i suppose in the 1960 s , conservatives often displayed a foolish prejudice against people with long hair or beards , and that wasn t made sensible simply because anyone could get a haircut the problem was that it relied upon caricatures and demeaning stereotypes of the other , and such pejorative stereotyping and mockery is inappropriate even if it relates to characteristics that are not innate such as faith and by the way , one thing we might have learned over the millennia is that religious wars aren t good for anybody it s okay to deride evangelicals because they re neanderthals on science and other issues if people don t believe in evolution , they invite mockery if we call them nuts , it s because we have good evidence that they are nuts i agree that the fundamentalist opposition to evolution is ridiculous , and it s certainly fair to argue that point or to criticize people s scientific beliefs but mocking religious beliefs is different because religions are neither rational or irrational as kant argued , breaking the old cartesian paradigm , religion is neither provable nor disprovable and kant was no nut there s also a question of tactics most of us would agree that female genital cutting is an outrageous ritual that is linked to religion \( most of those who practice it are muslims in africa , although it predates islam and also is practiced by some christians \) for decades , the standard western response was to shower contempt on the practice and try to outlaw it , and this got nowhere in the last decade , some local grassroots groups like tostan have taken a much more respectful approach that s why it s now called female genital cutting rather than female genital mutilation and finally they re making astounding inroads toward elimination of the ritual dialogue with people really does get you further than yelling at them what if you were gay \? evangelicals nurture antigay hatred and discrimination , and that s why we hate them not because of their faith if i were gay i might indeed be less forgiving but i ve written many columns criticizing fundamentalists for homophobia , so i feel i should also acknowledge the lifesaving work so many conservative christians also do evangelicals may do some good work in africa but it s outweighed by their insistence on abstinenceonly programs and hostility to condoms and their aim is to save souls , not to save lives they make people convert before they give out food it s true that evangelical insistence on abstinenceonly has been silly , and the prudishness about condoms positively ridiculous but none of this begins to outweigh the good that is being done by evangelicals on aids , and at the end of the day the bush administration is now giving out more than 400 million condoms a year , more than any other country and more than twice the 190 million condoms that the clinton administration gave out in 1999 \( clinton has been great on aids since leaving office he wasn t much use to africa while he was president \) the best thing that bush has done in office is start pepfar , the us antiaids program , which is set to save 9 million lives \( and which was pushed by michael gerson , his evangelical speech writer \) i tend to think that the money spent on abstinenceonly is largely wasted \( it delays sexual debut , but then young people are less likely to use condoms when they become sexually active \) , but that s just 30 percent of a hugely increased aids prevention budget finally , it s just incorrect that missionaries make people convert before giving them help occasionally they do , but mostly they don t and while the motivation may be to save souls as well as save lives , the parents of children who are being fed at emergency feeding stations don t care what the theological reason is they re just glad that someone , anyone , is saving their children s lives and we should be grateful , too you just focus on religious conservatives , but there are also liberal evangelicals true , but not so many of them one of the best predictors of a white person s voting is church attendance a white person who goes to church at least weekly is seven times as likely to vote republican as someone who rarely goes to church white evangelicals traditionally have been conservative politically \( although black evangelicals , with a similar theology , have been liberal \) that seems to be changing now , partly because so many white evangelicals are disenchanted with the bush administration failures that they might vote democratic you re always trying to hug conservatives while being hypercritical of liberals what kind of liberal are you if you try to betray your own side \? look , i don t see my job as a cheerleader , but as someone who tries to shine a spotlight and make people think and we don t get anywhere if we just point out the sins on the other side we should also have the decency to point out the sins on our own side or the virtues of the other during the clinton administration , i was appalled by how many moderate , intelligent republicans didn t denounce the vicious abuses of fellow republicans \( such as calling the clintons drugdealers or murderers \) , and i vowed that i would be just as critical of my side as of the other in any case , as a practical matter , conservatives don t listen to me and don t trust me , while liberals often do and so if my aim is to persuade people , then it s often more effective to target people who share my worldview than to target those who think i m an idiot more generally , we can achieve far more to advance humanitarian causes if the right and left will work together we tolerate good evangelicals like jimmy carter it s those conservative bigot evangelicals we can t stand if you only tolerate those you agree with , that s not tolerance the challenge is to keep an open mind in judging people who come from a different faith or skin color or background than yourself let s not kid ourselves evangelical conservatives and secular liberals are going to have many different beliefs , and they will often vote for different candidates but the world will be better off if they work together on those issues where they can find a measure of accord , from fighting maternal mortality to curbing carbon emissions the problem with fundamentalism is that it imposes blinders , and encourages people to see imperfectly , through caricatures right now , in congo , ethiopia , burundi , chad , there are missionaries putting their lives on the line to try to help others , and they re doing that with donations sent by the 10 percent charitable tithing of evangelicals for liberals sitting in the comfort of their apartments , giving 2 percent or 4 percent of their incomes to charity , and scorning those who have different political or religious views but who are doing good work out there , strikes me as no more than secular fundamentalism if you want to prove what jerks evangelicals are , then donate 15 percent of your own income to charity , volunteer at a soup kitchen , or arrange to work on your vacation in burundi for an aid group now that would be a useful competition between liberals and conservatives , to see who can do the most good !
caracas , the united states stepped up the diplomatic skirmish with its leftwing adversaries in latin america on friday , saying it would expel the venezuelan ambassador and declaring that venezuela s top two intelligence officials had supported the narcoterrorist activities of rebels in the region the moves heightened the political tensions that have been building between the united states and venezuela and in recent days , sending shudders through financial markets here and rekindling fears in washington of a cold warstyle contest in the region as venezuela grows increasingly close to russia the recent salvos began on wednesday , when bolivia s embattled president , evo morales , expelled the american ambassador there , philip s goldberg , accusing him of supporting rebellious groups in eastern bolivia then on thursday , president hugo ch vez of venezuela said he was expelling the american ambassador to his country , patrick duddy , expressing solidarity with mr morales and contending that an americansupported coup plot against him had been discovered the state department responded by declaring bolivia s ambassador to washington persona non grata then on friday morning , it said it would expel venezuela s ambassador , while the treasury department accused the venezuelan intelligence officials of aiding colombia s largest rebel group , the , or farc , even as it terrorized and kidnapped innocents it was the first time the united states declared specific venezuelan officials to be supporters of the farc , but the designation stopped short of a more serious option debated in washington in recent months classifying venezuela as a state sponsor of terrorism such a move could significantly affect the 50 billion in annual trade between the countries , potentially rendering venezuela s oil off limits to american markets still , a bush administration official said the expulsion of the american ambassador would inject fresh urgency into those deliberations , and that new economic steps against venezuela were being explored our expelling their ambassador is not the end of things , said the official , who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly a second american official said the accusations against the venezuelan spymasters could be an initial designation , possibly opening the way to venezuela s being placed on the terrorism list responding to the actions , venezuela s foreign minister , nicol s maduro , said in a statement on friday that venezuela has decided to submit its entire relations with the united states to an intense review process in announcing its action on friday , the treasury department said that the head of venezuela s military intelligence agency , gen hugo carvajal , protected drug shipments from seizure by venezuelan antidrug authorities and helped provide weapons to the farc , which the united states considers a terrorist organization the treasury department also said that gen henry rangel silva , the director of venezuela s disip intelligence agency , materially assisted the farc s drug trafficking activities and pushed for greater cooperation between the venezuelan government and the rebels in addition , the treasury department said a third official , ram n rodr guez chac n , who resigned as interior minister this week , was the venezuelan government s main weapons contact for the farc it said the rebel group used proceeds from narcotics sales to buy weapons from the venezuelan government in accusing the three officials , washington punctured mr ch vez s inner circle both intelligence officials have been longstanding confidants of the president , while mr rodr guez chac n was a key figure in mr ch vez s recent hostagerelease negotiations with the farc none of the three men responded friday to calls seeking comment senior american officials said the designation of venezuelan officials as supporters of the farc was unrelated to the expulsions of american ambassadors in bolivia and venezuela but the move came at a time of increased sparring between the united states and venezuela over a variety of issues , including claims that venezuela is growing as a transshipment point for cocaine and concerns about the safety of venezuela s airports for american airlines mr ch vez s plans for military exercises with russia s navy in the caribbean have also raised the stakes of the political drama unfolding this week , pointing to efforts by venezuela to aggressively counter american military influence in the region at a time when the united states navy has reactivated a fleet to patrol latin american waters from the us standpoint , the growing security alliance between venezuela and russia makes ch vez more of a problem today than was the case before the georgia crisis erupted and the chilling of usrussia relations , said michael shifter , vice president for policy at the interamerican dialogue , a research group in washington but there are significant internal issues that could be playing into these disputes as well bolivia is grappling with violent , spreading protests in its increasingly ungovernable eastern lowlands on friday the bolivian government announced a state of siege in pando province and sent troops there in venezuela , mr ch vez s government is facing uncomfortable revelations about its spying operations and attempted bribery in a trial of a proch vez venezuelan tycoon taking place in a miami courtroom , as well as rising inflation and potential losses in regional elections later this year do n't believe for a moment that either expulsion had anything to do with an imminent danger of aggression from a waning us administration already in way over its head in the middle east and with russia , said adam isacson , an expert on the andean drug war at the center for international policy , a research group in washington what we have here are two leaders badly in need of an external threat to rally their domestic bases at a volatile political moment as for the bush administration , it has been unable to engage either of those governments effectively , and antiamerican sentiment has been mounting in the countries for years , a phenomenon aptly stoked by both mr morales and mr ch vez in venezuela , that sentiment took off in 2002 , when the bush administration tacitly approved a coup that briefly toppled mr ch vez with oil prices falling on international markets in recent weeks , the latest surge of political tension added to financial fears here on friday the currency , the bol var , plunged more than 10 percent in blackmarket trading to 45 to the dollar , while venezuelan bonds fell to their lowest values in four years on concern that venezuela s oil exports to the united states might be disrupted while mr ch vez threatened yet again this week to halt americanbound oil cargoes , such a situation remains unlikely for all the warnings , refusing to sell oil would probably hurt venezuela more than the united states america is the country s main customer for its oil , and therefore the most significant financier of mr ch vez s attempts to assert great state control over venezuelan society by contrast , american refiners could buy oil elsewhere , though a disruption in venezuelan oil supplies could cause ripples in an already weak american economy in fact , the skirmish already appeared to have some repercussions honduras said friday that it had postponed the accreditation of the american ambassador there , voicing support for bolivia and venezuela yet insisting that it had not broken relations with the united states the treasury department s action on friday was based on information gleaned from computers recovered in a raid on a farc camp in ecuador last march by colombian security forces , as well as other intelligence sources , according to the second bush administration official in copies of the computer files obtained by the new york times last march , a member of the farc s sevenmember secretariat refers to general carvajal , the venezuelan military intelligence chief , as arranging an arms deal for the guerrillas through panama in another reference , general carvajal was also mentioned as a liaison for dealing with the killing of six venezuelan soldiers by the farc on venezuelan soil that month with mr ch vez s latest charges of an americansupported coup plot , several current and former military officers have been detained here for questioning , giving rise to complaints among domestic critics show respect , president , said miguel henrique otero , publisher of the newspaper el nacional and a coordinator of a group opposing mr chavez s socialistinspired policies the only coup plotter is you , he continued , making a reference to mr ch vez s failed attempt in 1992 to overthrow venezuela s government
snowflakes fell in new york on wednesday , but none onstage at lincoln center had closed its annual season of george balanchine s nutcracker with a particularly bright performance on sunday on wednesday it opened its eightweek winter repertory season with an account of balanchine s jewels the nutcracker is narrative jewels has its place in history as the first abstract fullevening ballet \( as it was billed when new in 1967 \) both ballets serve as ideal introductions to what dance theater has to offer and both are classics that repay innumerable rewatchings one of the best reasons for watching city ballet these days is listening , especially when its music director , fay al karoui , is conducting in the final nutcracker performances the orchestra actually sounded as if it was having even more fun than the dancers the do n'tmissthis castanets during the spanish dance made me laugh aloud , and the string section delivered a brilliant contrast between loud and quiet pizzicati in the chinese dance mr karoui s rhythm and accentuation grow only keener when there s an occasional blip in the orchestral playing there were two brief lapses of coordination in one postchristmas nutcracker matinee , and a hiccup during the oboe melody that opened the andante elegiaco movement in wednesday s performance of the tchaikovsky score for diamonds \( the closing third of jewels \) still such flaws never made these performances lackluster on wednesday the faur music for the opening emeralds sounded especially sensuous there have been a lot of jewels about of late city ballet closed its spring season with it in june , and since then i have traveled to see miami city ballet and the royal ballet in britain the paris opera ballet s account is on dvd , and the kirov ballet s performances early in this decade left powerful impressions a true balletomane in such circumstances should respond by attending to who danced what better or best but wednesday s curtain no sooner rose on emeralds , looking in peter harvey s d cor like not just jewelry but also a lusciously deep latesummer garden where dew hangs heavy on spider webs between the leaves , and i found myself plunged deep into the ballet itself why is it that ballets like these are so rewatchable \? balanchine knew how to construct a ballet in five dimensions the three dimensions of space the fourth of time the fifth of imagination , resonance , drama and memory so that , watching and listening in the theater , we are made extraordinarily alive and responsive his sheer grasp of theater seems far larger than that of most major directors take the entrances and exits in jewels alone in both emeralds and diamonds , there is a pas de deux that starts with man and woman entering from opposite sides of the stage and looking at each other as if across a vast terrain in emeralds they both enter from the back , then , locked into each other s eyes \( each with one arm powerfully raised \) , process forward , formally , slowly , powerfully distanced only then do they come together in diamonds they enter from diametrically opposed corners , stand , partner addressing partner , as if across an infinity and then advance formally again along gently zigzagging paths \( which seem dictated by the music \) until they meet center stage as for exits , just look at those in which balanchine has dancers retreat into the wings backwards the leading man of rubies has a famous exit jump , vaulting off while hailing the action onstage \( like the famous parthian shot in which the archers released their load while leaving the field \) this was a specialty of edward villella , who originated this role , but here it registers as drama the second ballerina of the same piece has a slow , strange , retreating exit toward the wings , repeatedly pausing , on flat foot , to raise her rear leg high in one powerful arabesque pench e after another as she goes the closing dance of emeralds starts with a beautiful fanlike tableau that melts as the 10 women of the corps de ballet slowly pace back , back , back they seem to be reluctantly withdrawing from a spell before leaving the stage for the 7 lead dancers then there are dance motifs in all three ballets dancers walk , walk , walk and , in the stravinsky rubies , jog in all three , dancers bend right forward to the floor , bring fingers together , then rise erect and , opening arms apart now , arch back \( a grand port de bras \) and variations occur on this toandfro bendingandopening throughout , not least during the several pas de deux , where such upper body motions become powerful expressions of intimate needs and reactions everybody sees these things in any performance of jewels , but since there is so much to see , it can take years before some of them truly register in terms of meaning and before we have a full sense of just what world we 're watching onstage i must have often seen how some of the lead dancers of emeralds shield their eyes for a moment during that closing septet the shielding of eyes is one of the most famous dramatic motifs in balanchine dance theater but had i noticed before wednesday \? certainly it struck me as if for the first time other points too emeralds , with its double aura of both perfumed romanticism and medieval chivalrous romance , looked freshest on wednesday the first ballerina role here is a good one for ashley bouder , just because it takes her out of the bright flash in which she excels and into less familiar zones of poetic mystery , and she dances it lovingly coming down the stage s center line toward the audience in a series of pirouettes on point , she contrasts fast turns with lingering ones with such dynamic clarity that we 're newly held , as we are by the rich pliancy of her upper body sara mearns , in the second role , is a dancer of similarly luscious tone and pointed dance nuance i begin to see why she has been given some of the repertory s foremost roles and am keen to watch what she can do with them rubies was dominated by teresa reichlen s account of the second ballerina , whom she makes its mistress of ceremonies , turning in one knee across another \( with a lavish downward arm gesture \) with the same inscrutable authority as elsewhere she hurls a leg to the sky as the leading couple , megan fairchild and benjamin millepied gave polite and perky performances that surely need attack and texture of an altogether more potent order wendy whelan , the company s senior ballerina as far as most of its prima roles go , led diamonds with such authority that she won the evening s biggest ovation though her authority is unquestionable , to my eye ms whelan s upper and lower body just are n't ideally coordinated , and her movements are n't fully finished there is a particular tension in her shoulders that often seems to block the flow of movement into her arms , so that it s like hearing a famous singer who often sings sharp this is the kind of problem one does n't enjoy addressing because ms whelan s authority is earned out of the best kind of dance honesty she is n't a superficially showy dancer , she does n't try to leave out steps , and she is riveting simply by her attention to movement cast changes in jewels lie ahead , and many other repertory programs over the weeks to come these programs will remind us of the continuing difficulties of life after balanchine in the meantime it is good just to go to see his choreography and , when concentration and conditions allow , to enter ever deeper into it its riches do not pall
san diego in a battle pitting two california passions cars and beaches against each other , a state panel will consider wednesday whether a highway can be built through a popular oceanfront state park the proposal before the panel , the california coastal commission , calls for completing the last 16 miles of a 28mile toll road in orange and san diego counties intended to alleviate worsening congestion on the main interstate between los angeles and san diego but the path of the proposed sixlane roadway bisects san onofre state beach , a 3 , 036acre park that is coveted by surfers for its stellar waves and by environmentalists for its large nature preserve interest in the commission s vote is so great that the meeting on wednesday is being held at a fairgrounds in del mar , north of san diego , to accommodate the expected crowds this is not just a campaign , it s a lifestyle , said jim moriarty , 44 , chief executive of the surfrider foundation , an environmental organization opposed to the project it s about people saying hey , i live here and i love it and i'm not going to see it spoiled' supporters of the toll road , which is being backed by the quasipublic transportation corridor agencies , describe it as an essential artery for a regional road system that will only get more clogged as proposed housing and commercial developments are built the road , in the planning stages since 1981 , has been scrutinized for years , the supporters say , to ensure that any damage to the state park is minimal we 've spent 20 million studying this over the last six years , said lance maclean , chairman of the foothill eastern transportation corridor agency and a councilman for the city of mission viejo , which is inland from the proposed toll road there s a lot of myths floating around out there , mr maclean added environmentalists worry that the waters off san onofre state beach would deteriorate with a new roadway as trash , residue from brake pads and other pollutants find their way into rainwater runoff that runoff , they say , would eventually pollute a beach where thousands of visitors congregate to enjoy some of the best water quality in southern california in addition , they fear the roadway would block the movement of sediment and cobblestones from a coastal lagoon into the open ocean that movement is essential to preserve the area s cherished surfing waves we 've looked all over the world and we 've never seen a road that does n't pollute in some way , mr moriarty said but officials at the transportation corridor agencies said runoffcleaning systems would be installed that would ensure that none of the pollutants from the road entered the local water table and they said the road would not affect the flow of sediment and pebbles out into the ocean because it would be raised above the state beach some supporters of the road say it would open up san onofre state beach , already the state s fifthmostvisited state park , to people from inland cities right now , they say , the beach is dominated by a clique of territorial surfers tom meservey is one such potential visitor meservey , a salesman from rancho santa margarita , which sits at the inland end of the proposed toll road route , said he has been teaching his 5yearold son , kenzo , how to surf at the beach the toll road will provide him with direct access to the coast there s only so many riders who can ride on each wave and they just want to keep it less crowded , mr meservey said of the road s opponents mr moriarty , the surfrider chief executive , rejected the criticism , noting that keeping people away from the beach goes against the surfrider foundation s founding principles it is the road , not distant visitors , that is the rallying cry for the opposition , he said our goal is to get as many people to the beaches as possible , mr moriarty said we 've got thousands of people coming from as far as washington state to protest , and activists campaigning around the world against this road
think of it as the ' owner , bonding with the bleacher bums at wrigley field , splurging for rounds of old style beer and screaming at umpires the concept is almost veeckian , as if bill veeck , the populist former owner of the browns , the indians and the white sox , had had zillions of dollars buying the cubs is the latest project for cuban , the owner of the nba s , but he is not alone in the expensive quest four other individuals and groups have given the debtladen tribune company nonbinding offers of at least 1 billion for the team , its stake in comcast sportsnet chicago , and 92yearold wrigley field cuban is reported to be the top bidder , at nearly 13 billion , but the auction will begin soon , after the applicants and their bankers delve further into the assets books the cubs are an amazing franchise and brand , cuban wrote in an email message i think the owner of any major sports franchise has two jobs first , it s to work hard to win a championship year after year , and second , to be the caretaker of the franchise in the community his eight years in basketball as the mavericks' owner have shown that there is no one in baseball like him , the closest being george steinbrenner or ted turner as younger men consider the roster of lesserknown buyers of baseball teams in recent years , and it s obvious that even if cuban never sits on an important committee , he will stick out , unlike liberty media \( braves \) , ted lerner \( nationals \) , robert castellini \( reds \) , lew wolff \( athletics \) , mark attanasio \( brewers \) , stuart sternberg \( rays \) and arte moreno \( angels \) cuban is loud , passionate and opinionated he s a media creature comfortable on multiple platforms , and he turned the oncecomatose mavericks into a perennial winner \( though they have not won it all \) he has amassed nearly 17 million in fines , mostly for criticizing nba referees as penance for insulting the chief of referees as incapable of managing a dairy queen , he spent a day at the chain serving up a promotional bonanza he s a blogger , a gadfly , a scold and a serial emailer he owns the hdnet channels , one of which employs dan rather he hosted a shortlived tv series , the benefactor , and got the hook from dancing with the stars after sambaing hurt , on a new artificial hip all he has done since reviving the mavericks will inform his baseball dossier , just as baseball will peer into the pasts of his competitors thomas ricketts , chief executive of incapital , a bond underwriter whose family founded td ameritrade a group that includes leo hindery jr , the former head of the yes network hersch klaff , a real estate investor and michael tokarz , who runs the mvc capital investment firm among them , only hindery has a high profile , but it is nothing like cuban s and none have had an exchange on radio like the one cuban had in may on dan patrick s syndicated radio show imagine what his rivals or the sitting major league baseball owners thought when they heard him respond to patrick s line of questioning about whether pursuing the cubs was like chasing the girl who s expensive and you may not have a shot at her cuban if there s a hooker you want , it all comes down to price , right \? and i think that s a better analogy patrick so the cubs are your hooker \? cuban well , yes , bad choice of words bob dupuy , the president of major league baseball , would not address the comment but praised cuban s internet and technology expertise he s been outspoken on issues , but we 've had owners who are outspoken as well , he said with his tongue lodged somewhere in his cheek , he said , i 've not heard of him referred to as a loudmouth but john henry , the principal owner of the boston red sox and a cuban booster , wrote in an email message , the commissioner s office abhors owners who speak their minds and fight for the rights of their respective franchises he added that he could think of no one better suited to reverse the fortunes of the cubs for the long term than cuban for all his excesses , cuban , 50 , is a successful owner the mavericks have averaged 573 wins in eight full seasons with him as their courtside benefactor , have reached the playoffs in each of those seasons and lost to miami in the 2006 finals and he has not been fined in two years by nba commissioner david stern so it came to pass last week that stern endorsed cuban to join mlb s ranks the sincere praise for him did not sound anything like a wish for bud selig , stern s baseball counterpart , to take cuban off his hands , on a parttime basis he lives in the here and the now , stern said in every issue we have to deal with , he freely expresses his views to me , some of which i'm happier to hear than others , but all are welcome he added , he would be an effective owner in most businesses in an email message , cuban wrote that the biggest surprise to people will be how wrong the press always is in their characterizations of our relationship stern hesitated when asked if cuban s avoidance of fines since 2006 was evidence of a boomer s mellowing his absence of mellow is in some ways his strongest trait , he said the nba board of governors voted to approve cuban as an owner in april 2000 , but he had been making decisions , and blowing off steam , shortly after announcing his 280 million acquisition from ross perot jr a few months earlier dave checketts , the president of madison square garden at the time , said cuban prompted some serious debate some powerful owners were against him , said checketts , the principal owner of the st louis blues , who came to admire cuban it was the way he presented himself to us in the interview , wearing jeans and sneakers , and turning his nose up and acting like he was the smartest guy in the room he was a smartaleck kid checketts said that russ granik , who was then the league s deputy commissioner , stood in opposition jerry colangelo , who owned the phoenix suns , said cuban was very outspoken and very opinionated , and we had information from people close to him most of what we gathered about him was not public , although today people are very familiar with him still , he was elected and the league held its breath he was fined eight times , totaling 1 million , in his first full season checketts said that if cuban s lack of decorum had not been more than balanced by the mavericks' rapid turnaround , he would have been dead , and we would have found a way to take the franchise from him colangelo , who also owned the arizona diamondbacks , said baseball and basketball owners were different breeds basketball is a little more cutting edge , and baseball has been stodgier , he said some people say it s difficult to see him as a baseball owner , but times change , circumstances change and he s done an incredible job in basketball if sam zell , who took tribune public in an 82 billion buyout and needs as much as he can get for the cubs , presents cuban as his choice to mlb owners , dupuy said he would get a fair hearing the fact that he s operated a successful franchise in another league will be taken into account but in truth , owners can reject whomever they want , for cause , like dubious financing or bad associations , or for no stated reason at all baseball faced questions of fairness in 2001 and 2002 when it appeared that selig favored the 660 million purchase of the red sox , fenway park and 80 percent of the new england sports network by john henry s group over two apparently higher bids , one of them by charles f dolan , the chairman of cablevision thomas reilly , the massachusetts attorney general , criticized the process that led to the approval of henry s acquisition when you see how they operate , he said , it s not a pretty sight dupuy insisted last week that there was no manipulation and that only one bid was submitted by the jean r yawkey trust , the red sox' majority owner but he conceded that he was not suggesting that people in baseball were n't cheering for henry to win now , the question is whether baseball s owners will cheer for the fanfriendly cuban , whose independence may clash with selig s consensusdriven rule or will they pray for the trumping of cuban by a lowerprofile , lessloquacious bidder like john canning , a minority owner of the brewers , who did not make the first cut of bidders but could conceivably return if he revises an offer that miscalculated the price of repairs at wrigley the best references i have will come from other nba owners who know what my contributions as a partner are , cuban wrote , adding that multiple nba owners have asked if they could participate in our attempts to purchase the cubs
washington senator needs three breaks to wrest the democratic presidential nomination from senator in the view of her advisers she has to defeat mr obama soundly in next month to buttress her argument that she holds an advantage in big general election states she needs to lead in the total popular vote after the primaries end in june and mrs clinton is looking for some development to shake confidence in mr obama so that superdelegates , leaders and elected officials who are free to decide which candidate to support overturn his lead among the pledged delegates from primaries and caucuses for mrs clinton , all this has seemed something of a long shot since her defeats in february but that shot seems to have grown a little longer despite mrs clinton s lastminute trip to on wednesday , democrats there signaled that they are unlikely to hold a new primary that apparently dashed mrs clinton s hopes of a new showdown in a state she feels she could win , and it left the state s delegates in limbo the inaction in michigan followed a similar collapse of her effort to seek another matchup with mr obama in , where , as in michigan , she won an earlier primary held in violation of party rules without new votes in florida and michigan , it will be that much more difficult for mrs clinton to achieve a majority in the total popular vote in the primary season , narrow mr obama s lead among pledged delegates or build a new wave of momentum mrs clinton s advisers had hoped that the uproar over inflammatory remarks made by mr obama s longtime pastor that has rocked his campaign for a week might lead voters and superdelegates to question whether they really know enough about mr obama to back him although it is still early to judge his success , the speech mr obama delivered on race in philadelphia to address the controversy was well received and praised even by some clinton supporters tad devine , a democratic consultant who is not supporting a candidate , said mrs clinton faced a challenge that although hardly insurmountable was growing tougher almost by the day mr devine said it was critical for her to come out ahead in popular votes , cut into mr obama s lead and raise questions about mr obama s electability to win over superdelegates they are going to have to be flawless in executing the strategy , which achieves the goal of taking away the advantage obama has in pledged delegates and the popular vote , he added any major setback could undercut that goal obama is in the advantageous position the race is certainly not over with 10 contests remaining , mrs clinton trails mr obama by about 150 delegates out of the 2 , 025 needed to secure the nomination if there is a road to victory for mrs clinton , it is a fairly narrow one her chief strategist , mark penn , said the campaign believed that when the primary voting was done , mrs clinton would have a lead in the overall popular vote , that mr obama s lead in delegates would be relatively narrow and that polls would show her in a stronger position than mr obama victories in contests where she is strong or competitive like pennsylvania , west virginia , puerto rico and , perhaps , oregon and indiana could give her a burst of energy no less important , the campaign hopes that mr obama will have been battered by five rough weeks that raise questions about his past , including the pastor s incendiary comments , that would underscore mrs clinton s warning to democrats that they were rallying around someone who was untested and unvetted the superdelegates are not going to really decide until june , mr penn said he s just going through a vetting and testing process that did n't happen a year ago and is now happening the whole vetting and testing process will make a big difference it is in the interest of mrs clinton s campaign to portray the contest as being highly competitive her campaign is intent on combating mr obama s efforts to pick off superdelegates and it is increasingly concerned that any sign that the window is closing could lead a democrat like al gore or speaker nancy pelosi to step in and urge democrats to back mr obama in the interest of unity in truth , in interviews , mrs clinton s advisers said that task was tough and growing tougher and that the critical questions were what would happen with florida and michigan and the possibility of developments involving mr obama s relationship with his spiritual adviser , the rev the fight over florida and michigan is just partly about delegates victories in new primaries in those states are among the only realistic ways for mrs clinton to erase mr obama s advantage in the total popular vote mr obama s edge over mrs clinton is 700 , 000 votes out of 26 million cast , excluding caucuses and the disputed florida and michigan results about 12 million people are eligible to vote in the remaining contests aides to the two candidates said even with the best possible showing for mrs clinton in the states ahead , it was hard to see how she could pass mr obama without michigan and florida she received 300 , 000 more votes than mr obama in florida in january in michigan , where none of her major opponents were on the ballot , she drew 62 , 220 more votes than the rest of the opponents mrs clinton s advisers said that absent some deal to seat the delegates from those states , the campaign would still argue that the popular vote in michigan and florida be counted the popular vote is the popular vote for all to see , said harold ickes , a senior adviser to mrs clinton for people to claim that because the delegates were n't seated you ca n't count the popular vote seems somewhat goofy yet that could be a tough argument to make none of the candidates campaigned in michigan or florida , and mr obama s name did not appear on the michigan ballot finally , mrs clinton s aides hope that disclosures about mr obama s past like the one involving mr wright could give superdelegates' pause mr devine said he thought that at least in terms of democratic primary voters mr obama had turned the furor to his advantage with his speech on race obama , confronted by an issue that was boiling , seemed to wade into it with a speech that was in many ways profound , mr devine said as a result , now these people who were so interested and awakened by his candidacy are back with him again instead of this being a setback , it becomes an opportunity but the audience now is as much the democratic superdelegates , who are especially attuned to politics and questions of electability in the fall , as it is rankandfile voters mrs clinton s advisers said they had spent recent days making the case to wavering superdelegates that mr obama s association with mr wright would doom their party in the general election that argument could be mrs clinton s last hope for winning this contest
all jokes are pratfalls , really , whether it s a clownish slip on a banana peel or a bon mot by oscar wilde humor , at its core , pivots on enduring or inflicting embarrassment yet it s hard to think of anything truly mortifying in an age of commercials , colonoscopies televised live , weightloss reality shows , presidential primary candidates who admit to adultery and a vice presidential nominee with a pregnant , unwed teenage daughter and that s the burden that weighs on classic television comedies every new season brings more reality shows and dramas , while traditional halfhour comedies dwindle , an endangered species there are lots of reasons , including competition from comedy channels on cable and the internet , but a fundamental one is that network sitcoms are still seeking broad appeal at a time when writers can no longer rely on common values or widely shared forms of inhibition comedians try to stretch the limits of humor by turning ever lewder and more offensive about gender , race , infirmity and sexuality but when sensitivities harden and taboos are so easily tumbled , it s tougher and tougher to find fresh forms of adultsonly material comedy reverts to a childlike mix of silliness and bathroom crudity the humor of bodily dysfunctions that led to movies like there s something about mary , by the farrelly brothers , meet the parents and knocked up now it has prompted cbs to adapt grossout humor for the small screen with a new sitcom , worst week the pilot , which has its premiere on monday , is based on the british show the worst week of my life , but it is also so deeply indebted to the ben stiller comedy meet the parents that it may disappoint many viewers it s a difficult conceit to sustain week after week , but it s an intriguing experiment for a network that still does very well with more conventional sitcoms two and a half men , after all , is a huge hit for cbs , and it s an updated version of a jerry lewisdean martin farce , a smooth rou \( charlie sheen \) who lives with and torments his doltish , inept brother \( jon cryer \) the humor in worst week is rooted in a ceaseless and escalating cascade of embarrassing mishaps that pile upon its seth rogenish hero , sam \( kyle bornheimer \) , when he and his girlfriend try to tell her disapproving parents that she is pregnant it would be churlish to reveal sam s ordeals in detail , but nudity , vomit and urine flow freely as in any situation comedy , from i love lucy to scrubs , the lead character is a wellmeaning , clumsy victim of colossal ill fortune or bad judgment the difference is that here the embarrassment is mostly physical , not social , dysfunction hbo is experimenting with the opposite end of the same spectrum with a new animated comedy in the school of south park and family guy , entitled the life times of tim , a hero who is impassive in the face of cringeinducing failure when embarrassing things happen to tim his girlfriend and her parents come home to find him with a streetwalker his coworkers make him pretend he was drunk at a bachelor party and raped by a homeless man he is meek , phlegmatic and registers faint dismay , not full indignation he is a man pecked and picked upon by fate and his own stupidity , but his offkilter restraint is the funniest part of a show that is laden with all the obscenity and feces jokes that adult cartoons allow worst week and the life times of tim try to exploit the one form of humor that has n't been lavishly explored by network television since its golden age from sid caesar on , comedies have reveled in all the awkward moments and social misunderstandings that have veined comedy since aristophanes even jokes about sex and race are not new in a 1965 episode of the dick van dyke show laura and rob accidentally dye their hands black while making a costume for their son the same night that rob is to speak to an interracial audience at an awards ceremony it was seinfeld that toppled a lot of sitcom taboos , including one of the toughest , in a famous 1992 episode , the contest , in which jerry and his friends compete to see who can abstain from masturbation the longest censors at the time required euphemisms , which turned the signature phrase , master of my domain , into a muchused expression in real life friends and will grace followed suit nowadays all kinds of sitcoms , from how i met your mother and the new adventures of old christine to scrubs , 30 rock and my name is earl , make light of drug use , drinking , casual sex , venereal disease , vomit , flatulence and masturbation worst week merely has more but even those shows do n't come anywhere near the crude , infantile audacity of foreign television comedies american versions tend to water down the harshest material even the office on nbc , one of the better adaptations , is gentler than ricky gervais s original version for the bbc nbc had to reshoot parts of kath kim , an americanization of australia s biggest comedy hit , and squeamishness may well be part of the reason a few animated shows like south park and the life times of tim , are brutally callous , but they are cartoons , so the most cruel and offensive jokes are uttered by animated characters cartoons protect reallife actors from having to pronounce the most virulent expressions of political incorrectness british comedians , from benny hill and monty python to mr gervais , have fewer inhibitions \( though crossdressing could be one way for british comedians to stay removed from their own cruelty \) little britain usa , which begins on hbo on sept 28 , is a madeforamerica version of an exquisitely puerile british comedy , little britain the export version is tailored to touch those last raw nerves in american culture the opening sketch has a british tourist in florida rise from his wheelchair , walk over to the hotel pool and urinate , spraying a woman swimming laps the show s creators and stars , matt lucas and david walliams , often dress in drag to impersonate all kinds of absurd characters , none more nutty than mr lucas as marjorie dawes , an insensitive weightloss instructor \( her segment is introduced by a narrator who says , there are more fat people in america than there are people \) rosie o 'donnell plays herself as the new spokewoman for fatfighters , a weightloss organization , who is invited to speak to marjorie s group of obese americans marjorie asks her guest , are you fat because you 're a lesbian , or are you a lesbian because you 're fat \? only larry david in curb your enthusiasm on hbo and sarah silverman on her comedy central show have as much nerve and deadpan social insensitivity they have learned that the most daring comedies are not the ones that focus on unpleasant facts of life but the ones that showcase unpleasant people some new comedies try to be as outr , but none of them are as clever forbidden territory in our society keeps shrinking sometimes , it s wiser to let the land lie fallow
as we marked five years of the war in iraq , i remembered my own milestone on march 25 , 2003 , just days into the war , men dressed in military uniforms came into my room at the palestine hotel in baghdad and took me and four other westerners to saddam hussein s most feared prison , abu ghraib no one ever explained exactly why , but through the interrogations it was clear that they had been looking for spies we spent the next eight days there , stripped of our belongings , in prison uniforms , at night listening terrified to beatings and bombings , during the day trying to cope with the strange mix of fear and boredom we were kept in separate cells , built out of cinder block and with a concrete grill as the only window to the outside we would sleep on a blanket on the concrete floor , which offered little shelter from the sandstorm whirling through through the bars of the cell door would come food three times a day , in a plastic bowl , delivered by guards who knew no english and seemed to know little about us on april 1 , we were set free without much explanation , put into a large gmc taxi and driven the 12 hours through the western desert to amman american fighter jets were trailing us in the clear skies overheadthe roads were littered with destroyed buses and cars , and i kept hoping the pilots up there would hold their fire and not take us for fighters the next time i saw the prison , in midapril , it was looted and smoldering american troops had rolled into baghdad a week prior , toppled the saddam statue in firdos square and sent the regime fleeing i found my cell and saw my name where i had scratched it on the wall i had thought that if i was to be killed , someone might find my name and understand what had happened to me i also found a key to a cell stamped into the heavy brass was the manufacturer s name , folger adam co , joliet , ill as i left , a shepherd led his herd into the lush green prison yard sticking out from underneath rocks outside the compound was an arm still wearing a wristwatch in the days before baghdad fell , three deserters and three civilians had been killed there , locals explained their executioners had left them for the wild dogs roaming the compound some days later i visited the cemetery close to the prison i was following a story about iraqis trying to identify their loved ones as the skeletal remains of former inmates were being exhumed making my way back past the prison , i stopped to photograph a crowd digging newer bodies out of shallow graves just outside my former cell block i recognized the stocky prisoner from across the hall , now bloated and muddy i realized these bodies were those of our former block mates the ones that hadn t been released in time the stench and the heat made me dizzy but the image that remains most vivid is the one of 13yearold nihad jewad i was documenting life at a saudi medical field hospital that had been set up in baghdad i was in a tent ward , talking to a young boy with burns to his face , when three men burst in carrying a bloodied teenager on a stretcher i spun around and shot a couple of frames as doctors and nurses struggled to save his life , his older brother , standing outside in a bloodstained white shirt , gave me permission to keep photographing he told me that the boy had accidentally set off a cluster bomb that had fallen in the soccer field close to their home nihad never regained consciousness after an intense 20 minutes on the operating table , the doctors quietly laid down their instruments his family did not have a car to take his body to an iraqi hospital to get a death certificate , required by iraqi law i volunteered my minivan we wedged the stretcher in as we weaved through the heavy baghdad traffic , all of us were crying the boy s father the driver , yahia the stranger who had helped carry the stretcher me , the observer from a faraway land as the sun set over the abu ghraib cemetery , i stood in the distance and watched the family bury its youngest son he had been dead for less than 5 hours i kept coming back to iraq over the years , and have taken thousands of pictures of people there i remember their faces i remember their stories but none as clearly as nihad , the boy i never met

sacramento al harrington loves to shoot and loves offense this could explain why harrington has not stopped smiling for three weeks harrington has played for four teams and six coaches in his nba career , none of whom seemed to fully appreciate his passion for flinging the ball at the rim , anytime and from anywhere but in d'antoni , the coach of the , harrington has found a basketball soulmate harrington needed just nine games to become the knicks' best scoring weapon and one of d'antoni s most trusted disciples d'antoni has given harrington the freedom to flex every offensive muscle in return , harrington has given the knicks a fantastic jolt through friday , he was averaging a teamhigh 247 points and 8 rebounds since coming to the knicks on nov 21 in a trade for jamal crawford he led the team in scoring five times , including a 39point outburst last week against the nets and he has not been shy harrington had taken 179 shots in nine games 60 more than the next closest knick \( quentin richardson \) d'antoni is not complaining i think it s a good thing , d'antoni said saturday as the knicks opened a threegame trip with a game against the sacramento kings i think he s playing very well and i think his percentages are up there , if i'm not mistaken despite a few messy games after he first arrived , harrington was shooting a crisp 464 from the field and 377 from 3point range in an offense that encourages shooting early and often , harrington can seemingly do no wrong he s just so multiskilled that he s going to get a lot of shots , d'antoni said he can put it on the floor , he can do everything shoot 3 s , post up so he should get a lot those are words that harrington has longed to hear throughout his winding career with indiana , atlanta and golden state although he played for the warriors' don nelson , another unconventional , offensiveminded coach , harrington found that the rules there varied from player to player like i tell everybody , nellie ball is totally different than this , harrington said , calling nelson s system erratic and all over the place , with frequent isolation plays for favored players this is totally different , harrington said of d'antoni s system it really just relies on guys' feel for the game and guys realizing who s hot and who s not and just playing off each other it should be noted , of course , that harrington and nelson clashed so badly that harrington asked for a trade in april in the first week of this season , nelson mocked harrington outright , saying , he thinks he s a superstar in d'antoni , harrington has a coach with a softer touch and a more generous demeanor , which is why he unflinchingly says this is the happiest he has been as an nba player the most fun by far , he said by far it s just fun to play in this type of a system and to play for that man when you play with somebody that s just so positive , i 've never seen nothing like it before i 've never really seen a coach really not get angry at his guys and beat guys down i 've never seen that it is not that d'antoni never gets angry \( indeed , there are times when it seems as if his head may explode midtirade \) , but he never berates his players for , say , a bad shot his body language tells you when you took a bad one , harrington said but the thing about it is that he does n't put that in your head so that now you become less aggressive although he had taken at least 20 shots in five games , harrington insists he does exercise discretion i got enough experience that i know what s a good shot , what s a bad shot , how to create for other guys , he said but he adds that passing and making teammates better is my new challenge still , the ball keeps finding harrington open at the 3point arc or in a mismatch in the post , and he is not about to squander a scoring opportunity that s always been my nature , he said i 've been in situations where i could n't show it all the time , but now i'm in a position where i can put it all on display and i'm just trying to take advantage of it

the throwback it all seemed too good to be true which of course it was which of course is a virtual guarantee of sports in america , eventual cannibalization with overkill because it was during the sojourn in omaha that i found out that rosenblatt stadium will get razed and relocated in favor of something that will be newer but impossible to conceive as better no atmosphere no funk no fun that s what city officials are doing here in having recently approved a new home for the college world series near the glass and concrete of the city s qwest center arena they call it progress they feared that without a new stadium , the ncaa would have pulled the series out of omaha regardless of a storied 58year relationship they wanted a longterm commitment of 25 years instead of the usual five never underestimate the ncaa when it comes to exerting its iron will in ways subtle or not so subtle \( more about the chokehold and handcuffs later \) but whatever the justification , it is still a tragedy of overindulgence buzz bissinger , takedown at the ballgame the wild side darwin did more in one lifetime than most of us could hope to accomplish in two but his giantism has had an odd and problematic consequence it s a tendency for everyone to refer back to him why darwin was wrong about x was darwin wrong about y \? what darwin did n't know about z these are common headlines in newspapers and magazines , in both the biological and the general literature then there are the words darwinism \( sometimes used with the prefix neo \) , darwinist \( ditto \) , darwinian why is this a problem \? because it s all grossly misleading it suggests that darwin was the beginning and the end , the alpha and omega , of evolutionary biology , and that the subject has n't changed much in the 149 years since the publication of the origin he was n't , and it has olivia judson , let s get rid of darwinism think again miltonists are like avis rentacar they know they 're second \( or their man is \) and they try harder nigel smith s most recent book is titled is milton better than shakespeare \? the title is a publisher s teaser and the answer to the question \( as smith knows \) is , no , he s different and the difference is that after reading or seeing a shakespeare play you want to sit down and discuss the glories of shakespeare , whereas after reading a milton poem you want to sit down and discuss the ideas and imperatives he has thrust at you shakespeare does many voices but identifies with none of them \( his , as keats said , is a negative capability \) he s hard to find , as his wouldbe biographers well know milton has many characters , but they all speak with one voice his stanley fish , happy birthday , milton heading home the fun part of reading the fan mail i 'd received was being able to paint a picture of my entire career through the eyes of others people remembered the most subtle moments there was the story of a man who was wearing a halo following an automobile accident i threw a ball to him before the game in an effort to lift his spirits , and after overshooting him i went back and threw him another baseball , this one landing softly in his hands his wife took the time to write me a thank you letter there was the 9yearold who told me to make sure i signed his baseball card by hand , demanding , write it yourself do n't stamp it there was my selfappointed jewish mother , who was upset that the phillies were n't selling jerseys with my name on the back not only did she write me , but she photocopied her letter and sent it to the phillies front office my jerseys eventually did end up in the gift stores , despite the fact that the photocopy of her letter intended for the front office ended up in my spam mail closet \( shhh do n't tell her \) doug glanville , signed , sealed , delivered finally domestic disturbances the winkwink excuse for john mccain s hypocrisy , for the contradictions between his goodguy persona and notsogoodguy politics , is that he has to hold his nose and keep his bread buttered with the religious right another explanation is that , like our current goodguy president , mccain is a man blinded by ideology in this case , by that roughrider rugged individualism thing that he so admires and that is so inimical to real , functional gender equality or it could be something else , something much more basic at work , something that , i think , showed very clearly in mccain s expression last week , as he fought , more or less successfully , to suppress a joke and the naughtiest bit of a giggle after reporters demanded a response to remarks by carly fiorina in which the clearly unscripted surrogate had complained about the unfairness of health insurers reimbursing viagra but not birth control you could see it in his mouth , in his eyes as , for a full five seconds , mccain worked to remake a face that said , give me a break , will you \?

if you want to know how the really began its journey of harmony , as the chinese call its current relay , if you want to see why the torch has had to pass through a human obstacle course composed of protesters , swat teams and police in san francisco , paris and london , then do not look to tibet s grievances against china look to the opening of s 1938 film , olympia in that homage to berlin s 1936 olympic games the origins of this ritual are revealed never before had a lighted torch been relayed from a greek temple in olympia to an athletic competition , let alone by thousands of runners trying to keep it from being extinguished so riefenstahl creates the myth the greeks never got around to telling , creating a filmic counterpart to the opening of wagner s ring , in which an entire world gradually emerges from elemental fragments the camera begins by surveying a misty landscape of ruins , of shattered pillars and overgrown grasses restless and circling , the camera reveals a greek temple standing amid the stones heads and the bodies of greek statues appear in an eerie erotic landscape under the sensuous caresses of riefenstahl s lens , a naked discus thrower comes to life , polished stone becoming muscular flesh another athlete prepares to throw a javelin , its trajectory leading toward a bowl of fire lighting the olympic torch , another nude acolyte triumphantly raises it aloft like wagner s siegfried displaying his sword humanity is given its purpose the relay begins the torch is conveyed from one bearer to the next and ends in berlin at a 110 , 000seat stadium where it ignites an altar of flame through shimmering heat the sun itself can be seen , vibrating in sympathy and salutes the cheering crowds this passing of the torch thus demonstrates a lineage of inheritance a historical relay making nazi germany the living heir to ancient greece a claim was being staked this claim was not unrelated to the very existence of the olympic games as nigel spivey shows in his book the ancient olympics , many different traditions , myths and cults fed the greek games but the founding of the modern olympics was far more straightforward a german scholar , j j winckelmann \( 17171768 \) proposed excavating olympia , the ancient site of the greek games the honor was eventually left to a 19thcentury german scholar , ernst curtius it was a frenchman , however , baron pierre de coubertin , who founded the modern international olympics with the first games in 1896 , explicitly declaring that the french should reconstitute what the germans had exhumed the implied rivalry was more bloodily enacted in the battlefield beginning in 1914 , two years before germany was supposed to host the games for the first time then , after its defeat , germany was banned from the olympics in 1920 and 1924 so hosting the games in berlin in 1936 was a kind of restitution , like the one the nazis sought on a grander scale , undoing the humiliating postworld war i penalties \( germany had also just remilitarized the rhineland \) but hitler wanted the torch fully in german hands he authorized a resumption of german excavations at olympia while an organizer of the 1936 games , carl diem , came up with the idea of the relay in 1940 , hitler told the nazi architect albert speer , the olympic games will take place in tokyo but thereafter they will take place in germany for all time to come speer was to build a 400 , 000seat stadium in nuremberg as the olympics' permanent home \( an exhibition about the 1936 games will open at the united states holocaust memorial museum on april 25 \) the , of course , offers a slightly different account of the torch relay \( see \) the olympic museum in lausanne , switzerland , explains that the torch alludes to the positive values that man has always associated with fire , its relay transmitting a message of peace and friendship amongst peoples but the olympics still preserves the selfloving aura of the nazi myth whiterobed priestesses in the ruined temple of hera \( all actresses of course \) light the torch using focused rays of the sun backup flames insure that the fire s lineage remains intact in case the main torch is temporarily extinguished \( as it was this year \) the purity of the flame , the olympics brochure piously explains , is guaranteed by the way it is lit using the sun s rays it was partly in opposition to such fetishistic reverence that in 1956 , as the torch made its way to the games in melbourne , australia , a student interloper made a model out of a chair leg and a plumpudding can stuffed with a burning pair of underpants and solemnly presented the flaming symbol to the mayor of sydney but more recently the relay has needed no help in attaining kitsch and stunt in 1976 the flame was used to send an electronic pulse by satellite from athens to ottawa , where a programmed laser lighted a torch in 1996 the passing of the flame took place between two parachute jumpers in 2000 a flaming torch \( presumably protected \) was carried under water at the great barrier reef now , despite china s attempt to put a smiley face on the torch relay light the passion , share the dream says the chinese web site \( see \) the tibetan protests have laid bare its nationalist essence there are reasons why the chinese wanted a route that invoked glory \( by touching everest s peak \) and power \( by passing through taiwan \) of course in 1936 the relay reflected a more ominous threat the torch was carried through salonika , greece sofia , bulgaria belgrade , yugoslavia budapest and vienna , and was welcomed along the way not by extensive protests but with pronazi demonstrations a prescient editorial in the new york times , sensing the drumbeats of war , called the torch s route a strategic highway that traced the line of the german drang nach osten the drive to the east that the kaiser sought in the first world war , and which hitler was soon to put into practice since then the torch s routes , like the games themselves , have regularly been subject to disruption and conflict the defense of the olympic enterprise is that the universal ideals of good sportsmanship and fairmindedness provide a means to transcend national difference but the history suggests that sentimentality is being slathered over rituals and practice that proclaim something quite different the greeks themselves were more forthright they believed , mr spivey suggests , that all games were war games at a conference at yale this month about greek hoplite warfare in which a wide array of greek citizenry supposedly maneuvered together in vast , linked phalanxes one hypothesis was that this reflected a revolutionary view of an interconnected citizenry in this light all war games also became social games at any rate all games were as serious as war , and none were about the brotherhood of all mankind perhaps , then , pretense should be eliminated the olympic games should simply acknowledge that they reflect wars fought by other means not a pleasant thought , but perhaps closer to the truth than the perspective of avery brundage , the fifth

devised
when i heard the news last week that the belgian company inbev wanted to buy anheuserbusch , i immediately called my bartender from france who 'll save budweiser \? i wanted to know mccain or obama \? i have n't heard either one give a position on that , moe said , a little groggily it was , after all , still morning in kansas city , mo besides , you drink high life moe , wake up ! i ranted it s my right to hate budweiser because it s from st louis , not belgium plus , i actually like the beer i 've probably downed more bud than any other single fluid in my life moe responded to this claim with a concerned , professional silence besides water , i added , quickly like moe , i and my fellow missourians have spent the spring in a deep political slumber our primary , way back in february , was exciting in retrospect , it seems that if barack obama had n't squeaked out a latenight , 14 percentage point victory in missouri , he might not be the nominee but since then , neither he nor john mccain has managed to find an issue , or even a jingle , that sticks no more no child left behind \? universal health care for almost everybody \? stop the war next century \? none of these have much of a ring even the war protesters who picket along my jogging route in kansas city seemed to lose steam , their numbers dwindling into single digits , their signs no blood for oil ! weathered and aged strange as it sounds , this budweiser story may liven us up sure , colorado s coors and milwaukee s miller were swallowed up by foreign companies but we 're talking the king of beers here the bud bowl the clydesdales the cardinals and that classic jingle when you say budweiser , you 've said it all now , suddenly , it seems as if inbev can buy it all and end anheuserbusch s 148 years of independence for a measly 43 euros or so a share of course , with the dollar near historic lows , those measly euros are worth about 65 this simple bit of math has crystallized the meaning of a year s worth of cable news graphics the week in war , the housing bubble , the credit crunch , the oil crisis and the dollar s slide the result \? america s cheap my brief visit to france where my wife , a french professor , is leading a student studyabroad program made this abundantly clear want a coke at a cafe \? that s 450 four slices of ham \? 5 pair of chuck taylor high tops \? try 90 missourians may not care about the price of tennis shoes in france but they do care about beer so when the candidates focus on missouri in the fall , we might be asking mr mccain and mr obama some new questions like how they intend to strengthen the dollar or where spuds mackenzie went according to the stock analysts quoted in the st louis postdispatch , anheuserbusch will likely be europeanowned by then the deal was predictable , one said they were ripe to a beer drinker , that word ripe sounds a lot like skunked , no pleasant association for the inventor of the born on date still , talking to moe made me thirsty , so i headed for the nearest brasserie and plunked down 750 for a miller , no bud available then , gingerly , with my wife s help , i hung some new lyrics on an old , happy tune  now there s a jingle that missouri voters wo n't soon forget
updated 4 17 , 7 30 am let s try an experiment i d love some help from you in dissecting what president bush said wednesday about climate change , united states policy , and international actions the complete text of his remarks follows , taken from a transcript released by the white house i ll insert footnotestyle references from specific passages to reader comments as they come in \( please specify which paragraph or phrase you re discussing \) it may get messy , but it could be instructive i m going to start the ball rolling with some annotations below in brackets i ll be adding more as time permits remarks by the president on climate change rose garden , 2 45 pm edt the president thank you welcome thank you all for coming i particularly want to thank members of my cabinet for joining me here today in the rose garden tomorrow represents representatives of the world s major economies will gather in paris to discuss climate change here in washington , the debate about climate change is intensifying today , i ll share some views on this important issue to advance discussions both at home and abroad a revkin mr bush almost always calls climate change an issue and not a problem i know about political issues i know about environmental or energy problems what is an environmental issue \? climate change involves complicated science and generates vigorous debate many are concerned about the effect of climate change on our environment many are concerned about the effect of climate change policies on our economy i share these concerns , and i believe they can be sensibly reconciled comment 10 , on , is simply hilarious  comment 13 proposes that the president s concern about humancaused global warming is   over the past seven years , my administration has taken a rational , balanced approach to these serious challenges we believe we need to protect our environment we believe we need to strengthen our energy security we believe we need to grow our economy and we believe the only way to achieve these goals is through continued advances in technology  ar wording like the only way is bound to greatly vex the many experts i hear from comes to mind who have repeatedly demonstrated how easy it is to make deep cuts in the co2 emissions from a building or business at a profit then there are all those folks who ve chosen to telecommute , mayors pursuing traffic management , and on and on is there no behavior change mr bush feels is worth throwing into the mix along with better solar panels or nuclear plants \? so we ve pursued a series of policies aimed at encouraging the rise of innovative as well as more costeffective clean energy technologies that can help america and developing nations reduce greenhouse gases , reduce our dependence on oil , and keep our economies vibrant and strong for decades to come i have put our nation on a path to slow , stop , and eventually reverse the growth of our greenhouse gas emissions in 2002 , i announced our first step to reduce america s greenhouse gas intensity by 18 percent through 2012  i m pleased to say that we remain on track to meet this goal even as our economy has grown 17 percent ar quite a few analysts have shown pretty convincingly that the reduction in energy and emissions intensity over the last seven years has basically followed an anyway path , meaning it was not a function of new policies or leadership or the like the same goes for are there conflicting studies \? as we take these steps here at home , we re also working internationally on a rational path to addressing global climate change when i took office seven years ago , we faced a problem a number of nations around the world were preparing to implement the flawed approach of kyoto protocol in 1997 , the united states senate took a look at the kyoto approach and passed a resolution opposing this approach by a 95 to nothing vote the kyoto protocol would have required the united states to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions the impact of this agreement , however , would have been to limit our economic growth and to shift american jobs to other countries while allowing major developing nations to increase their emissions countries like china and india are experiencing rapid economic growth and that s good for their people and it s good for the world this also means that they are emitting increasingly large quantities of greenhouse gases which has consequences for the entire global climate so the united states has launched and the g8 has embraced a new process that brings together the countries responsible for most of the world s emissions we re working toward a climate agreement that includes the meaningful participation of every major economy and gives none a free ride ar i keep hearing , again and again , that without help meaning money from countries , like the united states , that have built their own economies on fossil fuels for a century or two how does this square wit the no free ride approach \? comment 17  in support of this process , and based on technology advances and strong new policy , it is now time for the us to look beyond 2012 and to take the next step we ve shown that we can slow emissions growth today , i m announcing a new national goal to stop the growth of us greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 to reach this goal , we will pursue an economywide strategy that builds on the solid foundation that we have in place as part of this strategy , we worked with congress to pass energy legislation that specifies a new fuel economy standard of 35 miles per gallon by 2020 , and requires fuel producers to supply at least 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2022 ar we and others have written reams about the dubious carbondioxide benefits of biofuel choices that are available now or in the near term why are biofuels included here \? what is the anticipated climate benefit of those fuels \? about biofuels this should provide an incentive for shifting to a new generation of fuels like cellulosic ethanol that will reduce concerns about food prices and the environment we also mandated new objectives for the coming decade to increase the efficiency of lighting and appliances we re helping states achieve their goals for increasing renewable power and building code efficiency by sharing new technologies and providing tax incentives ar my sense is some governors would take issue with this an awful lot of states so which is it , helping , hampering \?  we re working to implement a new international agreement that will accelerate cuts in potent hcfc emissions taken together , these landmark actions will prevent billions of metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from entering the atmosphere these objectives are backed by a combination of new marketbased regulations , new government incentives , and new funding for technology research we ve provided billions of dollars for next generation nuclear energy technologies along with the private sector , we ve invested billions more to research , develop and commercially deploy renewable fuels , hydrogen fuel cells , advanced batteries , and other technologies to enable a new generation of vehicles and more reliable renewable power systems comment 36 from earlier post provides  in 2009 alone , the government and the private sector plan to dedicate nearly a billion dollars to clean coal research and development ar clean coal \? the administration s definition , i think , does not include capturing carbon dioxide and storing it even if it did , the am i missing something \? our incentives for power production from wind and solar energy have helped to more than quadruple its use we have worked with congress to make available more than 40 billion in loan guarantees to support investments that will avoid , reduce , or sequester greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants and our farmers can now compete for substantial new conservation incentives to restore land and forests in ways that help cut greenhouse gases we re doing a lot to protect this environment we ve laid a solid foundation for further progress but these measures while these measures will bring us a long way to achieving our new goal , we ve got to do more in the power generation sector to reach our 2025 goal , we ll need to more rapidly slow the growth of power sector greenhouse gas emissions so they peak within 10 to 15 years , and decline thereafter by doing so , we ll reduce emission levels in the power sector well below where they were projected to be when we first announced our climate strategy in 2002 there are a number of ways to achieve these reductions , but all responsible approaches depend on accelerating the development and deployment of new technologies as we approach this challenge , we face a growing problem here at home some courts are taking laws written more than 30 years ago to primarily address local and regional environmental effects and applying them to global climate change the clean air act , the endangered species act , and the national environmental policy act were never meant to regulate global climate for example , under a supreme court decision last year , the clean air act could be applied to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles this would automatically trigger regulation under the clean air act of greenhouse gases all across our economy leading to what energy and commerce committee chairman john dingell last week called , a glorious mess   if these laws are stretched beyond their original intent , they could override the programs congress just adopted , and force the government to regulate more than just power plant emissions they could also force the government to regulate smaller users and producers of energy from schools and stores to hospitals and apartment buildings this would make the federal government act like a local planning and zoning board , have crippling effects on our entire economy decisions with such farreaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges such decisions should be opened debated openly such decisions should be made by the elected representatives of the people they affect the american people deserve an honest assessment of the costs , benefits and feasibility of any proposed solution this is the approach congress properly took last year on mandatory policies that will reduce emissions from cars and trucks , and improve the efficiency of lighting and appliances this year , congress will soon be considering additional legislation that will affect global climate change i believe that congressional debate should be guided by certain core principles and a clear appreciation that there is a wrong way and a right way to approach reducing greenhouse gas emissions bad legislation would impose tremendous costs on our economy and on american families without accomplishing the important climate change goals we share the wrong way is to raise taxes , duplicate mandates , or demand sudden and drastic emissions cuts that have no chance of being realized and every chance of hurting our economy the right way is to set realistic goals for reducing emissions consistent with advances in technology , while increasing our energy security and ensuring our economy can continue to prosper and grow the wrong way is to sharply increase gasoline prices , home heating bills for american families and the cost of energy for american businesses ar mckinsey , the consulting company , found there are there ll be costs , too , for sure , in some sectors , but  the right way is to adopt policies that spur investment in the new technologies needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions more costeffectively in the longer term without placing unreasonable burdens on american consumers and workers in the short term the wrong way is to jeopardize our energy and economic security by abandoning nuclear power and our nation s huge reserves of coal the right way is to promote more emissionfree nuclear power and encourage the investments necessary to produce electricity from coal without releasing carbon into the air ar more on the administration s   the wrong way is to unilaterally impose regulatory costs that put american businesses at a disadvantage with their competitors abroad which would simply drive american jobs overseas and increase emissions there the right way is to ensure that all major economies are bound to take action and to work cooperatively with our partners for a fair and effective international climate agreement the wrong way is to threaten punitive tariffs and protectionist barriers , start a carbonbased global trade war , and to stifle the diffusion of new technologies the right way is to work to make advanced technology affordable and available in the developing world by lowering trade barriers , creating a global free market for clean energy technologies , and enhancing international cooperation and technology investment we must all recognize that in the long run , new technologies are the key to addressing climate change but in the short run , they can be more expensive and that is why i believe part of any solution means reforming today s complicated mix of incentives to make the commercialization and use of new , lower emission technologies more competitive today we have different incentives for different technologies from nuclear power , to clean coal , to wind and solar energy what we need to do is consolidate them into a single , expanded program with the following features comment 7 broaches the unmentioned issue of an incentive pulling in the wrong direction \?  first , the incentive should be carbonweighted to make lower emission power sources less expensive relative to higher emissions sources and it should take into account our nation s energy security needs second , the incentive should be technologyneutral because the government should not be picking winners and losers in this emerging market  ar one glaring problem is that the government is already picking winners and losers , often based on political geography more than what technologies hold the most promise as matt wald and i wrote last year , and far from solar , for example and this doesn t count hidden subsidies for oil and coal that many environmental groups and renewableenergy investors decry  third , the incentive should be longlasting it should provide a positive and reliable market signal not only for the investment in a technology , but also for the investments in domestic manufacturing capacity and infrastructure that will help lower costs and scale up availability even with strong new incentives , many new technologies face regulatory and political barriers to pave the way for a new generation of nuclear power plants , we must provide greater certainty on issues from licensing to responsible management of spent fuel comment 9 wonders if this means  the promise of carbon capture and storage depends on new pipelines and liability rules largescale renewable energy installations are most likely to be built in sparsely populated areas which will require advanced , interstate transmission systems to deliver this power to major population centers if we re serious about confronting climate change , then we have to be serious about addressing these obstacles if we fully implement our new strong laws , adhere to the principles that i ve outlined , and adopt appropriate incentives , we will put america on an ambitious new track for greenhouse gas reductions the growth in emissions will slow over the next decade , stop by 2025 , and begin to reverse thereafter , so long as technology continues to advance our new 2025 goal marks a major step forward in america s efforts to address climate change yet even if we reduced our own emissions to zero tomorrow , we would not make a meaningful dent in solving the problem without concerted action by all major economies so in connection with the major economies process we launched , we re urging each country to develop its own national goals and plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions like many other countries , america s national plan will be a comprehensive blend of market incentives and regulations to reduce emissions by encouraging clean and efficient energy technologies we re willing to include this plan in a binding international agreement , so long as our fellow major economies are prepared to include their plans in such an agreement we recognize that different nations will design different strategies , with goals and policies that reflect their unique energy resources and economic circumstances but we can only make progress if their plans will make a real difference as well ar once again , the old surfaces you first , sir i m not sure how that stalemate breaks  the next step in the major economies process is a meeting this week in paris and i want to thank my friend , president sarkozy , for hosting it there , representatives of all participating nations will lay the groundwork for a leaders meeting in conjunction with the g8 summit in july our objective is to come together on a common approach that will contribute to the negotiations under the un framework convention of global climate once the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 this approach must be environmentally effective and economically sustainable to be effective , this approach will this approach will require commitments by all major economies to slow , stop , and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gas emissions to be economically sustainable , this approach must foster the economic growth necessary to pay for investments in new technology and to raise living standards we must help countries in the developing world gain access to the technologies , as well as financing that will enable them to take a lower carbon path to economic growth and then there will be the major economies leader meeting in july that s the one i ll be going to where we will seek agreement on a longterm global goal for emissions reductions , as well as an agreement on how national plans will be part of the post2012 approach we ll also seek to increase international cooperation among private firms and governments in key sectors such as power generation , auto manufacturing , renewable fuels , and aluminum and steel we will work toward the creation of an international clean technology fund that will help finance lowemissions energy projects in the developing world we ll call on all nations to help spark a global clean energy revolution by agreeing immediately to eliminate trade barriers on clean energy goods and services the strategy i have laid out today shows faith in the ingenuity and enterprise of the american people and that s a resource that will never run out ar this sure sounds like a riff on being america s greatest renewable resource i m confident that with sensible and balanced policies from washington , american innovators and entrepreneurs will pioneer a new generation of technology that improves our environment , strengthens our economy , and continues to amaze the world thanks for coming \( applause \) there are more explorations of this sort out in blogworld dave roberts at grist has done his own critique of the speech i ll be adding more examples as i find them please alert us to anything else of this sort out there
in his mission to reinvigorate the , peter gelb , who completed his second season as general manager on saturday night , has inaugurated outreach campaigns and digitalmedia ventures that are the envy of the opera world there have been the enormously popular live highdefinition transmissions of broadcasts to movie theaters worldwide , and the met s lively 24hour station on sirius satellite radio mr gelb has proved a master of marketing and drawn highprofile directors from film and theater into the house it has all been exciting it has also been expensive as the wall street journal reported last month , the met s operating budget has grown more than 21 percent in two years , to a projected 2683 million , and the company is drawing down nearly 65 percent yearly on its endowment mr gelb confirmed on tuesday that this year s deficit will be 6 million to possibly 10 million he added , though , that last year the met had a breakeven budget , and he anticipates another for next year against that background and the national economic downturn , the met has some encouraging boxoffice figures the company sold 88 percent of the house this season , an 113 percent increase from two years ago out of a total of 219 performances , 127 \( 58 percent \) sold out , up from 10 percent in 20056 , s final season as general manager , and 40 percent last season , mr gelb s first the met s transmissions of eight live performances to movie theaters reached 908 , 000 people , more than the total number who attended performances at the house this season \( about 850 , 000 \) the transmissions do not yet earn a profit , but they do pay for themselves , mr gelb said , through ticket sales and rebroadcasts on public television meanwhile , how is the company faring artistically during the gelb era \? from my perspective , having seen most of this season s 28 productions , there was much to be grateful for the orchestra , under s steady leadership , has become so reliably remarkable that met regulars must be careful not to take it for granted and unquestionably the met chorus has thrived under its new chorus master , donald palumbo but as i think back , it is individual performances by singers that stay with me , none more so than the tenor anthony dean griffey s portrayal of the title role in the met s new production of britten s peter grimes singing with exemplary artistry and raw emotion , mr griffey found his own way into the daunting role of grimes , fully conveying that reclusive fisherman s instability and violent streak while revealing the wounded child within this was an overdue personal triumph for a selfless artist who rose through the ranks of the met and had been underused until now mr griffey s achievement stood out , literally , against the backdrop of john doyle s muchdebated production though mr doyle drew subtle portrayals from the strong cast , the stage was dominated by an imposing black wall meant to evoke the weathered clapboard houses of a fishing village on the east coast of england actually , the production came through better in movie houses and on television the set faded into the background as the cameras focused on the singers given the success and reach of the highdefinition transmissions , will met productions be conceived from the start with cameras in mind \? overlapping peter grimes was the met s illfated presentation of wagner s tristan und isolde the whole point of reviving dieter dorn s 1999 production was to bring s tristan and s isolde together for the first time but illnesses caused either one or the other artist to miss the first five of six performances ms voigt sang isolde opposite four tristans and had not a single stage rehearsal with any of them she and mr heppner finally appeared together for the final performance out of pentup frustration , it seemed , they threw themselves into the roles with abandon , giving thrilling , if somewhat intuitive , performances natalie dessay , the alluring , petite and charismatic french soprano , framed the met s season with signature portrayals of completely opposite roles from donizetti operas the season opened in september with ms dessay as the tragic heroine of lucia di lammermoor many opera buffs and insiders , including the star , voiced complaints about the director s boldly reimagined yet unfocused production still , ms dessay gave an emotionally exposed and vocally brilliant performance as the lovesick and manipulated young lucia despite talk that mr levine has scant interest in the bel canto repertory , he conducted about as smart and dynamic a performance of this score as you are likely to hear the most popular event of the met s final weeks was another donizetti vehicle for ms dessay , a new production of la fille du r giment as marie , the orphaned tomboy reared by an army regiment , ms dessay uncannily combined agile physical comedy with impeccable singing juan diego fl rez was tonio , the earnest tyrolean peasant who adores her this time ms dessay was happy as could be with her inventive director , laurent pelly mr fl rez was the talk of the town for his singing of tonio s showpiece aria , ah , mes amis , with its notorious nine high c s most nights the ovation for mr fl rez was so prolonged that he encored that aria , with the blessing of mr gelb , who thinks that banning encores , as had been house custom , makes opera seem stuffy if truth be told , it s not as hard as it sounds for a tenor with a light lyric voice like mr fl rez s to toss off those high c s in the early 1970s , when luciano pavarotti , whose voice was lyric in coloring but enormous in sound , let those high c s ring out , that was truly astonishing still , all credit to mr fl rez , an invaluable asset to the company the mezzosoprano susan graham had a memorable season as well , beginning in november with her elegant singing in the title role of the new stephen wadsworth production of gluck s masterpiece iphig nie en tauride , and ending this month with her nobly suffering portrayal of sesto in mozart s clemenza di tito the formidable mezzosoprano continued to show that she can sing anything with her vocally burnished fricka in wagner s walk re ren e fleming , much admired for exploring unusual repertory , reminded met patrons that she was nearly ideal for a classic verdi role like desdemona in otello , which she sang with vocal luster and aching vulnerability finally , there was the company s premiere production of philip glass s landmark 1980 work , satyagraha for me , even during the prime creative period that fostered this work , mr glass too often shifted into a default mode of ritualistic repetitions still , with phelim mcdermott s totemic production , the sensitive conducting of dante anzolini , an admirable cast and the met s stalwart chorus , the opera emerged as a humane , often profound exploration of gandhi s courageous and savvy politics of nonviolence the tenor richard croft brought aching poignancy to the role of gandhi and in the final performance , the tenor alan oke , in his met debut , was a comparably moving and distinguished gandhi bringing this timely work to new york audiences was a smart move on mr gelb s part now it s on to next season , full of his big , and expensive , plans
the sean avery debacle in dallas has given brett hull an uncomfortable few days in the spotlight as the stars cogeneral manager he stood up at a news conference on friday , after nhl commissioner gary bettman announced avery s sixgame suspension for his latest clash with polite society , and had the difficult job of describing how the signing of a player he championed had gone so wrong hull , who was hired last year to make the stars hockey decisions alongside les jackson , admitted he wanted to bring in avery after the rangers refused to meet his asking price as a free agent hull had played with avery in detroit before red wings general manager ken holland sent avery packing to the kings in 2003 avery had even lived with hull and his wife when he was a rookie hull said he admired what avery had made of his career i thought he was the type of guy that our dressing room needed to light a little bit of a fire and get a little more emotion on the ice , hull said i think obviously it went a little overboard avery was disliked by many of his teammates from the day he arrived , based partly on his past history and abetted by avery s aloof nature in the locker room and his angry outbursts they culminated in the fateful television interview avery gave after tuesday s morning skate , when he denigrated some former girlfriends who date other nhl players his derogatory language was the last straw , for the stars and for the nhl hull and the stars had been hoping to get the same boost from avery that the rangers got when they acquired him in a tradingdeadline deal in 2007 his agitating style gave the rangers an instant edge , helped them make a huge playoff charge at the end of that season as well as last season but what the rangers had that the stars do not is the perfect locker room situation for avery with the rangers , avery had a mentor in brendan shanahan , a venerable veteran who tried to guide avery and whom avery respected also , rangers captain jaromir jagr did not let avery s antics become a major disruptive force mostly , jagr was amused by avery and said as long as avery backed up his words with his play , what avery did was fine with him that combination helped keep avery s disruption confined to the opposition and not the rangers the team made offers for avery to return , but nowhere near what he was asking or the 158 million over four years that dallas offered it was probably for the best for the rangers , because neither jagr nor shanahan would return hull , however , introduced avery into a locker room with none of those helpful dynamics and when the stars got off to a horrible start on the ice , the situation deteriorated so there was hull , trying to explain what had happened he maintains avery was worth the risk he is a good man , hull said he does charity work i know him personally he is a pleasure to be around we need to fix that guy so when it comes to being around the rink , he can be that guy hull also stopped short of saying he regretted bringing in avery we re not going to stop taking risks to make our team better because sometimes you have to , hull said i won t stop trying to make the dallas stars a championship team because of one instance

in prospect park , new york has no shortage of prime outdoor concert spaces but none have had mccarren s brief and brilliant life more than 200 , 000 people are expected to ramble over its concrete shell this summer for concerts , film screenings , plays and craft fairs , said stephanie thayer of the open space alliance for north brooklyn , which administers the pool in cooperation with the parks department ten thousand alone turn up for the free sunday concerts by the promoter jellynyc the space holds 6 , 000 , and many are turned away the last free concert will be yo la tengo on aug 24 nowhere else does a quadrupleolympicsize swimming pool fill with music usually heard in dark nightclubs where hula hoopers fear to tread nowhere else do watersport squeals serve as auxiliary percussion and for better or worse , no other stage has so definitively established itself as the preferred strolling grounds for the latest and most bizarre hipster plumage this is the coolest place to peoplewatch , said bryan murphy , 20 , a university of connecticut student who commutes to the pool on the 85minute metro north train from bridgeport people in brooklyn are different than people anywhere else they just look different and perhaps no other concert space so clearly illustrates the swift effects of gentrification just as bohemian culture in greenpoint and williamsburg is having its most visible , celebratory moment , it is being bulldozed out of the neighborhood rows of gleaming luxury condominiums have sprung up alongside the park , and the tattooandskinnyjeans set is getting priced out that mccarren pool will be filled with water again has pleased many longtime residents and activists but at several recent concerts the prevailing opinion was bummer they let it rot for years and years , and now all of a sudden they 're like , 'it s viable to turn it into a pool again , ' said liz castaldo , a 23yearold sporting yellow knee socks , a plaid miniskirt and aftermidnight blue hair she lived in williamsburg until the rent shot up , she said now she lives in bushwick angus andrew of the experimental rock band liars , which played two sundays ago , echoed the ambivalence of many concertgoers unhappy about losing mccarren as a fullscale performance space but aware that far worse things could happen to it i think it s actually a real shame if we lose that space for what it s being used for , mr andrew said but at the same time , i'm as hot as anyone and i would love to jump in a pool the fight for mccarren pool has been going on for longer than much of the current crowd has been alive after it closed , the pool was nearly demolished amid a bitter and racially charged community debate over its use that debate still lingers phyllis yampolsky , founder of the mccarren park conservancy and a greenpoint resident since 1982 , said that the pool belonged to a more diverse local population than the mostly white crowd that attends concerts there the basic need of that pool is as a pool and recreation center for all the peoples of north brooklyn , which includes a lot of black people and a lot of latino people , ms yampolsky said its basic needs are not for the fashionistas of williamsburg adrian benepe , the parks commissioner , said that the concerts and other events were never considered a permanent plan we always envisioned that these would be interim uses , he said , but we are delighted by what has happened there and want to find alternate venues the design for the renovated pool calls for a slightly smaller swimming area and a space that could be used for offseason performances
a wellplaced barb can affect an artist s reputation forever , even when credit for the insult is uncertain philip heseltine , an english critic who composed under the name peter warlock , is said to have likened a pastoral symphony \( symphony no 3 \) by his countryman , ralph vaughan williams , to a cow staring over a fence google vaughan williams and that epithet , and you will also find it attributed to constant lambert , a composer acquainted with both men the bovine imagery appears in other variations aaron copland is supposed to have said that listening to vaughan williams s symphony no 5 was like staring at a cow for 45 minutes elisabeth lutyens , an english modernist composer , dismissed the british pastoral school , of which vaughan williams was the most prominent figure , with the withering term cowpat music the lutyens pronouncement is better remembered than any of her compositions vaughan williams s music , on the other hand , continues to flourish , at least in the land of his birth in april his lark ascending , a thricefamiliar reverie for violin and orchestra , took the top spot in a listener poll of the top 300 classical works , sponsored by classic fm in london , for the second straight year his fantasia on a theme of thomas tallis , moved up to 3rd place from 10th this year the 50th anniversary of vaughan williams s death is being commemorated with a bounty

fisher hall , colin davis conducted the new york philharmonic in vaughan williams s roiling fourth symphony and the london symphony orchestra in the bleak , disquieting sixth terse , enigmatic works that are worlds apart from the wistful nostalgia that continues to define his reputation new audio and video releases meant to coincide with the anniversary offer a fuller view of vaughan williams s life and work , prompting a timely reevaluation o thou transcendent , an extensive documentary by the english filmmaker tony palmer , has just been issued on mr palmer s dvd label , distributed by naxos vaughan williams the collector s edition , a budgetprice boxed set from emi classics , offers nearly all of his music on 30 cds , including important recordings of his symphonies , songs and operas mr palmer has long concentrated on musical subjects , having produced wellregarded documentaries on benjamin britten and william walton , and a bizarre yet fascinating dramatization of testimony , the disputed secondhand memoirs of shostakovich , starring ben kingsley that mr palmer approached vaughan williams with an agenda to shake up the status quo is apparent from the opening statement by stephen johnson , a music historian i think vaughan williams is the most underestimated , the most misunderstood of all the great 20thcentury english composers , mr johnson says what a complex and disturbing artist he is , a man who wrote some of the most deeply unsettling music of our time mr palmer cuts to the classic fm control booth , where the lark ascending is proclaimed the listeners' top pick video of the violinist nicola benedetti playing the work is interspersed with lingering shots of verdant hills , quaint villages and cloudy skies precisely what you think the music is about mr palmer then shatters the peace with a bracing excerpt from the fourth symphony , in which a discordant fournote theme in the brasses is obsessively repeated the music parallels a brittle strain also found in shostakovich through archival interviews with vaughan williams testimony from friends , colleagues and historians and vintage photographs and musical examples mr palmer illuminates a life that started in a position of status and privilege vaughan williams s mother , margaret , was a daughter of josiah wedgwood iii and a niece of charles darwin his father , arthur , the vicar of a church in down ampney , gloucestershire , died when vaughan williams was 2 he wrote his first piece at 6 , took up the viola at the charterhouse school , was educated at the royal college of music in london and at cambridge and studied with bruch and ravel coming of age at a time when english composers sought a means to eradicate german influence , vaughan williams looked to composers of the tudor era , adopting sounds from their music and instruments with the composer gustav holst , a devoted friend and colleague from the academy , and the preservationist cecil sharp , he trekked through the english countryside , collecting folk songs on primitive cylinder recordings just as the hungarian composers bartok and kodaly were doing in their regions vaughan williams adopted aspects of those formative experiences in his mature compositional style , a combination of plainspoken modal melodies , harmonies that suggested vast spaces and ravel s opulent orchestration what resulted was a distinctive musical language flexible enough to accommodate the bustling cityscape of a london symphony \( no 2 \) , the apocalyptic fury of the sixth symphony , the desolate majesty of the sinfonia antartica \( no 7 \) and the elusive melancholy of the ninth symphony mr palmer illuminates some of his subject s seeming contradictions though an atheist , vaughan williams compiled and edited the english hymnal and wrote a number of sacred works he enlisted in the army during world war i and served in the ambulance corps on the french front his pastoral symphony , no cowpat music , evokes the sad beauty and loss he experienced there mr palmer s interviewees draw uncommonly direct lines from vaughan williams s personal circumstances to the compositions that resulted the fourth symphony , widely regarded as a presentiment of world war ii , is explained as an expression of the rage vaughan williams bottled up while caring for adeline , his disabled first wife the radiant calm of the fifth symphony and the extraordinary fecundity and adventurousness of his final decades is ascribed to his relationship with ursula , his second wife , who is seen at 96 in her final interview , filmed in october just before she died some of the most impressive statements in o thou transcendent come from composers of later generations , none of whom emulated vaughan williams s style michael tippett , in an archival interview , says that he initially rejected his forebear s folk waffle but later came to realize that through him especially , we were made free harrison birtwistle points out that for a postwar british generation largely unaware of schoenberg s advances , vaughan williams quite simply constituted new music markanthony turnage and john adams speak admiringly of early encounters mr palmer s only major misstep is his use of grisly footage from modern conflicts in the middle east and elsewhere to bludgeon home his point that wars still happen and , presumably , vaughan williams s evocations remain relevant the point is selfevident , the carnage a disservice but without question mr palmer s film stimulates an appetite for vaughan williams s music this he achieves with tantalizing archival film of a serene adrian boult conducting the fifth symphony in 1970 and a gripping scene of sarah walker in the opera riders to the sea from 1988 , as well as with recent performances by the vocalists thomas allen and simon keenlyside and the national youth orchestra , an ensemble vaughan williams helped to establish 60 years ago those who wish to explore further will be well served by the cd boxed set the spare package includes no liner notes , just a booklet that lists tracks , timings and performers on the sturdy slipcover , vaughan williams , not a cow , stares over a fence forget about cut corners the set includes the nine symphonies with the royal liverpool philharmonic conducted by vernon handley , perhaps the most consistently rewarding cycle available boult leads job , an inventive , exuberant ballet for which he had a lasting affinity choral works like the ravishing flos campi and the noble mass in g minor are authoritatively handled by david willcocks the music group of london is poised in a number of sorely undervalued chamber pieces , and it sensitively supports the tenor ian partridge in a cherishable on wenlock edge and other songs another volume features the vocalists janet baker , thomas hampson and david daniels no vaughan williams opera has become established in the international repertory , and despite the provincial charms of hugh the drover and sir john in love , it is not difficult to understand why but meredith davies leads a riveting account of the doomshrouded oneact riders to the sea and in boult s hands the pilgrim s progress had an ecstatic aspect to rival wagner s parsifal and messiaen s st fran ois d'assise encountering a performance so utterly committed and assured , you can see why , for some , this broadly paced , largely static morality , as vaughan williams termed it , was the apex of a long life s quest

a few of the students involved in following the primary process in new hampshire as part of campus voicesorg , an academic project at harvard s institute of politics , offered their impressions of the debates on saturday night kristine beckerle , 18 , rockland county , new york the candidates seem to have learned that angry sparring is not the course if one wants to sway new hampshire voters mitt romney and rudolph w giuliani were noticeably calmer than they have been , both refraining from bashing the other candidates and attempting , if not always succeeding , at focusing on the strengths of their policies rather than the weaknesses of their colleagues yet their effort did not combat the compelling presence of john mccain yet again , he was the most successful in the debate clear and calm as always he focused on his strength , praised democrats as he thought necessary and told it like it is living up to his promise of straight talk he even managed a jab at mr romney with perfection his jab as romney truly being the candidate of change went over well , with perfectly timed laughter making mccain a lovable , real person , rather than a spluttering bull trying to pull everyone around him down the calmer , more genial atmosphere of the debate was bad for mike huckabee he shone through the cnn debate as calm and collected , being offered in direct comparison to the rushed insults of mr romney and mr giuliani yet tonight his pastoral manner was simply that boring preaching he did not thrive in the more relaxed atmosphere and almost seemed bland while the personalities of the other candidates shown through , he was an almost monotone fountain without tangible passion ron paul was also hurt by the format when he is only given ten seconds to disperse a message , his words seem pretty strong and convincing , but when forced to talk for over a minute , the lack of substance to his almost singleissue campaign less government ! becomes clear he didn t have the fire and radical appeal he normally does , and his more mellow attitude helped him blend in with the candidates on stage and blending in is it not something that will be benefical to the phenomenon campaign one of the most interesting points of the debate was the discussion of senator barack obama few of the republicans have shied from bashing senator clinton at every possible moment , almost to the extent of the democrats attack on george w bush with a potentially new frontrunner , one would think they would turn their verbal swords on the young senator , but not one republican candidate offered significant criticism they endorsed mr obama , saying they respected him , with mr paul and mr romney even praising his message of change they took the chance to highlight their own strengths , saying why them , but did not answer the question of why not him what are they afraid of or rather , what are they playing at \? do they think if he wins the candidacy they can beat him , and are thus hoping to help his bid for the nomination \? it seems unlikely they are endorsing him out of conviction , as he is more leftleaning than clinton the answer is uncertain , but the question may float in voter s minds elizabeth bridges , 20 , clover , south carolina it seems as though the iowa primaries may be having a major impact already on the candidates thinking in tonight s new hampshire debate , several of the candidates behaved remarkably different than they have in previous appearances fresh off his victory in iowa , obama played the role of a confident frontrunner , never losing his cool and even calling out the moderator of the debate for posing a question that lent itself to negativity in stark contrast , senator clinton seemed definitively shaken by her disappointing third place finish in iowa she shrilly bickered with mr obama and did not maintain her cool demeanor throughout the whole debate perhaps most surprisingly , edwards drew similarities between himself and obama , claiming that they were the two agents of change and that their message was responsible for their finishes in iowa in addition to perhaps further shaking the senator from new york , john edwards s ploy perhaps will lead to crystallizing the change versus experience debate that has characterized the democratic race kristine beckerle , 18 , rockland county , new york the democrats began ready to battle with iowa weighing heavily on each of their minds the stage looked bare with only four candidates after the packed republican debate but the democrats looked tired and worn , with only mr edwards cracking the occasional smile mr obama didn t envince his normal aura of hope he answered each question on the defense , seeming more angry than usual with a scolding tone that was not the motivational rhetoric he has been so successful with perhaps it was part of his attempt to talk straight to the new hampshire voters , an obvious effort to persuade fans of john mccain , his projected rival for the independent vote but it didn t work without his charm , he just seemed off he keep explaining that he was specific , that he did have plans , but rather than go into detail on a single issue , he continued with his ideabased discussion , explaining what he would do , but not how mr edwards was more amiable than mr obama , but did not come off strong he seemed stuck , overly patient and not taking opportunities of speaking time to say something different rather , he just seemed to repeat what the other candidates were saying , with an almost identical response to the surge in iraq as mrs clinton , and a backing of mr obama s response to her criticism mr edwards needs to convince new hampshirites that they should choose him over obama , and yet he portrayed their similarities rather than highlighting their differences while there is something to be said for being positive , this does not mean forgetting to differentiate yourself from your main rival hillary clinton was the strongest of the four , but it was still not a stellar performance the format highlighted her knowledge , background and experience and was the perfect setting for a candidate running on issues and specifics rather than environment and excitement she hit every question with specific answers , names , references to history and detail she didn t attempt to switch focus on the issues and rather provided a bulletpoint plan for every obstacle even her slipup , her overly angry response to the criticism levelled from mr obama and mr and edwards , highlighted her strengths while the three other candidates spouted generalities attempting to come off as concrete policies , she was the candidate who was ready to respond , to take control and to act with substance it remains to be seen whether new hampshire voters will appreciate her honesty and projected expertise , or whether they will be turned off by her serious manner and mildly abrasive approach bill richardson was not helped by the debate he came off as the least knowledgeable and the least poised without any knowledge of the race , one might almost assume he was a singleissue candidate , constantly bringing the questions to iraq all in all , the debate did not seem to do much to shake up the race , with none of the democrats taking full advantage of the opportunity with a large part of new hampshire watching tonight , it remains to be seen whether mrs clinton s realism , mr edward s positivism or mr obama s generalities will bring in the votes
philadelphia brown quarterback michael dougherty has been dangerous this season no matter where the bears' drives have started , but the team s defense made it easier for him saturday dougherty threw for 234 yards and 4 touchdowns in a 3427 victory against pennsylvania at franklin field none of the bears' five scoring drives covered more than 57 yards one covered 11 , another 28 you can really have the whole playbook at your disposal , dougherty said about starting drives close to the end zone brown \( 52 , 40 ivy league \) is now alone atop the league standings , mainly because it scored touchdowns after recovering two fumbles in the second half by the quakers \( 43 , 31 \) , enabling the bears to overcome a 1714 deficit dougherty threw touchdown passes of 11 yards to buddy farnham , 12 to bobby sewall and 29 to colin cloherty in the second half his 57yard scoring pass to farnham in the final minute of the first half gave brown a 1410 lead the quakers made the end of the game interesting tyson maugle fell on a blocked punt in the end zone with 1 minute 21 seconds left to trim brown s lead to 7 points but farnham recovered an onside kick , and the bears ran out the clock any time we made a mistake , they were able to take advantage of it , penn coach al bagnoli said the quakers played without center luis ruffolo , who sprained a knee in practice wednesday quarterback kyle olson injured his left knee late in the second quarter and did not return another penn quarterback , robert irvin , played with a tender shoulder after penn took a 1714 lead and stopped brown on its first possession of the third quarter , irvin fumbled a snap and michael lemmons recovered for the bears two plays later , farnham caught his 11yard touchdown pass we gave them more credit than they deserved , and we psyched ourselves out a little bit , penn cornerback chris wynn said david howard caused another fumble when he sacked irvin with 1 18 left in the third quarter joseph mcphee recovered the ball for brown nine plays later , dougherty threw a touchdown pass to sewall , who scored the game s first touchdown on a 9yard run penn had a chance to score with less than five minutes left the sophomore quarterback keiffer garton , in his first extended action , could not convert on a fourthand2 there was just no lane to cut up , garton said dougherty then threw a 29yard touchdown pass to cloherty , and brown defensive end james develin intercepted a tipped pass from garton at the bears' 9yard line brown was soon forced to punt , but it was blocked and recovered in the end zone still , the bears had enough of a cushion to absorb the blow farnham , who had 6 receptions for 120 yards , scored his first touchdown after penn took a 107 lead with 1 15 left in the first half farnham abandoned a post pattern , sprinted down the sideline and caught a 57yard pass from dougherty , who has thrown for 1 , 903 yards and 14 touchdowns this season we kind of felt better about ourselves in the locker room at halftime , brown coach phil estes said brown has won three ivy league titles , most recently in 2005 , but this is the first time the bears have won their first four league games brown faces yale next week , a team it has beaten only 31 times since 1880 no one s looking ahead , and no one s looking in the past , dougherty said
suddenly , the economic consensus seems to be that the implosion of the housing market will indeed push the us economy into a recession , and that it s quite possible that we 're already in one as a result , over the next few weeks we 'll be hearing a lot about plans for economic stimulus since this is an election year , the debate over how to stimulate the economy is inevitably tied up with politics and here s a modest suggestion for political reporters instead of trying to divine the candidates' characters by scrutinizing their tone of voice and facial expressions , why not pay attention to what they say about economic policy \? in fact , recent statements by the candidates and their surrogates about the economy are quite revealing take , for example , john mccain s admission that economics is n't his thing the issue of economics is not something i 've understood as well as i should , he says i 've got greenspan s book his selfdeprecating humor is attractive , as always but should n't we worry about a candidate who s so out of touch that he regards mr bubble , the man who refused to regulate subprime lending and assured us that there was at most some froth in the housing market , as a source of sage advice \? meanwhile , rudy giuliani wants us to go for broke , literally his answer to the economy s shortrun problems is a huge permanent tax cut , which he claims would pay for itself it would n't about mike huckabee well , what can you say about a candidate who talks populist while proposing to raise taxes on the middle class and cut them for the rich \? and then there s the curious case of mitt romney i'm told that he actually does know a fair bit about economics , and he has some bigname republican economists supporting his campaign fears of recession might have offered him a chance to distinguish himself from the gop field , by offering an economic proposal that actually responded to the gathering economic storm i mean , even the bush administration seems to be coming around to the view that lobbying for longterm tax cuts is n't enough , that the economy needs some immediate help time is of the essence , declared henry paulson , the treasury secretary , last week but mr romney , who really needs to take chances at this point , apparently ca n't break the habit of telling republicans only what he thinks they want to hear he s still offering nothing but standardissue gop pablum about low taxes and a probusiness environment on the democratic side , john edwards , although never the frontrunner , has been driving his party s policy agenda he s done it again on economic stimulus last month , before the economic consensus turned as negative as it now has , he proposed a stimulus package including aid to unemployed workers , aid to cashstrapped state and local governments , public investment in alternative energy , and other measures last week hillary clinton offered a broadly similar but somewhat larger proposal \( it also includes aid to families having trouble paying heating bills , which seems like a clever way to put cash in the hands of people likely to spend it \) the edwards and clinton proposals both contain provisions for bigger stimulus if the economy worsens and you have to say that mrs clinton seems comfortable with and knowledgeable about economic policy i'm sure the hillaryhaters will find some reason that s a bad thing , but there s something to be said for presidents who know what they 're talking about the obama campaign s initial response to the latest wave of bad economic news was , i'm sorry to say , disreputable mr obama s top economic adviser claimed that the longterm taxcut plan the candidate announced months ago is just what we need to keep the slump from morphing into a drastic decline in consumer spending hmm claiming that the candidate is allseeing , and that a tax cut originally proposed for other reasons is also a recessionfighting measure does n't that sound familiar \? anyway , on sunday mr obama came out with a real stimulus plan as was the case with his health care plan , which fell short of universal coverage , his stimulus proposal is similar to those of the other democratic candidates , but tilted to the right for example , the obama plan appears to contain none of the alternative energy initiatives that are in both the edwards and clinton proposals , and emphasizes acrosstheboard tax cuts over both aid to the hardesthit families and help for state and local governments i know that mr obama s supporters hate to hear this , but he really is less progressive than his rivals on matters of domestic policy in short , the stimulus debate offers a pretty good portrait of the men and woman who would be president and i have n't said a word about their hairstyles
when the cyclist tammy thomas goes on trial next week on charges she lied to a federal grand jury about whether she used performanceenhancing drugs , s lawyers will be monitoring the case from the legal equivalent of the ondeck circle much as bonds studied a pitcher before he came to bat , bonds s lawyers have the advantage of watching how federal prosecutors proceed against thomas thomas s trial , scheduled to begin march 24 , will be the first in the fiveandahalfyear investigation of the bay area laboratory cooperative in december 2006 , thomas became the first athlete to be indicted as part of the investigation she was charged with perjury and obstruction of justice , the same charges on which bonds was indicted last year at the time of thomas s indictment , prosecutors said they were entering a final phase of the investigation in which the government would pursue others that they believed made false statements since then , in addition to bonds s indictment , the former track and field star and the former football player dana stubblefield have pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal agents about their use of performanceenhancing drugs it is in bonds s interest to see thomas s trial go to a jury verdict , according to legal experts his lawyers will get a full look at the prosecution s arguments , which may be quite similar to the ones that will be made against bonds the lawyers will also see the strengths and weaknesses of the internal revenue service special agent jeff novitzky , the lead investigator , who is almost certain to take the witness stand for the first time in a balco case daniel c richman , a professor of law at columbia university and a former federal prosecutor , said bonds would be best served by a vigorous defense of thomas that would force the government to turn over anything possible and disclose as much information about their investigation because none of the balco cases have gone to trial , richman said , little has been learned about the details of the government s investigation on wednesday , when a judge denied a motion filed by thomas s lawyers to have the charges dismissed , a lawyer for bonds sat quietly in the courtroom until last spring , thomas , who as of 2004 was all but broke , was represented by a lessprominent lawyer but in may , ethan balogh , a lawyer who has represented major league baseball s players union in several drugrelated cases , took over balogh has aggressively litigated the matter and created headaches for federal prosecutors he has filed several motions to have the case dismissed and has asked to have one of the federal prosecutors and his legal assistant put on the witness stand balogh , who is known for his eloquent oral arguments , is also one of the few lawyers who has had success against these same prosecutors over the issue of performanceenhancing drugs in 2004 , he represented the players union in a dispute with the prosecutors over seized steroid tests balogh won , although the decision was later reversed he has a very good reputation in the bay area , and i do n't expect that he is cheap , said peter keane , a veteran defense lawyer and dean emeritus at golden gate university law school last year , he again represented the players union , this time in connection with a lawsuit brought by the associated press to have a judge unseal government documents that would reveal the identities of players that were tied to performanceenhancing drugs the judge ruled to keep the documents sealed , but they were later unsealed if the government loses the case against thomas , it will give bonds s lawyers more incentive to proceed to trial , perhaps sometime in early 2009 but if a jury finds thomas guilty , it could send a signal to bonds s lawyers that a trial may be too risky and that a plea bargain would make more sense
aboard the norwegian dawn if you 've ever wondered what became of the belief in musical theater s power to transform lives , take note for most of this week it could be found a few hundred nautical miles out of new york , chugging north on the way to halifax , nova scotia the 2 , 300 passengers of this r family vacations charter were on board for an annual week of swimming , frolicking , eating and building their own social utopia one in which musical theater plays an essential role really r family vacations is led by , the entertainer and talkshow host kelli o 'donnell , the pixieish entertainment executive who became her wife in 2004 and their business partner , gregg kaminsky , and caters to gay and lesbian families but anyone who might have signed up looking for something sexy or even illicit for a love that dare not speak its name boat well , that ship had left the harbor whatever their sexual orientation , this was an extremely straight bunch wearing tshirts and crocs , straining at their waistbands and beginning to contemplate middle age , they might have passed for the guests on any other if , that is , they were not quite so wholesome , so relentlessly focused on being good parents and raising happy kids at the dock , the ship seemed to serve as a kind of reverse quarantine , a metal container moored off 12th avenue to prevent the passengers' expansive childfriendly values from wiping out new york s social ecology whether they had come for their own family or the we are family spirit of community , all the guests from the dual mommies to the leather daddies to the grandparents , siblings , cousins and kids they all had in tow were excited to cheer on the of songanddance shows that the week would offer among the more than 100 entertainers on board were celebrated performers like christine ebersole , daphne rubinvega , andrea mcardle and lillias white in one configuration or another , this collection of winners and marquee names would put on two shows every night , as well as make countless impromptu appearances at the piano bar , karaoke bar or salad bar by the schlocky standards of much cruiseline entertainment , it was a floating royal shakespeare company to ms o 'donnell , putting on highquality shows was a matter of basic justice if you 're given a crumb and told it s a meal , you 'll believe it s a meal , she said so often gay people are given a crumb i did n't want anything that was n't top of the line i wanted a smorgasbord and if there s one thing a cruise ship can provide , it s a smorgasbord what it cannot provide , however , is top dollar now in its seventh year , the cruise , ms o 'donnell says , is far from making a profit so the organizers look for entertainers who might want to come along for the ride we 're in international waters , so it s ok to say we hire our friends , confessed michael lee , the venture s artistic director it helps that he , the company s founders and seth rudetsky , the musical director , are all so well connected but , as he took care to point out , in addition to being friends , the performers are all professionals this turns out to be a euphemism for people who can be pushed onstage with almost no rehearsal the first afternoon of the cruise , while everyone was still checking in , the cast and crew of the big openingnight revue were meeting for the first time no one had yet completed a lineup , much less mastered the technicalities of the theater s equipment ms mcardle and her 19yearold daughter , alexa koloff , who were signed up for the cruise only a week before , had n't even tried their duet more than twice and then , with just hours to put it all together , they all had to stop for the ship s lifeboat drill the semimanic mr rudetsky admitted he nearly had a meltdown but when the curtain rose for the first of the evening s two shows , the audience at the stardust theater saw only glitzy showmanship with the exception , that is , of ms o 'donnell herself , who in a floppy shirt and uneven leggings did a little soft shoe in the opening number wary of trying to teach her new steps , mr lee had just spliced in some moves she already knew from another production as an added precaution , he performed them right alongside her , gently applying a bit of what he refers to as elbow choreography meanwhile , she saved the audience the effort of mocking her performance and went on to remind them she 'd recently been voted most annoying celebrity despite the chewinggumandbalingwire spirit of it all , mr lee who is so good at making something out of nothing that ms o 'donnell calls him macgayver could only laugh i'm dancing onstage with rosie o 'donnell , he said just beforehand she s not a dancer that s funny already the schedule for the week s big finale was no more relaxed for a while the plan had been to do dreamgirls , so the organizers first focused on trying to cast black actors then a month or so ago they obtained the rights to chicago and decided to stage that instead , in a nearly fullscale production but up to the last week stars were still dropping out \( like joel grey , who had a scheduling conflict \) or signing on \( like carolee carmello , who happened to bump into mr rudetsky s partner at starbucks \) the plan was for one hour of vocal rehearsals , some time in the studio blocking out the basic shape of the show , a few takes on each scene and , if they were lucky , two full runthroughs but every time anyone tried to schedule a rehearsal , the room turned out to be booked for some other event and how do you reschedule a few dozen people on a ship where no one has cell reception and the passenger manifest is somehow unavailable \? somehow or other , everyone gets into the spirit of it no matter what diva gets on on sunday , by friday it s let me help you with that luggage' mr lee said as performers we 're so used to thinking , they 're going to rip me to shreds' but this is the only place where you feel they 're not here to judge you because this is the place where they 're not judged mr rudetsky was more emphatic it s the greatest entertainment in the world , he said add in the cruise s inclusive spirit , and , he said it s like , what if the world were perfect \? and the taste is just so amazing in part because it s my taste colin sheehan experienced that inclusiveness firsthand when , as a 13yearold in the audience of ms o 'donnell s talk show , he got up the nerve to sing a song that he had written about her she invited him back to be a cohost of the show now an extremely eager and frequently perspiring 23 , he is the entertainment coordinator for the operation to him , the cruise and the entertainment are about the same thing bringing outsiders into the fold we love that people in iowa or nebraska who do n't get to see the a broadway performers , they get to vacation with them for a week eventually , all discussions of the role that musical theater plays in this come back around to ms o 'donnell she is extremely accessible on the cruise , so lowkey she sometimes looks as if she had just rolled out of bed none of which diminishes the magical aura with which cruisegoers imbue her , running up to tell her about some experience they 've had , to introduce their families , to pitch her on a project , as though she were a senator walking through a crowd of constituents \( she says she prefers the image of mickey walking through disneyland \) she may not have singlehandedly saved broadway , as folks on the ship like to say she did by featuring it on her talk show , but for one week at a stretch she does seem to have inspired an alternate universe of family values , where people fight for the chance to adopt children of all races and needs , where they stand in line to be bound by the vows of marriage \( a nice canadian souvenir \) , where lesbians in the karaoke bar unselfconsciously request eminem songs , and where at the disco , late at night a brawny man who drops to the ground to feel for a missing tooth is n't the victim of a bar fight he s a dad , and his daughter is waiting for a visit from the tooth fairy if the economics of the cruise business do n't change , next year this social experiment will probably have to take place on dry land but at sheena easton s late show one night , no one was worrying about the future as she took the stage , vamping and bumping and camping it up , the 50something camouflagewearing lesbians and the 20something gay men in expensive jeans and the two little girls dancing at the foot of the stage all seemed equally , ecstatically grateful how did the news that her baby takes the morning train validate the struggles of gay families \? it was impossible to say , and yet somehow it all just worked with the audience in a frenzy , she acknowledged their ovation and exhorted them to keep the party going into the wee hours after all , she shouted , the ship had plenty of baby sitters
wayne brady could n't help himself , really a few songs into his set at b b king blues club grill on thursday night , this singer , best known as a comedian and television host , decided that he needed to do something , he said , to address the people that are saying , do something funny' up to that point no such request had been made , but that mattered little wayne brady had decided he needed to live up to wayne brady , and that was that so while his band played an instrumental version of a tribe called quest s scenario , he worked the crowd , freestyling rhymes about its appearance \( why your pants so tight \? \) and , after passing the microphone to an audience member for a few lines , he noted , you 're like busta rhymes s granddaddy ! \( a trenchant observation , as it happened \) though this was mr brady s first proper performance of material from his debut album , a long time coming \( peak \) , he could n't quite leave well enough alone maybe it was an acknowledgment of the obvious while mr brady is an able vocalist , his singing works best as part of a broader package , where less is at stake mainly he was genial with nods to the gentle 1980s soul singers freddie jackson and james ingram while his band delivered denuded funk ordinary , about the eroticism of fidelity , had verve , but sweetest berry and all naturally were too controlled and physically , mr brady is sinewy but stiff even when he danced , he appeared as if he were working a space even smaller than the one he had the best song on mr brady s album is the last , you and me , an emotionally exhausting yet affirming ode to the potency of family , even in the wake of divorce \( mr brady s divorce from his wife was finalized earlier this year \) whatever may come , he sings to his ex , invoking their daughter , just look what we 've done it s genuinely affecting , and here he sang it movingly , on a darkened stage under a cold spotlight , with none of the pretense that marred the rest of the show it was the rare moment in which mr brady captured a true mood a cover of sam cooke s song a change is gonna come was completely without pathos \( though his backup singers jamie jones , of the rb group all4one , and diane gordon , were excellent \) , and on his quick vamp of james brown s sex machine , he sounded , well , like someone imitating james brown at times it felt as if the most sincere thing onstage was the sweat drenching the armpits of mr brady s shirt not surprisingly , mr brady was better in unguarded or unexpected moments improvisation , as on the comedy show whose line is it anyway , has long been his calling card introducing his cover of the beatles' ca n't buy me love , he noted , almost as an aside , barely speaking into the microphone , i 've found out that this is quite true and at the encore , which mr brady said was unplanned \( y'all need to go home now , he 'd announced , somewhat seriously the album is only so long \) , he sang a duet with mr jones of stevie wonder s i wish , to which they promptly forgot the words it did n't matter the band , particularly the guitarist darrell crooks , felt unburdened on the web site of the venetian \( \) , the las vegas hotel where mr brady performs a regular variety show , he describes an extravaganza of improv , music , midgets , laser beams , darth vader and a woman from akron , ohio that sounds more like it
jerusalem the gray walls of yad vashem , the holocaust memorial here , have long documented the horrors perpetrated by the nazis against europe s jews now , an oddly vibrant exhibition at the memorial is telling a less known story of the renaissance of the survivors in and the extraordinary role they played in shaping the character of the new state my homeland holocaust survivors in israel opened in late april , in time for the 60th anniversary this week of israel s founding instead of gas chambers and ghettoes , it showcases designer beachwear and boldly colored posters that promoted potent israeli symbols like the airline el al more than 90 survivors , mostly prominent artists and innovators , are featured only about half have lived to see the day in the past year , the dominant image of the survivors in israel has been that of frail citizens living out their final years in cold and hunger , battling the government bureaucracy for monthly stipends of 250 , 000 survivors in israel today , 80 , 000 or more are said to be living on or near the poverty line last august , survivors took to the streets of jerusalem in protest a few wore yellow stars like the ones the nazis forced jews to display but experts say the suffering of those left behind in their old age does not negate their success story the story of the holocaust can be told from many different angles , said hanna yablonka , a historical consultant to the exhibition to me , one of the most important aspects is the question of where you take such a huge disaster you can turn to revenge , or to building lea gottlieb , who turns 90 this year , hid from the nazis during the german occupation of hungary and stepped off the boat in the port city of haifa in 1949 we came with nothing , without money , with nowhere to live , mrs gottlieb recalled , after viewing a movie about herself in a corner of the exhibition an hour before the official opening the first two or three years were very , very hard , she said petite and manicured , in a black pantsuit and sensible leather shoes , mrs gottlieb recounted in stillhalting hebrew how she and her husband opened a raincoat factory like the one they had left behind in europe but for months we saw no rain , only sunshine , she said so they founded gottex , a swimwear company that quickly grew to become a leading israeli brand abroad mrs gottlieb , the company s chief designer , would sometimes tell of an ugly memory from the past , said a grandson , danny shir , 37 , like when she hid herself and her children in a pit behind the house of their gentile host after seeing a nazi with a pistol outside six million jews died in the holocaust almost half a million jews who survived the camps and the ghettoes , or who emerged out of hiding , arrived here in the years after the end of the world war ii having cheated death once , many headed again to the battlefield half of the israeli fighters in the 1948 war were holocaust survivors , and they made up a third of the number who were killed by 1952 , kariel gardosh , the caricaturist known as dosh , had created srulik , a figure in sandals , a blue work shirt and a blue canvas hat srulik became the symbol of what nativeborn israelis saw as their quintessential selves guileless and pioneering , with none of the complexes and pretenses of europe born in hungary in 1921 , mr gardosh was sent to mine copper as a forced laborer during the war his family died at auschwitz after immigrating to israel in 1948 , he drew a daily political cartoon in the hebrew paper maariv for almost 50 years and died in 2000 srulik was chosen as the official icon for the 10th anniversary celebrations of the nation , and is the symbol of the yad vashem exhibition today like many israelis i tended to look at the holocaust survivors as victims , said michal broshi , a curator consultant as she learned of the extent of their imprint on israel , i could n't believe my ears , she said the survivors penetrated every sphere , from the arts and academia to commerce , industry and defense they were acting as a normal part of the fabric of life , said yad vashem s curator , yehudit shendar actually , it was a miracle the encounter between the newcomers and the early zionist pioneers was not always easy many already here disdained anything to do with jewish exile , and the survivors' accounts were at first beyond what a normal human being could grasp , said avner shalev , chairman of yad vashem s directors but the survivors took it upon themselves to be integrated , to be more israeli than the israelis , mr shalev said the only difference between them and other israelis , he said , was that the pain never left them it was with them in their small circles , and at night six decades later , the immigrants accepted as israelis are being honored as survivors i would prefer another reason to be celebrated , said dan reisinger , 73 , a graphic designer of international renown but survival is something one should appreciate every day mr reisinger , born in yugoslavia in 1934 , spent the german occupation hidden by a serbian family he immigrated to israel with his mother and stepfather in 1949 after studying in jerusalem and living in belgium and london , he returned to revolutionize israeli design on display at yad vashem is a collection of his distinctive corporate logos now ingrained in israel s consciousness , including that of el al i wanted to bring something fresh , something new , something more cheerful to compensate for the dark years i went through , he said mr reisinger , who also designed medals for the israeli army and a perpetual calendar for the museum of modern art in new york , likes to define his life in colors , split in three yellow for the yellow star , red for the soviet army , which liberated him , and blue for the israeli sky
with all the sniping from the clinton camp about whether barack obama has enough experience to make a strong president , consider another presidential candidate who was far more of a novice he had the gall to run for president even though he had served a single undistinguished term in the house of representatives , before being hounded back to his district that was abraham lincoln another successful president scorned any need for years of apprenticeship in washington , declaring , the same old experience is not relevant he suggested that the most useful training comes not from hanging around the white house and congress but rather from experience rooted in the real lives of real people so that it will bring real results if we have the courage to change that was bill clinton running in 1992 against george h w bush , who was then trumpeting his own experience over the callow youth of mr clinton that year mr bush aired a television commercial urging voters to keep america in the hands of experience it might seem obvious that long service in washington is the best preparation for the white house , but on the contrary , one lesson of american history is that length of experience in national politics is an extremely poor predictor of presidential success looking at the 19 presidents since 1900 , three of the greatest were among those with the fewest years in electoral politics teddy roosevelt had been a governor for two years and vice president for six months woodrow wilson , a governor for just two years and franklin roosevelt , a governor for four years none ever served in congress they all did have executive experience \( as did mr clinton \) , actually running something larger than a senate office maybe that s something voters should think about more governors have often made better presidents than senators but that s not a good democratic talking point , because the candidates with the greatest administrative experience by far are mitt romney , rudy giuliani and mike huckabee alternatively , look at the five presidents since 1900 with perhaps the most political experience when taking office william mckinley , lyndon johnson , richard nixon , gerald ford and george h w bush they had great technical skills but not one was among our very greatest presidents the point is not that experience is pointless but that it need n't be in politics to be useful john mccain s years as a pow gave him an understanding of torture and a moral authority to discuss it that no amount of senate hearings ever could have conferred in the same way , mr obama s years as an antipoverty organizer give him insights into one of our greatest challenges how to end cycles of poverty that frontline experience is one reason mr obama not only favors government spending programs , like earlychildhood education , but also cultural initiatives like promoting responsible fatherhood then there s mr obama s gradeschool years in indonesia our most serious mistakes in foreign policy , from vietnam to iraq , have been a blindness to other people s nationalism and an inability to see ourselves as others see us mr obama seems to have absorbed an intuitive sensitivity to that problem for starters , he understood back in 2002 that american troops would not be greeted in iraq with flowers in politics , mr obama s preparation is indeed thin , though it s more than hillary rodham clinton acknowledges his seven years in the illinois state senate are n't heavily scrutinized , but he scored significant achievements there a law to videotape police interrogations in capital cases an earned income tax credit to fight poverty an expansion of earlychildhood education mrs clinton s strength is her mastery of the details of domestic and foreign policy , unrivaled among the candidates she speaks fluently about what to do in pakistan , iraq , darfur mr obama s strength is his vision and charisma and the possibility that his election would heal divisions at home and around the world john edwards s strength is his common touch and his leadership among the candidates in establishing detailed positions on health care , poverty and foreign aid those are the meaningful distinctions in the democratic field , not mrs clinton s spurious claim to 35 years of experience the democrats with the greatest washington expertise joe biden , chris dodd and bill richardson have already been driven from the race and the presidential candidate left standing with the greatest experience by far is mr mccain if mrs clinton believes that s the criterion for selecting the next president , she might consider backing him to put it another way , think which politician is most experienced today in the classic sense , and thus according to the experience camp best qualified to become the next president that s dick cheney and i rest my case
greenburgh , ny the news that forward sean avery had sustained a lacerated spleen and was hospitalized rippled through the rangers practice wednesday morning , another hurdle thrown in front of a team facing elimination in its playoff series against pittsburgh avery was injured during the rangers' 53 loss to the on tuesday night at madison square garden , although no one knows precisely when a few players said avery did not seem well between the second and third periods , but it was not until after the game that the team doctors suspected something serious and drove him to st vincent s manhattan hospital after tests , avery was admitted to the intensive care unit the rangers said he would not have surgery and was expected to make a full recovery he will not play again this season it s tough , rangers coach tom renney said this is a good hockey player that can make a lot happen for our team we 'll work hard to overcome that , as many teams do the rangers are trailing the penguins by three games to none in their bestofseven series and will be trying to stave off elimination thursday night at the garden only two teams have bounced back from 30 deficits to win an nhl playoff series avery , 28 , has been a huge factor for the rangers since he was acquired from the los angeles kings at the trading deadline last season he is the rangers' premier agitator , a player known as much for antagonizing opponents as for his hockey skills but he has also developed into a major offensive contributor on the rangers second line he scored 15 goals in the regular season and had 4 goals and 3 assists in the playoffs but the number most associated with him is the rangers record with him in the lineup 331410 in the regular season in games avery missed with injuries , they were 9133 spleen injuries are not uncommon in contact sports in the 2001 playoffs , colorado center peter forsberg sustained a ruptured spleen , which had to be removed rangers center red sullivan nearly died in a game in the late 1950s when he was speared in the stomach and sustained a ruptured spleen the rangers will now have to try to dig out of their hole without avery and possibly without centers blair betts and chris drury betts was hit in his left cheekbone with the puck tuesday night renney said betts might have fractured the cheekbone and his prognosis was uncertain drury left tuesday night s game for a while with an unspecified torso injury , and he will also be evaluated thursday morning the injury to avery , though , was the most serious and it took the team by surprise wednesday morning most of the players did not know what had happened until after practice we were on the ice and we knew he was getting evaluated , forward ryan callahan said we 're definitely going to miss him he s a real big part of the team he s come up with some real big points , scored big goals and obviously gets under the other team s skin the turn of events overshadowed what would have been the biggest issue of the rangers' potential elimination game whether this will be forward jaromir jagr s last stand in new york jagr , the 36yearold captain , faces unrestricted free agency at season s end and has frequently alluded to the possibility of playing elsewhere but he made it clear wednesday that he was not counting himself or the rangers out once you get down , 30 , you 've got to look for something positive , jagr said of course it s tough because only two teams did it , but it s not impossible let me tell you one thing there are millions of playoff series played in hockey over those years you 're going to forget a lot of them but if you can do something special , everybody s going to talk about it there s a chance people dream about that stuff so do i it never happened to me i 've never been down , 30 , and come back that s what makes it special heading into wednesday night s games , jagr was tied for third among playoff scorers with 12 points he has been a dominating factor in several games , including game 3 despite the loss avery was the center of attention in the firstround playoff victory against the devils , mostly for his persistent antagonism of goaltender martin brodeur his stickwaving distraction of brodeur during one power play prompted the nhl to revise its rules so it qualified as unsportsmanlike conduct even before the series with pittsburgh started , the penguins were on guard when it came to avery but they expressed sympathy wednesday when they heard he was hospitalized you never like to see that happen , penguins center sidney crosby told reporters after practice at the garden on wednesday on the ice , things always happen it s emotional and intense guys are not the best of friends on the ice , but you never want to see someone s health in jeopardy i think we all wish him the best once the rangers were reassured that avery would eventually be fine , they turned their attention to their team s playoff health , which is not in the best shape , either
it was a moment straight out of the rules corner section of baseball digest and the yankees couldn t stop howling about it after their 30 win over texas on thursday night there was one out in the top of the ninth inning , and wilson betemit was on first jose molina hit a bouncing ball to rangers second baseman ian kinsler inexplicably , betemit retreated to the bag instead of running instead of flipping to second to start a double play , kinsler threw to first baseman chris davis , whose foot was on the base davis caught the ball to force molina , and at some point in the ensuing confusion , he also tagged betemit but when davis forced molina out , the force play was off on betemit he was standing on the base , so it still belonged to him betemit was safe , and he eventually came around to score the yankees final run that s something that none of us had ever seen , manager joe girardi said he thought it was a popup and that got us an extra run you have to tag the runner first and then step on the bag mike mussina and derek jeter were cracking up about it afterwards they had never seen such a play , either i didn t see betemit after the game , but if he really thought it was a pop up , maybe he should get a new prescription for those goggles he wears he had his glasses on , girardi said , smiling wilson s smarter than all of us
islamabad , pakistan s premier military intelligence agency has lost control of some of the networks of pakistani militants it has nurtured since the 1980s , and is now suffering the violent blowback of that policy , two former senior intelligence officials and other officials close to the agency say as the military has moved against them , the militants have turned on their former handlers , the officials said joining with other extremist groups , they have battled pakistani security forces and helped militants carry out a record number of suicide attacks last year , including some aimed directly at army and intelligence units as well as prominent political figures , possibly even benazir bhutto the growing strength of the militants , many of whom now express support for al qaeda s global jihad , presents a grave threat to pakistan s security , as well as nato efforts to push back the taliban in afghanistan american officials have begun to weigh more robust covert operations to go after al qaeda in the lawless border areas because they are so concerned that the pakistani government is unable to do so the unusual disclosures regarding pakistan s leading military intelligence agency , or the isi emerged in interviews last month with former senior pakistani intelligence officials the disclosures confirm some of the worst fears , and suspicions , of american and western military officials and diplomats the interviews , a rare glimpse inside a notoriously secretive and opaque agency , offered a string of other troubling insights likely to refocus attention on the isi s role as pakistan moves toward elections on feb 18 and a battle for control of the government looms one former senior pakistani intelligence official , as well as other people close to the agency , acknowledged that the isi led the effort to manipulate pakistan s last national election in 2002 , and offered to drop corruption cases against candidates who would back president pervez musharraf a person close to the isi said mr musharraf had now ordered the agency to ensure that the coming elections were free and fair , and denied that the agency was working to rig the vote but the acknowledgment of past rigging is certain to fuel opposition fears of new meddling the two former highranking intelligence officials acknowledged that after sept 11 , 2001 , when president musharraf publicly allied pakistan with the bush administration , the isi could not rein in the militants it had nurtured for decades as a proxy force to exert pressure on india and afghanistan after the agency unleashed hardline islamist beliefs , the officials said , it struggled to stop the ideology from spreading another former senior intelligence official said dozens of isi officers who trained militants had come to sympathize with their cause and had had to be expelled from the agency he said three purges had taken place since the late 1980s and included the removal of three isi directors suspected of being sympathetic to the militants none of the former intelligence officials who spoke to the new york times agreed to be identified when talking about the isi , an agency that has gained a fearsome reputation for interfering in almost every aspect of pakistani life but two former american intelligence officials agreed with much of what they said about the agency s relationship with the militants so did other sources close to the isi , who admitted that the agency had supported militants in afghanistan and kashmir , although they said they had been ordered to do so by political leaders the former intelligence officials appeared to feel freer to speak as mr musharraf s eight years of military rule weakened , and as a power struggle for control over the government looms between mr musharraf and opposition political parties the officials were interviewed before the assassination of ms bhutto , the opposition leader , on dec 27 since then , the government has said that pakistani militants linked to al qaeda are the foremost suspects in her killing her supporters have accused the government of a hidden hand in the attack while the author of ms bhutto s death remains a mystery , the interviews with the former intelligence officials made clear that the agency remained unable to control the militants it had fostered the threat from the militants , the former intelligence officials warned , is one that pakistan is unable to contain we could not control them , said one former senior intelligence official , who spoke on condition of anonymity we indoctrinated them and told them , you will go to heaven' you cannot turn it around so suddenly after 9 11 , the bush administration pressed mr musharraf to choose a side in fighting islamist extremism and to abandon pakistan s longtime support for the taliban and other islamist militants in the 1990s , the isi supported the militants as a proxy force to contest indiancontrolled kashmir , the border territory that india and pakistan both claim , and to gain a controlling influence in neighboring afghanistan in the 1980s , the united states supported militants , too , funneling billions of dollars to islamic fighters battling soviet forces in afghanistan through the isi , vastly increasing the agency s size and power publicly , mr musharraf agreed to reverse course in 2001 , and he has received 10 billion in aid for pakistan since then in return in an interview in november , he vehemently defended the conduct of the isi , an agency that , according to american officials , was under his firm control for the last eight years while he served as both president and army chief mr musharraf dismissed criticism of the isi s relationship with the militants he cited the deaths of 1 , 000 pakistani soldiers and police officers in battles with the militants in recent years as well as several assassination attempts against himself as proof of the seriousness of pakistan s counterterrorism effort it is quite illogical if you think those people who have suffered 1 , 000 people dead , and i who have been attacked thrice or four or five times , that i would be supportive towards taliban , towards al qaeda , mr musharraf said these are ridiculous things that discourages and demoralizes but some former american intelligence officials have argued that mr musharraf and the isi never fully jettisoned their militant prot g s , and instead carried on a doublegame they say mr musharraf cooperated with american intelligence agencies to track down foreign qaeda members while holding taliban commanders and kashmiri militants in reserve in order to undercut major opposition parties , he wooed religious conservatives , according to analysts and instead of carrying out a crackdown , mr musharraf took halfmeasures i think he would make a decision when a situation arises , said hasan askari rizvi , a leading pakistani military analyst , referring to militants openly confronting the government but before that he would not alienate any side there is little dispute that pakistan s crackdown on the militants has been at best uneven , but key sources interviewed by the times disagreed on why most western officials in pakistan say they believe , as pakistani officials , including president musharraf , insist , that the agency is well disciplined , like the army , and is in no sense a rogue or outofcontrol organization acting contrary to the policies of the leadership a senior western military official in pakistan said that if the isi was covertly aiding the taliban , the decision would come from the top of the government , not the agency that s not an isi decision , the official said that s a governmentofpakistan decision but former pakistani intelligence officials insisted that mr musharraf had ordered a crackdown on all militants it was never fully carried out , however , because of opposition within his government and within isi , they said one former senior intelligence official said that some officials in the government and the isi thought the militants should be held in reserve , as insurance against the day when american and nato forces abandoned the region and pakistan might again need them as a lever against india we had a school of thought that favored retention of this capability , the former senior intelligence official said some senior ministers and officials in mr musharraf s government sympathized with the militants and protected them , former intelligence officials said still others advised a goslow approach , fearing a backlash against the government from the militants when arrests were ordered , the police refused to carry them out in some cases until they received written orders , believing the militants were still protected by the isi , as they had been for years inside the isi , there was division as well one part of the isi hunted down militants , the officials said , while another continued to work with them the result was confusion in interviews in 2002 , kashmiri militants in pakistan said they had been told by the government to maintain a low profile and wait but as pakistani military operations in the tribal areas intensified , along with airstrikes by ciaoperated drones , militant groups there issued highly charged and sometimes exaggerated accounts of women and children being killed the first suicide bombing attack on a military target outside the tribal areas came days after an airstrike on a madrasa in the tribal area of bajaur in october 2006 killed scores of people another turning point came last july when pakistani forces stormed the red mosque in islamabad , where militants had armed themselves in a compound less than a mile from isi headquarters and demanded the imposition of islamic law government officials said that more than 100 people died the militants have insisted that thousands did several weeks later , militants carried out the first direct attacks on isi employees suicide bombers twice attacked buses ferrying agency employees , killing 18 on sept 4 and 15 more on nov 24 according to pakistani analysts , the attacks signaled that enraged militants had turned on their longtime patrons one militant leader , maulana masood azhar , typifies how extremists once trained by the isi have broken free of the agency s control , turned against the government and joined with other militants to create powerful new networks in 2000 , mr azhar received support from the isi when he founded jaishemuhammad , or army of muhammad , a pakistani militant group fighting indian forces in kashmir , according to robert grenier , who served as the central intelligence agency station chief in islamabad from 1999 to 2002 the isi intermittently provided training and operational coordination to such groups , he said , but struggled to fully control them mr musharraf banned jaishemuhammad and detained mr azhar after militants carried out an attack on the indian parliament building in december 2001 indian officials accused jaishemuhammad and another pakistani militant group of masterminding the attack after india massed hundreds of thousands of troops on pakistan s border , mr musharraf vowed in a nationally televised speech that january to crack down on all militants in pakistan we will take strict action against any pakistani who is involved in terrorism inside the country or abroad , he said two weeks later , a britishborn member of mr azhar s group , ahmed omar sheikh , kidnapped daniel pearl , a reporter for the wall street journal who was beheaded by his captors mr sheikh surrendered to the isi , the agency that had supported jaishemuhammad , and was sentenced to death for the kidnapping after mr pearl s killing , pakistani officials arrested more than 2 , 000 people in a crackdown but within a year , mr azhar and most of the 2 , 000 militants who had been arrested were freed i never believed that government ties with these groups was being irrevocably cut , said mr grenier , now a managing director at kroll , a risk consulting firm at the same time , pakistan seemingly went through the motions when it came to hunting taliban leaders who fled into pakistan after the 2001 american invasion of afghanistan , he said encouraged by the united states , the pakistanis focused their resources on arresting senior qaeda members , he said , which they successfully did from 2002 to 2005 since then , arrests have slowed as al qaeda and other militant groups have become more entrenched in the tribal areas asked in 2006 why the pakistani government did not move against the leading taliban commander jalaluddin haqqani , and his son sirajuddin , who are based in the tribal areas and have long had links with al qaeda , one senior isi official said it was because pakistan needed to retain some assets of its own that policy haunts mr musharraf and the united states , according to american and pakistani analysts today pakistan s tribal areas are host to a lethal stew of foreign qaeda members , uzbek militants , taliban , isitrained pakistani extremists , disgruntled tribesmen and new recruits the groups carried out a record number of suicide bombings in pakistan and afghanistan last year and have been tied to three major terrorist plots in britain and germany since 2005 mr azhar , who once served his isi mentors in kashmir , is thought to be hiding in the tribal area of bajaur , or nearby dir , and fighting pakistani security forces , according to one former intelligence official militants who took part in the red mosque siege in islamabad in july were closely affiliated with mr azhar s group this fall , his group fielded fighters in the swat valley , the famous tourist spot , where the militants presented a challenge of new proportions to the government , seizing several districts and mounting battles against pakistani forces that left scores dead one militant from a banned sectarian group who joined mr azhar s group , qari zafar , now trains insurgents in south waziristan on how to rig roadside bombs and vests for suicide bombings , according to the former intelligence official cooperation against the taliban fighting in afghanistan has improved since 2006 , and three senior taliban figures have been caught , according to western officials and sources close to the isi yet doubts remain about the pakistani government s intentions senior provincial isi officials continue to meet with highlevel members of the taliban in the border provinces , according to one western diplomat it is not illogical to surmise that cooperation is on the agenda , and not just debriefing , the diplomat said there are groups they know they have lost control of , the western diplomat added but the government moved only against those groups that have attacked the pakistani state , the diplomat said , adding , it seems very difficult for them to write them off western officials say that before mr musharraf resigned as army chief in december , he appointed a loyalist to run the isi and appears determined to retain power over the agency even as a civilian president for as long as he can , musharraf will keep trying to control these organizations , a western diplomat said i do n't think we should expect this man to become an elder statesman as we know it that puts mr musharraf s successor as army chief , gen ashfaq parvez kayani , who headed the isi from 2004 to 2007 , in a potentially pivotal position general kayani , a proamerican moderate , is loyal to mr musharraf to a point , according to retired officers but he will abandon him if he thinks mr musharraf s actions are significantly undermining the standing of the pakistani army mr musharraf will maintain control over the agency as long as his interests coincide with general kayani s , they said , while the new civilian prime minister who emerges from february s elections is likely to have far less authority over the agency opposition political parties already accuse the agency of meddling in next month s election the western diplomat called the isi the army s dirty bag of tricks since ms bhutto s assassination , members of her party have accused government officials , including former isi agents , of having a hidden hand in the attack or of knowing about a plot and failing to inform ms bhutto american experts played down the chances of a government conspiracy against ms bhutto they also said it was unlikely that lowlevel or retired officers working alone or with militants carried out the attack but nearly half of pakistanis said in a recent poll that they suspected that government agencies or progovernment politicians had assassinated ms bhutto such suspicion stems from decades of interference in elections and politics by the isi , according to analysts , as well as a high level of domestic surveillance , intimidation and threats to journalists , academics and human rights activists , which former intelligence officials also acknowledged pakistani and american experts say that distrust speaks to the urgent need to reform a hugely powerful intelligence agency that pakistan s military rulers have used for decades to suppress political opponents , manipulate elections and support militant groups pakistan would certainly be better off if the isi were never used for domestic political purposes , said mr grenier , the former cia islamabad station chief that goes without saying pakistani analysts and western diplomats argue that the country will remain unstable as long as the isi remains so powerful and so unaccountable the isi has grown more powerful in each period of military rule , they said civilian leaders , including mrs bhutto , could not resist using it to secure their political aims , but neither could they control it and the army continues to rely on the isi for its own foreign policy aims , particularly battling india in kashmir and seeking influence in afghanistan the question is , how do you change that \? asked one western diplomat their tentacles are everywhere
london the danish choreographer kim brandstrup is little known in the united states , but that is not the case in britain , where he studied at the london contemporary dance school in the early 1980s and later formed his own troupe , arc over the last two decades he has created pieces for many of the major classical and contemporary companies in britain , and his most recent commission is from none other than the  it s a disappointment mr brandstrup made a name for himself with highly theatrical pieces , often drawn from famous literature , and an inventive physical language this new work , rushes fragments of a lost story , which i saw on thursday and friday nights as part of a triple bill at the , is loosely based on early drafts of dostoyevsky s 1868 novel the idiot , but it would n't matter if you never knew that despite the striking visual effects created by the designer richard hudson and the lighting designer jean kalman shimmering , translucent curtains of silvery strands , geometric boxes of light that vaguely evoke constructivist art , sketchy projections of trees the ballet is essentially an old idea guy loves temptress who ignores him while he ignores the good girl who loves him rushes is set to prokofiev s nearly forgotten score for the queen of spades , a film that was to be directed by mikhail romm in the 1930s but was not made mr brandstrup learned about the partial score after reading about it here the music has been arranged and elaborated by michael berkeley the ballet itself is essentially one long pas de deux for the hero with one or other of the women , with six corps de ballet couples swirling ineffectually in the background , often behind the curtain the schematic nature of the storythatis n't might not matter so much if mr brandstrup created interesting movement for his highpowered dancers , but the choreography never reaches for anything more than bigeffect ballet \( legs up ! high jump ! back arched ! \) and dramatic partnering \( woman slung over back of man ! woman thrown to floor ! \) and the score , while occasionally hinting at the complexity of greater prokofiev works , mostly sounds just like film music , background to the action on friday night carlos acosta brought something of his star power to the role of the man , and both alina cojocaru , drably outfitted in grey , and laura morera , slinky in red , danced beautifully on thursday , thomas whitehead did a perfectly capable if less charismatic job , and leanne benjamin \( the innocent \) and tamara rojo \( the femme fatale \) could n't be faulted for lack of passionate commitment to their roles but the choreography does the emoting for the dancers , and any potential nuance is steamrolled in its path the triple bill opened with balanchine s serenade , impeccably staged by patricia neary the royal ballet danced it with a softness and a precision that are quite unlike the new york city ballet s account of the piece it s positively unsettling to see all the arms and heads of the corps de ballet angled exactly alike both casts also gave a more dramatic slant to the hints of narrative the evocation of loss , perhaps death in the work but this sense of drama did n't veer into acting sarah lamb in particular gave a moving account of her role , musical and fleet in her solos , dignified and grieving at the end the program closed with homage to the queen , a revision of s 1953 work \( celebrating the coronation of elizabeth ii \) to music by malcolm arnold the ballet now has sections by three other choreographers david bintley \( earth \) , michael corder \( water \) and christopher wheeldon \( fire \) but the best part is still ashton s concluding air , full of intricate interwoven steps and soaring lifts its central female role was performed with a lovely demure delicacy by ms rojo , but the general effect of this ballet is of a lot of steps , a lot of pomp , and not much else

worth 18million , according to tsn 3 38 it will be very interesting to get the tsn panels opinion on why the big names have not moved yet with all the second and third ranked players signing , how much money is going to be left for the big fish \? 3 33 the xm guys wonder what s going on with the rangers \? 3 31 tarik elbashir writes on his wash post caps blog that the deal with theodore is for

raycroft , just cut loose by the leafs he ll partner with peter budaj 3 03 nothing from the caps website or the wash post yet on the theo signing it will be interesting to see what george mcphee s thinking is on this deal theo has only periodically shown his hart trophy form since he s been away from the habs although he had a terrific first round last spring he is younger than huet don t know what huet was asking but theo is getting 16 mil over three years 2 58 here s the tsn story on no way jose going to the caps as their new goaler 2 55 xm says tsn says jose theodore has signed to play

news shares our concern about the lightning not signing defenseman 2 27 the funny thing about this year is that there have been very few players moving team to team and none of the big names that s much different than previous years when the big names went first and the lesser names followed perhaps when one big name signs , the log jam will break 2 24 the pens signed their fa defenseman mark eaton for two years at a million a year , says tsn 2 21 this is a little complicated and obscure , but bob mckenzie explained yesterday on tsn s site that this season , teams will have tough time fitting performance bonuses into the salary cap and the consequences of that provision of the cba between the players and owners is that the teams have less money to spend than they thought they did 2 16 the devils and sergei brylin didn t agree on a deal , but lou has not closed the door on resigning him  2 07 tsn s dreger is reporting that sundin , still \( wink , wink \) undecided about playing

was answering questions about ownership s legal problems the closing copyright credit came on and in mid sentence , he was gone an xm promo came on , then a nhl network promotion and now they re showing the avswild playoff series from last spring the lesson \? don t go over your alloted time on your own network so the nhl live show is over and we ll turn on our xm tuner now and surf around for more info from other sources 1 57 mr , bettman dodges answering much on the status of the rangersnhl legal problems , as he should 1 56 ej asks what concerns him and he says a couple of teams he d like to see do better at the gate and some of that is competitively driven but things are healthier than they ve ever been 1 55 ej asks if the high cap floor is a concern for teams and mr bettman replies , it may be , but shouldn t be they may be the most revenue challenged teams but they can get revenue sharing which helps them so the floor with revenue sharing helps them 1 48 wonder if they ve actually closed the deal to buy the lightning yet 1 45 mr bettman has dropped by the xm studio and says the tampa bay owners are certainly causing a stir they re creating lots of excitement but he does say there is a learning curve and he praises their enthusiasm 1 44 looking at mike russo s blog again , he says the andrew brunette deal is not signed yet , but it s close 1 40 ej says that miro satan is likely done on the island don adds he s too expensive for a team not in the playoffs but ej reminds us that teams have to spend to get to the 40 million floor payroll 1 38 the sportsnet tracker has the previously reported kyle wellwood to vancouver signing he had to wait until today to make it official as well 1 36 checking russo s blog , he says the deal is zidlicky for jones and a second rounder and that has also been reported by bob mckenzie on tsn 1 34 propsect ryan jones goes to nashville in that deal a pick is also involved going the other way 1 30 ej says mike russo of the minny startribune is reporting that the wild have indeed brought andrew burnette back and have traded with the preds for marek zidlicky we ll try to find more details 1 28 the official nhl free agent list of ufas and rfas with all the different classifications thereof has been released here it is  1 23 there are reports ollie kolzig will sign with tampa bay he d be a good choice there to share the goaltending job with mike smith 1 20 john has signed off xm , but he also said the rangers should trade for dan boyle , who they ve long wanted , and make a push for orpik , which would drastically change the rangers defense for the better mark streit of montreal is a player he likes on d more than brian campbell and is more affordable 1 17 as for shanny , john says it s hard to bring him back and that he s blocking the development of prucha and callahan , that he can t play in traffic any more but he s still a terrific locker room presence 1 14 john also says that sundin asked to speak with the rangers and the rangers weren t interested in sundin at the price he was asking that s different that what larry brooks has reported in the post , that nyr was hot after mats 1 11 john believes avery will go somewhere else , that the rangers won t meet his price and he won t cave he says avery s impact on the team wasn t as big last season as it was his first year with the team , that there s a limit with him , he s a third line player and he s asking for more than third line money 1 10 rangers fans have probably already read this , but for the rest of the world , here s dell s blog for today  1 07 dell does not believe the omsk offer was three years 35 million , but less , but jj wants the most on the rangers , slats won t give it to him and that s part of the impasse and why he s available today 1 04 dell and ej are both miffed that the rangers couldn t sign their top three f a s jags , avery and rozival dell believes jj really wants to play for nyr 1 02 john dellapina from the daily news will be a guest on the xm show and he might shed some light on the rangers various free agents and targets 12 58 blake wheeler is officially a free agent today , and he already said he s sign with the bruins and it is now official he was a coyotes draft pick who wouldn t sign with them and he was officially available starting today , but he was spoken for and now it

annually 12 46 defenseman anton babchuk returns to the canes from russia with pitkanen , it gives them two defensemen , which they needed after losing both hedican and wesley 12 45 eric duhatschek in his globe and mail blog has a post on the flames moves , getting bourque and cole to add depth to the wings 12 42 we wrote in yesterday s morning skate about the curious record of the new lightning ownership and management and one thing we neglected to say was that we wonder why they are heavying up on forwards and trying to move their best \( by far \) defenseman dan boyle these guys need reliable defensemen especially because their goaltending is an unknown , but they haven t looked much in that direction they did swing a deal for janne niskala from philly , but the word is he has some questions on his defensive game , while his offensive skills are nhlready so that s not really helping them 12 36 the tsn site is back up , but they have nothing we don t at the moment 12 34 after a strong first 20 minutes , deals done under deadline pressure , things seem to have slowed down 12 28 mike green says he hopes that huet resigns with the caps 12 27 we ve been trying to log onto tsn s website but to no avail could be they ve crashed , been swamped by too much traffic 12 24 no word yet on sean avery , but the rangers fan blog rangerlandnet had a very funny fake interview with him over the weekend there s a little break here as the xm guys interview the caps mike green , so you might want to read it here 12 14 darren dreger says on tsn s website that the pens and evgeni malkin will agree on a fiveyear deal averaging 87 million the penguins also agreed to a threeyear deal with forward pascal dupuis for three years at 14 million per season 12 12 ej reminds us

free agent market opens today at noon we ve got the maple leaf flag flying out front , my ancient laptop is fired up , and so are we of course , if nothing much happens , we ll probably use the free

night and this morning the devs resigned dman bryce salvador for four years at about 29 mil a year the caps signed a big deal with their young stud dman mike green , four years and 21 mil total the

lists how much money each team has committed in salary for this year and with the cap set at 567 million , you can do the math to see how much room they have
los angeles the attitude of white , liberal hollywood toward african american churches has long been one of almost participatory respect whether it s gospel brunch at the house of blues on sunset boulevard , or the blind boys of alabama on the ipod , or a serious reverential mention of the southern christian leadership conference over dinner , the understanding is clear the black church is a foundational institution in the history of the civil rights struggle , and its music \( although it makes reference to jesus christ as a personal savior \) is smoking hot it was only recently that the alist discovered that this love is unrequited last month , proposition 8 passed , making gay marriage illegal in california , and the demographic that lent insult to injury was the state s africanamerican voters they came to the polls in record numbers to support barack obama , and they brought with them a fiercely held and enduring antipathy toward homosexuality 7 in 10 blacks voted in support of traditional marriage whether that was the gamechanger or not is a question for nearconstant debate many gay activists have begun quietly to suggest that had hillary clinton been the democratic nominee , prop 8 would not have passed of the values progressives hold dear , none can be as central or as cherished as the promotion of diversity it is a word that has become almost a term of art when a private school champions its embrace of diversity , parents understand that the admissions office is not dying to enroll the son of a white evangelical minister or the daughter of a founding partner of a whiteshoe law firm rather , we know that the school makes an intentional effort to include children of certain minority groups among its student body , and that most important among those groups are africanamericans and the children of gay families leftleaning california s horror about this newly revealed schism between two of its favorite sons is a situation that cries out for a villain , but the one that liberal white hollywood has chosen for the role probably wo n't make it all the way to the third act it s their churches , somebody whispered to one of us not long after the election it s their christianity , someone else hissed , rolling her eyes apparently the religion espoused by the rev dr martin luther king jr is now the enemy , at least among the smart set , and if this sounds like a regional issue , it s not what we in california have been forced to confront , before anyone had even had the chance to sweep up the tinsel or plop the first alkaseltzers into the glasses of water after that heavenly night in grant park , is that there s a big difference between coalition politics and rainbow party politics a coalition is composed of groups that may dislike or even hate one another , but who understand the shared political expediency of standing together rainbow party politics involve bringing together masses of people who are identified by being burdened by a particular grievance soon enough in groups forged of such friable bonds , and almost always when matters of morality and lifestyle come into play you will discover that one oppressed group does not necessarily support the goals of another oppressed group hollywood , of course , is a city full of statesmen and moral authorities , and many of them ran to their pulpits and web sites to get on the right side of this issue , but there was no way to hold both truths together in a position that was both acceptably liberal and coherent at some point in our lifetime , said george clooney , gay marriage wo n't be an issue , and everyone who stood against this civil right will look as outdated as george wallace standing on the school steps keeping james hood from entering the university of alabama because he was black to the opponents of proposition 8 , this kind of analogy is a rallying cry but as white hollywood has recently discovered , to the blacks who voted for the measure , it s galling comparing the infringement on civil rights that gays are experiencing to that suffered by black americans is to begin a game of top my oppression that you 're not going to win the struggle for equality beginning with freedom from human bondage \( see references to the book of exodus at the gospel brunch \) has been so central to africanamerican identity that many blacks find homosexual claims of a commensurate level of injustice frivolous , and even offensive furthermore and perhaps even more painfully for those of us who support gay marriage and all that it represents christian teaching on marriage is not the only reason so many blacks supported proposition 8 although it has come as a shocking realization to many in this community , a host of sociological studies confirm that many blacks feel a significant aversion to homosexuality itself , finding it morally and sexually repugnant and here in essence is the problem with the democrats' big tent , as well as the grounds for a wholly new kind of culture war that is probably going to make us long for the clear lines and simple enmities of the old one the new deal coalition was a mass movement based on building a more just economic and political order , embracing protestant evangelicals and catholic immigrants , segregationists and integrationists , radical leftwingers and unionized working men from the steel belt , all holding their noses with one hand and pulling the lever with the other many of us who voted for mr obama want the same things that the new dealers wanted we are n't trying to advance a cause as much as we want to regain so much lost ground this is our moment , the presidentelect has told us , stirringly this is our time to stand shoulder to shoulder , the hipsters of washington square and the minivan moms of minnetonka our nation is seeing huge numbers of its citizens slide into actual and virtually intractable , if we keep hold of president bush s policies poverty we can stand together on these big issues , or we can balkanize ourselves with the help of good oldfashioned identity politics , which did n't serve too well the last time around as anyone who ever had to sit through a lecture on the paradox of tolerance can tell you , it s possible to create a vast utopian society forged of many previously disenfranchised groups but you do n't want to ask too many questions
president bush s plan to end the national ban on offshore drilling isn t getting much love from the blogosphere , although conservative columnist don surber does his best  here is the price americans are paying for pristine coastlines 4 a gallon for gasoline and 5 for a box of cereal president bush wants to end this nonsense it will be fun to see democrats trot out their save the polar bear talking points again rasmussen reported 67 percent of americans want to drill and fill that s more than double the percent who want us out of iraq immediately \( surber also thinks the press has been wrong to call this a flipflop by the president , and cites this league of conservation voters press release as evidence \) steve benen of the liberal carpetbagger report , however , thinks the gop is grasping at straws  republicans seem thrilled to have something specific to add to their talking points this is , however , a slight problem for all of the leading gop officials who have opposed coastal drilling , some as recently as last week the ban on coastal drilling was first enacted in 1982 , and has been widely accepted by both parties ever since this has been especially true of republican presidential candidates , in large part because coastal drilling has been wildly unpopular in florida and california , which combine for about a fourth of the electoral votes needed to win the white house but that was before gas hit 4 per gallon now , bush has flipflopped and so has john mccain and so has florida gov charlie crist , rumored to be a leading vp possibility , who was asked just last week about whether he s dropping his opposition to drilling for oil off of florida s coast i am not , crist said no , i don t like it yesterday , he reversed course and embraced ending the ban it s certainly possible a lot of voters will fall for this many will likely conclude that the way to lower prices is to increase supply , and if that means coastal drilling , so be it there are , however , a few problems with this most notably , for those struggling to afford filling their tanks , coastal drilling won t offer much of a break for a very long time tom firey of the cato institute s liberty blog tries , without much hope , to bring some common sense to the table  already , drilling proponents and environmentalist opponents are gearing up for battle , and the presidential candidates are sounding off on the idea none of their comments , so far , offer anything useful for public policy for people who want good policy , here are some points to consider good public policy would examine the risks and costs underlying both of these concerns , and then make a decision \( or perhaps a compromise \) about drilling however , this issue will not be decided in such a rational way the debate will be dominated by two ideological camps the drill at any cost crowd and the don t drill at any cost crowd and their ideological priors and political power will preempt any good policy discussion
none of us have ever lived through an election at a time when 80 percent of voters think the country is headed in the wrong direction but now that we 're in the thick of it , a few things are clear from voters , the demand is surprise me most for candidates , the lesson is weirdness wins last winter , barack obama succeeded by running a weird campaign he was n't just a normal politician aiming for office , he was going to cleanse the country of the babyboom culture war mentality in his soaring speeches , he denounced the mores of both the clinton and bush eras and made an argument for unity and hope over endless partisan warfare but over the course of the spring , obama s campaign got less weird the crucial pivot came when he failed to seize on mccain s offer to do a series of joint townhall meetings across the country those meetings would have elevated the race and shown that obama is willing to take risks in order to truly change the way things are done instead , obama s speeches became more conventional , more policyspecific and more orthodox his denver acceptance speech was different from his iowa speeches it was more traditionally antirepublican and prodemocratic in the speech s crucial contrast obama declared it s time for them to own their failure it s time for us to change america you see , we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country as david broder noted , obama s speech subordinated any talk of fundamental systemic change to a checklist of traditional democratic programs it is easy to see why obama might tack this way democrats have a huge advantage in a straightup issue contest mccain is vulnerable on health care and the economy but by campaigning in this traditional way , obama ceded the weirdness edge to mccain the old warrior jumped right in think about how weird last week was the republican convention was one long protest against the way the republicans themselves have run washington mccain s convention speech barely mentioned his own party his vicepresidential nominee came out of the blue and seems totally unlike the regular crowd of former eighthgrade class presidents who normally dominate public life mccain s campaign ideology , exemplified in a new ad released on monday , is not familiar conservatism it s maverickism against the entrenched powers and party orthodoxies and it all worked mccain got a huge postconvention bounce in the polls now the campaign has become a battle between two different definitions of change the obama camp has become the champion of policy change after eight years of failed bushmccain policies , it is time for different , democratic ones the mccain campaign is the champion of systemic change after two decades of bickering and selfdealing , its time to shake up the whole system in order to get things done the obama change is more responsible and specific , but it has all the weirdness of a brookings institution report \( not that there s anything wrong with that \) the mccain promise of change is comprehensive and vehement , though it s hard to know how it would actually work in office it will still be hard for mccain to win in this environment , but his emphasis on broad systemic change may appeal to swing voters independent voters do not believe the country s problems can be solved merely by replacing republicans with democrats they cast a pox on both houses that s why they 're independents furthermore , the maverick theme allows mccain to talk directly about character obama can hint at his values when he describes his tax cuts and health care plans , but he is indirect most voters , especially ones who decide late , vote on character over policies if i were advising the candidates , i 'd tell them to double down on weirdness obama needs to occasionally criticize his own side if he ca n't take on his own party hacks , he 'll never reclaim the mantle of systemic change specifically , he needs to attack the snobs who are savaging sarah palin s faith and family many liberals claim to love workingclass families , but the moment they glimpse a hunter with an uneven college record , they hop on chairs and call for disinfectant obama needs to attack bill maher for calling her a stewardess and the rest of the coastal condescenders if i were mccain , i 'd make the divided government argument explicit the republicans are intellectually unfit to govern right now , but balancing with democrats , they might be able to do some good i 'd have mccain tell the country that he looks forward to working with congressional democrats , that he is confident they can achieve great things together the candidates probably wo n't take this kind of advice but remember weirdness wins surprise me most
he sits abandoned and bitter in his luxury condominium at united nations plaza the electronic monitoring bracelet is off his ankle , but he cannot travel without court permission , and his curfew is 11 pm rage at the government seems to be s constant companion once a highflying investor who rode the technologystock bubble and spread his largess throughout the cultural world , mr vilar tumbled off the stage on may 26 , 2005 , when he was arrested on charges of defrauding clients of his firm , amerindo investment advisors with his trial opening on monday the same day his beloved metropolitan opera starts its season mr vilar sounds defiant about his legal troubles and still boastful about his past financial success he is angry at prosecutors and the news coverage and disillusioned about those he once counted as friends i 've been fighting some charges i think are preposterous , and thank god they 're going to trial soon , mr vilar , 67 , said , speaking slowly and quietly the strict conditions of his 10 million bail have been eased but i do n't lead a very normal life , he said , with the brutality of the criminal justice system on my back mr vilar had already suffered a fall from grace before his arrest , when arts institutions disclosed that he had failed to keep up with his pledges the metropolitan opera to which he promised 20 million but , by his own admission , gave half of that took his name off its grand tier the royal opera at covent garden in london removed vilar from its floral hall the took his picture out of its programs now the united states government will lay out the full extent of its allegations jury selection starts on monday , with opening arguments on thursday before judge richard j sullivan in united states district court in manhattan the trial is expected to last seven weeks mr vilar s business partner , gary a tanaka , will also go on trial he looks forward to this longawaited day in court and his opportunity to vindicate himself and his name , said mr tanaka s lawyer , glenn c colton the 12count indictment alleges conspiracy to commit securities fraud , investment adviser fraud , mail fraud , wire fraud and money laundering the combined prison terms would amount to more than 150 years in interviews several days before the trial , mr vilar said a dispute with a client was trumped up into a criminal matter he denounced prosecutors for saying early during the highly publicized case that 5 million in allegedly stolen money was the tip of the iceberg you know what s missing \? he said zero the government is saying , none of your clients lost a penny , and you 've got to go to jail for the rest of your life' mr vilar blamed his highprofile philanthropy for the prosecution if i had been another guy who said , gee , put another picasso on the wall , ' they probably would n't have bothered me , he said the united states attorney s office declined to comment , but government documents allege 17 million has gone missing mr vilar also finds it painful , he said , that the board members and cultural officials who benefited from his patronage have abandoned him the notion of presumed innocence does n't exist , he added i'm disappointed to say that 99pointx percent of people i knew have n't had the decency to pick up the telephone and say anything , like , my prayers are with you' even members of his small family have turned their backs on him , mr vilar said he said he spends most of his time alone in his 25thfloor apartment overlooking the east river and the united nations , surrounded by the trappings of a cultural life legal documents and binders covering glass tables and the floor are the anomaly in his 5 , 500squarefoot living room , with its gold brocade drapes , marble floor , paintings and sculptures , and welltuned steinway baby grand piano a largerthanlifesize bronze statue of the child mozart has pride of place a reproduction of the met chandelier hangs from the ceiling a framed newspaper photograph showing mr vilar in his old seat at the met , a101 , sits on a side table recordings of the tenors rolando villaz n and fritz wunderlich lie nestled in a cd player tray his life is a far cry from what it was in the mid1990s , when he rode the market boom , especially in technology stocks his funds soared in value , and the profits rolled in mr vilar s investment firm was managing 9 billion , and his wealth at one point was valued at a near 1 billion we were the first investors in probably 15 household tech companies that made it , he said as his fortune grew , mr vilar embarked on a giving spree , pledging some 200 million in all to arts and other institutions he was not shy about announcing his largess , often demanding naming rights for the projects he financed , even suggesting that he be recognized onstage at the met some acquaintances cited a craving for attention and legitimacy mr vilar said he was trying to set an example for potential donors but when the stock bubble burst , starting in 2000 , the value of his funds declined markedly he began defaulting on pledges by as much as half of what he had promised though what he did distribute still makes him a major arts patron many institutions that were happy to take his money started keeping their distance one of the few to retain the vilar name was the vail valley foundation , which runs the vilar performing arts center in beaver creek , colo mr vilar gave about 7 million toward the 15 million cost of building it , said harry frampton iii , the foundation chairman we 're inclined to keep the name , mr frampton said it was a number of years ago he fulfilled his financial commitment last time i checked , he was still innocent after his arrest bail for mr vilar was set at 10 million he spent nearly a month in jail before rounding up enough pledges of assets from friends , including the russian conductor valery gergiev \( a tax lien prevented mr vilar from putting up his apartment as a guarantee \) he was at first confined to his house except to go to church , the doctor and the like conditions were eased in the summer of 2007 , although he still needs court permission to leave town he has visited a relative in puerto rico and attended a civil war reenactment in gettysburg , pa these days , mr vilar said , he spends 10 to 12 hours a day working on his defense he reads , and he is writing a book about his investing career , philanthropy and legal case people would be shocked by the abuse of the justice system , he said he occasionally attended the met last season , catching perhaps a dozen performances , a far cry from the 100 worldwide he said he used to attend to the day i die i'm going to love opera , he said classical music has been the cornerstone of my life meanwhile his lawyers struggled to suppress a mass of evidence seized from amerindo offices , with partial success the case remains relatively narrow , focusing on two types of investment offerings the indictment accuses mr vilar of inducing a victim in 2002 to invest 5 million in a new amerindo fund backed by the government to steer venture capital to small businesses , including biotechnology companies he promised a quarterly return of 250 , 000 the investor has been identified in other court documents as lily cates , an heiress and the mother of the actress phoebe cates she and mr vilar were once close friends , and her investments with amerindo reached 18 million in 2000 , the government said but , the indictment says , mr vilar never had government approval for the fund and steered her money elsewhere , failing to redeem it when she asked for it the government says that mr vilar instead used her funds to make donations for his alma mater , washington and jefferson college in washington , pa , and the american academy in berlin business and personal expenses and the redemption of another customer s investment there s no way they can prove that , mr vilar said she made millions with the firm , and i had complete authorization to invest her money he said that ms cates later got a bee in her bonnet about something and began asking for her money back next thing i know , he added , she files a complaint that we had stolen her money he said he had agreed to return her money only days before his arrest the indictment also accuses the two defendants of establishing a sham product called amerindo guaranteed fixedrate deposit accounts in those accounts , investors' money was said to be put in shortterm debt instruments with little or no risk , high rates of return and liquidity in fact , the government charges , the money was mingled with amerindo s brokerage accounts , and investors were put off when they asked for their money back government documents say two sisters , lisa and debra mayer , whom mr vilar had known in puerto rico , lost 12 million in the scheme that s a 100 percent lie , mr vilar said he acknowledged that some of that money was put in equities , not debt instruments , but called that a regulatory matter and said the money represented less than 1 percent of the firm s overall assets in the interview mr vilar promised to fight on there s no way in kingdom come we 're even going to consider a plea bargain , he said that this can happen in the united states is beyond your wildest imagination
kevin garnett , paul pierce and ray allen had just become teammates last summer when they were ushered onto one of boston s famous duck boats and taken on a tour by celtics coach doc rivers it was a move ripped straight from the phil jackson coaching manual a teambuilding exercise wrapped in a whimsical diversion rivers showed his three superstar players the parade route used by the patriots and the red sox , preaching sacrifice and team defense along the way that poetic moment may soon be enshrined in franchise lore , next to tales of red auerbach s cigars , larry bird s twirling towel and , most certainly , thursday night s stunning comeback victory over jackson and the los angeles lakers the celtics hold a 31 lead in the nba finals after wiping out a 24point deficit in game 4 on sunday night , they are poised to claim the franchise s first championship since 1986 so rivers was asked to retell the story of three allstars , one coach with a teamfirst sermon and one amphibious vehicle i just thought it was important that they saw the route , rivers said friday of the duckboat tour paul knew about it paul has been in boston for so long but kevin and ray , i think they thought we were going on a historic trip of boston i do n't think they really got it at first until we explained to them what we were doing the lessons preached then , and honed in a 66victory regular season , were on full display thursday night at staples center the celtics shut down kobe bryant , flummoxed his lessseasoned teammates and made finals story they set at least three modernday finals records , based on the deficits they faced after the first quarter \( 21 points \) , the first half \( 18 \) , and in the game \( 24 \) they outscored the lakers by 3115 in the third quarter and by 178 in the final five minutes they did it all after losing center kendrick perkins to an injured shoulder \( he s questionable for game 5 \) , and despite the limitations of rajon rondo , who played just 17 minutes on a sprained ankle pierce was asked to guard bryant in the third quarter and held him to 2of7 shooting , while the celtics closed a 20point deficit to 2 freed from checking bryant , allen was able to play all 48 minutes and hit the gameclinching layup with 164 seconds left the fact that ray had strength at the end of the game , i thought , had a lot to do with paul guarding kobe , rivers said and that allowed ray to get some rest the celtics are here , however , because of their team defense , which has turned bryant into a mere mortal for the series , bryant is averaging 268 points and shooting 432 a notable drop from the western conference finals \( 292 points , 533 \) , the semifinals \( 332 , 491 \) and the first round \( 335 , 500 \) in the wake of a devastating defeat , bryant strained to make light of his team s mental state whine about it tonight , a lot of wine , a lot of beer , a couple shots , maybe like 20 of them , he said thursday night jackson called his players together friday for a film session , then turned them loose , without a practice , allowing them to evade the news media we need rest and recuperation in this situation , probably more psychologically than we do physically , jackson said i just told them as a team , they had their heart ripped out it s tough to recover from that , but they will eight teams have won a series after trailing by 31 , but none have done so in the finals since the nba adopted the 232 format , no road team has ever won the last two games the celtics' next duckboat tour may be just days away photo ray allen , driving in game 4 , took a ride through boston with coach doc rivers last summer \( photograph by lucy nicholson reuters \)
chopiniana , which opened the kirov s recent quadruple bill at city center of ballets by michel fokine , is 100 years old this year this is the plotless , romantic dreamworld , poetmuse ballet that used to be known very well known in the west as les sylphides , the title diaghilev gave it in 1909 when he also gave it a different overture and a new d cor , by alexandre benois it was said to be diaghilev s favorite ballet , and for decades it was the epitome of what many dancegoers wanted from ballet atmosphere , romanticism , poetry it has become , however , a rarity among western companies though i can remember seeing three british companies and two pickup troupes perform it in london in 197778 , the only western company i have seen dance it since 1980 is american ballet theater you can understand why some people are n't interested in it all those posey sylphs and that one equally posey poet can easily look like everything that gives ballet a bad name though these kirov performances were n't ideal , they were in basic respects exemplary no soppiness , just focused evocation of the changing moods of this moonlit nocturne chopiniana , by far the richest of fokine s puredance compositions , is brimming with history he had been inspired by an allchopin recital given by isadora duncan on her 19045 visit to st petersburg , including some of the same music here you can still feel her rapturous way of carrying gestures around the stage and her way of turning simple runs , walks and poses into images of inspiration rebuking the virtuoso excess of late 19thcentury ballet , fokine also invoked romantic ballets of chopin s era , like la sylphide and giselle , in which all technical display was subsumed in dramatic expression he was also responding to glazunov s orchestrations of chopin items , to many of the less virtuoso structural features of marius petipa s choreography and to the compositional precedent of lev ivanov s 1895 setting for act iv of swan lake , notably its un poco di chopin episode in that \( as in chopiniana \) a female ensemble frames but constantly responds to the dances for heroine , hero and two female soloists chopiniana in turn became the archetype of a whole 20thcentury genre of ballet in which the prime subject was the music without its kaleidoscope of moods , the chopin ballets of jerome robbins would probably have never happened his dances at a gathering is its radical update balanchine s serenade and emeralds are especially indebted to its romantic groupings one of the choreographic fascinations of chopiniana is that use of the corps de ballet in the opening and closing sections the members of the corps are almost always dancing , using both upper and lower body in orchestral support even when they 're lined up by the wings during most of the central episodes they mainly hold one picturesque tableau after another , but the way those tableaus melt into one another \( sometimes it happens the very moment a soloist enters sometimes it reflects a change of tone in the centerstage dance \) is part of the poem during the prelude the dancers cluster in three flowerlike groups , and there s an astonishing long phrase in which the outer women , like petals opening , very slowly sink to one knee and then arch back while the woman at the center of each group , like a stamen , remains standing and slowly lifts her arms yet you hardly notice , for meanwhile the soloist is passing around the stage as if listening to the sounds of the night and opening her arms to the moon all these kirov dancers maintained the spell ekaterina osmolkina , dancing the solo mazurka and valse pas de deux , was beautifully rapt , with the most delicate and spontaneous dancing of the season so far , on friday and saturday evenings the male role is almost always performed with dignity by kirov men , without a hint of the embarrassment or effeminacy that western men have often brought to it on saturday afternoon danila korsuntsev , a handsome performer with great charm \( an excellent partner too \) , even carried off the daft moments when he must pose on halftoe , eyes lowered and arms circling his head with dropping hands , without looking at his beloved as she dances elsewhere nothing else in this program is choreographically of much import the middle two ballets the spectre de la rose pas de deux and the dying swan solo last less than 17 minutes together \( including the pause in between \) , after which the kirov thinks nothing of drawing out the next intermission for 30 to 40 minutes before the final scheherazade \( when finally the curtain rises , we then get a drop curtain and a long overture \) le spectre de la rose is really a short reversegender view of the situation in chopiniana here is this girl s dream the soaring male roseghost is the poetic figure who transports her isabella fokine , the choreographer s granddaughter , is responsible for this often clumsy kirov version none of her work that i have seen has been much good leonid sarafanov was the most aerial , effortless and noiseless of the three spectres i saw without quite suggesting any sensual perfume sources differ as to which dancer once confused her admirers by saying i am the best fokine ballerina in the world today neither uliana lopatkina nor diana vishneva , who both appeared in the dying swan and scheherazade , takes the prize \( it would have been better to see them in chopiniana \) ms lopatkina , a bleakly restrained but dull swan , was more dramatically focused as the adulterous zobeide in the melodramatic scheherazade ms vishneva , a more artfully intense but not more convincing swan , seemed to have based her zobeide on the recent youtube footage of angelina jolie at 16 , especially the glossy , parted lips scheherazade , despite the valiant efforts of dance theater of harlem in the early 1980s to render it serious again , should really be left to les ballets trockadero de monte carlo these kirov performances the silliest scheherazade i have seen in 30 years were already halfway to the trocks comedy style i especially admire the pelvis wiggling of the three odalisques someone should cast them at once in kismet as the three princesses of vavavoom
tbilisi , the prowestern president of georgia , , was leading in the polls ahead of an election on saturday that he hoped would restore his mandate to govern after he ordered a police crackdown on protesters and declared a state of emergency here in november the dispersal of demonstrators on nov 7 , in which more than 500 people were injured , though none fatally , was hardly unusual in postsoviet politics but it disillusioned at least some supporters of mr saakashvili , whom the bush administration has championed as a model of democratic leadership in the region mr saakashvili , 40 , a graduate of columbia university law school in new york and a staunch ally of the united states in the caucasus region , was unapologetic about the police crackdown in an interview at his residence on friday he said his decision to call saturday s snap elections set his government apart from others in the region , and had already deflated criticism of his government after the events of november all these claims that georgia went authoritarian collapsed after the socalled authoritarian leader called for elections , mr saakashvili said people usually do crackdowns to keep power i gave up power immediately after the crackdown to make sure there is a democratic process that resolves the crisis police used tear gas , rubber bullets , water cannons and clubs to clear the streets of the capital in a daylong melee on nov 7 he declared a state of emergency that day , but lifted it nine days later mr saakashvili said the police crackdown on protesters was justified because a supporter of the protesters was plotting a coup he said he called new elections not in response to the police actions but to what he said was underlying discontent with economic reforms expressed by the protesters over all , i do n't regret any of it , he said i believe we were right indeed , in the two months since the election was called , the vote has evolved as much into a referendum on mr saakashvili s economic reforms as his democratic credentials , georgia s tense relations with or its policy of closely supporting the united states , according to aides and some opposition politicians the reforms have brought foreign investment and growth to one of this region s poorest countries , but have left large pockets of poverty and runaway unemployment roughly a quarter of the population lives in poverty there was a segment of society that felt like we did n't care , giga bokeria , a member of georgia s parliament and an ally of the president , conceded in an interview here on friday georgia s economy grew 10 percent in 2007 yet below the surface , as in other former communist countries , poverty and unemployment are corroding support , mr saakashvili said he said protesters included former traffic policemen he had fired to curtail corruption the country is important to the united states , in part because of a key oil pipeline that crosses its territory mr saakashvili s government has also supported the united states by deploying troops in iraq and is the third largest contributor of troops , after america and britain the deployment , however , was not an issue in the election , as it has been in other countries that allied with the united states in the war seven candidates are on the ballot on saturday if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote , a runoff will be held in two weeks a poll of 1 , 200 adults by the washington firm greenberg quinlan rosner , sponsored by mr saakashvili s campaign and released thursday , showed mr saakashvili with support from 52 percent of probable voters the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 34 percentage points his leading opponent in the election , levan gachechiladze , who represents a coalition of nine opposition parties , received 16 percent among probable voters , according to the poll in the nov 7 crackdown , government troops entered and closed down an independent television station , imedi , which is partly managed by rupert murdoch s news corporation , causing what company officials estimated was 3 million to 4 million worth of damage imedi is owned by badri patarkatsishvili , a billionaire wanted in russia on corruption and other charges and now living in london for fear of arrest if he returns to georgia he remains a candidate on the ballot on saturday in december , the georgian government released clandestine recordings of mr patarkatsishvili offering a georgian interior ministry official a 100 million bribe , apparently to help stage a coup the election on saturday is also a plebiscite on georgia s hopedfor integration into membership in the alliance is widely supported here six of the seven candidates and a majority of georgians support nato membership also on saturday , voters will decide whether to a hold parliamentary elections this spring or next fall

in one of the numbers from fiddler on the roof , tevye sings , with a mixture of emotions we have n't got the man we had when we began back in january when barack obama pulled off his stunning win in the iowa caucuses , and people were lining up in the cold and snow for hours just to get a glimpse of him , there was a wide and growing belief encouraged to the max by the candidate that something new in american politics had arrived his brilliant , nationally televised victory speech in des moines sent a shiver of hope through much of the electorate the time has come for a president who will be honest about the choices and the challenges we face , said senator obama , who will listen to you and learn from you , even when we disagree , who wo n't just tell you what you want to hear , but what you need to know only an idiot would think or hope that a politician going through the crucible of a presidential campaign could hold fast to every position , steer clear of the stumbling blocks of nuance and never make a mistake but barack obama went out of his way to create the impression that he was a new kind of political leader more honest , less cynical and less relentlessly calculating than most you would be able to listen to him without worrying about what the meaning of is is this is why so many of senator obama s strongest supporters are uneasy , upset , dismayed and even angry at the candidate who is now emerging in the bright light of summer one issue or another might not have made much difference tacking toward the center in a general election is as common as kissing babies in a campaign , and lord knows the democrats need to expand their coalition but senator obama is not just tacking gently toward the center he s lurching right when it suits him , and he s zigging with the kind of reckless abandon that s guaranteed to cause disillusion , if not whiplash so there he was in zanesville , ohio , pandering to evangelicals by promising not just to maintain the bush program of investing taxpayer dollars in religiousbased initiatives , but to expand it separation of church and state \? forget about it and there he was , in the midst of an election campaign in which the makeup of the supreme court is as important as it has ever been , agreeing with justices antonin scalia and clarence thomas that the death penalty could be imposed for crimes other than murder what was the man thinking \? thankfully , a majority on the court left the barbaric scaliathomasobama \( and john mccain \) reasoning behind and held that capital punishment would apply only to homicides what s he doing \? is the most common question heard recently from obama supporters for one thing , he s taking his base for granted , apparently believing that such stalwart supporters as blacks , progressives and pumpedup younger voters will be with him no matter what a taste of the backlash this can produce erupted on the candidate s own web site thousands of obama supporters flooded the site with protests over his decision to support an electronic surveillance bill that gives retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that participated in the bush administration s warrantless wiretapping program the senator had previously promised to filibuster the bill if it contained the immunity clause there has been a reluctance among blacks to openly criticize senator obama , the first black candidate with a real shot at the presidency but behind the scenes , there is discontent among africanamericans , as well , over mr obama s move away from progressive issues , including his support of the supreme court s decision affirming the constitutional right of individuals to bear arms there s even concern that he s doing the obama twostep on the issue that has been the cornerstone of his campaign his opposition to the war in iraq but the senator denied that any significant change should be inferred from his comment that he would continue to refine his policy on the war mr obama is betting that in the long run none of this will matter , that the most important thing is winning the white house , that his staunchest supporters \( horrified at the very idea of a president mccain \) will be there when he needs them he seems to believe that his shifts and twists and clever panders as opposed to bold , principled leadership on important matters will entice large numbers of independent and conservative voters to climb off the fence and run into his yard maybe but that s a very dangerous game for a man who first turned voters on by presenting himself as someone who was different , who would n't engage in the terminal emptiness of politics as usual time flies and the iowa caucuses seem a very long time ago
the question was one she had heard before , but this time it was asked in downright hostile terms has your mother shown any remorse for the fact that her vote cost iraqis a million of their lives \? a student asked on monday at the university of wisconsinmadison ms clinton replied she cast a vote based on the best available evidence perhaps you had clairvoyance then , and that s extraordinary as senator s presidential campaign tries to win some younger voters , her daughter is parachuting into the heart of enemyoccupied territory college campuses in the grip of obama fever , both in mustwin and lostcause states for her mother s candidacy on saturday and sunday , ms clinton will campaign in hawaii , the childhood home of senator barack obama for nearly the first year of her mother s presidential bid , ms clinton , 27 , was practically invisible to voters just before the iowa caucuses on jan 3 , she began appearing in the tableau of flags and signs behind her mother at speeches but when it became clear that mr obama was making off with many people her age , ms clinton decided to speak out unlike most other family members who hit the campaign trail , she does not offer an intimate portrait of the candidate , and she recounts old family stories only when her audiences clamor for one \( memory lane can be a dangerous place waxing about white house christmases might remind voters of just how many her family has already had \) instead , she upholds another clinton tradition blitzing her targets with policy details in a single hour of responding to questions at the university of wisconsineau claire on tuesday , ms clinton talked about part d , the distinction between the chronically and occasionally uninsured , health care premium caps , pell grant allowance maximums , income contingency repayment programs for financial aid , sugarbased ethanol and carbon sequestration that is not counting her detours into romanian reproductive policy and the design of the internal combustion engine it was a little over my head , admitted stephanie biese , the founder of the students for hillary chapter on the madison campus , about an exchange ms clinton had with another attendee about nuclear base loads at these appearances , ms clinton , on leave from her job at a new york hedge fund , greets her audience , plugs her mother s web site and asks for questions thin , with strawberry blonde hair that has none of its adolescent frizz , ms clinton dresses with goodgirl chic muted colors , necklines that are high and skirt hems that are not her voice is huskier than her mother s , but she has her habit of opening her eyes wide to emphasize a point you can applaud for that , she tells audiences when she hears a few claps , encouraging others to join in they do , but there is no mistaking the political climate at many of the universities and colleges where ms clinton appears after steven lawrence , a student on the madison campus , left ms clinton s event wearing a campaign sticker , another student yelled , i'm ashamed of you ! mr lawrence said he had been leaning toward mr obama , but might shift his loyalties to mrs clinton after hearing her daughter she came off as more of a regular person answering questions , but with an incredible amount of knowledge , he said elsewhere , ms clinton has been confronted with signs bearing messages like america deserves better than aristocracy and got pimp \? a reference to a recent remark by a nowsuspended msnbc host who claimed that mrs clinton was exploiting her daughter but in a political race that has become a delegatebydelegate fight , clinton campaign officials say ms clinton could make a difference before feb 5 , she sped through 15 of the 22 states that voted that day , and has been to maine , maryland , ohio and wisconsin since while it is impossible to tell how many votes ms clinton is winning , the campaign invites the local news media to each stop , meaning that ms clinton is popping up on evening broadcasts everywhere she goes there is no asking ms clinton , who does not give interviews , exactly why she threw herself into her mother s bid which , if successful , will rob her of some of the privacy she is said to cherish but a furious , provocative essay that ms clinton massblasted to her friends and acquaintances on feb 4 provides clues she wrote that she did not agree with everything the essay s author , robin morgan , a former editor of ms magazine , said \( ms morgan argues that mrs clinton has faced not only a sexist double standard but also sociopathic womanhating \) but until jeering men insulted her mother in new hampshire and the news media made light of it , ms clinton wrote , i confess i did n't entirely get it'
vail , colo morphoses the wheeldon company , just a year old , is a dream ballet troupe it uses leading american and european dancers , including some of the foremost members of new york city ballet and the royal ballet of britain its artistic director and chief choreographer is , today s most internationally indemand ballet choreographer it commissions several premieres a year , not all by mr wheeldon , and includes work by other star choreographers dead and alive it has residencies at the vail international dance festival and sadler s wells in london and annual seasons in those two forums , as well as new york city center such dream conditions occur thanks to the combination of generous sponsorship , the high reputations of mr wheeldon and his dancers and the crucial fact that morphoses performs only from august to october , when most of its dancers can be spared from their yearround companies most professional ballet dancers never get to perform with members of other companies , so watching morphoses last week in vail , i marveled as principals from the royal ballet and new york city ballet partnered each other \( edward watson with gonzalo garcia , maria kowroski with martin harvey , leanne benjamin with tyler angle \) the quality of this dream depends on the quality of its choreography last year , as it started life in vail , morphoses looked strong because it presented mr wheeldon s polyphonia , the 2001 ballet that has been staged by several companies and that has made mr wheeldon appear the most important fulltime ballet choreographer since jerome robbins and kenneth macmillan and an heir to the ballet classicism of george balanchine and frederick ashton without polyphonia , morphoses made a weaker impression last year in new york and , reportedly , in london this year the company will dance polyphonia in both those cities unfortunately , i will be unable to see it either place without polyphonia , and without the ponchielli dance of the hours that last year gave it so striking a contrast brilliant , fragrant , highstyle ballet confectionery as opposed to the intricate and modern patterns of polyphonia the morphoses repertory looked even weaker in vail than it did in new york in october fortunately , the festival s enthusiastic , intimate atmosphere , combined with the juxtapositions of these international dancers , maintained the morphoses dreamlike quality the first of the company s two performances was an upclose event \( at the vilar performing arts center in the beaver creek resort \) concentrating on new works by other choreographers that were made , at mr wheeldon s request , to minimalist music adam hougland \( to gavin bryars s north shore \) , pontus lidberg \( to philip glass s metamorphosis \) , edwaard liang \( to david lang s wed and how to pray \) an injury prevented a performance of annabelle lopez ochoa s one it was replaced by mr wheeldon s liturgy \( to arvo p rt music \) , danced by wendy whelan and craig hall mr wheeldon introduced the program and interviewed all three choreographers about their work , with films of rehearsals showing entertaining fragments of that process as an unannounced finale , there was at the behest of damian woetzel , the vail festival s artistic director a brief new dance cooked up by mr wheeldon the second performance took place in the idyllic setting of the gerald r ford amphitheater , with the rocky mountains visible all around it began with mr wheeldon s there where she loved \( to songs by chopin and weill \) and ended with his fools' paradise \( music by jody talbot \) in between there was a special onedancer version of ms lopez ochoa s one and the titaniaoberon pas de deux from ashton s dream given that the program concentrated on the new , it might have been interesting to audiences if mr wheeldon had explained why he included the pas de deux from the dream , a 1964 ballet the sadler s wells and city center seasons will include ashton s monotones ii should we assume that mr wheeldon is acknowledging his debts \? the opening phrase of ashton s dream pas de deux , in which the ballerina is folded in two and revolved before she beautifully reopens , is something mr wheeldon quoted in an initial sequence of polyphonia and his fools' paradise likewise borrows from ashton s monotones a wonderful pas de trois device in which the woman does pirouettes supported by one man while nearby another man does the same pirouettes unsupported mr wheeldon can seem like a clever magpie choreographer , so it s good to see that he honors his sources though none of the wheeldon choreography at vail this year was among his finest , each piece had the felicitous touches that prove him a dance maker of rare caliber in the chopin spring duet in there where she loved , the dancer c line cassone ended a flourishing movement for alternating arms with one raised , exactly catching a quality of suspension at the end of that musical phrase and exactly as her partner , mr garcia , suddenly lifted her everything said up the closing tableau of fools' paradise is a masterstroke , bringing together the eight dancers in a vertical accumulation of four of the ballet s motifs , a , b , c , d piling atop one another like a grand chord in the beaver creek event , the sheer rhythmic vitality of mr wheeldon s unnamed concluding dance again showed why he matters but the vail programs also showed as not all mr wheeldon s work does his overreliance on manipulative malefemale partnering his work suggests , too consistently , that women are there to look spectacular because of the support of handsome and controlling men more disturbing , his choreographic inventions do n't all cohere , formally or expressively too many of his most striking devices look like mere theatrical effects and pattern seems to matter more to him than steps too often , we see more choreography than dancing the premieres by mr hougland , mr lidberg and mr liang all suggest that they are lesser though busy practitioners of these tendencies and ms lopez ochoa s one was simply a series of effects in william forsythe style , lighted from behind , toying with stuntlike devices from the ballet vocabulary it s generous of mr wheeldon to give them opportunities , but he is the one we want to see stretch himself though greatly gifted , he is only intermittently an artist whose creations add up to true works of art the london and new york seasons bring the next wheeldon premiere what aspects of him will it reveal \?

donovan mcnabb started a controversy last fall when he said black quarterbacks were judged more harshly than white ones that prompted a discussion in the comments section that i think is the most thoughtful reader giveandtake we ve ever had on this blog below are excerpts from that discussion \( it s long , folks , but i m suggesting you may find it worthwhile \) two figures in the exchange have agreed to look back on it , to consider whether barack obama s run at the presidency has changed the equation , and to update their thoughts \( in posts above \) if the nation is seriously considering electing a black president , aren t we past the point of caring about the race of a quarterback \? excerpts from the original discussion from walt maybe some neanderthals somewhere at some time believed that blacks lacked the essentials to play qb \( or , in the case of that quote , manage a big league baseball team \) those views were ignorant on their face and are not representative of common thinking are not not i have never known a single white person who ever criticized an athlete s performance based on their race not once ever if you can play ball , you can play ball and nobody cares what color your skin is this is not 1947 this is not even 1967 not even 1987 this is 2007 different world , and in fact i challenge mcnabb to produce a single anecdote of race holding him back in any way there is one area where race still matters off the field behavior there is still an element of thinking that black athletes have a posse and spend their money foolishly and take unnecessary risks , as compared to white players to the extent that there is a grain of truth there , it is a cultural issue rather than a racial one are blacks more visible when they break the law \? i believe the answer is yes that is still a problem but on the field \? no way , and not for many many years now from lindsay i have two words for anyone who thinks that white quarterbacks are not criticized as harshly as black quarterbacks rex grossman from dc part of the problem , walt , is that some guys will say i ve never known a single white person that well , first of all you probably do know white people who judge black athletes and people in general based on race , but you wouldn t know it because it s not in your everyday discussions still , even if you don t , exactly how many of the nearly 200 million white people in this country do you know \? the reason that so many white people feel that the black perception of existing racism is overblown is because they live a different existence in this country you can be face to face with some of the most vicious white racists , but how would you know \? unless you have a discussion about race , you would not have to confront their feelings about race because you are not the the object of their hatred i went to college in indiana and i faced some very blatant and hurtful racism this included being out and out called that infamous nword i was born and raised in philly , so i had no idea that this backwards way still existed philly has it s own more subtle racism \( try being black and walking in certain south philly or north east neighborhoods at the wrong time if looks could kill \) still , i had never been faced with something like this , which included neonazi flyers being handed out on campus the funny part is that a poll came out in some paper while i was there and the people in indiana were voted the friendliest people in the country i showed my black friends at school and we all laughed at it but it was that kind of laugh that you laugh when you don t want to cry we all understood that day how different this world still is for us by the way , i m not yet 35 years old for anyone to tell mcnabb or any adult , that they haven t experienced what they say they have is to call them a liar what would mcnabb possibly gain , after all he s been through , and all he knew he would go through what would this man gain from lying about the subject \? he s already paid , and is the face if the franchise he certainly doens t need any more controversy he just answered a question very truthfully about his own experience but , being a black man , people jumped on him like a little boy crying wolf they say , look , boy , you don t really see what you say you see or we would see it too he is a man , and he knows what he has experienced i know what i ve experienced you don t from walt dc , i have no doubt about your experiences , or those of ewthree or of dmcnabb i m certain that they are true what they are not , is representative of anything which could be called white america here s the thing , man if one writer or even ten ask a question of mcnabb that is racebased , \( a \) that does not imply that they see mcnabb in racial terms , it implies that some of their readers may \( b \) they do not represent all anything i try to imagine being black i suppose it is something like this you have 100 normal interactions with white people , and then out of the blue somebody says or does something racially insensitive and it sends chills up your spine , and you remember that you are seen as different because , well , your skin is permanently dark compared to caucasians i imagine there is some selfconsciousness , which i also imagine passes with time i was struck by serena williams comments about her trip to africa i believe it was nigeria , and she said she had the overwhelming urge to just run around and act like a kid , because she felt so free and relaxed and not different that told me a lot about blacks living in america and what they generally experience i hear you , dc it ain t over but i am 47 and i can say it is improving are there racists left \? sure i know some quite well some say we are all a little racist , but i disagree i think we are all a little tribal i think we work to overcome that i think those who do , deserve to be acknowledged for the effort i don t know what mcnabb was trying to accomplish , but it s out there now , so we may as well talk about it from ron gino torretta was a college stud his record as a starting qb for the miami hurricanes was 261 in 1992 \( the year prior to charlie ward \) he threw for 3 , 000 yards and won the heisman that same year he was drafted way down in the 7th round by the vikings he never played a down for the vikings or the lions who picked him up in 1994 in 1995 , torretta moved to nfl europe and was also on the roster for the 49ers and detroit lions again , but was relegated to backup roles he was cut by the 49ers in 1996 and subsequently picked up by the seahawks his only chance to play in an nfl game came in the 1996 season finale when he came off the bench for the seahawks against the raiders he immediately threw a 32yard touchdown pass that put seattle ahead , leading the team to victory in 1997 , torretta was on the roster for seattle and later the indianapolis colts but again did not play after that season , he retired from the nfl his professional football career was a big fat bust he now works in institutional marketing is it that gino didn t get the chance to play because he was prejudiced against due to his italian heritage \? no he didn t play because he was just not good enough to play in the nfl case closed randall cunningham and daunte culpepper both played for the vikings \( and cunningham for the eagles \) and both excelled by all accounts , they are stand up guys and all around good people i don t remember ever hearing anyone in the media taking shots at them about being black qb s while manning the helm for the vikings or the eagles why you ask \? becuase it was not an issue then and it s not an issue now people need to understand that the nfl is not a microcosm of society it s a bunch of rich men playing a game for a living and their performances are what speaks for them if they underperform , get injured or someone else can do their job , they are on the outside looking in mcnabb should realize that by now and concentrate on bringing the lombardi trophy home to philly if not , he ll be in the same place the rest of the aging and unable to perform players end up on espn from dc lindsay , rex grossman is the same poor example that the press gave to mcnabb during his press conference the problem with that comparison is that rex grossman is not a good qb ! donovan mcnabb is mcnabb didn t say that white qbs are not criticized he simply said that black qbs need to be that much better if you want to make a fair comparison you would have to compare the crticism of mcnabb , culpepper , mcnair , etc to that of good white qbs after manning and brady , mcnabb has had the most success and best number of any qb in the league compare in that realm \( carson palmer would also be in that realm \) all qbs get criticized it goes with the territory but it s obvious that white qbs don t have to deal with comments such as those by rush limbaugh , or the guy from the naacp they also don t have to answer some of the questions from the press that black qbs do walt , no one has made sweeping generalization such as whites are never persecuted or all black suffer from persecution still , the simple fact is that whites in general occupy the seats of power in government , corporate america and media even if only ten percent of people all people are racists , blacks have a heck of a disadvantage to overcome and , the fact that whites have these seats of power is due to the racist history of this country which sets the foundation for where we are today from dc walt , first let me say that i appreciate your discussion still , i think you are missing the practical point of how this racism affects blacks specifically , as well as society in general first , i believe that racists exist in larger numbers than you seem to think after all the leaders of today \( corporate and political \) in large part are simply the children of the leaders in the sixties if you think that mindsets have completely changed simply because laws have changed i d have to say that you are being naive in this matter i agree that there is the mental side to being faced with the racism from your fellow citizens i m sure that the guys chanting racists slurs in my dorm stuck with me a lot more than the guys who simply gave a friendly hello understandable , right \? still this only touches on the viciousness of and mental anguished caused by racism it doesn t touch on the real practical danger of racism the real danger comes from things such as disproportionate hiring practices , unequal punishment for the same crime , and very unbalanced education opportunities due to lack of resources in innercity schools these things affect a person s livelihood just because of the disproportionate rates of poverty , if you re born black there is a much higher chance you will be born into poverty in this rich country of ours if none of the other forms of racism existed , you are born into disadvantage you lack the education and resources to compete that added to the rest makes for a tall mountain to climb one of the issues that i think affects these discussions is that many white people feel defensive about the subject they feel as though blacks are somehow lessening their accomplishments by saying that they have an advantage over us in this society many , also feel personally accused of the racism that exists taking the first issue first obviously if you are successful you likely worked and or study hard to get there the fact that racism exists doesn t in and of itself take anything away from what white people accomplish still , if you are white you know that your hard work will pay off you don t likely have to worry about walking into that office and losing the job right away because your interviewer happens to be one of those racists , or having your application tossed because your name is too ethnic you also don t have the stigma on you simply because you are of the same race as some criminal who is plastered on the news at the time the white race doesn t get labeled by the actions of a few i , on the other hand , being a fairly young looking black man have to break down preconception nearly every time i walk into a business meeting , or conference \( and if i wear my hoodie and jeans , you can believe that i get clutched purses and head turns and even people getting up from seats in public transit it has an effect on your psyche \) to you , ron t , you are very wrong about what culpepper and cunningham had to face i was born and raised in philly and cunningham faced worse than mcnabb he was the only offense that the eagles had \( no offensive line and rarely a running back \) , but all anyone wanted to talk about was his arrogance he also constantly got questions about being a black qb and running rather than passing \( though his passing numbers are better than troy aikman s \) with the vikings , he and culpepper both got criticized for having bloated numbers due to randy moss and , as we can see , randy s numbers , like any receivers , are only high when he has a good qb in fact , randall cunningham lead the vikings to a 151 record and had a passer rating of over 100 , and somehow didn t win mvp i can t think of another time a qb had such a record and didn t win mvp i hate to be long winded , so i ll end it here needless to say , this barely touches the issue from walt dc , thanks for the comments you have begun the process of helping me \( and perhaps others \) learn what you go through and how it affects you i m not defensive , per se more , i am skeptical , and that is due to not having walked in your shoes i do honestly try to imagine it , and try to understand it , but of course that will always be an incomplete process still , the alternative is to not try at all i do understand white guilt we owe the black race a rollback of history which can never happen , and so we are left in a present where it is impossible to ignore the past but but ! we cannot allow ourselves to be defined by it believe me i understand institutional racism i am a white collar worker , a computer professional , and i have spent many years working for conservative , buttondown companies who very rarely hired people of any color than white on the few occasions when i had the opportunity to make a hire , as it turned out i chose minority applicants they seemed at the time to be the best fit for my team , and in two particular cases i was 100 correct they worked out superbly was i subconsciously biased in there favor because they were underdogs \? it s possible i can also assure you that these same companies would likely not hire a white person with a visible tattoo , a nose ring , crazy hair or overly expressive dress there is a certain expectation of conformity to specific standards on the other hand , you could get all of the above right and be a person of color , and some organizations would not hire you i understand and have lived that reality i ve seen it in practice what i do see is my own children , mixing and mingling with kids of all ethnic backgrounds without a whiff of awareness that they are pioneers people are people to this generation , much more so than to mine and certainly to the one before it so , we are making progress i am openminded but skeptical that the topic mcnabb opened can be discussed in a positive way generally , the opinions on this subject are hardened and somewhat myopic i m sure you agree that you want to be defined as a person , not as a black person i am just as sure that you are proud of your heritage and your roots it s a conundrum of course you are affected when a yahoo belts out a racist chant of some sort , but does he not achieve his objective if you let it under your skin \? you made note that plenty of people treated you well in college , and i m sure you would much rather see the world as they see it , where people are people to some extent we all have to ignore idiots in your case , as i said , there is a selfconsciousness involved because you are being verbally harassed in a racially insensitive way these are people who hurt others for the sport of it i wouldn t let such people define me or my life experience in any way i hear you with regard to doing everything right and still being denied opportunity i know it s true i hope it s getting better from dc walt , i only hope that you are sincere in the concerns that you express \( okay , yes that s me being skeptical again \) still , it s easy to say that i shouldn t let racists define me or my life experience and in fact , i don t let them define me racism , however , does help to define my life experience not prejudice , understand but , that prejudice being put into practice , denying opportunity or prejudging me before i have a chance to demonstrate my talent or value is a large part of my life experience if it was just the prejudice , i don t think that many people would make much of it it would be like complaining about a person being rude to you you may say something , but mainly you just let it roll off your back and go about your day i grew up in a large city on the east coast , so obviously i ve had many experiences with rude people honestly , i can t remember any one situation in particularly it meant that little to me prejudice would probably be the same way if it didn t come with the oppression of racism i m an educated man i ve always scored at top levels in standardized tests even with the racism i ve experienced and the hurdles i still face , i ll be all right i just have to be exceptional this issue is not about guys like me this issue , to me , is more about the guys with whom i grew up in my innercity neighborhood the exceptional will have some level of success \( even if there is a ceiling \) , and the deficient will likely fail it s the average mass , where most people fall , who are most affected i knew guys who weren t exceptional , but who were bright , who just didn t have a chance they knew what they learned from the neighborhood , and from the inadequate public schools in our area they spoke the language that they were taught the way they were taught and , outside of the neighborhood they were already labeled as dangerous these guys , with the same work ethic and level of intelligence , were they white , would have had opportunities for success they would have been better educated , more properly prepared and most of all , given a chance to show who they are and what they could do rather than being prejudged walt , i am indeed a human being before i am my color in my home , of course , my family doesn t look at each other as black , we look at each other as brother , sister , mother , father once i step outside of my home , however , i dare not think that i am looked at the same as any white citizen of my age i dare not because i ve tried and have been slapped in the face i dare not because if i want any real level of success i know i can t be average like mcnabb alluded to , i have to be exceptional and , as we have both seen in our lives , sometimes that s not enough you re a reasonable person even if we don t see eye to eye after this discussion , it s obvious that you and i could go have a drink somewhere and discuss this issue or others if the opportunity allowed most people are just not so reasonable they have their stance and rather than debating to reach the truth , they argue to prove their point or just call you a name and say if you don t like it here go back to africa \( you ll find that one in these discussions more times than not \) these people are not just backwards hicks in the mountains of west virginia you ll find the unreasonable in every step along your way to any kind of success \( even if outnumbered , if the reasonable are passive the unreasonable win \) you might not necessarily recognize them because they treat you differently to you they are just another man to me they become a hurdle to some of the guys with which i grew up , they can be a dead end from ron dc , i appreciate and respect your opinion i too was born and raised in philadelphia and am the son of a retired philadelphia police officer the neighborhood i grew up in was predominantly white , but bordered areas that were predominantly not like you , i was unable to walk down certain streets or through certain areas without hearing racially insensitive remarks shouted in my direction unfortunately , there were many times \( more often than i d like to admit \) when those confrontations did not stop at remarks i have the scars to prove it both physically and mentally i have also been witness to two racially motivated murders they were seperate instances , but both involving white male teens killed as a reaction to black teens being hurt in my neighborhood i even saw a row home set afire because a white woman , her african american husband and their baby girl moved onto the street next to mine so , my experiences with racism are more similar to yours than you might think just because of the color of my skin , i was treated differently and to this day , it still infuriates me when i hear that people of color cannot be racist but what i didn t realize then is that those experiences would shape me into who i am today a very open minded person empathetic to many causes racial equality being one of them my father has shared many stories over the years and many of his partners on the force were men of color he always spoke very highly of them and they of him they would come over to the house , play cards and watch sports yes , the eagles to a man they taught me to give people the benefit of the doubt until forced to make a decision one way or the other my dad was then \( and to a degree still is \) very cut and dry his message was to treat people \( all people \) with respect that is , of course , unless they fail to reciprocate and even then , learn to take the high road life is too short to make a big deal about something as nebulous as color it s what s underneath the surface that matters i went to an all boys catholic high school in west philly the enrollment was 65 white , 30 black and a 5 mix of asian and latino i played football with many black athletes both in high school and in college i was a offensive lineman and a linebacker although i never blocked for a black qb , i played against a few never once \( even with all of my negative experiences \) did i look at the color of skin on the field i am positive that some of my teammates did , as did people in the stands fact is , some folks just cannot hide their feelings about race and they let their experiences \( good or bad \) rule their emotions but it s the silent ones that hide their hatred that are the most dangerous in mcnabb s case , i feel he opened a pandora s box not because it is sensitive subject matter that our society is unable to handle but instead because the medium of hbo was not the proper forum and because the field of play is the one place \( like my father s squad car \) where many of the barriers do not exist donovan may have to answer certain questions posed to him by a variety of media outlets that peyton manning or carlson palmer do not , but work harder \? that just doesn t seem fair of him to say i realize that the interview itself took place weeks before the season and the question was only one of many asked the fact that the interview aired after an 02 start to a season that was supposed to be donovan s rebound year is just poor timing the editor of the piece knew exactly what he or she had in front of them \( and so did mcnabb evidently \) and hbo took full advantage of the situation that s why you don t answer questions about race on a program like that nothing good can come of it but then again , i guess that any time an open dialogue about race can occur is a good thing look at us here i would just rather donovan concentrate on winning football games and bringing home a championship to philadelphia for once , why couldn t he just take the high road \? from mo kelly donovan mcnabb is right and maybe this will clarify as to why he is http mokellyreportblogspotcom 2007 09 donovanmcnab bisrightandhistoryhtml presently 5 of 32 nfl teams have africanamerican quarterbacks as their starter six , if you assume that michael vick would have been at the helm of the atlanta falcons if not for his felony dogfighting fiasco my problem with this whole discussion is that both sides of the discussion seemed to have become brand new and forgotten how we had come to this point if we are going to address this issue with any degree of intellectual honesty , we must acknowledge that there are far more layers than simply whether mcnabb is right or wrong in his remarks to adequately ascertain the significance of some of these social realities , we have to avoid the kneejerk , emotional response to this divisive issue and go deeper much , much deeper the historical foundation for mcnabb s remarks is built upon the history of football and racism in america not just nfl football , but all of football since jesse owens embarrassed adolf hitler and the whole of white supremacy at the berlin olympics of 1936 the notion emerged and grew that the africanamerican athlete was physically superior to white athletes hold on now hear me out i said notion concurrently , throughout the whole of american history \( ie since the founding of jamestown in 1607 \) the prevailing notion was is that whites were intellectually superior to africans africanamericans don t get ahead of me remain calm and unemotional i said notion in terms of athletics , these prevailing notions have perverted and poisoned our collective consciences , both black and white you will readily find people both black and white who will point to basketball , football , boxing dominance by africanamericans as proof of africanamerican athletic superiority \( ie genetics \) and when given the opportunity to compete in the exclusive sports such as golf and tennis tiger woods and the williams sisters are also thrown into the equation and that is where the real problem begins in the ongoing discussion of nature \( ie genetics \) vs nurture \( ie environment \) there has always been this slippery slope if africanamericans \( or others \) somehow allege physical superiority in regards to athletics \( ie genetics \) then the door is inevitably left open for the converse that whites are then somehow superior in terms of intellect \( ie genetics \) this historical context must be acknowledged to have any honest and informed discussion of donovan mcnabb s comments if you are an individual predisposed to believe either supposed notion then donovan mcnabb is absolutely correct and black qbs are held to a different standard but before any of you quickly allege you re the shining beacon of racial sensitivity , slow your roll let s not get brand new and act as if we were born yesterday black nfl quarterbacks didn t become common until this past decade that is , if 5 of 32 can be considered common also , in a historical context , let s not forget that this 5time pro bowl quarterback was only recruited by two colleges to play the position of qb , syracuse and nebraska and nebraska was still running the tripleoption run offense back then in other words , football didn t believe in the qb abilities of donovan mcnabb or how about steve mcnair , qb for the baltimore ravens \? no major division i schools recruited him to play quarterback only as defensive back mcnair ended up at alcorn state and we all know what happened from that point this isn t doug williams ancient history mcnabb and mcnair are 2 of the aforementioned 5 presently leading teams in the nfl and the beat goes on tennessee titans quarterback vince young had his mental aptitude openly criticized after scoring low on the nfl introductory wonderlic test , given to all rookies http www theonion com content node 45976 note the headline vince young may not be smart enough to play in the nfl young went on to win the associated press offensive rookie of the year award checking my math , that s now \( 60 \) , 3 of the 5 present nfl starters who at some point in their football career were openly disparaged and disrespected in terms of their supposed intellectual aptitude to handle the position of quarterback time has proven the doubters wrong nevertheless , it s proof of an attitude of doubt and skepticism for the aptitude of africanamerican quarterbacks these slights are real , not imagined this perceived intellectual inferiority of africanamericans extends beyond the quarterback position in this football discussion how there are still only a handful of div1 football coaches who are black i don t know given the prevalence of the black athletes running up and down the gridiron it s even more egregious in nature all that says is this notion of intellectual inferiority still exists in the game of football and the numbers bear this truth out the notion invariably carries over to treatment it is inescapable how charlie weis still has a job at notre dame and there are those who still blame tyrone willingham for the failures of notre dame this year bears this truth out http seattletimesnwsourcecom html budwithers 200389 1349 withers19html http www uhnd com articles 2006 football willingham e 2 80 99sstamponirishfadingfornow http www thenewstribune com sports story 160302 html charlie weis began his notre dame tenure 52 and was rewarded with a 10year extension , in part to his supposed market value tyrone willingham shot out of the cannon 80 and only got his head rubbed by the notre dame faithful also bears this truth out nobody was blaming bob davie three years after he left so why is willingham so special \? never mind the fact the program was better off when willingham left than when he found it now it s back in the toilet where it rightfully belongs what goes around , comes around in terms of black quarterbacks and coaches , we as africanamericans didn t get smarter over the past ten years and we definitely didn t become more talented we simply were granted opportunities and harsher scrutiny trailblazers inevitably bear that burden if the black college quarterback is now common , some of the credit must go to donovan mcnabb if the black quarterback is now common in the nfl , surely some of that credit must laid at the feet of mcnabb too donovan mcnabb is right in his assessment of the perception and treatment of africanamerican quarterbacks and has the personal and american history to back it up don t tell me that sylvester croom at mississippi state is the only africanamerican in the history of civilization to be smart enough or talented enough to coach in the sec http enwikipediaorg wiki sylvester croom don t tell me that charlie weis has demonstrated he s deserving of more leeway than tyrone willingham don t tell me that donovan mcnabb is speaking out of turn and his comments are baseless if you ve taken any time to review the recent history of america generally and football specifically the history and facts fall clearly on the side of donovan mcnabb one just needs to be willing to seek them out from walt ron and mo , you humble my pitiful attempts to contribute to this discussion i would ask each of you the same question i asked dc do you see the current younger generation the way i do , as much less influenced by differences in skin color and social background \? from walt dc , i wonder what your thoughts are with regard to the younger generation do you see what i see , that they just don t look at people in those terms \? from dc walt , i do i do see a start in the right direction for many in the younger generation as with some of the movements in the sixties , it takes young people being willing to rebel against an ideology that they realize is wrong , even if it s one taught by their parents of course , in the youngest children there has never been a problem young children give us an idea of how things could should be they play together , and they don t try to be color blind , which is a ridiculous notion instead , they realize that not all kids look alike , and they find it interesting they want to touch each other s hair and compare skin , not because one is better or worse , but because the recognize and appreciate the differences then they just go about playing together it s when they get a little older and have been influenced by family members or friends , who have been influenced , that they feel a need to be superior to those who are different that s when teasing starts i have hope , because i have to still , i am so often reminded that a child s first teacher is the parent , and that it s difficult to overcome the incorrect lessons of one s youth i was sent a youtube link the other day for a video called sparkling wiggles \( look it up if you want , but i warn you that it could spoil your day \) that video is just one example of a reality unteaching racism is a slow process we are only a couple of generations from a time when the laws of this country supported racism things just aren t going to change significantly in a couple of generations in the big cities things are much different than they are in rural america as i said , it s going to take children rebelling against the idea of their parents or , obviously , things can t change racist will raise racists and the number will remain similar what reason would a kid have to rebel against his father unless he sees an alternative to the lessons of his father \? in the city , children have a chance to be among other children of all types they have a chance to form their own opinions outside of a father s inherited prejudice or the media s skewed portrayals some will in much of middle america , however , there is no alternative so , a kid comes into adulthood believing the lies and misconceptions that he s been taught and , if he is educated , he then brings his ideas into the work place and of course , being white , if he is capable enough he has the opportunity to get into a position to affect that workplace it doesn t take many if other s are passive , the racists have a tremendous effect when i was in school in indiana i noticed a huge difference between the white students raised in coastal big cities and chicago versus those raised in the south and other parts of the midwest \( the majority \) in fact , it got to the point where i could tell with very good accuracy whether a student was from a city or not by his first response to me our hope is in the younger generations but how do you reach them \? how do you reach a kid in rural indiana , kentucky , montana , alabama , etc , etc , when his father tells him that black people are criminals and clowns and then he turns on the television only to see that sketch of the scary black man plastered all over the news , and the silly television shows on the wb \( a quick note on that a good friend of mine is in the entertainment industry the reason black shows on television are what they are is not because blacks don t offer better shows they are simply told that middle america doesn t want to see complex black characters seriously so , to play to the ignorant they play ignorance television , in part , actually feeds racism , not because of a conspiracy to keep anyone down , but because they are about making money and don t want to lose the racist dollar it s sickening \) as you can see , i didn t have a quick answer to your quick question i m sorry about that it s just a little more complex than saying that things are improving to take this back to the mcnabb issue , again , i don t think that these reporters are purposely being racists just like we ve been discussing , it s a part of growing up in america the reporters didn t avoid growing up with some prejudices , be it from family or media their questions will reflect their perspectives from walt dc , i m of the belief that things aren t as bleak as you seem to believe you ask , regarding the younger generation , but how do you reach them \? you also acknowledge that things are getting better , while cautioning that it is not realistic to expect a great deal of change in only a couple of generations , which i agree with i would say , we don t reach them they simply observe the world around them and make their own sense of it you say that while in college you were able to tell where somebody was from by their first reaction to you i would say it would matter far more where they were going , as represented by their second , third and so forth reaction to you you seem to have a deep held belief that parents can efficiently and effectively teach their children to hate people based on skin color i suggest that it is more nuanced than that children can and do reject the morals of their parents i m sure many skinheads had perfectly square parents who loved all people equally racism is not necessarily taught in such a way i m sure you would agree there are other ways to get there as a species , humans continue to gain knowledge born of experience we also blend more from one generation to the next , both in social and genetic terms we are creating a new race of people with slightly dark skin and a variety of hair colors , facial features and body types it doesn t seem so odd anymore to have some nonwhite blood in your gene pool i honestly believe that this generation will grow up to be much less hateful in general , and especially with regard to race i see it and i feel it , that they just can t be bothered they have their own ideas of what s important from dc ron , i would never be one to say that prejudice is one sided just as you ve known white bigots , be they friends or not , i ve known black bigots growing up in philly is something else , isn t it \? you have different groups of working class people all living in the same city they love the city with passion they rally around their teams like no other they are all philadelphians through and through yet , they are as segregated as any city in modern times we can go outside of the city and meet each other and if we re both wearing eagles jerseys , we re like family we talk about the team and the city and the food \( wherever we are we know that we can complain that the cheesesteaks just aren t as good as the ones back home \) but get back into the city and we are heading in separate ways often times where i am going you wouldn t want to go and where you are going i wouldn t want to go and honestly , we might not be welcomed if we did right now we are dealing with a high murder rate in philadelphia it s in large part due to innercity \( yes , mostly black \) kids involved in the drug game the story is similar in a lot of cities the perspectives on this , to me , gives some of the greatest insight into modern racism first , the news sensationalizes , as always race always get viewers because people are afraid to talk about it publicly so they watch it in the privacy of their homes and rant to friends and family \( which is why i give mcnabb credit rather than criticism for his courage \) in white neighborhoods you hear that those people are animals who have no respect for human life they talk about these young kids as if they are monsters \( which not only stirs racial passion , but it feeds children s minds \) in black neighborhoods we are just as concerned \( and often more so since the victims are usually black \) we are just as afraid to walk through neighborhoods where we know the crimes are most prevalent for us , however , it s not a fear of black people , it s a fear of the very small percentage of criminals and , we not only have to deal with the concern and fear , but we have to deal with being feared just because we are of the same race as those few because we can t just brush this off as being a problem that those people have , we have to have a deeper understanding of the real problem blacks are very disproportionately in poverty our neighborhoods are underpoliced \( we only see cops after a crime \) the schools are underdeveloped then , when the economy goes bad , as it has been for years now , we suffer the most why \? well , as we ve discussed , the hiring seats in america are filled by whites when jobs are limited , black unemployment skyrockets it makes sense i would imagine that if jobs were limited and blacks were doing the hiring , many would hire their friends or people who remind them of their children \( but again , the notion in some minds is that blacks are lazy it s not true the hardest working people i ve known in my life have been black , just as i m sure you know hard working whites \) so now , with poverty already an issues , jobs are more limited and , like with any group , there are those who in times of hardship try to take the easy way out \( they are the minority , but as always it only takes a few to destroy \) in the city , that easy way tends to be the drug trade that choice comes with violence , with the victims usually being others involved in drugs then there are victims from muggings , and thefts , which are obvious side effects of poverty when the economy was thriving , violence in the black community was way down there was such a difference that , even with the other issues , life just felt better in the neighborhoods the fear was lessened \( for those to wonder why blacks , in general , like bill clinton so much , that is a big reason but let s not get into that discussion \) again , this is not to say that only whites take these tragedies and turn them into racial issues when there is a school or workplace shooting , or a white serial killer or whatever the case may be , i hear , from black people , very similar things they re just sick they have no respect for human life it s as if we want to take any tragedy and use it to confirm our prejudices maybe it makes us feel better about thinking , and sometimes teaching , ideas that are wrong we can both agree that we want mcnabb to concentrate on football we are fans we want need the eagles to get there we re from philly ! still , as a man , mcnabb needs to say what he feels and when he said that black qbs need to work harder , i don t think he meant it the way you took it see , in the black community there is an expression you need to work twice as hard to have the same success some even say , you need to work twice as hard to get half as much it s passed down from our fathers because they suffered through so much and their hard work was often no rewarded the saying is further explained as you grow up working twice as hard isn t just in studying and physical work it s that you have to overcome so many preconceived notions from people , and you have to be patient and respectful and sometimes go out of your way to make people comfortable or give them a chance to see beyond your skin color it s a shame , but it s true and if you look at donovan mcnabb , that s exactly what he s had to do we ve watch this man smile and joke through some of the most vicious controversies i ve ever seen a qb face , all in the midst of him having a successful career no one works harder than peyton manning when it comes to things on the field any fan has heard about his study habits and work ethic all of the greats work hard but off the field , no one has had to deal with as much as mcnabb \( and cunningham before him \) you as an eagles fan have to recognize that don t you \? from dc walt , all i can say is that i hope you re right i do wonder if your experiences are limited to certain parts of the country i m younger than you , but i ve lived in a number of places since college , including different parts of the midwest \( for work \) , and the south things are not changing as fast in those areas as they are in philly , for example and , philly still has a long way to go you re mention of the skinheads brings another thought to mind i recently read that white supremacist groups are growing in numbers again i d guess that it s another side effect of a country and world that had become more politically divided over the past six or seven years on this subject i tend to be more optimistic than you i believe \( or at least hope \) , that these new skinheads are , for the most part , not from square parents but from parents who have taught them prejudice even if not to the extreme of these groups if i were to believe that new racists are being created from tolerant homes , i d really have a bleak outlook my main hope comes from the belief that as the new generation does rebel and become independent it will move toward the truth about , and respect for , others racist ideas can indeed come from places other than the home they come from one s experience which is dictated by ones environment i m sure you will agree that for the first 1620 years of your life the most significant part of your environment is your home , with the most significant influences being your parents it s no coincidence that these hate groups are in some areas in much greater numbers than others there s no coincidence that polls about race issues tend to be greatly affected by area racism is passed down sure , some can overcome their environment , but as i stated before , as alternative must be presented even then , a person must be openminded enough to take that new path one area where we disagree most is the area concerning our duty is as it relates to the new generation i definitely believe that we have to reach many of them rather than leaving it to chance that they find the truth i look at the history of this country and see that blacks suffered for many decades through lynchings , jim crow , and all sorts of vicious inequality and violence before things changed blacks started many civil rights movements but the big difference wasn t made until whites , who were good people , but who just didn t believe that things were that bad , started to realize that they were it was when the news showed the depictions of the water hoses and attack dogs being turned on children that whites joined the civil rights movement of the sixties in large numbers that s what turned the tide because , if you re racist and believe that blacks are somehow not worthy of the same things as you , do you really care that they are marching , or complaining or living in insufferable conditions \? it took whites being shown the truth and being willing to do something about it , just as it will today you ve said that you are skeptical some see mcnabb making all of this money , so it seems that things aren t so bad and yes , things have becomes much better for many but just like so many were surprised after katrina that black people lived in such conditions , and couldn t afford to leave the area , many are content in their lives and have no reason or opportunity to know just how bad things are for some citizens in this country frankly , walt , it s much easier for you to be willing to let things take their course and hope that our children get it right after all , the alternative doesn t hurt your life in any obvious practical way \( though it does hurt us all directly or indirectly \) quite honestly , i ll be fine as well but i do see how the friends of my youth and even much of my family has been and is being affected , and i know that they and their children need change and they need it fast they need it so that their children have a decent shot at a good life they need it so that the violence in their neighborhoods doesn t claim someone they know as a victim they need it so that their son doesn t feel the need to turn to something he shouldn t and end up destroying his life they need it so that he doesn t end up with his life destroyed even if he is innocent they need it so that the little smart kids in our communities who we see walking early and talking early and showing all the early signs of being mentally gifted have a chance to be educated and successful and not have their talents lost forever for them , every generation matters a great deal people are being lost every day in one way or another it sounds almost silly to say that white people need to stand against racial inequality toward other groups in this day and age , because many don t even realize to what extent it still exists most are quite content and would rather believe that everyone is so so i don t continue discussions like this one hoping that enough people will actually see and take action not any more i just hope that a little more understanding might help change attitudes enough to so that the kid who does make it through all of this stuff is a little less likely to run into an employer who is ready to just write him off because of preconceived and illconceived notions if nothing else , walt , i hope you teach the children you know to be as openminded

irving , tex the softer side of surfaced sunday after the cowboys' season ended in another playoff loss , after his quarterback turned in another playoff disappointment , owens became downright sentimental he wore pitchblack aviator shades to his postgame news conference and he needed them to shield his eyes , which dripped tears when the subject turned to tony romo it s not about tony , he said , his voice even , flat you guys can point the finger at him you can talk about the vacation his voice trailed off , then cracked and wobbled but owens continued on he fought to contain his sobs , blurting out sentences between them if you do that , that s really unfair , owens said really unfair that s my teammate that s my quarterback we lost as a team we lost as a team , man owens knew the subject would come up , especially after romo completed 18 of 36 passes for 201 yards , a touchdown , an interception and a 647 quarterback rating the performance came after romo botched the snap on a late fieldgoal attempt last season in the playoffs against the seahawks it also came after romo used his playoff bye week to vacation in mexico with his pop star girlfriend , jessica simpson during the week , the cowboys insisted the controversy romo created in cabo san lucas was overblown after the game , romo said better there than las vegas i do n't live with regrets , romo said i'm content in my own skin if i try to be a good person , and i'm strong enough in my faith , if i'm strong enough in what i'm trying to do , then i feel like i'm doing it the right way romo pulled on designer jeans and a brown shirt , as teammates avoided his locker a reporter asked if this loss felt different than the playoff loss last season against the seahawks no , romo said it was owens who took to heart the criticism of romo he stopped the tears and carried on the interview , but eventually someone asked why the subject made him so emotional he turned immediately from a sympathetic teammate to a news media critic of course it s unfair , owens said i 've been through it i know what it s like like what , exactly , someone else wondered \? i know the media , owens said he s the quarterback of this team win or lose , it s going to fall on the quarterback s shoulders this was not the terrell owens of years past , the flamboyant and talkative wide receiver with the tendency to engage in clashes with his quarterbacks he bickered regularly in philadelphia with donovan mcnabb and he insulted quarterback jeff garcia , then with the 49ers on sunday , owens changed the whole routine he went from a quarterback critic to a quarterback defender his sadness appeared genuine asked if that was because this was the best relationship he had had with a quarterback , owens said none of his relationships with quarterbacks went sour \( mcnabb and garcia might disagree \) i always had a good relationship with my quarterbacks , owens said i know the type of person i am on the inside you guys judge me on the outside during the week , owens declared that an ankle sprain would not prevent him from playing sunday after the game , in which he caught four passes for 49 yards and a touchdown , he said the injury did not limit him at all before the romo subject brought owens to tears , he sat like the rest of his teammates it seemed like an adult version of the quiet game , with the biggest question who would break the silence \? receiver patrick crayton declined to talk running back marion barber iii had already cleaned out his locker lineman flozell adams shouted obscenities at reporters jerry jones , the cowboys' owner , whispered quietly , sweat dripping down his face , as he was surrounded by dozens of reporters of all these reactions , owens s was the most emotional he last cried publicly when the 49ers upset the green bay packers in the 1998 playoffs he said he felt the cowboys were destined for the super bowl , then corrected himself not felt , he said i know we were this loss hurts
manchester , nh to fully appreciate the pure political carnival that is on primary day , there is no better place to absorb it than on elm street , the main thoroughfare that runs through the heart of downtown manchester , the state s biggest city throughout the day , the street was asnarl with tv trucks , people being interviewed , signholding demonstrators and all manner of odd vehicles , like the red mustang convertible carrying two people dressed as bright pink pigs urging , for whatever reason , a tax on all meat shortly before 1 pm , an eightblock stroll of the street yielded the following spectacles , sounds and observations several stop signs outside city hall , placed \( curiously \) in snowbanks one man telling his friend that curt schilling , the boston red sox pitcher , had been in the state campaigning for senator the friend then said he had also heard that the new england patriots quarterback cover idol tom brady was here for representative dennis j kucinich no way , the man said asked if he was serious , the friend , kevin conroy of manchester , explained only that i like to say outrageous things and that he was supporting fred d thompson a tent from which european broadcasters were trying to do standups as an extremely vocal signholder for ron paul stood nearby , yelling about the evils of the federal reserve well , the guy s sure getting his message out , said one norwegian broadcaster , tove bjorgaas \( we 're like the norwegian pbs \) cspan s campaign '08 bus , and something that sounds at first like a fancypants motorcade , but turns out to be just an ambulance and a fire engine the tour ends in the lobby of the radisson hotel , a favorite spot for people who get a kick out of seeing semifamous political and news media types among the star gazers , no one was more easily dazzled than debbie andersen of sandown , nh , who had taken her 9yearold daughter and her two friends out of school so as not to miss the sight of so many mucketymucks and personalities in one place just after 2 pm , ms andersen and the girls had their noses pressed up against the windows of nbc s makeshift bureau , like extremedieters outside an ice cream parlor i think that s john edwards in there , she said , pointing to a man holding a microphone in the far corner of the bureau \( it turned out to be some other guy with good hair \) suddenly , ms andersen spotted david gregory of nbc walking her way , and let out an actual shriek oh my god , she said , jumping in front of mr gregory and flashing his photo from close range , causing him to squint i'm like a paparazzi with my 3 camera who was that anyway \? five minutes later , ms andersen was seen , literally , bowing at the feet of patrick j buchanan , the former republican candidate and now a cnn commentator oh god , i'm never doing this again , said kristin iller , 14 , a friend of ms andersen s daughter , who was looking on , horrified in the last few days , supporters of mr mccain , republican of arizona , have taken to chanting mack is back at his rallies and appearances across the state it s a nice little chant , to be sure , except that no one who knows mr mccain has any knowledge of the man ever being called mack mr mccain confirmed as much tuesday aboard his campaign bus , the straight talk express but he allowed that as a line for a resurgent campaign , mack is back beats the comeback kid , which bill clinton famously coopted after finishing a surprising second in the 1992 primary here mr mccain added that he never really had a nickname speaking of mr mccain , democratic candidates love nothing more than to advertise their alliances with the senator , who tends to be popular with democrats and independents and is thus coveted as a public friend the phenomenon became particularly egregious in the 2004 presidential campaign , in which senators john edwards , joseph i lieberman and , particularly , john kerry \( who courted mr mccain to be his running mate \) fell all over themselves to boast of their i love mccain \( and he loves me , too ! \) bona fides at one point , mr mccain even joked in a speech i now know why joe lieberman , john edwards and john kerry are always so anxious to cosponsor legislation with me it seems they not only want to work with me they actually wanted to be me i feel so violated the 2008 version of the i love mccain \( and he loves me , too ! \) primary has heated up in recent days as mr mccain has risen in polls here former president bill clinton and senator hillary rodham clinton have been especially conscientious about mentioning mccain collaborations but mrs clinton took the prize monday at a rally in which she spoke about a trip she had taken to iraq with mr mccain he and i have done some traveling together , mrs clinton said and she added , what happens on the road stays on the road she grinned as members of the audience roared with laughter , none more so than bill , who was standing behind her the imagination reels , or does n't
his class in international relations was starting in 10 minutes , but tang tang was busy studying a map on a computer screen inside a cramped common room at the prestigious tsinghua university his major is international relations the chinese equivalent of political science and his screen displayed the biggest political show in the world the redandblue electoral jigsaw of the united states , with every state written in chinese characters mr tang , 23 , admitted that the american election had been a serious distraction during his wednesday morning classes given the different time zones , the outcome was still uncertain yet now that he could assess the historic obama victory , mr tang s reaction seemed akin to that of a sports fan dissecting a box score and betrayed none of the hopeful idealism once conferred on westernstyled democracy by young chinese intellectuals we are different from the younger generation 20 years ago , mr tang said , alluding to the generation defined , and scarred , by the 1989 prodemocracy demonstrations at tiananmen square now we can take a more rational , sober approach when we observe the election the generation 20 years ago grew up in a different environment america was like a completely different world it would be shocking to watch this in a country as huge as china , there were an array of reactions on wednesday to senator barack obama s victory , whether surprise , bemusement or even moments of enthusiasm for an exercise in democracy that seems so quintessentially american but mr tang s cool detachment , if hardly indifference , is just a small reminder that while the youthful elite of china remain intrigued by the american experiment , many of them are no longer awed by it the bookcases outside mr tang s classrooms are filled with journals assessing the sinoamerican relationship , and several students said mr obama s candidacy had become a subject of much interest and discussion but china s own political evolution seems unlikely to be significantly altered by a historic election half a world away mr tang s biggest concern one expressed by several other students was how an obama presidency would , or would not , influence relations with china mr tang had even studied past american presidents and found a trend they talk tough about china at first but then soften over time he assumed mr obama would be the same this is huge for america , mr tang said but for the chinese , i do n't think we are paying as much attention a few minutes later , he checked his watch sorry , i 've got to get to class , he said jim yardley photos dubai , united arab emirates employees of the arabiclanguage news channel al arabiya prepared for a program on the american elections on tuesday senior editors had expected a victory by senator john mccain \( photograph by tamara abdul hadi for the new york times \) nyangoma kogelo , kenya some of senator barack obama s kenyan relatives from left to right , said obama , mama sarah and auma obama met with reporters on wednesday to talk about mr obama s victory \( photograph by evelyn hockstein for the new york times \)
rome italians often minimize what afflicts them with this philosophy without the bad , no one would appreciate the good the question now on the table , almost literally , is whether their passion for food and the money it makes will finally force action against the lawlessness that is hurting the name of one of s most revered delicacies mozzarella made with buffalo milk in the last few months , sales of buffalo mozzarella have dropped 40 percent , the product s trade association says the problem makes for a nearperfect morality play about italy for years , the nation s paralyzed political class has done little to halt hugescale illegal dumping of trash , some of it toxic , around naples that area happens to produce some of the best mozzarella a new trash crisis peaked yet again , and last week fears that food might be contaminated seemed confirmed when health officials announced elevated levels of the carcinogen dioxin in samples of buffalo mozzarella last weekend , south korea banned imports of the cheese , and italy began scrambling to avoid deep damage to one of its most emblematic products it is a usual sad italian story , said silvio ursini , 46 , who two years ago started obik , a restaurant here that specializes in quality buffalo mozzarella on tuesday , mr ursini , along with farmers , producers and government officials , went on an offensive to persuade more countries not to ban sales while the exact cause of the contamination has not yet been established , they said the producers with elevated levels of dioxin in their milk were few and that none belonged to the consortium that receives the protected designation of origin quality seal from the european union the protected region , they noted , is big , and much of it is far from illegal trash it really is a problem of criminals making a counterfeit product from godknowswhat , said mr ursini , who expects to open a branch in new york soon mozzarellawise , we 're in good shape i just hope the whole thing does n't become a panic much is at stake in a business that stretches back nearly to antiquity invading barbarians are believed to have brought the first buffalo from asia as early as the sixth century some 30 , 000 tons of the highquality protected cheese are produced each year , representing nearly half a billion dollars in sales while some buffalo mozzarella is exported to europe and elsewhere , notably russia and japan , italians eat most of it they are now eating much less alessandro cervini , owner of zaz , an organic takeout pizza place here , said he stopped serving buffalo mozzarella on pizza in january , even though he buys only from topquality makers even if we have a certificate , people wo n't eat it , he said mozzarella does not have to be made with buffalo milk , and he now uses only cheese made from cows , the type melted on most pizza anyway to send a message of concern , italian health officials are meeting wednesday to discuss the scale of any contamination and how to end it harder to fix is the larger problem for decades the camorra , the naples organized crime group , has made a profitable business illegally dumping trash , and no one has stopped it for now , there are two investigations running one concerns the larger problem of crime and why naples periodically floods over with its own refuse the other focuses on complicity between shady mozzarella producers and local officials who reportedly knew about the contamination still there is hope that this time something may be done , because the damage is spreading now it is visible , mr cervini said of the effects of allowing organized crime to keep dumping it s like when the mafia dumps bodies but you do n't know why now you see it
the results were so thoroughly precooked that there was no surprise in the senate s 69to28 vote today to gut a law that has protected americans from spying by their own government for 30 years still , it was distressing and depressing to watch congress wrench americans civil liberties back to where they were in the days before watergate , when the united states government listened to our phone calls whenever it wanted we had hoped , at least , that the supporters of this awful bill would make a substantive case for their position instead , they offered up the usual thick stew of fear mongering mixed with big chunks of disinformation senator christopher s bond , the missouri republican who is vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee , said there was nothing to fear in the bill unless you have al qaeda on your speed dial actually , the bill has nothing to do with whether al qaeda is on your speed dial it dilutes safeguards in the old foreign intelligence surveillance act that directed government eavesdropping at threats like al qaeda the bill will permit the government to intercept your telephone calls , cell phone calls , letters , faxes and email messages to other countries basically whenever it wants the government eavesdroppers won t need a warrant and they won t even have to say they are trying to prevent a terrorist act all the government has to do is certify that its target is someone overseas and it can snoop all it wants for an entire year without a warrant does the cia want to listen in on all the calls to say , damascus , or tel aviv , or london \? no problem , just get the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to certify that no one in this country is the target of that investigation and they can listen to every call made to those cities from the united states , regardless of who is making them proponents of the bill , and much of news coverage , are portraying the vote as a battle between liberals \( in the 2008 edition of the bush gop dictionary that means lilylivered appeasers of terrorism \) and conservatives \( patriots who understand the threat to america and have nothing to hide and therefore nothing to fear \) first , there is no position more conservative than fighting to protect the rights and liberties enshrined in the bill of rights , and nothing more radical than trying to undermine them second , anyone with an elementaryschool understanding of american history can recite cases in which the government spied on , harassed and even imprisoned people who did nothing more than exercise their constitutional right to express their political beliefs this bill was not a compromise , as the spinners would have it it was a bad bill period democrats who voted for it did so primarily because they were afraid to vote against a national security bill in an election year here is the roll call  all of the republicans voted for the bill except for john mccain , who was too busy campaigning to cast a vote on a bill that many of his fellow republicans , including president bush , claimed was one of the most important national security bills of our time senator barack obama , who had once promised to filibuster against immunity for the telecommunications companies , executed a deeply distressing pivot in recent weeks , hewing to the best we could do line that was adopted by many democrats today , he voted to cut off debate on the bill , and then voted for its final passage fortunately , mr obama seemed to have no influence over democrats who opposed the bill none of them joined him in changing their positions
washington barack obama will be the third democratic president in the last 40 years the first two , wildly different as human beings , had one important thing in common they both got off to a dreadful start jimmy carter failed to win passage of any signature program in his first year , never really recovered , and could n't win reelection bill clinton made himself so unpopular that his party was swept out of power in congress in 1994 ultimately , he bounced back , won a second term , and had a reasonably successful presidency but there s no question that his disastrous first two years limited what he could ultimately achieve any new president would be foolish not to look back at those experiences and try to figure out what went wrong , and how it might be avoided and there are plenty of lessons to look at mr carter s seeming arrogance and lack of familiarity with washington mr clinton s politically clumsy health care plan and lack of personal or managerial discipline but there s something else that presidentelect obama ought to think carefully about numbers simple , beguiling , ultimately misleading numbers it would be hard to overstate what a different universe capitol hill was three decades ago jimmy carter came in with huge democratic majorities there was a filibusterproof 61seat majority in the senate , while in the house , more than twothirds of the members were democrats perhaps he can be forgiven for thinking that he had enough legislative support for the ambitious program he wanted to enact welfare reform , national health care , a comprehensive energy package and a great deal else but president carter failed to grasp or refused to confront the mathematical reality that every reporter in the press gallery instinctively understood that democratic majority was almost totally illusory of the 292 house democrats sworn in that january , about 70 were conservative southerners with little personal loyalty to the president and none at all to a mainstream democratic agenda perhaps 30 more were bigcity machine democrats , the last of a dying breed , with little interest in public policy at all other than offering an occasional vote to labor and asking politely for instructions from the party back home to get anywhere , mr carter needed help from what was then still a sizeable contingent of moderate republicans yet , falsely confident in his majority , he made little effort to reach out bill clinton , taking office 16 years later , made a different mistake he took the rules of the senate too literally they provide that bills are declared passed when they receive a majority but by 1993 , this had ceased to be true the right to filibuster , used extremely sparingly for almost two centuries of american political life , was now considered an acceptable tool for the minority in fighting against anything it wanted to fight it did n't take 50 votes to pass a bill it took 60 , the number required to end a filibuster and force a vote on election night of 1992 , the senate republican leader , bob dole , declared belligerently on television that mr clinton would need 60 votes for anything important he wanted to pass this may have sounded to the presidentelect like an empty threat with 57 senators on the democratic side of the aisle , he must have felt he could charm or cajole just three republicans into voting with him but the senate had significantly changed even since jimmy carter s time moderate republicans , who once made up nearly half of their party s senate membership , had seen their ranks dwindle to at most 10 or 12 meanwhile , nearly a dozen conservative southern democrats had been replaced by even more conservative republicans the reality was that while president clinton could find 50 senate votes for many of the things he wanted , getting to 60 was far more difficult than he had imagined the only realistic way to do it was to bring in at least a few of the moderate republicans as full legislative partners , even at the risk of alienating leftofcenter democrats given the level of republican party discipline under mr dole , it s not clear that this would have worked in any case , president clinton did n't really try the ambitious health care program introduced in his first year failed for many reasons , but in the end , there never was any plausible way to get to 60 votes , not with a program that was viewed as an exclusively democratic project and a president who was rapidly losing credibility among the electorate at large had there been 60 or 61 democratic senators that year rather than 57 , it would have made little difference mr clinton was just not strong enough in the country to achieve supermajorities in congress the one major success of his first year passage of a fiscally responsible budget became law only because , by a quirk of congressional rules , it could n't be filibustered now , 16 years later , another democrat gets his chance in many ways , the political environment has turned upside down the democratic party in congress is no longer the fragile and ideologically disparate group it was in 1977 or even 1993 it is now a remarkably cohesive leftofcenter majority , with the presence of several dozen fiscally conservative blue dog democrats in the house only a minor obstacle to its unity now the question is not whether the next congress will be willing to support president obama s vision , but whether this majority will want to move further in a liberal direction than the country wishes to move barack obama is a man of compelling gifts , but in the end he was elected primarily because the republicans had made a hash of things , not because of his charm or elegance if he shows any early signs of being the ideological leftwing president john mccain warned of , he will be stepping into his own kind of political trap , different from the ones that ensnared jimmy carter and bill clinton , but potentially just as debilitating nor is he free of the filibuster problem he almost certainly wo n't have 60 democratic senators to work with , but that was always an overrated issue a president who commands the allegiance of most americans can usually find a way to reach 60 votes in the senate , as george w bush did in his first term on tax cuts and education reform but a president who does not have that allegiance ca n't get there no matter how many democrats are sitting in the chamber the route to breaking filibusters runs through the court of public opinion more than it does the senate chamber and , despite the democrats' remarkable gains over the last two national elections , the party remains to the left of the electorate all of this suggests that , to escape the fate of messrs carter and clinton , barack obama needs to preserve the centrist image he cultivated during the campaign to reinforce the personal good will that both parties genuinely seemed to feel for him on election night to avoid letting impatient democratic majorities tempt him into pushing initiatives that the electorate wo n't support and still somehow emerge with a record of accomplishment that bears some resemblance to the promises he made all over the country this fall one might argue that doing all this does n't just call for statesmanship , eloquence or legislative skill it calls for a magician on the other hand , barack obama has already done something that seemed impossible maybe he is one

southport , england july winds , chilled and blowing at 30 miles an hour , are not cause for celebration in most places but the northwest coast of england where july can be just a rumor is not most places here , the highest sand dunes on the british coastline have been formed by eons of such weather on the eve of the 137th british open , many bundledup britons traipsed through the dunes at royal birkdale golf club wearing cashmere , tweed , woolen stocking caps and big smiles these hardies may be getting even giddier at 6 30 am thursday , when craig parry of australia hits the opening tee shot , because the forecast is for rain to complement the winds off the irish sea this attitude is all about stiffening the open test , and it was reflected in the mood of the chief executive of the royal and ancient , peter dawson he appeared almost mirthful at his pretournament news conference as he delivered a smashing amateur meteorology report in his uppercrust british accent i think all is set fair for tomorrow for perhaps a windier championship than we 've had in recent years , he said the forecast seems to be moving the wind speeds up slowly but surely , and i think we 're going to have a bit of breeze for once , which is good to look forward to bit of a breeze \? as an example of what will face the field of 156 golfers , consider that steve stricker hit a 3wood for his second shot at no 2 , a 421yard , par4 hole , which he had reached with a 7iron during his sunday practice round that s a big difference , hitting a 7iron compared to a 3wood , stricker said that s a big change it is also will be a big challenge for the players , and a welcome sight for the very large and enthusiastic galleries whether winds gusting from 20 to 30 mph are considered a bit of a breeze or a proper wind is open to debate , but inarguable is this scots axiom nae wind , nae rain , nae golf no wind , no rain , no golf the first major since the 1996 pga championship to commence with no tiger woods will at least have all those elements to validate it and none of the contestants are complaining yet that could change when actual numbers begin to go up on leader boards next to names on thursday , possibly as early as the 450yard , par4 first hole yeah , i mean , this is all you would want , said , the champion especially the first hole , where you ca n't really take your driver , so you have to lay up to the dogleg with a 2iron or a 3iron , and then you 're looking at 4iron into the green so you 've got two long shots to start it s an incredible opening hole after abandoning his final practice round after nine holes because of the conditions , adam scott called the first tee shot at birkdale the toughest i mean , the wind is affecting the ball 20 , 30 , 40 yards at times , scott , an australian , said welcome to royal birkdale , where the fairways are generous but are mined with devilishly placed bunkers , exacting a price for imprecision on a calm day , most of the golfers would be lining up tee shots on fairway bunkers and blithely blasting away but when crosswinds are moving golf balls up to 120 feet offline , yardage books are as relevant as a 1700s nautical chart when it gets like this , you just have to simplify things , said , a twotime open champion you have to see it , feel it and trust it that means looking at an 87yard shot and deciding to punchchip a 5iron into the green , as norman did wednesday at the 544yard 15th hole it means cutting a quailhigh 3iron from 188 yards out of the right rough and rolling it onto the green at the 457yard eighth hole , as the 1997 open champion , justin leonard , did monday it s very much a mental exercise , said ernie els , who won the 2002 open at muirfield in weather similar to that forecast for this week you 've got to be very patient you 've got to feel like a lot of guys are going to make mistakes , you 're going to make mistakes yourself and you 've got to rebound from that and you 've got to be a strong ball striker to play in tough weather conditions that basically describes els , sergio garc a , justin rose , lee westwood , geoff ogilvy , jim furyk , scott , andr s romero and hunter mahan rose who pitched in from the rough left of the 18th green on sunday 10 years ago is among those who are hoping the forecasts are correct and the british open weather comes and stays for four days the yardage book goes out the window , and basically you 've just got to rely on feel , said rose , now a seasoned pro of 27 that s hopefully where growing up in the uk and having played some really big events in some atrocious weather as an amateur , and also through open championships and what have you , that s hopefully where that little bit of experience might just pay off variables blow in on the cold northwest equalizer , which blows where it will at a becalmed st andrews in 2000 , when woods was demolishing the field and the old course , an inscription on the chalkboard in the bar of the dunvegan hotel in st andrews all but begged for the prevailing wind off the sea to come to the defense of the lady the old course it read , the lady remains defenseless without wind yes , the lady needs the winds to protect her charms blow , wind , blow it did not blow then it is now royal birkdale needs it for protection , even without woods in the field , and the fans have welcomed its coming
it is a grave humanitarian crisis 15 million iraqi refugees living in deplorable and declining conditions in syria and jordan they are clustered not in camps but in overcrowded urban neighborhoods , crammed into dark , squalid apartments many have been traumatized by extreme violence their savings are dwindling many cannot afford to pay for rent , heat and food few have proper medical care after meeting with refugees , leaders in both syria and jordan and united nations experts , we came to the inescapable conclusion that this crisis could endure for years and that much more help is needed now there is absolutely no denying that the united states has a special responsibility to help the sectarian violence these iraqi refugees have fled is a byproduct of the invasion and its chaotic aftermath yet america has paradoxically done far less than its traditionally generous response but while the united states must lead , the scale of this humanitarian emergency and its uncertain duration require international contributions , including the active participation of european and gulf arab states the refugees face three alternatives return , remain or resettle none is a good option it is too dangerous to go back , they will become increasingly destitute if they remain where they are , and yet only a few will be resettled in other countries the united states and the international community must therefore take three actions to ease the plight of displaced iraqis until the day comes when they can safely return home first , these refugees simply need more aid we estimate that to serve this population a minimum of 2 billion is needed annually for at least the next two to four years and it is fitting that the united states cover at least half of this cost contributions from the international community have been woefully inadequate so far this year the united states has given only 208 million in direct humanitarian assistance for displaced iraqis the gulf states have given 11 million since last october and with its significant oil funds , the iraqi government must do better in assisting its own uprooted citizens the 25 million it has allocated in this year s budget is grossly insufficient host countries must also allow nongovernmental organizations better access to iraqi refugees and affected local communities second , because a sizable population of iraqis will not return home under any circumstances , more refugees must be resettled in more third countries unfortunately , many doors have closed or are being closed again , the united states must lead , and it is failing our government has resettled fewer than 5 , 000 iraqi refugees since the war began this year america should at a minimum meet its target of resettling 12 , 000 iraqi refugees and fulfilling its commitment to admit 5 , 000 iraqis \( and their dependents \) who have worked for the united states and are eligible for special immigrant visas in the years ahead , the united states can realistically admit at least 30 , 000 iraqis annually european countries especially britain , which , like america , bears a particular responsibility should be taking in larger numbers of vulnerable iraqis like single women with children and those who worked for the coalition third , it is important to bring attention to the iraq refugee problem to this end , the united nations secretary general , ban kimoon , should organize a highlevel conference of regional countries and interested donors the conference should examine the plight of iraqi refugees and pledge concrete help because there is also an urgent need for actions that can improve conditions in iraq and facilitate the safe , voluntary return of many refugees , the conference must include foreign ministers who can grapple with the diplomatic and political aspects of the crisis , not simply the humanitarian ones discussions about iraq both here and abroad inevitably focus on the surge and on timelines for troop withdrawal missing is any realistic assessment of the fate of iraqi refugees , 15 million people who have a crucial role to play in ensuring the longterm stability of the region
and so it came to pass that on nov 4 , 2008 , shortly after 11 pm eastern time , the american civil war ended , as a black man barack hussein obama won enough electoral votes to become president of the united states a civil war that , in many ways , began at bull run , virginia , on july 21 , 1861 , ended 147 years later via a ballot box in the very same state for nothing more symbolically illustrated the final chapter of america s civil war than the fact that the commonwealth of virginia the state that once exalted slavery and whose secession from the union in 1861 gave the confederacy both strategic weight and its commanding general voted democratic , thus assuring that barack obama would become the 44th president of the united states this moment was necessary , for despite a century of civil rights legislation , judicial interventions and social activism despite brown v board of education , martin luther king s ihaveadream crusade and the 1964 civil rights act the civil war could never truly be said to have ended until america s white majority actually elected an africanamerican as president that is what happened tuesday night and that is why we awake this morning to a different country the struggle for equal rights is far from over , but we start afresh now from a whole new baseline let every child and every citizen and every new immigrant know that from this day forward everything really possible in america how did obama pull it off \? to be sure , it probably took a onceinacentury economic crisis to get enough white people to vote for a black man and to be sure , obama s better organization , calm manner , mellifluous speaking style and unthreatening message of change all served him well but there also may have been something of a buffett effect that countered the supposed bradley effect white voters telling pollsters they 'd vote for obama but then voting for the white guy the buffett effect was just the opposite it was white conservatives telling the guys in the men s grill at the country club that they were voting for john mccain , but then quietly going into the booth and voting for obama , even though they knew it would mean higher taxes why \? some did it because they sensed how inspired and hopeful their kids were about an obama presidency , and they not only did n't want to dash those hopes , they secretly wanted to share them others intuitively embraced warren buffett s view that if you are rich and successful today , it is first and foremost because you were lucky enough to be born in america at this time and never forget that so , we need to get back to fixing our country we need a president who can unify us for nationbuilding at home and somewhere they also knew that after the abysmal performance of the bush team , there had to be consequences for the republican party electing mccain now would have , in some way , meant rewarding incompetence it would have made a mockery of accountability in government and unleashed a wave of cynicism in america that would have been deeply corrosive obama will always be our first black president but can he be one of our few presidents \? he is going to have his chance because our greatest presidents are those who assumed the office at some of our darkest hours and at the bottom of some of our deepest holes taking office at a time of crisis does n't guarantee greatness , but it can be an occasion for it , argued the harvard university political philosopher michael sandel that was certainly the case with lincoln , fdr and truman part of fdr s greatness , though , was that he gradually wove a new governing political philosophy the new deal out of the rubble and political disarray of the economic depression he inherited obama will need to do the same , but these things take time fdr did not run on the new deal in 1932 , said sandel he ran on balancing the budget like obama , he did not take office with a clearly articulated governing philosophy he arrived with a confident , activist spirit and experimented not until 1936 did we have a presidential campaign about the new deal what obama s equivalent will be , even he does n't know it will emerge as he grapples with the economy , energy and america s role in the world these challenges are so great that he will only succeed if he is able to articulate a new politics of the common good bush co did not believe that government could be an instrument of the common good they neutered their cabinet secretaries and appointed hacks to big jobs for them , pursuit of the common good was all about pursuit of individual selfinterest voters rebelled against that but there was also a rebellion against a traditional democratic version of the common good that it is simply the sum of all interest groups clamoring for their share in this election , the american public rejected these narrow notions of the common good , argued sandel most people now accept that unfettered markets do n't serve the public good markets generate abundance , but they can also breed excessive insecurity and risk even before the financial meltdown , we 've seen a massive shift of risk from corporations to the individual obama will have to reinvent government as an instrument of the common good to regulate markets , to protect citizens against the risks of unemployment and ill health , to invest in energy independence but a new politics of the common good ca n't be only about government and markets it must also be about a new patriotism about what it means to be a citizen , said sandel this is the deepest chord obama s campaign evoked the biggest applause line in his stump speech was the one that said every american will have a chance to go to college provided he or she performs a period of national service in the military , in the peace corps or in the community obama s campaign tapped a dormant civic idealism , a hunger among americans to serve a cause greater than themselves , a yearning to be citizens again none of this will be easy but my gut tells me that of all the changes that will be ushered in by an obama presidency , breaking with our racial past may turn out to be the least of them there is just so much work to be done the civil war is over let reconstruction begin
pittsburgh joe girardi tries hard to stay optimistic and project confidence in all of his players but there are games that try him , and tuesday s was one of them the returned from a day off and fell flat at pnc park , where they were thumped by the , 125 in a short but sharp address to his players after the game , girardi criticized their lack of preparation and sloppy play the whole game bothered me , said girardi , the yankees' manager we stunk , is the bottom line we stunk asked how he stays positive while reminding players that such an effort grates on him , girardi was equally succinct it gets done , he said i 'll leave it at that the yankees lost two of three games over the weekend , succumbing to strong pitching by the cincinnati reds this game was different , and the yankees understood girardi s frustration i do n't think he needed to express that , said alex rodriguez , who was 0 for 5 we were all very upset the yankees faced a pirates starter , tom gorzelanny , who has more walks than strikeouts gorzelanny played to form , walking five in the first four innings none of those walks led to a run we let him off , girardi said a guy that s been struggling with his command , and we get the free passes we did n't get the hits when we needed to the pirates got hit after hit against darrell rasner and two relievers they blitzed rasner for 10 hits and 7 runs in five innings , then went 9 for 16 against latroy hawkins and edwar ram rez in all , it was a 19hit barrage that had rasner stating the obvious i just was n't making pitches when i needed to make them , he said everything was up , and they hit balls hard every time it was up i just need to get pitches down , get on top of the ball maybe guys are getting a little comfortable in there against me maybe i need to pitch inside a little more but i think it s an easy fix the yankees hope so , because rasner seemed to be a sure thing for a while with phil hughes out until august and chienming wang gone even longer , they need to rely on rasner when they face the mets in a daynight , twostadium doubleheader on friday , the yankees will start the untested dan giese and the castoff sidney ponson rasner is scheduled for sunday , where he will try to improve on a fivestart stretch in which he is 14 with a 700 earned run average darrell gives us everything he s got when he s out there , girardi said his effort is tremendous , and he 'll straighten it out i do n't have a lot of concerns we need to get him straightened out and get him back to where he was he s getting too much of the plate , that s all it was the first meaningful game here between the teams since the 1960 world series , won on a game 7 home run by bill mazeroski , who threw out the ceremonial first pitch tuesday there was little drama thereafter , just a lot of bashing by the pirates , who rank third in the national league in runs scored justin christian went 2 for 4 in his major league debut for the yankees , but they had few other highlights gorzelanny walked two in the first inning , but derek jeter bounced into a double play his teamleading 10th of the season and rodriguez struck out with a runner on second in the third , gorzelanny started rasner with two strikes in rasner s first career plate appearance but four balls followed , and then four more to jeter got ahead in the count but tapped a ball back to gorzelanny for a force out bobby abreu who is 5 for his last 41 followed with a groundball double play the misery continued in the fourth , when the yankees scored once but left the bases loaded when cabrera grounded to short two fly outs stranded a runner at second in the sixth , and the yankees squandered a leadoff double in the seventh i ca n't rate frustration , jeter said pretty much , they killed us today obviously , it did n't look good you come back and play tomorrow you ca n't lose sight of the fact we 've been playing pretty good it is true enough the yankees are five games over 500 , at 4136 but their manager did not like what he saw on tuesday , and he was not afraid to say so inside pitch the yankees' kyle farnsworth is the answer to a trivia question about the pirates' former home , three rivers stadium on oct 1 , 2000 , farnsworth pitched two scoreless innings of relief for the chicago cubs to become the winning pitcher in the final game at the ballpark farnsworth said he was aware of his distinction and kept two ticket stubs from the game , a 109 victory before 55 , 351 fans joe girardi was with the cubs at the time , but did not play in the game
twenty years of hard work have paid off watching deliver punchy versions of sinatra standards with a 17piece band on tuesday evening , you could hardly guess that two decades ago he was a different musical animal in those early days mr feinstein was a polite pianobar crooner with too many rings on his fingers , who exuded the hothouse aura of a former child prodigy serenading bluehaired ladies and their lapdogs with gershwin and berlin standards at moments he suggested a young liberace minus the flamboyant flourishes since then that atmosphere of preciousness has largely evaporated at the ballroom of feinstein s at loews regency , where he is appearing through saturday , he came across as a seasoned swingband vocalist with almost as much visceral clout as frank sinatra , to whom he pays tribute on his newest album , the sinatra project \( concord \) mr feinstein , unlike sinatra , could never be described as dangerous he has none of the pressurized anger that was an essential sinatra personality trait with mr feinstein you do n't worry that in midperformance an eruption might take place he wants to please , not to vent especially in his ultrapolished ballad singing his disciplined perfectionism creates a protective veneer that said , his swinging versions of it s all right with me , for once in my life and the lady is a tramp \( the last two are not on the new album \) carried serious rhythmic bite hammering the downbeats with a percussive ferocity , he showed he can more than hold his own with latterday sinatra acolytes like michael bubl and harry connick jr the excellent arrangements by bill elliott , who conducted the band , playfully quoted those of nelson riddle and billy may on sinatra s late1950s albums without seeming slavishly copycat as on the sinatra project the most inspired moment was his rendition of begin the beguine , sung with an arrangement that echoed that of sinatra s famous version of i 've got you under my skin it was an ideal musical double exposure because it allowed mr feinstein to glide through the lyrics like a champion figure skater , treating the rhythmic hot spots like twirling leaps , and completely owning the song
to the extent that the tenor saxophonist kidd jordan is known in the general jazz world , he s known as a new orleans patriarch and educator dig deeper and you might also hear about his long , eclectic career as a sideman and his role in inspiring the formation of both the dirty dozen brass band and the world saxophone quartet but mr jordan , 73 , has never made much of a dent as a solo artist , and he still does n't have an entry in the biographical encyclopedia of jazz \( oxford \) none of which should be seen as a reflection of mr jordan s prowess , or his prominence among a certain adventurous subspecies of jazz fan at the vision festival , held annually on the lower east side , he commands a sort of veneration on wednesday at the clemente soto v lez cultural center , the festival devoted a full evening of programming to mr jordan , bestowing what it calls a lifetime recognition honor and he earned that distinction , playing hard in four ensembles and presiding over a fifth , in a room that might charitably be described as ventilation challenged the group that did n't include mr jordan was a sextet featuring two of his accomplished sons marlon , a trumpeter , and kent , a flutist their set , atypical for the festival , involved postbop standards by john coltrane and wayne shorter in terms of content and execution , it would have suited a midtown jazz club every ensemble featuring mr jordan , by contrast , knocked about in the realm of free improvisation he s a master of that tradition , one of a handful of saxophonists of his generation to absorb the breakthroughs of his contemporaries coltrane and ornette coleman , not just as a shock but also as a spur his technique has the capacity to astonish , especially in the altissimo range but he works to ensure that the technical takes a backseat to the soulful that much was clear in the first of his two sets with william parker on bass and hamid drake on drums , the same partners as on palm of soul \( aum fidelity \) , one of mr jordan s few available albums during one heated stretch , he engaged in a strident backandforth with the violinist billy bang during another , he took the horn out of his mouth and called out exhortations he seemed just as committed to a quintet with mr parker , the trumpeter clyde kerr , the pianist joel futterman and the drummer gerald cleaver his rapport with mr futterman in particular they have recorded together was striking earlier he had struggled to find the right chemistry with another strong pianist , dave burrell but the set with mr burrell had also presented mr jordan with an intuitive foil , the baritone saxophonist hamiet bluiett their dual improvisation kept returning to the substance of a spiritual , with rewarding results a similar thing happened in the evening s exquisite finale mr jordan locked horns with fred anderson , a fellow tenor and former vision festival honoree as on the album 2 days in april \( eremite \) , recorded in 1999 , they dug in deeply with mr parker and mr drake but first there was a conversational prelude , in which the two saxophonists tossed phrases back and forth , rejoicing and rejoindering with a mischievous secret wisdom
melbourne , australia with this tennis season now in full swing on the new , blue courts at the australian open , last season s troubles are still in plain view there is an atypical amount of interest in the news conferences of nikolay davydenko and martin vassallo arguello , whose match last year in sopot , poland , is still being examined by tour investigators and after the concerns that surfaced last year about possible match fixing , the tournament organizers have adopted new policies shutting down the onsite gambling window and shutting down onsite access to realtime gambling web sites they have also created a roundtheclock integrity hot line and mounted an aggressive education campaign players returning to melbourne park quickly face walls with signs that underscore the official change in tone the signs read , tennis australia has a zero tolerance policy on illegal gambling , match fixing and the communication of sensitive information which may affect the outcome of a match and will investigate all reported instances underneath that warning , the number for the integrity hot line is featured prominently there are signs everywhere , signs in the locker room , said lindsay davenport , who is in the midst of a successful postmaternity comeback it is strange , but i'm amazed it took this long for people to realize it of course you ca n't control some things it s an individual sport , but i hope that if it s true with the people who were doing it , i hope there are some ramifications for now , three italian men s players alessio di mauro , daniele bracciali and potito starace have been fined and given suspensions ranging from several weeks to nine months for gambling on matches , none of which were their own some players have suggested that the italians have been used to make a point , but vince spadea , in his 16th year on tour , said that gambling on tennis by players was worth taking seriously i guess that s the cousin of match fixing , he said there s a lot of players struggling to make a living , so on paper it s frightening , but at the same time i think we have a fair sport right now to get to the level to even get into these situations where your matches would be placed online to gamble on , it takes a lot of hard work we 're not going to throw it all away , 20 years of hitting tennis balls , unless we 're talking about something that is really an extreme , isolated case that they may or may not find the sport as a whole is still researching its options and working out the details of the collective integrity unit being created by its multiple governing bodies jeffrey rees and ben gunn , the former british police officers who have been hired to lead the sport s internal investigation , will be in melbourne until the end of the tournament to interview players , coaches and even some journalists but tennis australia had to reach conclusions and move ahead quickly we could n't wait , because we had the event , said craig tiley , the open s tournament director so we went ahead and did our own environmental review three months ago one conclusion was that the tournament needed to block access to gambling sites in player areas like the lounge , locker room and restaurant we 've identified any possible realtime gambling site we can , tiley said but the thing with that is how the internet works the moment you block one , something else pops up as at some tournaments last fall , laptop computers have been banned from the stands unless their owners secure formal permission from the organizers the ban is , in part , to keep gamblers from taking advantage of the slight time gap between live tennis and televised tennis a cellphone ban was considered and rejected more detailed background checks have also been performed on those seeking credentials for the tournament , which is about to become commonplace on the tour , too it s something coaches and people around the game are not necessarily happy about , said larry scott , the chief executive of the women s tour nobody likes to submit themselves to background checks , but protecting the security of our players is paramount what remains unresolved is how to treat injury information , a valuable commodity in gambling circles more transparency could remove gamblers' ability to pressure players , but more transparency runs counter to the sport s individualistic culture top players are often secretive about their injuries , eager to avoid giving a mental edge to the opposition it is one of the reasons that stars like the williams sisters often employ personal trainers , but keeping secrets in the tennis microcosm remains a challenge the problem is our locker room is open if i'm in there and something just happened to me in practice , there are 20 girls who are going to see it , davenport said i do n't think they 're going to be able to control the information it still gets around like wildfire corruption was the first issue scott addressed in his remarks at a general women s player meeting on saturday i was talking to them in a way i do n't usually , he said i was essentially warning them if you 're caught match fixing , it s a careerending situation scott confirmed that several women s players had informed him that they had been approached to throw matches or provide insider information numerous men s players , including dmitry tursunov , also came forward last year with similar accounts , and the men s tour is continuing its investigation into the davydenkovassallo arguello match that generated suspect betting patterns players of all levels tell us that they have been approached , but that s no proof of corruption , scott said we have no concern that players have broken a rule , but plenty of concern in general
hanoi , vietnam senator s wartime jailer thrust two fingers into the air as if he were on a campaign trail and shouted john mccain ! my friend ! victory ! it is a fiction he seems to revel in the jailer who was actually the prisoner s friend , who has watched his political career with paternal pride , and who is now hurt and offended when mr mccain , the republican presidential nominee , says he was tortured by his captors tran trong duyet , 75 , was head of the guard unit at hoa lo prison nicknamed the hanoi hilton during mr mccain s fiveandahalfyear imprisonment , which began after his bomber was shot down over the city in october 1967 mr duyet presided over the neglect and torture of mr mccain , which was witnessed by his fellow prisoners and which left him with lasting injuries the experience has become a staple of mr mccain s political biography , and it has given mr duyet a place in a footnote of history , which he occupies with gusto for most vietnamese , though , mr mccain s story is an obscure artifact of a receding history in a week of interviews around hanoi , neither his imprisonment nor his presidential candidacy seemed to arouse much excitement vietnam s relations with the united states are on an even keel , and vietnam has little at stake in the election while mr mccain wins points among some vietnamese for having supported the normalization of relations with the united states in 1995 , his story , for the most part , has taken on an aura of wartime kitsch in vietnam , like the selfparodying propaganda posters that are now sold in galleries , or the good morning vietnam tshirts popular with tourists there is mr duyet , the jailer with the vivid imagination there is the nurse who treated mr mccain for a few minutes after he was shot down and there is mai van on , the man credited with pulling mr mccain from the lake after he crashed , and who died two years ago there is the little chunk of the prison , preserved as a museum when the rest of the building was razed to make way for a highrise , with its halfhearted and anachronistic wartime propaganda mr duyet still seems at home here , and his memories are in harmony with the carefully chosen exhibits in the museum he pointed proudly to a sweater and a paper fan as evidence of the comforts the prisoners enjoyed the walls are hung with photographs of prisoners playing sports and making christmas dinner and of mr mccain lying on a cot being treated by a doctor that s me with the prisoners , mr duyet said , pointing to a group photograph and there we are shaking hands like friends when the prisoners were released but his greatest pride is his account of his relationship with mr mccain i used to meet with him in my office at the end of the day and debate with him , mr duyet said we debated quite fiercely , but there was never any personal prejudice between us the debate was between two men in a manly style but after that we were quite friendly we did n't take it personally this is certainly not the way mr mccain remembers it , nor is it the way that witnesses and history have recorded it in 2000 , mr mccain called his captors cruel and sadistic people and declared , i will hate them for as long as i live mr mccain has visited hanoi several times in recent years , and although he has returned to the prison , he has not met with mr duyet to compare memories i 'll call right now my interrogator that tortured me and my friends a gook , mr mccain said in 2000 , using a particularly offensive term for asians you can quote me soon after the prisoners were released in 1973 , he described his torture in a long essay in us news world report they bounced me from pillar to post , kicking and laughing and scratching , he wrote after a few hours of that , ropes were put on me and i sat that night bound with ropes he continued for the next four days , i was beaten every two to three hours by different guards my left arm was broken again and my ribs were cracked none of that is true , mr duyet insisted all fabrication all political posturing by mr mccain some americans still carry a prejudice toward vietnam , he said so mccain has to say he was beaten to gain the votes of these people at the edge of the lake in hanoi where mr mccain parachuted to earth stands a small concrete marker noting the event it depicts a man on his knees with his arms in the air as if surrendering i do n't know much about him , said do van sy , 78 , who was exercising nearby in white shorts and a white tank top , carrying an umbrella in case of rain and a paper fan in case of sun you 'll have to ask the older men about that although he is two years younger than mr sy , bo the an , 76 , sitting on a bench nearby , knew quite a bit about mr mccain he was a pilot who bombed vietnam , and he was our enemy , he said but that was a long time ago the important thing is what is in his mind today i wish him good luck in his 1973 account , mr mccain said that he broke his right leg and both arms when his plane crashed and that he was surrounded by an angry crowd , all hollering and screaming and cursing and spitting and kicking at me once he was pulled from the crowd , a nurse named nguyen thi thanh said she bound his wounds and gave him a few sips of medicinal liquor in an interview , ms thanh , now 81 , said she had followed his career since then , although with her fading eyesight he is just a fuzzy image now on television it seems he s been running for president for a long time , she said so he s quite persistent , is n't he \? she is confident that whatever happens , he will not give up i'm only 81 now my mother lived till 94 that s 13 more years so each time he runs for the presidency , i 'll have a chance to see him again
atlanta speaking from the pulpit of ebenezer baptist church , senator barack obama paid tribute here today to the rev dr martin luther king jr and reprised his call from four decades ago , unity is the great need of the hour it s the great need of this hour as well , mr obama said , addressing hundreds of worshipers during an overflowing service not because it sounds pleasant or because it makes us feel good , but because it s the only way we can overcome the essential deficit that exists in this country the deficit , he said , is one of morality and of empathy on the eve of martin luther king jr day , mr obama was on his way to south carolina to spend a week campaigning for the state s democratic presidential primary on saturday he was invited to speak at ebenezer , the historic church where dr king once preached before leading the civil rights movement across the south in his 30minute address , which came near the end of a service that drew a capacity crowd with congregants spilling outside the church in unusually frigid weather here , mr obama presented his candidacy as an opportunity to extend the racial unity dr king spoke about none of our hands are clean , mr obama said each of us carries with us the task of changing our hearts and minds the division , the stereotypes , the scapegoating , the ease with which we blame the plight of ourselves on others all of that distracts us from the common challenges we face , war and poverty injustice and inequality , he added , drawing applause from the crowd we can no longer afford to build ourselves up by tearing each other down we can no longer afford to traffic in lies or fear or hate it is the poison that we must purge from our politics the wall that we must tear down before the hour grows too late the south carolina primary , the first state where a large share of the democratic voters will likely be africanamerican , has emerged as a critical stop for mr obama as he seeks to compete with senator hillary rodham clinton john edwards , who was born in south carolina , also is aggressively campaigning there for mr obama , it presents an interesting moment for his candidacy for nearly a year , he has worked to reduce the focus paid to his race but now , his campaign is depending on the support of black voters in south carolina to strengthen his candidacy and propel him into a nationwide series of primaries and caucuses on feb 5
to the editor in the lament of hundreds my child is dead ! ' \( front page , may 13 \) , you evoke a heartwrenching snapshot of parents who have lost children in the earthquake in southwestern china the loss of a child is never less than devastating , but circumstances in china magnify this dreadful impact china s one child policy means that a child lost is likely to have no siblings a rocky transition to a market economy , with patchwork social support , means that a child may be a parent s best hope for a retirement free from penury for those with the means , children are an acceptable outlet upon which to lavish the fruits of a new economy if we are to better understand our world , and those taking a more prominent place in this century , we need to appreciate the context for their hopes and fears , their joy and suffering william murray new york , may 13 , 2008  to the editor as an engineer by education , i could not help but notice that in the photograph on the may 14 front page showing rescuers carrying a victim across pancaked concrete decking and also in the photograph of collapsed buildings with the same article , there was no evidence of any kind of reinforcement in the concrete that might have limited the collapse of the structures and resulted in a lower loss of life than would be expected none of these structures appear to be particularly old if they were built in most industrialized or developing countries to standard civil engineering and construction practices , they would have been reinforced with steel rebar or steel mesh while the buildings may have still collapsed , i doubt that they would have been as flattened as shown in the photos there would be many more survivors i believe that there is more to the story that should be investigated richard beck houston , may 14 , 2008
los angeles at the end of his hardest days on the set of the shield , exhausted by the emotional and physical toll of playing the brutal and besieged rogue cop vic mackey , would perform a ritual to wash away the reminders of his character s many sins every day i would come into my trailer and i would physically shake myself , mr chiklis said in an interview last week , explaining how he dealt with playing such an intensely dark , complicated man , whose notions of right and wrong were often corrupted by rage , greed and a penchant for boneshattering retribution i would take off my costume , and i looked at it as shedding him , he said after a day working in urinesoaked alleys , kicking down doors and jumping on 22yearold gangbangers , i wanted it off me and oftentimes i went home and showered , walked right past my family and right into my bathroom to take a shower i just felt the filth of it then i could go to my wife and children and say , hey , it s me , ' and connect with them i did everything i could to consciously let it go i just felt so wrung out at the end of each season , he added , that i would sleep for three days after it was done before , you know , i started feeling like a human again physically , mr chiklis , who turned 45 over the weekend , has n't had to worry about shaking off the vestiges of vic mackey since the shield finished shooting last november , but as the show begins its seventh and final 13episode run on tuesday night on the fx cable channel , he s still coming to terms with what the role , for which he won an emmy , a golden globe and newfound respect as an actor , has meant for his life and career when something that occupies a giant space in your life comes to an end , then you have to go through a mourning period , he said , acknowledging that his grieving for the shield and vic mackey may not be over yet i loved the shield , ' he said it was one of the hardest and one of the greatest experiences of my life but having said that , i'm always thinking about what s next i never want to rest on my laurels i want to own what we did and celebrate it , but then i want to move on now what that means , i do n't know he s been in this situation before , coming off a successful television series in which he played a character so convincingly that he worried whether casting directors would be able to imagine him as anyone else he portrayed a pudgy , lovable police commissioner on the commish from 199196 a pudgy , lovable stayathome dad in daddio in 1999 and the pudgy , lovable curly howard in a movie about the three stooges in 2000 at that time the idea that mr chiklis would be believable as a ruthless , intimidating street cop seemed ludicrous but mr chiklis , who played high school football in his hometown , andover , mass , arrived at the shield audition muscled up and slimmed down , his steelblue eyes full of unsettling menace when the shield made its debut on march 12 , 2002 , with a level of violence and sexuality previously unseen on basic cable , it became an immediate hit and changed the hollywood perception of mr chiklis from lovable nudge to prototypical tough guy , tony soprano with a badge now the irony is that some people have questioned whether or not i can play a nice guy , he said , laughing and shaking his head sometimes you ca n't win for losing shawn ryan , the executive producer and creator of the shield , said of mr chiklis i do n't think he s going to be pigeonholed into any one thing i think he s going to do a lot of things that will surprise people he s not one of those actors that relies on one thing and just goes to that well for every single episode one of the reasons we made it to a seventh season is because the audience felt like they were still discovering vic mackey , mr ryan continued and that s because of michael he gives you the feeling that you have n't seen every facet of this guy yet mr chiklis , who plays the secretary of defense in the coming feature film thriller eagle eye , said he had offers on the table , some for films , some for television series but none have gripped him yet in the way the shield did , and all are still early in the development phase what s frustrating is this town moves very slowly , mr chiklis said everything is like gum surgery , painfully slow and i'm a workaholic i could easily work 300plus days of the year but that s just not the way it works out here so after finishing the shield last november and filming eagle eye in the spring , mr chiklis decided to go back home to massachusetts with his wife and two daughters , he spent the entire summer in new england \( in the real world , he said \) , living for a while in a rented brownstone in boston , taking his children to summer camp and being awarded a key to the city of andover , with his parents in the crowd my mother was just a puddle , crying her eyes out with happiness , he said that was really cool but now he s back in beverly hills , eating lunch at a sidewalk cafe and being acknowledged by larry king , who was walking along beverly boulevard and saw mr chiklis , then growled love your work when are you going to be on the show \? i 'll call you tomorrow mr chiklis , who sometimes seems to forget that he s famous , appeared genuinely moved that mr king , the cnn host , stopped for him this is a good day , he said but he s still antsy for the next thing patience has never been my strong suit , he said one of the wonderful things about this business is that every minute s a new minute , and you just do n't know what s going to happen but one of the terrible things about this business is that every minute s a new minute , and you do n't know what s going to happen
jerusalem a series of recent israeli actions in the mainly arab neighborhoods of east jerusalem have raised tensions there , with and israeli critics contending that they are part of a wider plan to judaize historically charged areas around the old city the actions , ostensibly unconnected , include the demolition of two arab homes in silwan , a neighborhood adjacent to the old city above the ruins of an ancient jewish site the start of a controversial infrastructure project there and the eviction of a palestinian family from its home in sheik jarrah , another neighborhood coveted by jewish nationalists near the old city none of these actions in themselves are that unusual here but the spate of highprofile , highly symbolic moves in the past few weeks has reignited concerns that an increasing jewish presence in arab areas will further complicate the chances of reaching an israelipalestinian political agreement based on a twostate solution , which calls for a division of powers in a shared capital and they come as a new jerusalem mayor who has vocally supported expansion of jewish settlements in east jerusalem takes office east jerusalem must be the capital of the palestinian state , said hatem abdel qader , an adviser on jerusalem affairs to the palestinian authority prime minister , salam fayyad is trying to create facts on the ground and determine the results before we reach any solution some believe that the israeli authorities and jewish nationalists , who are increasingly gaining footholds in the arab neighborhoods , are intentionally exploiting the period of political transition in the united states , as well as the political vacuum in israel before the february elections several elements combine to make the situation in jerusalem much more dangerous , said hagit ofran of , a leftwing israeli group that opposes jewish settlements in areas that are expected to be part a palestinian state the conditions are ideal , she said , for settlers to seek to force their agenda without fear of challenge or repercussions a spokesman for , gidi schmerling , rejected the accusations , saying that municipal enforcement is carried out equally and according to the law in the eastern part of the city and the predominantly jewish western part he added that the demolition of the houses , which were built on public land , was carried out after the residents lost their appeals in the district and supreme courts the home demolitions in this part of silwan , where a volatile mix of about 7 , 000 palestinians and a few hundred jewish ultranationalists live in cramped quarters on steep hillsides above the ruins of the ancient city of david , set off a riot they were the first of 88 homes to be razed in a compound built without proper permits where israeli planners want to expand a national archaeological park the infrastructure improvements , in ordinary circumstances , would be welcome news in a poor and neglected neighborhood like silwan but in the charged atmosphere of east jerusalem , which israel seized from the jordanians in the 1967 war and later annexed , some perceive even municipal road works and new traffic arrangements as part of a larger plan in late november , jerusalem city authorities and east jerusalem development , an israeli government company , began a project to lay new water and sewage pipes and to repave one of silwan s main roads the road , known to arabs as wadi hilweh and renamed by israeli authorities as city of david steps , runs roughly from the main entrance of the city of david site down toward the compound known as the bustan , where the demolitions took place many local residents oppose the traffic changes , which have already been instituted , as well as plans to turn empty spaces along the road into parking lots , saying they will benefit the tourists to the detriment of the local residents we lack schools , playgrounds , everything , said jawwad siyam , an activist in silwan the israeli government and jerusalem city are now like tools in the settlers' hands with the help of the a human rights group , mr siyam and several other residents have gone to court to try to halt the work they told the court that they feared that the road works would turn up archaeological finds , requiring a salvage dig that could paralyze life in the area for years eli shmuelyan , the deputy director of east jerusalem development , dismissed the complaints we 're creating parking lots for the residents as well , he said , so the streets will be clear and the buses can move perhaps the opponents of the project enjoy traffic jams , he said but what the opponents see is a pattern , a direct line extending from the city of david and the bustan where the demolition orders were issued in 2005 but were delayed , largely because of international pressure to the eviction of the palestinian family in sheik jarrah the family , the kurds , who had lived in its home there for more than 50 years , was evicted in early november a jewish association claims ownership of the land and has plans to build a large jewish housing complex there for years , the kurds had refused to pay rent as protected tenants in their own home , as they had been ordered to do , pending the outcome of a protracted legal battle against the jewish claimants religious jewish nationalists had already moved into an extension of the kurds' small , singlestory stone house just days after the kurds' eviction , the family patriarch , muhammad alkurd , 61 , who suffered from diabetes and heart problems , died his family moved into protest tents on an empty lot near the house where they received mourners , but the tents , too , have been dismantled by the israeli authorities several times the kurds' home is adjacent to a site held by jews to be the ancient tomb of shimon hatzadik , or simeon the just , a jewish high priest from the days of the second temple a jewish organization has reclaimed the land based on property deeds whose authenticity is disputed , and which date back to the 1870s , long before the jewish state was established in 1948 another 27 palestinian families are threatened with eviction on the same grounds people in the neighborhood are very upset and fear they will be next , said a resident , mahmoud abu turk , who was visiting the mourning tent the palestinian authority , based in the west bank , is responding by trying to assert its presence mr abdel qader and rafiq husseini , the director of the president s office , took a group of foreign consular officials on a tour of silwan , sheik jarrah and other problematic areas of east jerusalem last week the tour was symbolic , mr abdel qader said , a message to israel that the palestinian leadership can also operate in jerusalem others note that the jewish reclamation of prestate property in east jerusalem could open a political pandora s box of counterclaims in a symbolic protest on thursday , muhammad alkurd s widow , fawziyah , 56 , accompanied by palestinian and israeli activists and two arab israeli members of parliament , briefly set up a tent in the affluent west jerusalem neighborhood of talbieh she said that her parents abandoned a home there when they became refugees in 1948

in the great hunt for superdelegates , there is no better place to look than the floor of the house , and senator barack obama dived right into a sea of them on thursday morning , shaking hands , clapping backs , doling out hugs and even doing a little curtsy before representative john m spratt jr of south carolina , the chairman of the budget committee mr obama , who worked the chamber for more than 45 minutes , and even got some handshakes from republicans , insisted that he just stopped by to say hello , to update his supporters and to answer questions for any fellow democrats who might remain undecided what do you think , i was going after superdelegates \? mr obama joked after leaving the chamber but after his commanding victory over senator hillary rodham clinton in north carolina , and his strong showing in indiana , mr obama s triumphant visit to the house floor had all the buzz and excitement of a victory lap while mrs clinton has met with superdelegates away from the capitol since the results from the primaries on tuesday , a sign of her struggle among democratic party leaders , mr obama returned with all the subtlety of a rock star he started out , shortly before 11 am in the corner of the room with the pennsylvania delegation including representative john p murtha , who has endorsed mrs clinton mr obama then moved down the aisle swarmed by wellwishers , through the throng of lawmakers who were milling about for votes on housing legislation all the while , he was flanked by representative steven r rothman of new jersey mr rothman seemed to be serving as bodyguard and ambassador for mr obama , who entered the senate without ever serving in the house among the crowd was mr spratt , now in his 13th term , who met on wednesday with mrs clinton at the democratic national committee headquarters and told her that he would remain uncommitted because his state had voted overwhelmingly for mr obama standing before mr spratt , mr obama dropped to a bended knee , in what seemed to be some sort of genuflection mr obama made his way into the well of the chamber , at one point stopping by representative yvette clarke of brooklyn , who showed him a copy of new york daily news , which on thursday ran his photo on the front page with the headline it s his party teenage house pages , and some visiting children of lawmakers , squirmed through the crowd to say hello mr obama then walked up the center aisle of the chamber , where he was even greeted by republicans , including representatives jerry lewis and dana rohrabacher , both of california , and he even got a warm greeting from representative barbara cubin , republican of wyoming , a state whose caucus mr obama won by a comfortable margin and while mr obama has largely portrayed himself as an outsider , an agent of change compared with mrs clinton or the presumptive republican nominee , senator john mccain , he seemed perfectly at home in the house chamber , barely looking up as the crowd of democrats shouted aye on a vote he chatted with representative steny h hoyer of maryland , the majority leader , said hello to representative chris van hollen , the chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee , and greeted speaker nancy pelosi of california , who was not in the chamber for most of mr obama s visit none of them have officially endorsed as mr obama made his way back down the center aisle , representative ray h lahood , republican of illinois , who is retiring after his seventh term , gave chase , and grabbed mr obama s arm the senator turned and gave mr lahood a hug after leaving the chamber , mr obama posed for a photograph and then made his way back across the capitol surrounded by a crowd of reporters and photographers , pushing his way forward into the rotunda , as dumbstruck tourists realized there was something more exciting to look at than the statues and the paintings on the wall they cheered and shouted as he walked , mr obama insisted that the democratic race would continue he said he expected mrs clinton to win west virginia and kentucky and described her leads in those states as insurmountable my goal , he said , is to bring the party together as soon as possible senator clinton is a formidable candidate , she is very likely to win west virginia and kentucky , those are two states where she s got insurmountable leads , he said there is no doubt that she is the heavy favorite in both states but my goal has been to spend time in all 50 states mr obama said his visit to the house was partly intended to reassure democrats who were concerned about the divisiveness of the long primary contest , and also to appeal to potential supporters there are some undecideds , mr obama said if they have questions for me , then i am certainly happy to respond to them obviously people have been anxious about some of the sense of division in the party , and i just wanted to assure them that whatever happens , we will be coming together outside the old supreme court chamber , mr obama found himself encircled by photographers as members of a tour group shouted at him from across the room we re from illinois over here , someone said good to see you guys , the senator shouted back , who heard the group but could not see them i am surrounded but i appreciate you where are you guys from \? schaumburg \? tell everybody i said hi tell everybody back home i said hi

clive , after the months of speeches , millions spent on advertisements and seemingly zillions of debates , the culminating event of the iowa caucus campaign in the city of clive , precinct 4 , is an orderly , uncomplicated affair before the caucus started , fox news played on a bigscreen tv in the front of the hall , a midsize auditorium the meeting convened promptly at 7 pm , central time the precinct chairwoman , peggy hermann , reading from a presidential preference poll report procedure sheet , went over the rules children and teenagers sat quietly along a side wall , watching the spectacle , which really was not much of a spectacle all the caucusroom intrigue , horsetrading , debating , lastminute prodding and drama you hear about \? that s a democratic thing not the republicans their rules are simple , pragmatic , no big todos caucusgoers show up , sign in , fill out a secret paper ballot , then leave , or wait for results but mostly likely , leave the real tension is mostly internal , in the minds of the stilluncertain this has never happened to me before , said jeff bradley , whose face betrayed his undecided status like a migraine he was agonizing over several candidates , despite what he called their fatal flaws mitt romney \( the mormon issue \) , former senator fred d thompson \( a not presidential demeanor \) , senator john mccain \( a bit too liberal \) and mike huckabee \( endorsing god and rock 'n' roll at the same time \) i 'll decide at the last minute , said mr bradley , a pastor at heritage assembly of god the fourth republican precinct of clive , a bedroom community west of des moines , offered little of the prototypical flavor of an iowa caucus site it was not a small gathering at a cafe , or in a classroom , or in an auction barn rather , the proceeding took place in the auditorium of dewaay capital management , a financial services company in a building that resembles a large hunting lodge at 6 30 pm , a winding procession of welldressed professionals , many straight from work , waited to sign in we have a lot of ceo s , cfo s , doctors , lawyers , all leaders here , said ms hermann , who was sitting in front of the room she expected 250 people , but closer to 400 are here by 6 45 by appearances , the crowd fit the demographic of romney supporters whitecollar professionals , lots of sweaters , nice haircuts but there are numerous huckabee voters in the first wave , it seemed i like that he is honest and humble , said mrs hermann , who admired the way mr huckabee presented himself when he addressed the board of the iowa christian alliance ms hermann called the meeting to order at 7 05 and led the group in the pledge of allegiance at 7 08 she marveled at the overflow crowd of more than 500 people being close to des moines , there are several political pros in from washington here to speak on behalf of the candidates ron kaufman , a former aide to the first president bush , appearing for mr romney representative steve king for mr thompson and rick tyler , a former spokesman for speaker newt gingrich , for mr huckabee is there anyone here for rudy \? mrs herrman asked , and a man who does not give his name comes forward you get two minutes , mrs hermann said , and the man promises that rudy is a proven leader for the tough times we face at 7 20 , a call comes for someone to speak for representative duncan hunter anyone \? we 'll ask again later mr tyler , here on vacation , boasted that his 11yearold daughter had made 400 phone calls on behalf of mr huckabee ron paul is a man of principle , the crowd is told next mr kaufman , mumbling in a thick boston accent , said mr romney reminded him of former president george bush mr mccain is a man of his word , said jennifer crall , at 7 25 pm last call for a duncan hunter speaker \? and a tom tancredo speaker \? no one people fill out their cards , turn them in don dewaay , who owns the firm holding the event , put out a plea for donations to the of polk county this is why you need to give , he said , and clicked an unflattering photo of senator hillary rodham clinton , the new york democrat , onto the big screen ms hermann summoned a representative of each campaign and began to tally the cards nearly twothirds of the room has emptied by the time ms hermann announced the results mr romney won the precinct with 179 votes , and mr mccain finished second with 109 they were followed by mr huckabee , 78 mr thompson , 48 mr giuliani , 45 mr paul , 22 and none for mr hunter or mr tancredo on his way out , pastor bradley reported that he voted for mr huckabee in the end despite his penchant for rock 'n' roll
dan schnur was the national communications director for john mccain s presidential campaign in 2000 \( \) the loss of a congressional seat in mississippi was only the second most disturbing sign for republicans last week the exodus of lobbyists from john mccain s campaign wasn t even close the most ominous warning for what the fall might be like for the gop was the throng of 75 , 000 people that barack obama turned out for a rally in portland over the weekend the crowd would have almost filled wrigley field to capacity twice over and would have been either the fifth or sixth biggest city in oregon or to look at it another way , it was roughly twothirds the number of republicans who participated in the iowa caucuses this year throughout the primary campaign , we ve seen growing and irrefutable evidence of an enthusiasm gap between the two parties the democratic candidates are raising more money , attracting larger audiences and turning out greater numbers of voters that s no guarantee of an obama win in november , but it s a potentially bigger challenge for john mccain than age , war and recession combined the excitement among democratic primary voters , while not unprecedented , may represent the greatest level of political passion since the republicans eight years ago call it the politics of hunger the longer it s been since you ve been invited to a state dinner at the white house , the more motivated you become conversely , when you ve been in charge for eight years , it s easy to get a bit fat and a little selfsatisfied in 1992 , after 12 long years of ronald reagan and george hw bush , democrats were so hungry that they nominated a protrade , prodeath penalty , prowelfare reform budget balancer that s how badly they wanted the white house back at the same time , republicans had forgotten what it was like to be outside the gates on pennsylvania avenue so they barely went through the motions for that george bush , flirting with pat buchanan , winking at ross perot and shrugging off the defeat of an incumbent president as if he were a temporary inconvenience it s hard to remember what an unknown quantity george w bush was to republican true believers in 1999 , what with his lineage , his history of working with democrats in texas and his fondness for talking about compassionate conservatism but after years of watching congressional republicans play wile e coyote to bill clinton s road runner , the gop faithful were hungry again so they took a flyer on the scion of the bush they had turned away from less than a decade earlier as for the democrats , eight years of power took the edge off their hunger to a point where just enough of them decided that al gore wasn t sufficiently liberal and that the luxury of a vote for ralph nader was an indulgence they could afford in both 1992 and 2000 , the opposition party would have chewed off its own arm to win so they did the satiated incumbents , meanwhile , simply burped and went home now , eight more years later , the dinner fork and knife are back in the hands of the democrats look no further than the way the potential third party candidates are being treated in 2000 , most democrats found mr nader to be amusing in 2004 , he was aggravating when he announced earlier this year that he was thinking about another campaign , he was almost assaulted but when former congressman bob barr declared recently that he planned to run for president as the libertarian party nominee this year , he heard barely a peep from either the republican leadership or grassroots mr barr s candidacy would hijack votes away from mr mccain just like mr nader did to mr gore eight years ago but the howls of outrage from the left that greeted mr nader s announcement were not mirrored by conservative anger toward mr barr the republican base did not rush to his candidacy either rather , most gop regulars just shrugged shrugging is rarely the indicator of a motivated political party and republicans seem particularly unenthused worse , 12 years of a gop congressional majority have added to the complacency , and two years under speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid don t seem to have been enough to rouse the party faithful john mccain has no shortage of challenges in this uphill race he is taking on the war debate full force , and is working hard to convince voters that his path toward eventual peace is less risky than barack obama s while he carries the burden of a recession that most voters attach to the current administration , mr mccain argues strenuously that tax increases during tough economic times is unwise he turns questions about his age into answers about experience and preparation uphill fights all , but none more challenging than the broader task of reinvigorating a dispirited republican party
to the editor re profit and public good clash in grand plans \( architecture column , march 27 \) nicolai ouroussoff comes to the right conclusion when you are trying to build a city , it s about championing the public good , not counting beans but by bemoaning the quality of the proposed buildings and the watering down of frank gehry s work for the atlantic yards project in brooklyn , he adds to the confusion about the difference between building a city and treating big chunks of the city as if they were architectural design problems the fact is that great cities do not rely on cuttingedge architecture they rely on a clear framework of streets and open spaces , designed by and for the public , that over time can support the full spectrum of architecture , from the pedestrian to the heroic indeed , how many heroic buildings can you have in one place before none of them are \? robert lane director of design regional plan association new york , march 27 , 2008
not that they want to see any prospect fail , but oldline major league scouts everywhere stood up and cheered last week jeremy brown , the announced , had retired jeremy who \? the athletics have been the home of catfish hunter , reggie jackson , sal bando , joe rudi , gene tenace , rollie fingers , jason giambi , eric chavez , miguel tejada , tim hudson , mark mulder and barry zito but jeremy brown \? the best that can be said about brown in his six years in the oakland organization is that he made the team s 40man roster and played five games in the majors but brown will be remembered most as a portly college catcher who was a central figure in moneyball by michael lewis , the book on the revolutionary way oakland identified players to be drafted for a system that had little money to spend because of the team s lowrevenue status  brown was one of seven players the athletics picked among the first 39 players taken in the 2002 draft , a focal point of the book , the athletics' general manager , found brown attractive , despite his size , because he was a college player with a high onbase percentage veteran scouts for the a s scoffed at the pick picking amateur players from among thousands was too much of a gamble , as everyone knew , and beane sought a system that could be more reliable and less wasteful brown s retirement is a good time to look back at the athletics' 2002 draft and see how the system worked based on statistics more than on the established method of having scouts identify prospects from seeing them play , the system has become more widely used and has created debate between oldtimers and younger executives the change in thinking made its biggest impact on the former cardinals general manager walt jocketty , who was let go last fall despite a world series championship in 2006 , because of a difference in scouting philosophy there are whole web sites and companies dedicated to providing statistics on college players , beane said in a telephone interview i think clubs are utilizing them more now than they have in the past some companies have solicited clubs and some have accepted beane unveiled his method to his scouts before the 2002 draft that was to be a potentially fruitful draft for the a s because they had so many early picks as a result of the oakland free agents signed by other teams with their first seven picks , the a s selected nick swisher , joe blanton , john mccurdy , ben fritz , brown , stephen obenchain and mark teahen swisher , blanton and teahen have played in the majors for three years , although blanton is the only one remaining with the athletics swisher was traded to the chicago white sox this winter , and teahen was traded to kansas city in june 2004 for octavio dotel fritz , a pitcher , is preparing for his seventh minor league season , but infielder mccurdy and pitcher obenchain were released after last season beane said hitting on three of seven early picks was a good result you 'd like to be 50 for 50 , but that s the imperfection of the draft , he said that was the point of the process for us the complete randomness is why we did what we did i think the draft up to this point has been pretty random the average number of players teams get to the big leagues is two the idea was to try to do something objectively to compare decisions down the road four of the seven players picked by oakland \( 57 percent \) among the first 39 picks in that draft have played in the majors , including brown of the other 32 picks , 20 have played in the majors \( 625 percent \) the difference is in the number of high school players in those groups oakland drafted none while other teams selected 18 , and 11 have played in the majors , including prince fielder , b j upton , cole hamels , scott kazmir , james loney , jeff francoeur , matt cain and adam loewen from beane s perspective , college position players are the safest selections while high school pitchers are the riskiest yet hamels , kazmir , cain and loewen are pitchers drafted out of high school but beane cautioned that people make a mistake with their absolute interpretation of the athletics' drafting strategy if anything is to blame for that misinterpretation , it s the book that made beane a celebrity the book , for example , makes fun of fielder s size , saying here s an astonishing fact prince fielder is too fat even for the oakland a s  the a s did n't even consider fielder , whom milwaukee selected seventh , nine slots ahead of oakland s first pick yet last season the toofat guy outperformed swisher , the college kid the a s coveted , in every major category 288 batting average to 262 , 50 home runs to 22 , 119 runs batted in to 78 , 618 slugging percentage to 455 , and in the a s favorite , 395 onbase percentage to 381 maybe the fact that scott boras was fielder s agent influenced the a s view of fielder , but that s not apparent from the book , which portrays the a s as only being concerned with which team might select fielder and how that could affect their ability to get swisher the a s system has enabled them to contend , but they have yet to reach the world series they did not make the playoffs last year and beane does n't expect them to get there this year he would n't talk about his current thinking on the draft are we doing the same things now as we did then \? he said no things change nobody s invented a template about how to draft in professional baseball there s no silver bullet out there we do n't have it and no one else has it
when apple opens its online app store for iphone software on thursday , steven p jobs will be making an attempt to dominate the next generation of computing as it moves toward internetconnected mobile devices the store , which will offer more than 500 software applications , including games , educational programs , mobile commerce and business productivity tools , may be a far more important development than the iphone 3g , which goes on sale at the same time an abundance of software could make the iphone s operating system dominant among an abundance of competing phones the reaction we have gotten so far has been really strong , mr jobs said in a telephone interview this week the quality and the sophistication of the applications you can write for the iphone is in a different class mr jobs failed to make his personal computers dominant , in part because software developers did not write as many programs for macbased machines as they did for microsoft windows pcs he did not make the same mistake when he developed the ipod music players apple s itunes stores , with easy and inexpensive downloads of music , gave the device an insurmountable lead , to date , over other players with the app store , apple simplified the process of adding software to the phone mr jobs contends that apple does not plan to make much money on games and other applications he has also said the company does not make much money selling music on itunes we are not trying to be business partners , mr jobs said of the app store instead , he said , the goal is to sell more iphones apple gives developers a 70 percent cut of sales the enthusiasm among software developers is high , from san jose to san francisco but , at the same time , some developers are approaching apple with caution as they figure out what their relationship with the company will be many expect the dealings to be more lucrative than those with wireless carriers , which in large part control what programs end up on phones but there are still many unknowns , especially for developers whose applications will compete with the popular itunes music and video store apple has a substantial way to go to catch its competitors palm , microsoft , rim , nokia and symbian have all enticed developers to write software for their smartphone operating systems palm , for example , says that it has 30 , 000 active software developers , and microsoft said last month that it had more than 18 , 000 applications available for its windows mobile operating system , which is available from 160 cellular carriers around the world still , mr jobs is catching up quickly , and none of his rivals are dismissing him everybody wants to build an iphone app , said gene munster , a senior research analyst at piper jaffray in minneapolis it s pretty rare you hear things like this the enthusiasm is surprising matt murphy , a partner in a fund set up by kleiner perkins caufield byers to invest in iphone apps , ascribes the intense interest to the consumer demand for the iphone , as well as the unfettered distribution promised by the app store it limits the phone company s role as a gatekeeper a lot of the best entrepreneurs have n't wanted to start anything because the carriers had to bless you , he said there were a lot of unknowns for instance , there was no standard deal for what carriers would be paid carriers also rejected some applications and , mr murphy said , no one wanted to fall on their face one indication of how much the iphone changes the scene is mr murphy s fund , the ifund , which plans to invest 100 million in new iphonerelated software firms in the last four months , the kleiner fund has received 2 , 000 financing requests from developers , 85 percent of them intended for consumers mr murphy said that kleiner was serious about 100 of those ideas the fund expects games , health care , social networking , mobile commerce and locationbased services to be the most popular types of software an application that would allow bay area surfers to check tides and network with other surfers failed to past muster instead , kleiner is backing , among others , icontrol networks , which is creating an application to let homeowners turn off their lights and alarms at home , as well as monitor security cameras , via their iphones still , apple could end up at odds with some developers particularly creators or distributors of content and media who offer applications that compete directly with itunes rajeev raman , chief executive of mywaves , an adsponsored free mobile video service available on millions of handsets , including nokia and blackberry smartphones , said he would like to offer mywaves in the app store but he has made little headway in his discussions with apple , he said we have a reverse conflict because they are not providing video for free , but we are we are interested , but we do n't want to jump into anything that will have our hands tied behind our backs when asked about it , mr jobs said he s right we will compete he added , that s a discussion to have twentyfive percent of the first 500 applications at the store will be free , mr jobs said of the commercial applications , 90 percent will be sold for 999 or less , he said , adding that a third of the first wave of applications will be games mr jobs insisted that the 30 70 split is a more generous deal for developers than what is common in the video game industry and he said that apple would provide distribution and marketing the question that remains unanswered is how apple and mr jobs will manage the relationship with software developers when the ipod was released , music executives hailed him as a savior for their flagging business but they later complained they were not paid enough hollywood studio executives were even more cautious , dragging their feet for months before allowing fulllength movies on itunes mr jobs declined to elaborate on how he expected to foster a more positive relationship with software developers , but mr murphy of the ifund said he ca n't kill the golden goose the promise of the iphone is developers if you choke them off , there are a lot of other platforms waiting photos the app store will let iphone users download applications like games one program offers baseball highlights
a man who the police say entered a unitarian church in knoxville during sunday services and shot 8 people , killing two , was motivated by a hatred for liberals and homosexuals , chief sterling p owen iv of the knoxville police department said monday it appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job , his frustration over that , and his stated hatred for the liberal movement , chief owen said of the suspect , jim d adkisson , 58 we have recovered a fourpage letter in which he describes his feelings and the reason that he claims he committed these offenses police officials said they had charged mr adkisson , of powell , tenn , with firstdegree murder amira parkey , 16 , had just uttered her first lines as miss hannigan in annie , jr when the performance at tennessee valley unitarian universalist church was interrupted by a loud pop , witnesses said we were just , oh , my god , that s not part of the play , ' amira said , adding that she saw a man standing near the door of the sanctuary and firing into the room it took a beat longer for fear to strike the audience the music director realized what was going on and she yelled , get the hell out of here , everybody , ' said sheila bowen , 70 , a church member parents dove under the pews with their children , and the cast of young actors , some of them as young as 6 , was quickly herded out of the sanctuary none of the victims were children members of the church tackled the gunman and wrested his weapon , a 12gauge shotgun , from him the police received a call to the church at 10 18 am and took the gunman into custody four minutes later at a news conference , chief owen said investigators believed the gunman had acted alone two of the wounded were treated at the hospital and released , chief owen said , and the other five were in conditions from serious to critical the is assisting in the investigation , and chief owen said all videotapes of the service had been collected and were under review there were about 200 people in the church when the gunman opened fire , church members said witnesses said that the gunman , carrying a guitar case , had first tried to enter the area where the children were preparing for the play , saying he was there to play music but he was told to use the public entrance to the sanctuary instead ms bowen said that the gunman was a stranger to the church and that she had seen him in the entry hall fiddling with the guitar case she said she did not see him again until the shooting started it was when the man paused to reload that several congregants ran to stop him ms bowen said john bohstedt , a history professor at the university of tennessee in knoxville , was among them he moved very quickly and he assessed the situation very quickly , ms bowen said he s sitting on this guy he had a package with him , wrapped in brown paper and tied with string , and john was afraid that that might be a bomb , so john was screaming at everyone to get out jamie parkey , who had been watching his eldest daughter from the front pew , said he turned to see a woman bleeding in the pew behind him i thought , did she have a nose bleed from the loud boom \? did she have a pacemaker blow \? ' mr parkey said it did n't make any sense he dragged his mother and middle daughter to the ground and then looked up to see several church members rushing the gunman , who was described as middle aged , tall and thin mr parkey s wife , amy broyles , was in a soundproof glass nursery with the couple s 2yearold she dropped to the floor and used her body to bar the door , which was near the gunman mr parkey , who installs hardwood floors and is trained in martial arts , joined the others in trying to subdue the gunman , pinning the man s arms behind his back until the police arrived to take the gunman into custody i did n't want him feeling around for a handgun , mr parkey said , adding that the package turned out to have been a prop for the play chief owen contradicted early reports that 13 shots had been fired , saying his investigators believed that the count was lower he did not confirm the detail about the guitar case , but said the man had indeed concealed the shotgun as he entered the church mr adkisson was being held on 1 million bail , a knoxville city spokesman , randy kenner , told the associated press one victim who died was identified as gregory mckendry jr , 60 , a church board member and usher chief owen said it appeared that mr mckendry was one of the first people the gunman encountered when he entered the sanctuary the other person killed was identified by the ap as linda kraeger , 61 , who died at the university of tennessee medical center a few hours after the shooting the church s minister , the rev chris buice , returned from a vacation in western north carolina when he heard about the shooting i will tell you , greg mckendry , we love , he said before ms kraeger s death , his voice breaking we loved greg mckendry please pray for this congregation because we are grieving the loss of a wonderful man amira parkey said mr mckendry and his wife had recently become foster parents for a church friend of hers , taylor bissette , 16 , who was also to be in the musical according to a previous newspaper article that mentioned mr mckendry , he was an engineer with two grown children this guy does not realize how many lives he totally destroyed , amira said of the gunman people who do this , they think they 've got problems , but they destroy so many other people s lives
riverton , there might have been a crowd more predisposed to view gov s debate performance as favorable than the one here at the rock creek pizza co , but it was probably gathered in alaska this is an extremely conservative area , said debbie francis , 39 i 've already decided , so i'm not looking for anything in particular i'm just hoping she does well ms francis was not disappointed she and roughly 50 others gathered at the local restaurant for an event called pizza and palin , part debate party and part fundraiser for state representative carl wimmer , who is seeking reelection and who spoke before our beloved sarah comes on , he said about taxes \( against \) abortion \( seeking a statewide ban \) and the constitution \( founded and created with the help of god \) riverton , which sits just south of salt lake city , is one of the fastestgrowing cities in utah , with roughly 38 , 000 residents it is almost exclusively white and republican , and , in a state with the most bedrooms per household in the nation , has lots of children it is territory friendly to senator john mccain , and ms palin appears to be wellliked , too , at least if the crowd at the pizza parlor was any indication the room was largely quiet during the first half of the debate , as people ate pizza and sipped soft drinks , looking at the television , or its reflection in the window facing a busy street as the debate moved on , some of ms palin s comments began to draw applause , and senator drew scowls and comments of dismay when he spoke about energy bryan kjar said he was a bigger supporter of ms palin than he was of mr mccain he s got some stuff in his past i do n't like , mr kjar said , and palin is more conservative i think she did a great job hitting on the taxes , and i think she is pretty strong on energy mr kjar s wife , holly , said that her expectations for ms palin had been high , and that she felt they had been met i think she s very sophisticated and strong , ms kjar said ms palin s biggest hit was the line unless you 're pleased with the way the federal government has been running anything lately , in a comment deriding senator barack obama s health care plan it was followed by an explosion of applause she also got tremendous laughs , and more applause , when she said mr obama had created tax breaks for multinational corporations her comment that marriage should be confined to one man and one woman was also very well received , with applause and hoots \( her line about third graders at gladys wood elementary school in anchorage getting extra credit for watching the debate got laughs , too \) one dissenter was in the room she s doing better than i thought , that person , scott singleton , said but now she sounds like the rest of them i liked her the way she was before they 've kind of made her a puppet , the mccain campaign , to make sure she stayed on message but she is an attractive puppet but when there is no decision to make , no internal conflict to quell , a debate seems to be comforting , lulling even two men fell asleep at their table even the nonvoters were impressed chris aston was visiting from england and took it all in what s her name \? mr aston said i do n't know i think she s chewing up the other guy in interviews with about a dozen pizza and palin people , none expressed any concern about ms palin s performance before the debate or trepidation about her experience beyond assuming that she would trounce mr biden , many said they had few other expectations before the debate i really did n't have any , said kirk phillips , 40 , a consultant i expected some talk on the financial crisis and the war , and i got that and i think her answers were good i feel like she was in control of the debate and biden was on the defensive mr phillips s wife , julie , put it more succinctly i think she s awesome
peshawar , the pakistani military , which has been criticized by the bush administration as not pushing hard enough against militants in the country s tribal areas , has used jet fighters and helicopter gunships in the past three weeks to strike at insurgents pouring over the border to attack american forces in afghanistan the air assaults have resulted in more than 400 taliban casualties in bajaur , an area of the tribal region where and the taliban have forged close ties , and have forced the militants to retreat from villages that they controlled , a military official involved in the operations said but on saturday night , the pakistani government declared a ceasefire in the area for the muslim holy month of ramadan , which begins here on wednesday the deal was arranged after the electorally important jamiat ulemaeislam , a religious party , and legislators from the tribal areas said they would support asif ali zardari for president in return for an end to the airstrikes mr zardari , the widower of former prime minister benazir bhutto and head of the pakistan peoples party , is the leading candidate for president in the electoral college vote scheduled for saturday the ceasefire prompted concerns that whatever gains had been made against militants in the region would be squandered khalid aziz , a former chief secretary of the northwest frontier province , said the taliban would use the opportunity to regroup some communities have risen up against the militants , and the government has to capitalize on this , has to prop them up , he said they have n't done it it was unclear whether the ceasefire would extend beyond ramadan , politicians from the tribal areas said the last three weeks of airstrikes , in addition to a monthlong air and ground offensive in nearby swat , a scenic area in the northwest frontier province , was the most sustained campaign by the pakistani military after months of intense pressure by the bush administration to do more against the insurgents whether or not the military s bajaur operation was intended specifically to assist the united states , the airstrikes dovetailed with washington s interests the bush administration has said that the ability of al qaeda and taliban to operate there and in other areas of the tribal belt gives them license to plot attacks against the united states the militants , operating with impunity from havens like bajaur , a 250squaremile pocket of mountains and narrow valleys on the northern edge of the tribal areas , have struck american and nato forces in afghanistan with mounting ferocity in that context , the pakistani army chief , gen ashfaq parvez kayani , was invited to a secret meeting with the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , adm mike mullen , on an aircraft carrier in the arabian sea last week it was their fifth encounter since general kayani took over as army chief from pervez musharraf in november the session at sea appears to have been more congenial than a confrontation in islamabad in july , when admiral mullen told the pakistanis that washington had evidence of the involvement of their powerful spy agency , interservices intelligence , in the bombing of the indian embassy in kabul , afghanistan as a result of the air campaign , more than 200 , 000 civilians have fled their homes , according to the world health organization and unicef , which are providing assistance in the area many of the refugees , who are now squatting in makeshift camps or bunking with extended family , are angry at the deaths of relatives and the destruction of property more than 40 , 000 people from bajaur are now refugees in afghanistan , the international committee of the red cross said most of the women in the camps arrived clad in burqas and remained inside small tents with up to 11 children squeezed together on the ground without mattresses and with very little water the pakistani military has met fierce resistance from the militants in bajaur col shahbaz rasul of the frontier corps , the paramilitary force that is leading the army operations there , said more than 400 taliban had been killed by airstrikes , though an official with access to interservices intelligence data said an estimated 200 taliban had been killed it was difficult to verify the number of casualties independently colonel rasul said that the taliban fighters were better paid than his soldiers and that they were well motivated he said the taliban force numbered 2 , 300 men under four commanders the largest group , with about 1 , 200 men , fought under faqir mohammad , the second in command of the umbrella group tehriketaliban , he said there were reports that mr faqir , reputed to run the most disciplined taliban force in bajaur , had been killed during the early days of the airstrikes but mr faqir later gave a radio interview saying he had survived by jumping out of his van before a bomb hit it , killing 11 of his fighters the frontier corps has remained inside its fort at khar , the capital of bajaur , since the airstrikes began , colonel rasul said that is largely because the corps was bloodied during three days of heavy fighting in early august , when soldiers tried to take back a post at loe sam from the taliban the village is at a strategic junction leading north to kunar province in afghanistan , and about 10 miles from damadola , where an american airstrike in january 2006 failed to kill ayman alzawahri , the qaeda deputy in the fighting to recapture loe sam , 29 soldiers were killed , colonel rasul said after three attempts using 400 men to take the post , the frontier corps had to retreat along the 16mile road from loe sam to khar the miscreants came in full force in numbers of men and sophistication of equipment , he said of the surprising strength of the taliban around loe sam the pakistani army uses miscreants to describe the taliban maulvi omar , the spokesman of the tehriketaliban , said in a telephone interview on friday that the taliban had lost only six people in the fight over loe sam he minimized the losses elsewhere mr omar often answers reporters' calls on a cellphone , an indication that he is in an area with phone coverage , raising questions about why the military has not been able to capture him in the interview , mr omar criticized mr zardari for doing what he called america s bidding if the zardari government has promised to kill us for the sake of american aid , then he should better hand the country over to india , he said meanwhile , many pakistanis in the northwest frontier province and the tribal belt said that they were pleased that the government was taking firm action against the taliban , who are now threatening the capital of the province , peshawar , and have taken over some of the towns around it but the airstrikes were criticized for being indiscriminate the assault had not killed any known leaders of the taliban in bajaur , said aftab ahmed khan sherpao , a former interior minister , whose constituency is close to bajaur the displaced civilians blamed the government for the hardships in the camps and for the destruction of their homes another legislator , muneer orekzai , said it s not justice to kill 5 taliban and 95 civilians everyone knows who the militants are in every village we want a targeted operation with the army going on search and destroy operations in salarzai , a cluster of villages in the northern part of bajaur , local people had organized themselves against the taliban , jalal uddin , a tribal leader , said in a telephone interview people are fed up with the taliban , mr uddin said people are seeing the government fighting the taliban , so they are encouraged , he said , adding that it was disappointing that none of the taliban leaders had been killed as news of the government ceasefire spread over the weekend , there were indications that many of the displaced in the camps would return home but some said they were worried about the absence of government ground forces if we go back now , no one is in charge , neither the militants nor the government , said maroof shah , a shopkeeper from loe sam who brought an extended family of 23 on the trek out of bajaur to escape the bombing

baghdad senator arrived in on sunday morning on a trip that was described as a visit by an official congressional delegation , but that also served to showcase his foreign policy credentials as he campaigns for the white house mr mccain , the presumptive republican presidential nominee , was scheduled to meet with officials including the american ambassador to iraq , ryan c crocker , and the senior american military commander in the country , gen david h petraeus he was also scheduled to meet with the iraqi prime minister , nuri kamal almaliki , said yaseen majid , a media adviser to mr maliki many iraqi politicians are closely monitoring the american presidential race , and some said the visit bolstered their belief that if mr mccain , of arizona , succeeded president bush in the november election , the american military would have a large presence in iraq for a very long time this visit confirms that the republicans believe that the iraqi war is very important in the fight against terrorism in the middle east , said wael abdul latif , an independent shiite member of the iraqi parliament it s a message to iran that the united states will never leave , even after bush is gone jalaladeen sagheer , a senior member of the supreme islamic iraqi council , a leading shiite party , described the visit as an advertisement for the american elections and said it showed mr mccain s commitment to staying in iraq , a policy mr sagheer said he favored it suggests that american officials will make good on their promises , he said some sunni arabs were not pleased by the visit if the republicans win the election , then nothing will really change in iraq , and we need a big change to kick the occupiers out of the country , said abu mohammed , a 30yearold barbershop owner in samarra , north of baghdad i would like to show him the schools and hospitals and how the children and women suffer another samarra shop owner , 52yearold hamid saleh , said he wanted the republicans to lose the election all i want is someone who works to fix my country , and not destroy it , he said american officials in iraq said mr mccain s precise schedule was not being released for security reasons he was joined on the trip by two close political allies , senator joseph i lieberman , independent of connecticut , and senator lindsey graham , republican of south carolina the three senators are also visiting israel , london and paris mr mccain has said the trip is not primarily political he told reporters last friday i do want to emphasize again that the three of us are going as members of the armed services committee on thursday , however , mr mccain will attend a 1 , 000aplate fundraising lunch at a home in london his campaign has said congress will be reimbursed for the political parts of the trip , including the fundraiser mr mccain s advisers have been cautious about the perception that he is exploiting his overseas trip for political gain none of his top political advisers are traveling with him , and his campaign has been careful to route questions about it to his senate office but they say they believe that the trip is clearly beneficial to mr mccain , enabling him to showcase his national security credentials while his democratic counterparts continue to battle for the nomination the new dynamic in iraq , with significant declines in american military and iraqi civilian casualties , has significantly altered the political landscape for mr mccain since last spring , when american troop deaths spiked and his candidacy faltered a low point of that period for mr mccain came last april when he drew ridicule for trumpeting a peaceful stroll through a baghdad marketplace , which was actually backed by heavily armed american troops mr mccain stands to reap the most politically from any rise in public support for the war effort , having staked his candidacy on his unflagging backing of president bush s troop escalation while cautious about being overly ebullient about iraq , mr mccain is almost invariably upbeat when he describes what is happening in iraq he said last month , anybody who believes the surge has not succeeded , militarily , politically and in most other ways , frankly , does not know the facts on the ground a survey done in late february by the pew research center for the people and the press found that 48 percent of americans believed that the war was going very well or fairly well , up from 30 percent in february 2007 , although a majority continued to believe it was a mistake meanwhile , senators barack obama and hillary rodham clinton continue to reject the troop escalation out of hand , arguing that the political reconciliation it was supposed to help usher in has not occurred and will happen only if prodded by the prospect of american withdrawal mrs clinton was scheduled to give a major speech on iraq on monday , in which her advisers said she would furnish details about her plan to begin withdrawing american troops within 60 days of coming into office , arguing it is the only way to force iraqi politicians to take responsibility she was also expected to attack mr obama over a recent statement by a former foreign policy adviser , samantha power , in which she said the iraq withdrawal plan mr obama had outlined while campaigning was a bestcase scenario that he would revisit once in office mr obama has defended his stance on withdrawing troops mrs clinton s advisers said she would also take on mr mccain for a recent comment in which he said american troops could be in the country for 100 years mr mccain has defended that comment , made at a town hall meeting earlier this year in new hampshire , arguing that he did not mean they would still be fighting but simply maintaining a presence in the region
mason , \( ap \) the police charged a man saturday with murdering his wife and their four children , who were pulled from their burning home the night before the man , michael veillette , 34 , was charged with four counts of aggravated murder , one count of murder and one count of aggravated arson in the friday night fire , said officer troy nelson of the mason police department mr veillette had been stabbed and was in stable but serious condition saturday at university hospital in cincinnati , officer nelson said he would not speculate on how mr veillette was injured nadya ferrariveillette , 33 , was killed along with her children , marguarite , 8 , vincent , 4 , and 3yearold twins jacob and mia , officer nelson said the authorities said they received a call just before 10 pm friday reporting the house fire ms ferrariveillette , who had knife wounds and firerelated injuries , and one child were found dead inside the twostory house three of the couple s other children were taken from upstairs bedrooms and died at a hospital none of the children had been stabbed , officer nelson said mr veillette had jumped out of a secondstory window and was found on the ground autopsies were to begin saturday
if there s anything everyone is against in these election times , it s identity politics , a phrase that covers a multitude of sins let me start with a definition \( it may not be yours , but it will at least allow the discussion to be framed \) you re practicing identity politics when you vote for or against someone because of his or her skin color , ethnicity , religion , gender , sexual orientation , or any other marker that leads you to say yes or no independently of a candidate s ideas or policies in essence identity politics is an affirmation of the tribe against the claims of ideology , and by ideology i do not mean something bad \( a mistake frequently made \) , but any agenda informed by a vision of what the world should be like an identity politics voter says , in effect , i don t care what views he holds , or even what bad things he may have done , or what lack of ability he may display he s my brother , or he s my kinsman , or he s my landsman , or he comes from the neighborhood , or he s a southerner , or \( and here the tribe is really big \) my country right or wrong my country right or wrong is particularly useful in making clear how identity politics differs from politics as many americans would prefer to see it practiced rather than saying she s right on immigration or he s wrong on the war , the identitypolitics voter says he looks like me or she and i belong to the same church identity politics is illiberal that is , it is particularist whereas liberalism is universalist the history of liberalism is a history of extending the franchise to those who were once excluded from it by their race , gender or national origin although these marks of identification were retained \( by the census and other forms of governmental classification \) and could still be celebrated in private associations like the church and the social club , they were not supposed to be the basis of decisions one might make as a citizen , decisions about who might best lead the country or what laws should be enacted or voted down deciding as a citizen means deciding not as a man or a woman or a jew or an african american or a caucasian or a heterosexual , but as a human being stanley crouch believes that the project of liberal universalizing is now pretty much complete and that elements of distinction his phrase for the thinking that was fashionable in the era of identity politics have become secondary to the power of human qualities with which anyone can identify or reject \( daily news , feb 11 \) but his judgment is belied by almost everything that is going on in this campaign as i write this i am watching the returns from the potomac primary and the news is being presented entirely in racial , ethnic , and gender terms every newspaper or magazine article i read does the same thing the obama and clinton campaigns accuse each other of playing the race card or the gender card an hispanic superdelegate warns that by replacing her latino campaign manager with a black one , senator clinton risks losing his vote and the vote of other hispanic delegates he is in the process of contacting christopher hitchens looks at the scene and is disgusted by behavior that , in his view , keeps us anchored in the past \( wall street journal , jan 18 \) he will not , he tells us , vote for clinton just so that we can have the first woman president \( i don t remember that one from the past \) and he won t vote for obama who , he says , wants us to transcend something at the same time he implicitly asks us to give that same something as a reason to vote for him it would seem that we are far from realizing ken connor s dream that we might judge all of the presidential hopefuls on the basis of the content of their character and their qualifications to serve \( townhallcom , jan 20 \) but is it as bad as all that \? is it so irrational and retrograde to base one s vote on the gender or race of religion or ethnicity of a candidate \? not necessarily if the vote is given \( or withheld \) only because the candidate looks like you or has the same religion , it does seem a shallow and meretricious act , for it is an act unsupported by reasons because she is a woman as i am is of course a reason , but it is not a reason of the relevant kind , a reason that cites goals and programs , and argues for them but suppose what was said was something like this as a woman i find government sponsored research skewed in the direction of diseases that afflict men and inattentive to the medical problems faced by women , and it is my belief that a woman president will devote resources to the solution of those problems that s an identity politics argument which is thick , not thin the she slikeme point is not invoked as sufficient unto itself , but as it relates to a matter of policy the calculation may or may not pan out \( successful candidates both disappoint and surprise \) , but it is a calculation of the right kind one objection to identity politics \( crouch makes it in the same column \) is that groups and populations are not monolithic , but display a diversity of attitudes and positions yes they do , but members of a group who might disagree with each other on any number of things could nevertheless come together on a matter of shared concern american jews , for example , have widely varying views on many important issues tax cuts , tort reform , gay marriage , the iraq war still , the vast majority believes that it is important to defend the security of israel this is a belief shared even by those american jews who are strongly critical of israel s treatment of the palestinians they may deplore israel s actions and agree with jimmy carter when he likens them to apartheid , but if the choice is between a politician who pledges to support israel and a politician who would withdraw support and leave the jewish state to fend for itself , most of them would vote for the first candidate every time african americans are no less heterogeneous in their views than jewish americans yet every african american conservative or liberal , rich or poor , barely educated or highly educated meets with obstacles to his or success and mobility that are all the more frustrating because they are structural \( built into the culture s ways of perceiving \) rather than official to the non african american these obstacles will be more or less invisible , especially in a country where access to opportunity is guaranteed by law it makes sense , therefore , that an african american voter could come to the conclusion that an african american candidate would be likely to fight for changes that could remove barriers a white candidate might not even see a vote given for that reason would be a vote based on identity , but it would be more than a mere affirmation of fellowship \( he s one of mine and i have to support him \) it would be a considered political judgment as to which candidate will move the country in a preferred direction identity might be the trigger of the vote , but it would not be the whole of its content we should distinguish , i think , between two forms of identity politics the first i have already named tribal it is the politics based on who a candidate is rather than on what he or she believes or argues for and that , i agree , is usually a bad idea \( i say usually because it is possible to argue that the election of a black or female president , no matter what his or positions happen to be , will be more than a symbolic correction of the errors that have marred the country s history , and an important international statement as well \) the second form of identity politics is what i call interest identity politics it is based on the assumption \( itself resting on history and observation \) that because of his or her race or ethnicity or gender a candidate might pursue an agenda that would advance the interests a voter is committed to not only is there nothing wrong with such a calculation it is both rational and considered i don t see that there is an alternative to voting on the basis of interest the alternative usually put forward is crouch s vote for human qualities rather than sectarian qualities that is , vote on the basis of reasons everyone , no matter what his or her identity , will acknowledge as worthy but there are no such reasons and no such human qualities to be sure , there are words often attached to this chimera integrity , dedication , honesty , intellect , to name a few but these qualities , even when they are found , will always be in the service of some set of policies you either favor or reject it is those policies , not the probity of their proposer , that you will be voting for \( if your candidate is also a good person , that s a nice bonus , but it isn t the essential thing \) you will be voting , in short , for interests , and those who do not have an investment in those interests will be voting for someone else what this means is that the ritual deprecation of special interests makes no sense all interests are special interests proceed from some contestable point of view and none is generally human and that is why identity interests , as long as they are ideological and not merely tribal , constitute a perfectly respectable reason for awarding your vote
st paul hidden from view during much of the republican convention here , a fierce struggle has been under way for the foreign policy heart of  it centers on the deep schism inside the over how to engage with the rest of the world , a running debate that has consumed different wings of the party and the bush white house for the past seven and a half years all week here , it was an undercurrent running just beneath the message of party unity and experience that mr mccain emphasized in his acceptance speech on thursday night on thursday night , republicans here got few hints about whether mr mccain will appeal to the base by leaning toward the more confrontational , goitalone approach of president bush s first term , or whether he will adopt the somewhat chastened , let snegotiate tone of the second term , which has driven many of the hawks to despair before mr mccain appeared , a video dwelled on the most horrific images of sept 11 , and senator lindsay graham of south carolina , one of mr mccain s best friends , hailed him for his early advocacy of a strategy for iraq that has succeeded more troops mr mccain reserved his toughest words for moscow and tehran , accusing the vladimir v putin of reassembling the russian empire and the mullahs of iran of acting as the world s biggest sponsor of terrorism but he said nothing about how he would approach either , other than a vague promise to work with allies around the world and stand up to enemies i know how the world works , he said , in what seemed like a glancing accusation that senator barack obama has not been around long enough to find out there is little question where the majority of the speakers at the convention came out on that issue in seeking to portray mr obama as weak on terrorism and confused about american national interests , they have sounded a lot like mr bush sounded five years ago on wednesday night , former gov mitt romney of massachusetts was at the lectern praising mr mccain for understanding that there is an axis of evil seeking to harm america , a term mr bush has deliberately not used since he opened direct talks with its two surviving members , north korea and iran former mayor rudolph w giuliani of new york mocked mr obama for , he said , avoiding discussion of the sept 11 attacks and advocating taking the russian invasion of georgia to the united nations security council apparently , none of his 300 foreign policy security advisers told him that russia has a veto power in the council , mr giuliani said , skipping over the fact that after the bombing began , mr bush s secretary of state spent days helping draft a security council resolution on the subject but wander outside the convention hall , where advisers to mr mccain were talking about what the next president would face , and the tone was very different on thursday morning , the man mr mccain often describes as one of his heroes , henry a kissinger , 85 , was warning about the need for a bit more modesty in the use of american power as a nation we have to understand our reach , but also our limits , mr kissinger told a packed audience of delegates and others at the hubert h humphrey institute of public affairs at the university of minnesota he urged the next president to go slow on promoting democracy around the world one of the centerpieces of mr bush s foreign policy and suggested that lessons could be learned from mr kissinger s own cold war encounters with the soviet union our major effort with the soviets , he said , recalling his time as president richard m nixon s secretary of state , was not to democratize them , but to normalize them it was a lesson worth thinking about , he suggested , as the next administration considers how to deal with china the debate over whether to seek democracy or stability is part of what richard n haass , who directed policy planning at the state department in mr bush s first term , calls the single most important fault line in american foreign policy today at its core , it is a debate over how deeply america is willing to intervene inside the boundaries of sovereign states to bring about political change whether the country will pursue the humble foreign policy mr bush talked about in 2000 , the unilateral one he executed after 9 11 or the middle road has been forced to pursue in his second term mr mccain has been described by his advisers as a man so experienced in foreign policy that he knows his own gut , but he defies easy categorization his threat to throw russia out of the group of eight industrial nations went far beyond anything mr bush has said , and he has often sounded more hard line than mr bush about doing whatever it takes to stop iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon there are things john has to say to point out the differences with obama , like never negotiating with rogue states without preconditions , one of mr mccain s senior foreign policy advisers said the other day , declining to be named because the campaign had not authorized him to talk to the news media but i would n't overread that , he said who argued for normalization with vietnam when the conservative wing of the party got ill at the idea of sitting down at the table with a bunch of exvietcong \?
we just bought a '92 bluebird bus i am speechless this is happening this is actually happening we are going to travel the country in an old church bus let s just hope the veggie oil conversion goes throughbut more importantly let s hope it makes it back to los angeles from sacramento i just did my first shift behind the wheel of the bus i was certain that i would crash it and that this whole adventure would be over , the tour would be canceled and i would spend the summer in my room avoiding phone calls from people wondering what had happened the bus made it to new york it actually made it here to pick us up this is amazing this is unreal this tour is gonna happen everyone is speechless and donovan has n't showered in what looks like a decade everyone is focused on ami dancing to too fast for luv by motley crue in the middle of the bus he has told us numerous times that this is real rock n' roll he is 43 i love him dearly and am so happy to be traveling him and monotonix \( the band he sings for \) for the next month there are 21 people at tonight s show last night there were 400 the night before 300 now 21 winstonsalem , nc whatever , you ca n't win them all we have to make the best of this broke down in birmingham , ala earlier this morning could n't move for four hours everyone thought the tour was over cause the back wheels stopped spinning but we made it out now we are in a thunderstorm ami is calling the bus greased lightning listening to ccr feeling good the promoter for tonight s show has done nothing to help the bands or run the show he told me that i should be grateful that he put on the show and reminded me that he organizes a music festival that takes place in gainesville during the fall the bands are livid and so am i sadly the promoter is an old friend of mine lesson learned , do n't mix business and friendship i ca n't sleep i am furious six months of work 60 bands that i will have to cancel 60 bands that have set aside time in their life to be a part of this and i will have to explain to them that the show is canceled all day on the phone trying to save the event it s not looking good this is terrible  last night i did what all people do when they drink too much make an ass of themselves i was depressed that s my excuse austin , tex liz from the echo returned my call i worked with the echo for the past four years on the fest and fired them to work with its main competitor i explain to her what happened and she agrees to meet with me this is like getting back with an old girlfriend after leaving her for a betterlooking girl , but quickly realizing that the better looking girl is a terrible person and that first girl you had , the one that was simple and honest , was far better met with liz last night she agreed to do the fest again but would need to check with mitchell mitchell runs the echo when i told him in april that i would be working with their competitor he was furious that was the last time we spoke hopefully he has the same interest as liz phil , donovan , jon malia all called me saying that it was too much that the tour was too much and that they needed to take a day off they were all on the verge of a mental breakdown when we booked this tour we decided not to take one day off we wanted to push ourselves and see how hard we could work i was back home in los angeles for three days trying to save the fest they were the ones working so when they asked to cancel minneapolis i agreed i could n't say no i was n't there they needed rest a day without the stress next tour , two days off a week tonight s show was a disaster matt kim were doublebooked and in turn did not play our show everyone is angry it s an ugly scene i'm livid and so are the bands if this tour happens again we will begin planning in september tonight we celebrated donovan s birthday every band wished him a happy birthday , audience members bought him drinks , girls hugged and kissed him and he drank far too much no one knew that his birthday is next month we just thought this would be fun , which it was no one thought buffalo would be the best show of the tour it was and swimming in a fountain with 20 drunk fans after the show made it so much better just got done talking with jon he chewed me out for over an hour he is livid i understand where he is coming from parts of this tour are so unorganized i got way over my head and it affected everyone i owe him the world met with mitchell and liz it was awkward but mitchell accepted my apology and we have agreed to work with one another the fest will be happening but on a much smaller level it will take place at the same locations it did last year the echo , echoplex , rec center and a few other places let s see how it goes i'm excited worked all day two meetings forgot to eat two cups of coffee now a terrible headache i hate stress rejoining the tour in philadelphia , i made my flight by one minute i do this too often i have to get my life together and begin getting places on time i have no concept of time it s terrible and i need to change today i change if not today then next week but really , i need to change this is hands down the worst feeling i have ever had at best i end up 50 thousand in debt after this tour that is at best i want to die honestly last night i slept in the bus the bus was parked on myrtle and broadway underneath the train in brooklyn at 6 30 am i woke up to someone pounding on the door of the bus it was a large woman she was not happy to see me and stared at me through the plexiglass door , angry that someone was stopping her from breaking into the bus i stood there in my underwear holding an aluminum baseball bat i was too tired to speak so i screamed not a scream for help but a loud caveman like yell to show that i was crazy and would have no problem swinging the bat at her if she tried to get on the bus \( i would n't hit anyone but in a situation like this i had to pretend that i was well , tough \) she walked away and i went back to sleep for an hour before being woken up by the train note every night someone has to sleep on the bus being that we have far too much equipment that could easily be stolen the new york times writer took me out to dinner it was the first good meal that i had eaten in over a month and my first meal of the day i quickly finished my meal within five minutes and stared at her food but was too embarrassed to ask her if i could take what she did n't finish her plate was half full she picked at her food she continued to ask me questions but i struggled with a response i was thinking about my friends back at the venue who i knew were hungry without money this is the last day of tour despite what everyone is saying we all know that the tour needs to end it s gone on far too long tired played a fun game of basketball tonight with adam , peterson and mike i am out of shape after about five minutes i was struggling to breathe and was covered in sweat sure enough my team lost vacation is over time to go home and figure out the fastest way to getting out of debt i know i will struggle for the next year but i dug this hole so i have no reason to complain i have over 20 , 000 in cancellation fees from the fest i contacted the people that i worked with about having them cover half of the fees and i take care of the other half no response lesson learned , never work with someone without a contract regardless of how good of a friend they might be back home tomorrow i start work tomorrow i will start calling all the people that i owe money to and telling them that it will be another week i'm still looking for that pot of gold that will help me pay them back i want to say that this will all work out but really , will it \? but this is at the bottom of the journals i could write about this tour for a week so many little things that i wish to share all in all it was the best time of my life
of all the pressing tasks to bolster homeland security , the one that congress has most dedicatedly ignored is the call to reform itself a hydraheaded system of oversight currently finds the department of homeland security answerable to 16 committees and 40 subcommittees in the house , and 14 committees and 18 subcommittees in the senate this is a comedy that invites fresh national tragedy unless congressional leaders finally resolve to streamline down to a few dedicated panels they must have the power to budget and birddog the sprawling agency , just as comparable scrutiny must be introduced to the parallel world of national and military intelligence gathering these crucial reforms have been undermined by the culture of fiefdoms where gavels are clung to by a herd of congressional bulls snorting on their separate turfs as the reallife threats from terrorism grow more complex when the 9 11 commission first warned of the oversight chaos in 2004 , lawmakers dared to insist there was purposeful redundancy in their ramshackle approach the commission s alarm has been repeated lately by two more bipartisan , independent expert groups commissioned by none other than congress will the next congress finally listen \? one of the studies , from the commission on the prevention of weapons of mass destruction proliferation and terrorism , points out that forming commissions to get patently obvious advice is a symptom of congress s reluctance to change a structure built for the cold war , not modern terrorism a reorganization would require lawmakers to sacrifice committee powers they competed for years to accrue but the only course , if congress is serious about guarding the nation , is to center homeland oversight and budgeting in single committees in the senate and house reform will require more than just consolidating the oversight of national and military intelligence lawmakers must confront the monopoly of the hallowed appropriations panels by creating focused intelligence subcommittees with budget power that is where true oversight begins
new york times correspondents are sharing reactions from around the world to the election of barack obama post a comment  read the comments for months maziar aghazadeh , 29 , and amirhossein teimouri 26 , the two reporters on the foreign desk of kargozaran , a daily newspaper , argued who would win the us presidential race mr aghazadeh favored john mccain and mr teimouri favored barack obama the united states has two wars going on , said mr aghazadeh on wednesday , after it became clear that mr obama would be the next american president mccain would have been a much better commander who could fight these wars , he added but america needs a leader who can fix its image in the world , argued mr teimouri obama can do that although iran s government refused to publicly side with any of the candidates throughout the race , most iranians followed the elections closely and cheered mr obama s victory iran s leaders said his election proved the american people wanted fundamental changes in policy most people recall mr obama s willingness to hold talks with iranian leaders and his objections to the possibility of a military strike against their country many are still skeptical that his election will lead to an immediate improvement of relations between the two countries , but his stance has raised hope that his victory could thaw nearly 30 years of ice radicalism has two ends , said saeed leylaz , an economist and political analyst in tehran if america puts its radicalism towards iran aside , radicals in iran will gradually get isolated nemat ahmadi , a lawyer in tehran , noted mr obama s african blood and eastern roots , and concluded that he will certainly have different views towards the east and the middle east abbass abdi , a reformist politician who was one of the radical students who overran the us embassy in tehran in 1979 and took its diplomats hostage , said , people around the world look at this development with respect in less than half a century from when black people could not go to the same school as the rest of the americans went , he said , americans have voted for a black man who did not come from american parents mr obama s election also presented a paradox , and a challenge , for many in iran who have heard for three decades that the united states is a place where racism rules his election can be a lesson for the dictators of the middle east , said badralsadat mofidi , the deputy editor of kargozaran the country that they called the great satan and said it was the symbol of all kinds of tyranny has enough respect for democratic values that allowed a black candidate to come this far and even become a president , she said have we created that kind of condition \? post a comment barack obama may have been the toast of europe since his visit this past summer , but a stop at the john f kennedy school here showed he might not want to take that popularity for granted not if the students have anything to say a youtube clip of the presidentelect s acceptance speech kicked off the postelection discussion at the public bilingual school tuesday , but the effort his american supporters found so inspired did not seem to sway the jaded teenagers , raised on american wars in afghanistan and iraq and distrustful of his intense popularity here this , announced the first student to step up to the microphone stand , his adolescent slouch exaggerated by the low microphone , is going to be the great disillusionment of our generation another student compared mr obama to the school s namesake , but was talking about the bay of pigs rather than the famous ich bin ein berliner speech the students who attend the school in the city s zehlendorf district would seem to be shoeins for the candidate , with his appeal to young voters and the wild enthusiasm many germans showed the capital was , after all , the improbable site of his largest campaign rally , when more than 200 , 000 people turned out to hear him speak in july the elite of german politics and society gathered at swanky , corporate sponsored parties to ring in the american presidential election overnight here average workers awoke to news of mr obama s victory , which came in the wee hours of the morning normally in the morning i m not in a hurry to listen to the news , but this morning i jumped to the radio first thing at 5 o clock , said anna lemme , 29 , a berlin architect passing through the friedrichstrasse train station in berlin it will give a america a new face , she said of the election but most of the teenagers at the postelection discussion , which turned into more of a dissection of the winning candidate , said they would need convincing before they were willing to believe that change was more than a slick slogan his victory in the school s mock election on tuesday with a resounding 86 percent of the vote was dismissed as a repudiation of president bush s party more than an endorsement of mr obama the gulf between the overjoyed commuter crowd and the circumspect cafeteria clique was notable grownups are thankful for what the americans did for them , with the airlift and everything , said francesca klein , 17 the teenagers , meanwhile , were at most 10 years old when president bush was elected , and remember little else we disregard what the country had done before the last eight years , said caroline meder , 18 , secretary general of the school s model united nations , one of the two moderators of the student discussion , and one of the most supportive of mr obama others gave grudging respect to the american people s intent , if not their celebrated presidentelect even though he doesn t stand for change , i guess it s a sign of change that people vote for him , said laura weidinger , 17 secretarygeneral ban kimoon , habitually a taciturn diplomat in his public statements , bordered on effusive in talking about the presidentelect while careful to highly praise both candidates , he called mr obama s election a historic opportunity for a stronger working relationship between the united nations and the united states i am very optimistic that we will have a very strong relationship , a renewed partnership under his administration , said mr ban the secretarygeneral quoted from several campaign speeches in which the presidentelect voiced support for diplomacy , development and even the united nations itself , often considered a radioactive issue for the american electorate he values highly the resolution of all the conflict issues through dialogue , mr ban said he has expressed publicly that he is willing to meet anybody , any country , so that will provide good opportunity not only for the united states , but also the united nations as a whole to resolve all issues through dialogue relations between the bush administration and the united nations have been notably tense , although the hostile surface rhetoric often masked a working rapport on numerous issues , particularly development in africa still , mr bush did not appoint a united nations ambassador until nine months into his first term and one of his envoys , john bolton , once suggested that nobody would notice a difference if the top 10 floors of the secretariat building were lopped off the bush administration disparaged numerous treaties advocated through the united nations , including the kyoto protocol on global warming , the international criminal court and the comprehensive test ban treaty his administration also withheld funds from the united nations population fund and worked against a treaty limiting small arms trafficking , among others mr ban suggested all that might change i also expect the united states will take a more active participation in all united nations organizations and activities , he said the secretary general noted that in february 2007 he and mr obama met by chance on a shuttle flight from washington to new york the senator asked him many questions , particularly about nuclear proliferation issues involving iran and north korea as well as the challenges of reforming the united nations itself he was very engaging and he knew a lot about the united nations and i was very much encouraged , mr ban said call it redemption this town , in the epicenter of kenya s obamaland the same area where barack obama s father was from and where some of his cousins , halfbrothers and a very gregarious 80something stepgrandmother still live exploded into cheers when the news broke that mr obama had won the presidency thousands of people sang , danced , blew whistles , honked horns , hugged , kissed and thumped on drums all down the same streets where not so long ago huge flames of protest had raged who needs a passport \? people yelled we re going to america ! it was sweetness on many levels a black man in the white house a halfkenyan at the helm of the most powerful country on the planet and a fair election , which kenyans have learned is nothing to take for granted people here stayed up all night , swatting mosquitoes as they watched the election results trickle in on tv sets with fuzzy pictures the last time this many kenyans were riveted by an election their own , in december 2007 riots erupted after the opposition candidate lost and kenya s incumbent president won widespread allegations of vote rigging sent tens of thousands of young men into the streets , to loot , burn and kill much of kisumu , usually a relaxed town along the steamy , hippoinfested shores of lake victoria , was ravaged but on wednesday , many of the same young men who had been doing the burning , the looting and worse , were all smiles , part of the happy wave of emotion that coursed through kisumu passersby and minibus drivers and bicycle taxi men got swept into the streets , where obama posters , obama pins and even obama wall clocks were selling faster than juicy papayas this has restored my faith in democracy , said duncan adel , a computer technician who had been part of the election protests last year about an hour away , down a bumpy dirt road , mr obama s extended kenyan family held a 1 , 000person bash in their ancestral village of kogelo we re going to the white house ! they sang most people in kisumu are luo , the ethnic group of the top opposition leader and coincidentally the same ethnic group of mr obama s father there is an old joke in kisumu that a luo will become president of the united states before becoming president of kenya it has indeed come true by midmorning , the kenyan government declared thursday a national holiday it meant a day off and surely more partying minutes before show time , the 2 million hightech backdrop for al arabiya s election day news coverage was not working but the channel s executive editor , nabil alkhatib , was calm he is a tall man , with an easy presence , decades of experience in middle east news and a conviction that events would not surprise senator john mccain , he believed , was going to win would americans choose someone who thinks outside the box \? he asked rhetorically as an army of engineers and technicians scrambled to get the big screen working again wednesday morning this is just too good to be true al arabiya is a saudiowned , arabiclanguage television news channel based in the arab world s capital of consumer spending , dubai al arabiya s regional audience was overwhelmingly in favor of senator barack obama , the editors said , but in the emirates , it seemed , there were at least some people who were certain that americans would never vote for someone as different as mr obama mccain will win , bilal albodour , a deputy minister of culture for the united arab emirates , said a day earlier that is the american mentality mr khatib had the same sense he stood in the back of the newsroom , a circular studio wrapped in a belt of video screens , all bathed in red and blue lights the engineers had fixed the digital backdrop this is a historic moment not only for the united states , but so we can all get away from perceptions about religion and race and instead consider the quality of the person , mr khatib said al arabiya was determined to present news coverage of the election that was not biased toward either candidate there was concern , for example , about the banner swirling across a screen it was red , the station s color , but it might appear to signal support for the republicans as the night went on , it was clear who was the favorite candidate on the set i want obama to win with 99 percent , like saddam hussein , said hani abu ayyash , who was monitoring the early returns at his computer i swear , if he doesn t win , i m going to take it personally and then , a few minutes before 8 am , cnn called the race , declaring senator obama the winner , and there was , for a brief moment , a cheer in the studio , a fist raised , and then back to the broadcast mr khatib clasped his hands over his head , like a champion declaring victory , and smiled broadly i am positively surprised , he said it s great early on wednesday morning , as news of mr obama s victory poured in from across the world , balaji samanthapudi , 36 , a technology consultant , was jubilant in bangalore , india as the president of the barack obama fan club in india s outsourcing mecca , mr samanthapudi gushed optimistically about all that an obama presidency would deliver i ve never seen such an inspiring leader before , he said you can see the market prices going up he is going to put a stop to terrorism completely he is a very straightforward leader his fan club collected donations from a dozen people , mostly software engineers and management consultants , putting 4 , 000 in mr obama s campaign kitty none of them are us citizens but they urged their us citizen friends and family to vote for obama satyaja bedi , 39 , sipping coffee midmorning and struggling to listen to obama s victory speech at a noisy new delhi cafe , had similarly outsized expectations it s very good , she said i think america should bounce back at the american center nearby , where big screen television monitors broadcast news of the election , sukanya bhardwaj , 19 , a college student studying politics , said obama s victory was testament to the candidate s abilities but also to the maturity of american voters it has become the greatest democracy , she said it has proved it is ready for a black president nearly every major newspaper in the capital , new delhi , had obama vs mccain on the front page television stations have broadcast nothing but american presidential election news all morning the world enters america was the headline of the hindustan times lead editorial wednesday morning , reminding the 44th president of the united states to be mindful of an interconnected world roiled by a financial crisis and two wars for america to chart these choppy waters , it will have to have a helmsman who understands and engages with the world on the world s terms , it urged the indian express , whose editorial pages had been fond of the bush white house over the last couple of years , echoed how swiftly and decisively the next president would have to act the way the world has been enthralled by the contest is a message that the dominant sentiment , after the bush presidency , is not so much antiamericanism , but exasperation with the uses of american power and a concurrent belief that with adequate political will the superpower can repair its agenda for the greater global good some indians used the occasion to introspect krishna prasad , a magazine editor who runs a blog , churumuricom , invited readers to consider when india could expect to elect a prime minister from its largest minority group muslims he said he was surprised that more than a third of his roughly 600 respondents said they believed it was possible rajendra k pachauri , the indian chairman of the intergovernmental panel on climate change , urged mr obama to demonstrate a change in us energy policy the us now has a unique opportunity to assume leadership in meeting the threat of climate change , and it would help greatly if the new president were to announce a coherent and forward looking policy soon after he takes office there is every reason to believe that president obama will actually do so this should please people across the globe , because us leadership is critical for mounting global efforts to meet this threat effectively the sacramento bar in the trendy palermo district filled with a thunderous roar when cnn declared mr obama the winner several hundred americans and a few argentines who were packed inside then launched into a soccer chant , singing , ol ol ol ol , obama obama ! the biggest economy in the world has a leader that the world can talk to , said alejandro saks , an argentine television scriptwriter there is the feeling that for the first time since kennedy , america has a different type of leader the sputtering bus inched its way up the streets of petare , this city s largest slum , delivering its passengers in front of vecinito , enrique cisneros s corner store salsa blared from loudspeakers perched nearby on the stoops of cinderblock hovels pull up a seat , we re celebrating tonight , said mr cisneros , 37 , opening a bottle of blender s pride whiskey he poured the spirit into plastic cups , mixed in some orange juice , and declared to his guests , the united states is choosing a black man as its president maybe we can share a bit in this happiness his guests tuesday night included a schoolteacher , a shoe factory worker , an accountant s assistant , a telephone operator and a couple of foreign journalists they sipped mr cisneros s concoction or nursed polar ice beers and engaged in venezuela s top pastime political debate this is the first american election i can remember in my lifetime that i was eager to witness , said armando d az , 24 , who works at movistar , a cellphone company here before , we d just switch the channel to baseball , said mr d az , gazing at a television announcer on globovisi n and wrapping venezuelan rapidfire spanish around the names of states like connecticut and rhode island it s kind of nice to feel good about the united states again as they do in almost any gathering here in which people examine the toxicity of venezuelan political life , in this instance through the lens of the election of barack obama as president , jokes ensued sitting under a poster of a playful painting by carlos cruzd ez , a kinetic artist , most of those present proudly identified themselves as pitiyanquis , or petite yanquis , thus appropriating a vitriolic insult used with increasing frequency by president hugo ch vez to describe his opponents i wonder if ch vez can stop referring to the united states with such hatred , if only for a few days , said lucy mart nez , 44 , a teacher at a primary school in petare it would be nice to get a break from that as if on cue , globovisi n shifted its broadcast to focus on a political cartoon from tuesday s newspapers here , showing an image of mr ch vez and the headline antiimperial discourse , under a smaller photo of mr obama next to the words , expiration date , 11 4 in other words , the punching bag that the bush administration has been for mr ch vez may be losing its stuffing as night engulfed the streets outside vecinito , revelers rejoiced as slums go , this area of petare , called la monta ita , was not so bad , they claimed many of its residents were working class or middle class , struggling to rise in life they all agreed their most pressing concern was with violent crime sometimes the police don t arrive for an entire day to pick up the body after someone is shot dead on the street , said yamile contreras , 30 , a telephone operator with hair dyed about a shade lighter than marilyn monroe s is it true new york was once this violent \? then they turned the tables on their journalist guests , peppering them with more questions about american oddities like its electoral college \( is that democratic \? \) they asked when america s distant wars would come to an end they asked whether america was in a recession or a depression bidding farewell after an evening filled with awe over the events unfolding in the united states , those gathered at vecinito embraced each other and piled their visitors and mr cisneros , the owner of the corner store , into a bandit taxi parked outside earsplitting salsa blared again from the speakers of the car , an astonishingly large 1982 chevrolet malibu without seat belts i love american cars , the taxi driver said as he drove on petare s maze of streets , which were still buzzing with pedestrian activity past midnight motorcycles whizzed by in the caribbean night a few hours ago , said mr cisneros , the world felt like a different place as barack obama took one state after another , there was the occasional cheer , the occasional grunt of disgust , but mostly the soldiers looked serious either candidate could change their lives where they serve how long they live away from home or in harm s way what s going to happen to us \? said specialist katherine roy , of the 122nd infantry support company , fourth infantry division what s going to happen to us \? we know we re not going to leave iraq right away , but we don t want to go to afghanistan we just want to go home iraq was one of the issues over which mr obama and mr mccain disagreed ferociously mr obama opposed the war and wants us troops out more quickly mr mccain supported it and had pledged to stay much longer yet some soldiers reported feeling a certain distance from both men for younger soldiers mr mccain is from an older generation one soldier described him as being like your grandfather , set in his ways but mr obama is a newcomer to the military world , a rare visitor to iraq , an unknown in many respects president bush listened to the generals , the joint chiefs , they have a lot of experience , said 2nd lt hunter wakeland , staff officer , first brigade , fourth infantry division and a native of kennebunkport , maine with presidentelect obama s lack of military experience , hopefully he listens to them too in the normally querulous union of iraqi writers club in baghdad , there was a rare unanimity among the secular , the religious , shiites , sunnis and former regime loyalists while the election of the first black man to the highest office in the united states was admirable , mr obama s promise to start withdrawing troops from iraq was a cause for great concern at the club s restaurant and bar , which has survived the wrath of religious extremists over the past few years , daoud alrahmani , a selfstyled poet , writer and satirist , gathered at one table with two of his colleagues for an early lunch they drank beer and nibbled from little bowls filled with marinated fava beans served as hors d oeuvres  there will be chaos if they leave , mr rahmani said we are still in disagreement sectarianism is ingrained in us now his class in international relations was starting in 10 minutes , but tang tang was busy studying a map on a computer screen inside a cramped common room at prestigious tsinghua university his major is international relations the chinese equivalent of political science and his screen displayed the biggest political show in the world the redandblue electoral jigsaw of the united states , with every state labeled in chinese characters mr tang , 23 , admitted that the american election had been a serious distraction during his wednesday morning classes given the different time zones , the outcome was still uncertain yet now that he could assess the historic obama victory , mr tang s reaction seemed akin to a sports fan dissecting a box score and betrayed none of the hopeful idealism once conferred on westernstyled democracy by young chinese intellectuals we are different from the younger generation 20 years ago , mr tang said , alluding to the generation defined , and scarred , by the 1989 prodemocracy demonstrations at tiananmen square now we can take a more rational , sober approach when we observe the election the generation 20 years ago grew up in a different environment america was like a completely different world it would be shocking to watch this mr tang s cool detachment is just a small reminder that if the idealism of young voters in the united states was considered critical to mr obama s victory , their peers in authoritarian china are often less convinced of the transformative potential of democracy the bookcases outside mr tang s classrooms are filled with journals assessing the sinoamerican relationship and several students said mr obama s candidacy had become a subject of much interest and discussion but china s own political evolution seems unlikely to be dramatically altered by a historic election half a world away mr tang s biggest concern one expressed by several other students was how an obama presidency would , or would not , influence relations with china mr tang had even studied past american presidents and found a trend they talk tough about china at first but then soften over time he assumed mr obama would be the same this is huge for america , mr tang said but for the chinese , i don t think we are paying as much attention a few minutes later , he checked his watch sorry , i ve got to get to class two hours before dawn on wednesday morning , four college students were tucked into a cherryred booth at the starlite diner here , waiting for election returns all of them had class in a few hours , and they were struggling to stay awake ilya glazunov , 18 , rested his cheek on the cool tabletop vladislav malashenko , 22 , slipped down the vinyl seat and threatened to disappear entirely still , during a season when antiwestern sentiment in russia built to a pitch not seen for a decade , they nudged each other awake for senator barack obama each of them had their own reasons david zokhrabyan , 21 , is armenian , and mr obama s ascendance made him wonder aloud when a nonrussian might be a viable candidate for higher office here his girlfriend , mane karapetyan , a student of public relations , wanted to know how mr obama s campaign had managed to promote him so effectively he has so many things not preferable in a president , ms karapetyan , 22 , said he is a black , and his middle name is hussein , and all that stuff what interested mr malashenko was the mere fact that either candidate could win he and his friends , politics buffs from moscow state university , had a single point of reference for presidential elections dmitri a medvedev s landslide victory this spring , after the barest semblance of a campaign , on the strength of the recommendation of his predecessor , vladimir v putin it s just like a soccer match , mr malashenko said , as cnn anchors chattered excitedly about results from virginia and ohio you don t know what s going to happen in 10 seconds this is a real competition between the candidates although russians , like everyone else , were exhausted by this year s extraordinary race , that weariness was gone at 7 am , when cnn called the election for mr obama the waitresses on the night shift went home , and traffic picked up around the lenin statue in october square mr glazunov roused himself the us , that is country that is really majestic , he said i feel it is a country where everything is possible he stood when mr obama began his victory speech , with a faint smile playing on his lips the whole time , as if it had never occurred to him to be sleepy that s what i call an election , he said

on the last night of july the mark morris dance group gave a thronged and warmly acclaimed openair performance as part of the celebrate brooklyn ! season in prospect park quite right too from the handsome building in brooklyn in which it has been based since 2001 , the morris company tours the length and breadth of the united states and the wider world later this month it has a season in new zealand and in november one in london in between , it will appear in ann arbor , mich , and berkeley , calif its januarytomarch schedule includes performances from hawaii to boston what was lovely about this celebrate brooklyn ! performance was that it was a triple bill of morris dances new and old excursions , mr morris s short work for six dancers to samuel barber piano music \( which had its premiere at five weeks before \) , followed by new love song waltzes \( 1982 \) and love song waltzes \( 1989 \) , his beloved pair of dances \( to brahms song cycles \) about multiple facets of love as seen across and within a community the oldandnew program reminded me of the last brooklyn season the company had given , in january 2007 at the small theater in the mark morris dance center it included the premiere of the bach italian concerto , in which mr morris himself , who dances infrequently these days , gave himself a haunting role that quadruple bill played some part in persuading me to move to new york to start this job a few months later but these modest , succinct brooklyn mixed programs stand in stark contrast to the fulllength special projects that now fill more than 60 percent of the morris company s schedules these include l'allegro , il penseroso ed il moderato \( 1988 \) , the hard nut \( 1991 \) , king arthur and mozart dances \( both 2006 \) , and romeo and juliet , on themes from shakespeare \( 2008 \) about the radiant , philosophical and innocent l'allegro there are few doubts no work mr morris has made has received more popular and critical acclaim , and it has been widely regarded as a classic since it was new the others , however , follow in order both chronological and of diminishing quality although i have changed my mind about the hard nut more than once over the years , it is never less than entertaining from start to finish , and its waltz of the snowflakes shows mr morris on his utterly remarkable top form but mozart dances , made to two piano concertos and the double piano sonata , was a puzzle even before its premiere i love mozart , mr morris said in a 1988 interview , but i find that the structure of his works is often too fragile , too sophisticated for dancing by choreographing two piano concertos and the double piano sonata in his 2006 mozart dances , was he saying that he had now acquired the sophistication to match mozart s \? or that in these three pieces mozart s structure was less sophisticated than usual \? although mozart dances is a work of considerable craftsmanship , and although the central movement of the double piano sonata an allmale meeting of drama and form was a rare flowering , i think that both the concertos proved that mr morris was right in 1988 the final taste that mozart dances left in the mouth was one of hubris pride before a fall king arthur and romeo , considerably worse , were major disappointments meets romeo and juliet \? the critic joan acocella , in her excellent 1993 book mark morris , writes \( accurately \) at one point uninterested in boygirl love , he tends not to use partnering since mr morris spent more than a year preparing this romeo , which used prokoviev s first thoughts on the subject \( notably , a happy ending \) , you hoped in advance he would find time in which to become more interested in boygirl love and in partnering i find the boygirl love in the hard nut calculated and unrewarding as choreography unfortunately , in romeo i find it much more so both ballets make , with zero subtlety , the point that love is something youngsters copy from their elders why make romeo and juliet , of all lovers , xerox copies of the senior capulets at the ball \? in dances like this mr morris s choreography seems the equivalent of some of the worst aspects of contemporary directors' theater wiseguy , schematic , less interested in making us experience an old story or score as if for the first time than in analytically laying out its entrails on the slab , determined at every point to make you see that a directorchoreographer has been here there are three main ways in which this tendency reveals itself in mr morris s work a doggedly stepfornote quality , a yet more nagging employment of movement motifs and a need to make us aware of choreographic constructions like canon and fugue to call mr morris s choreography stepfornote is not to imply that he is simply filling out in dance terms a prescription set out by the music but the rhythm often feels tight musically slavish , like a translator who ca n't break free from the constructions of the original language when you 're watching fred astaire dance or watching balanchine choreography , you 're soon aware that dance and music have separate existences that complement each other by not always staying close there are dances that mr morris pins to their music , and the result is about as joyous as pinning a butterfly as for motifs they occur in just about everything mr morris has done in his best work their eloquence and the surprising way they answer the music make for absorbing dramatic poetry in romeo and juliet , however , even someone not used to watching dance could have identified six or more clunky motifs after one viewing several of them have to do with hands the outstretched palm as a gesture in social dance the palmtouchingpalm gesture romeo and juliet do on meeting \( taken from shakespeare \) the hands , with palms joined , turned like a key \( as a symbol of marriage \) none of these are subtle or poetic and each is done to death with repetition mr morris keeps banging home his meanings and messages and treating us as if we were stupid in romeo mr morris is using a version of prokofiev s previously unperformed score as realized by scholars , and i 've read that he hopes to get some orchestrations altered but the problems go deeper i'm hoping he may rework his choreography before 2009 this romeo comes to lincoln center in may but will he \? king arthur , a staging he had been preparing since the early 1990s , was dismal at its 2006 premiere in london and it was not significantly improved when it joined new york city opera in march why do some morris works thrill while others irritate \? the dichotomy has grown only more marked i find it striking that no overemphasis on choreography has ever bothered me when mr morris himself is dancing i last saw him dance in the slow movement of his italian concerto , in that january 2007 quadruple bill at his company s dance center he was considerably overweight \( as he has usually been since the early 1990s \) , a few months over 50 , and still one of the world s most memorable and affecting dancers standing absolutely still , he began by simply miming a heartbeat holding a hand next to his heart and then beating that hand once how can anyone do something so simple and make it an event of magnitude \? isadora duncan \( whose weight was also part of what made her controversial \) apparently had the same gift then mr morris slowly walked forward next he did a slowmotion throwing gesture , with such control that , while moving , he reminded me of the greek sculptures of discusthrowers even though he \( dressed in black \) looked nothing like an athlete how did those separate three motifs the heartbeat , the walk forward , the slow throw fit together \? how did they reveal something in the music \? why were they were so profoundly riveting \? i ca n't tell and , to me , this sense of mystery is a quintessential morris experience it s hard even trying to work out just what the emotion you feel is , let alone trying to explain its derivation mr morris has made a number of group dances over the years that have been similarly transporting without his presence onstage of those he has made this decade , the most remarkable has been all fours \( 2004 \) , to bartok s fourth string quartet this was in some ways one of the tightest responses to a score he has ever made as the title suggests , he was hooked on the music s quartet construction yet he had eight dancers rather than four the differences between the two quartets made for a drama that told us something about the music beyond rhythm its complex use of stage space made for a further layer of drama and most important of all , it had the same urgency as the music , the same unstoppable momentum few of the dances he has made in the last 12 years have been on that level , but a number of them have been fresh and serious much rests simply with his choice of motifs how will they connect with each other and with the music \? he has made a series of ballets for san francisco ballet , the latest of which , joyride \( to a commissioned score by john adams \) , opened in april and will be danced in the company s october season at new york city center just to see the contrast between its first two motifs a plucked , deliberate walking step , then a boldly vaulting jump was good news very little of the movement of excursions , his next piece \( made for his own company \) , could be easily analyzed as dancing , and that very oddity was part of its fascination neither of these is a morris classic and yet they show him as a completely skillful , committed artist nonetheless , his fulllength works attract much more attention there were new york city dancegoers who made an overnight trek upstate to see his romeo at bard college but who could n't organize themselves to attend excursions in prospect park the difference between mr morris s best and worst work was disquieting in the 1980s it is more so now like the european choreographers kenneth macmillan and pina bausch and the playwright david hare , he has become an artist about whom it is impossible to sound fair it s odd that in his worst works he can seem both frivolous and overorganized , dogged and unserious and then you doubt that such a choreographer was ever capable of greatness but he was and is from new love song waltzes \( 1982 \) to all fours \( 2004 \) , he has made works that are among the peaks of american dance \( and thus world dance \) and that have taken dance expression where it has not been before , with visions of human contrast and harmony , comic and bleak at the same time odder yet , this most schematic of choreographers has the most marvelously spontaneous company of dancers how do such marvels and blunders coexist in one man \? is mark morris his own worst enemy \?
bangkok the remnants of the last financial crisis are still arrayed across this sprawling city , halffinished buildings covered with mold and rust stains , reminders of a real estate bubble a decade ago that burst with a loud bang the crisis of 1997 was breathtaking for its suddenness and ferocity banks collapsed , companies went under and erstwhile millionaires , desperate for cash , sold their belongings at what became known as the market of the formerly rich now as another global financial crisis unfolds , the signs of distress in southeast asia are much more subtle traffic has thinned by 6 percent on bangkok s expressways indonesian farmers who harvest the red fruit from oil palm trees are having trouble finding buyers house prices in vietnam , a relative newcomer to capitalism , have come down 30 percent in recent months , following years of steep rises stock markets in southeast asia have slid downward almost in lockstep with those in new york , london and tokyo but outside of trading rooms , there is none of the palpable panic of a decade ago when the region was ground zero in what the thais called the tom yam crisis , after the famous spicy soup that can burn one s tongue last time it was selfinflicted the crisis originated from within asia , said mark tan , an economist at goldman sachs in hong kong this time the contagion is radiating out from the united states and europe , the region s biggest customers while the initial reduction in growth wo n't be as bad as in the asian crisis , mr tan said , it will also mean the rebound is slower and takes longer , as export demand will be much weaker lacking the immediacy of the last crisis , the twists and turns of the financial turmoil in the west have been received here like news of a plague several valleys away the villagers are wondering when it will hit their homes and how bad it will be the reckoning is likely to come next year as orders for exports drop off , factories will slow down and the main motor of southeast asian economies will sputter , say economists and government planners southeast asian countries exported themselves out of the last crisis with cheap products made even cheaper by their devalued currencies the united states , which was still enjoying its technology boom in 1999 , snapped up the electronics , clothing and toys that the region produces this time debtladen consumers in the united states do not appear to have the means to keep factories here humming on the contrary , a newfound frugality among americans is likely to drag southeast asia down thailand and vietnam depend heavily on exports to power economic growth for malaysia and singapore , overseas markets are even more crucial to domestic prosperity we have had exportled growth for more than 30 years , said pansak vinyaratn , a former chief economic adviser to the thai government we have not geared ourselves toward investment in domesticled growth workers may be laid off or migrant workers sent home , but economists are predicting a slowdown , not a recession in 1997 the suddenness of the crisis put a bankrupted real estate developer out on the street selling sandwiches thailand s economy shrank by a stunning 10 percent in 1998 this crisis , when measured by economic growth , is predicted to be far less severe governments , which now have larger cash reserves and relatively small deficits compared with the roaring , and profligate , 1990s , have already announced plans to increase spending to keep the economies moving indonesia , which went cup in hand to the international monetary fund last time , has much more room to maneuver the country s public debt has come down significantly , from more than 100 percent of the size of its economy eight years ago to about 36 percent now and in its earliest stages the has brought a measure of relief to southeast asia the plunge in oil prices is good news for indonesia , where subsidies make up a large part of the government budget the poor may also benefit along with fuel , the price of rice has fallen sharply inflation this year is 6 percent next year it will be half that , said supavud saicheua , managing director of phatra securities in bangkok the poor and working class in factories will definitely benefit
baghdad a company of iraqi soldiers abandoned their positions on tuesday night in sadr city , defying american soldiers who implored them to hold the line against shiite militias the retreat left a crucial stretch of road on the front lines undefended for hours and led to a tense series of exchanges between american soldiers and about 50 iraqi troops who were fleeing capt logan veath , a company commander in the 25th infantry division , pleaded with the iraqi major who was leading his troops away from the sadr city fight , urging him to return to the front if you turn around and go back up the street those soldiers will follow you , captain veath said if you tuck tail and cowardly run away they will follow up that way , too captain veath s pleas failed , and senior american and iraqi commanders mounted an urgent effort to regain the lost ground an elite iraqi unit was rushed in and with the support of the americans began to fight its way north this episode was a blow to the american effort to push the iraqis into the lead in the struggle to wrest control of parts of sadr city from the militia and what americans and iraqis say are iranianbacked groups that approach was intended to build up the iraqi military s fighting capacity and put an iraqi face on the operation in sadr city , which is occurring in a baghdad bastion of support for , the antiamerican cleric two weeks ago , more than 1 , 000 iraqi soldiers deserted their posts during the fight against militias in basra tuesday s desertions in sadr city , although involving a particularly hesitant iraqi unit , left many of the americans soldiers wondering about the tenacity of their iraqi allies it bugs the hell out of me , said sgt george lewis , captain veath s platoon sergeant in company b , third platoon , first battalion , 14th infantry regiment we do n't see any progress being made at all we hear these guys in firefights we know if we are not up there helping these guys out we are making very little progress company b moved into sadr city at the end of march as part of a broader effort to secure the southernmost portion of the densely populated sadr city that area has been used by militias to fire 107millimeter rockets toward the green zone the americans' mission is to stop the rocket firings and help the iraqi government establish a modicum of control some iraqi soldiers have fought hard american soldiers have been regularly coaching them on how to protect their patrol bases , conserve ammunition and evacuate their wounded one big problem is that the iraqi troops have responded to militia gunfire with such intense fusillades that the soldiers have endangered civilians , american soldiers and even their own forces the barrage of iraqi army fire has become such a regular occurrence that some american soldiers are worried that militia fighters have tried to insert themselves between nearby iraqi units to induce the iraqi soldiers to fire on one another in a recent visit to the iraqi forward position , first sgt martin angulo of company b sought to coach the iraqis on how to use their newly acquired m16s to direct precision fire at a militia sniper who had been tormenting the iraqi forces from an alleyway the problem on tuesday , however , was more serious an iraqi retreat that left a gaping hole in the most forward position on a critical thoroughfare in the tharwa section of sadr city the episode began when major sattar , the leader of an iraqi company that had taken up positions 700 yards in front of the americans , suddenly appeared at company b s field headquarters in the southern part of sadr city the major s company had replaced a more battlehardened iraqi unit just two days earlier , and he had been unhappy to find that he would be occupying a position to the front of the better trained and equipped americans every house in sadr city probably has one of their sons in the mahdi army , he observed when american soldiers visited his position on monday so it is hard to convince people to believe in the iraqi army when he arrived at the americans' position on tuesday , the iraqi officer reported that many of his soldiers had taken off their uniforms and deserted after other iraqi army commanders failed to send reinforcements during a gun battle with militias that he said had lasted several hours major sattar calmly explained that he was leading the remainder of his 80man company away from the fight as if to underscore the point , a convoy of iraqi vehicles piled high with furniture was parked in front of the american position abandoning the stronghold , however , would allow the militias to move in again and seed the road with roadside bombs other iraqi units had stood their ground through several long firefights , and captain veath was surprised that the major s unit was leaving after holding off another militia attack you went through a whole battle and are now removing yourself \? captain veath asked incredulously are any of your men dead \? major sattar acknowledged that his unit had several wounded but none killed but he and other iraqi soldiers insisted that they were poorly equipped to battle the militias iraqi forces , they said , were short of ammunition , had only a few armored vehicles and were up against militia fighters they said were equipped and trained by the iranians we are not afraid , the major responded he also complained that he had no means to communicate directly with the american troops that is an excuse , and you know it , captain veath shot back he argued that one of the major s platoons was situated just 100 yards from some of the american stryker vehicles and that the two sides had agreed that the iraqis could send a runner over to the vehicles to ask for help if necessary the iraqi commander returned to his convoy and captain veath followed , promising a stryker escort if the iraqi soldiers would only return to their positions dozens of excited iraqi soldiers began to join in the discussion as tempers flared and voices rose , sergeant angulo ordered the company s soldiers to stay close to captain veath the iraqi convoy drove off , and the americans began to scramble to find a new iraqi unit to plug the gap senior iraqi commanders hurried to the scene and a special iraqi reconnaissance unit was ordered to advance up the road with the help of an american bombclearing unit , stryker vehicles and attack helicopters , the iraqis rumbled north , spraying rounds as they went according to the last reports monitored by company b , the iraqis were stopped short by several roadside bombs , and planned to resume the push in daylight the furious iraqi fire on their drive toward the abandoned base endangered the american soldiers who were bringing supplies to one of their platoons , and an american officer issued a plea over the tactical radio they are lighting up everything , he said tell them to knock it off
if your latest battle with your hmo has you pounding your head with frustration , sick around the world on may spur you to more drastic action , like leaving the united states altogether in this frontline report on tuesday night , the washington post reporter t r reid travels to five countries britain , japan , germany , taiwan and switzerland that manage to provide some form of universal health coverage to their populations in each nation , he reports , insurance premiums are significantly lower than those in america \( in britain there are none \) , and the waiting time to see a doctor is either tolerable \( in britain \) or nonexistent this fastmoving and entertaining hour starts from the premise that the american health care system , with its high costs , multiple gatekeepers and failure to provide insurance for much of the population , is a failure and mr reid makes the case \( in about 10 minutes per country \) that other capitalist democracies have not just cheaper and more equally available health care , but also better care over all , with longer life expectancies and lower infant mortality rates the clinics and hospitals he visits may not be as spacious and well buffed as those in american suburbs , but surveys of these countries' citizens the actual consumers of care show rates of satisfaction that should make american providers blush how do they do it \? the british , of course , have done it by nationalizing the medical profession , and mr reid , who s on the lookout for ideas that will work in the united states , admits that this one s a nonstarter in the other countries , however , the systems doctors , hospitals , insurers are for the most part private , and the difference lies in government regulation that is heavy by current american standards but far short of socialism the key factors , mr reid determines , are mandatory coverage \( only in germany are the rich allowed to opt out of the national insurance system \) , a competitive but nonprofit insurance system and price fixing in the medical industry one of the greatest savings created by this increased regulation is , counterintuitively , less bureaucracy with no combat between insurers and insured , and with no fear on the part of doctors and hospitals that they wo n't be paid , these systems have dramatically lower administrative costs than in america nothing is perfect , of course we see german doctors taking to the streets in mass protests over the low payments they receive we learn that the japanese and taiwanese systems are running at a deficit , which will mean either higher fees or higher taxes but even if those asian countries were to make up their deficits immediately , they would still be spending only half as much of their gross domestic product on health care as the united states and , by all accounts , providing far more to their people than the safety nets that our presidential candidates propose as solutions to the american crisis one area sick around the world does n't explore is the one that probably makes many americans those well above the poverty line , anyway most nervous about the idea of medical regulation the availability of the kind of heroic , expensive care we expect when our hearts fail , or cancer strikes that kind of care is the subject of the truth about cancer , another pbs health special , on wednesday night in this program the television producer linda garmon documents the battles of her husband and several other bostonarea patients against different forms of lethal cancer mesothelioma , pancreatic cancer , adult leukemia in a film that is alternately scattered and emotionally wrenching it s really about ms garmon s own process of discovering what s important , for the patient and the family , after a diagnosis of cancer , and that it s not always one more round of chemo or the latest experimental drug jon palfreman , director and producer written by mr palfreman and t r reid produced by frontline and palfreman film group wgbh boston , series producer david fanning , series executive producer correspondent , mr reid linda garmon , producer , writer and director produced by carousel films llc production for wgbh boston laurie donnelly , executive producer for wgbh boston
one of the most unique aspects of the 2008 heisman trophy race is that all three of the candidates could be considered strong contenders to return to new york as finalists next season this year marked the first time in the heisman s 74year history that none of the top three finalists were seniors oklahoma s sam bradford , florida s tim tebow and texas s colt mccoy all have shown at least passive interest in the nfl , though mccoy , a junior , is the only one who has declared he will definitely return tebow , a junior , and bradford , a sophomore , were asked about the nfl on saturday night and gave waitandsee answers oklahoma coach bob stoops , however , went on a diatribe that could have melted mel kiper s hair gel you don t know that , stoops said sternly to a reporter who said that bradford projected high in the nfl draft those people who are projecting that have no idea about that you guys are making something that isn t there unless you have got a draft projection back that i didn t ok \? so you re going on speculation that rarely is correct if he s a topfive guy , he ought to go if he isn t , he ll be a topfive guy at some point in his career at least that s my belief there s a big difference he still has a lot he ll improve and mature and physically grow and mentally handling everything there s so much that people don t talk about that throw those projections around that don t take into consideration bradford blew off questions about the nfl , as he ll have a week to decide on his future after the title game on jan 8 tebow said he had not put the paperwork in for the nfl , though he will he has dropped hints that he wants to return to gainesville for his senior year guess even more motivation maybe for one more year to tie archie , i don t know , tebow said of the prospect of joining archie griffin as the only player with two heisman trophies
we re going to philly tied at 1 , and unless one team sweeps , we ll be back at tropicana field for at least a game 6 on wednesday the phillies were once again downright grotesque with runners in scoring position in this game 1 for 15 , with no runs batted in , because shane victorino s infield single didn t score ryan howard from second in the fourth jayson werth s hot smash that scored carlos ruiz in the ninth was scored an error , a tough error , so no rbi there they had three atbats with runners in scoring position in each of the first three innings , and did not score this , after going 0 for 13 wednesday night it was fun to see joe maddon stick with david price through trouble in the ninth i think we saw the threat of price not being known by opponents jimmy rollins was ahead in the count 21 after ruiz s leadoff double , and swung way over a downandin slider that is price s best pitch right now if rollins had faced price before , he might have known to lay off it instead he went 22 instead of 31 , and flared out to shortstop and two batters later , after chase utley got down 02 , he struck out on another price slider , this one down and away that might be one of our sloppiest games we ve played all year , charlie manuel said immediately afterward but the phillies got a split here , and they have to feel ok on the flight back home  bottom 8th werth redemption \? rays 4 , phillies 1 11 24 pm bad night for jayson werth error in right field , two strikeouts and a groundout , and the one single he got was negated when rocco baldelli nailed him straying off first for a double play werth will be up third in this inning if he can redeem himself and get on , things could get very interesting with chase utley and ryan howard batting behind him if david price is no longer in , the rays still have two lefthanders to go after utley and howard jp howell and trever miller , who each pitched briefly wednesday night against them howell came in in the seventh and struck out werth , allowed a single to utley , struck out howard , then walked pat burrell on a close pitch miller struck out howard in the ninth  middle 8th price paid rays 4 , phillies 1 11 18 pm if you called the eric bruntlett homer off david price , you win the right to deliver a pizza to me in the press box mushroom and onion , well done , please watching david price pitch again , it has to be very uncomfortable hitting against him in part \( not just because of his speed \) because the ball tends to fly all over the place sometimes his pitches pump right through the strike zone , and sometimes they re two feet high or outside i don t think this is that big a deal , but it must be unnerving bruntlett got one of the pitches right down the pipe and smoked it for all the people wondering if price would suddenly become the rays closer , despite joe maddon s denials , you got your answer in this game he probably won t pitch the ninth , and other relievers will close out this game , not him  middle 7th 30 series ago rays 4 , phillies 0 11 04 pm was that our generation s bob welchreggie jackson moment \? a bit of a stretch , but a fun thought david price just struck out ryan howard with two runners on and two out in the seventh , in what felt a bit like philadelphia s last chance to make this 40 game close by the end price rebounded from walking his first hitter , just as he did in his last inning against the red sox welch , as a young , hardthrowing rookie for the dodgers in 1978 , found himself with the game on the line two on , two out , dodgers up 43 in the ninth facing the yankees reggie jackson jackson fouled off several pitches in the epic atbat , but welch struck him out and became an almost overnight household name he ended up winning 211 career games and a cy young award no one knows whatever happened to that jackson guy  end 6th zooming along rays 4 , phillies 0 10 58 pm i love quick games , but man , it s hard to blog through em can t someone argue a call for a while \? run onto the field \? what about michael sergio , the clown who parachuted into shea stadium in 1986 \? anyway assuming he is replaced for the bottom of the seventh , brett myers ended up pitching a bit like scott kazmir did wednesday night he gave up two runs in the first , and looked horrible through two , when he was down , 30 but he gave up only one run in the next four it s all about fastball command , folks but his offense didn t help hats off to james shields i still say he looked very shaky , but when your guy doesn t give up a run through almost six , you re thrilled  middle 6th into the bullpen rays 4 , phillies 0 10 42 pm joe maddon taking out his ace with two out in the sixth indicates two things he saw something in james shields that said , his luck is going to run out , and how important winning this game 2 is for the rays it was first and third , yes , but he had a fourrun lead with two out , and it s not like there was a platoon decision \( the hitter , pedro feliz , is just as righthanded as shields and the new pitcher , dan wheeler \) shields had thrown just 104 pitches , but they were what pitching coaches call highstress pitches runners were on base most of the time wheeler got feliz to ground into a force play there are still nine outs for the rays bullpen to get , though grant balfour is available , but he did throw 1 2 3 innings wednesday night , so don t look for him to do that again we want david price to face chase utley and ryan howard in the seventh or eighth !  end 5th evan streaks , not eva rays 4 , phillies 0 10 30 pm don t look now , but evan longoria is 0 for 7 in this world series , including the runscoring groundout in the first inning his october stardom notwithstanding , longoria has slumped this postseason at times and been incredibly streaky he hit two homers in game 1 of the al division series against the white sox , then had just one hit in the next four games he then hit home runs in four straight games against boston in the threeplus games since , he s 1 for 13  middle 5th werth not so much rays 4 , phillies 0 10 17 pm i still say that james shields is flirting with disaster , but he needs to do it only for a few more innings another firstandsecond , oneout situation for the phillies , and chase utley hooks a soft liner to rocco baldelli , who catches it and fires a strike back to carlos pena to double up jayson werth who was almost decapitated by the throw pena immediately ran off the field as if the firstbase umpire , fieldin culbreth , was going to change his mind , which , after baldelli s ridiculous walk earlier , is a distinct possibility and ryan howard , 2 for 2 in this game \( finally \) , doesn t hit nice outside changeup by shields on 10 to get a swinging strike on utley , though scott kazmir couldn t get an outside pitch on utley in the first wednesday night , left it inside , and utley smacked it for a tworun homer  end 4th rocco runs rays 4 , phillies 0 9 50 pm nice to see that rocco baldelli can still run hard he has said for weeks that he was saving his energy for when he needed it , and he s needed it twice in this game , the second time in the bottom of the fourth on a potential doubleplay ball because he just beat out the turn throw from second baseman chase utley , jason bartlett was able to bat with one out rather than two , and squeeze home cliff floyd for a 40 lead if baldelli comes out soon , as i mentioned earlier , it will be as much because of the fourth inning as his sprint and collision at home in the second  middle 4th risp risks rays 3 , phillies 0 9 14 pm greg dobbs now has two huge strikeouts in the game with runners in scoring position so much for being the designated hitter pedro feliz also has failed twice but the phillies broke their 0for19 start with runners in scoring position this world series with a single that didn t score a run ! shane victorino hit a hard ground ball off carlos pena s glove and beat akinori iwamura s throw , but of course ryan howard couldn t score from first single for victorino , no rbi , phillies off the schneid whoopee i wrote a book on statistics , and still don t bow at their altar that s one of a million reasons why  middle 3rd shades of ozzie rays 3 , phillies 0 9 14 pm ok , it s a little bit of an exaggeration , but when akinori iwamura made that heytheball sgoingthatway play on jimmy rollins s hard ground ball with none out and a runner on second , so a pretty big situation my mind turned to ozzie smith smith was just 10 games into his major league career when he made what is probably the best shortstop play ever he was a 23yearold rookie on april 28 , 1978 , when the braves jeff burroughs hit a swerving but hard line drive off the end of his bat as smith flashed to his left to go after the ball , it hit the infield dirt about five feet beyond the grass the ball probably hit a pebble , because it caromed weirdly , to smith s right as he was still moving in the other direction with the ball clearly having a mind of its own , smith threw his glove up to protect his face , planted his left foot , and all but blindly stuck out his right hand to make one desperate try for the ball amazingly , smith s five fingers grabbed it high above his right shoulder he splashed to the ground and got a face full of dirt then he put his hands under himself , jumped up in one fluid motion , and threw burroughs out at first smith made dozens of amazing plays in his 17 seasons after that but none ever topped that one , made before anyone knew who ozzie smith was they did soon enough you can watch the clip here , about 10 seconds into the very pirated clip \( apologies to mlb productions \)  end 2nd men in boo rays 3 , phillies 0 9 14 pm i don t mind when the guy behind the deli counter is a little indecisive my power windows even , occasionally , my tv remote control but i want my baseball umpires to be resolute and clear not egotistical and smug , but sure of themselves to the point where they at least appear as if they know what they re doing so what in the world happened on rocco baldelli s strikeoutthatwasn t in that last inning \? baldelli clearly swung on a 32 pitch and was rung up by the homeplate umpire , kerwin danley but he started jogging to first , and because the firstbase umpire said no swing , that supercedes danley s call \? i don t mind baldelli jogging confidently he s supposed to but where was danley to say , hey , buddy , you re out \? absolutely inexcusable i m surprised charlie manuel didn t have an aneurysm arguing as it turns out , baldelli wound up thrown out at home on bj upton s single it was a long \( seriously \) 180foot run for the staminachallenged baldelli , followed by a violent crash into catcher carlos ruiz i say baldelli doesn t play more than five innings tonight better warm up , ben zobrist  middle 2nd courting disaster rays 2 , phillies 0 9 03 pm even though he hasn t given up a run , i do not like how rays pitcher james shields looks yes , he retired the side in the first , but he ran the count full against the first two hitters , jimmy rollins and jayson werth in the second , ryan howard smashed him for a double he got pat burrell behind , 12 , then walked him and , after shane victorino s foul pop , threw a horrible wild pitch on 02 with greg dobbs at the plate and he seemed to get lucky on his strikeout of dobbs on a 12 cutter , catcher dioner navarro set up outside , but the pitch went inside dobbs was fooled \( did burrell on 2nd flash him the pitch that had been signaled \? \) , took it , and after pedro feliz s hard lineout , the inning was over with the phillies squandering yet another scoring opportunity shields probably won t get so lucky in innings three and four  end 1st rays move ahead rays 2 , phillies 0 8 55 pm it should be noted that the rays , like the phillies on wednesday , are also 0for with runners in scoring position but they ve scored two runs , thanks to two rbi forceouts one of them was from carlos pena , about whom a word is warranted first , is pena separated at birth from colin powell \? second , there are few players in baseball as much of a delight as pena , a longtime prospect who has blossomed in tampa bay he is frightfully friendly , extraordinarily intelligent , and just wonderful to be around i was talking with him in fenway park just minutes after the rays blew their 70 lead to the red sox and lost , 87 , in game 5 of the alcs pena had the maturity to say what an exciting game it really was , at which point i reminded him of pete rose after carlton fisk s home run for boston beat cincinnati in a wild , 76 game 6 in the 1975 world series , rose boarded the bus and was bubbling to his manager , sparky anderson , about what a great game it was anderson was mortified because the reds had lost , but rose realized he had just played in one of the finest games ever pena felt the same way last week i guarantee you , this has to go down as one of the most incredible games in alcs history it has to it has to obviously i wish i were on the winning end of things but let s be objective about it that was an unbelievable game  middle 1st awaiting myers phillies 0 , rays 0 8 37 pm was talking with jimmy rollins on wednesday night \( actually , early thursday thanks , fox \) about what to expect from phillies starter brett myers much has been made about how the emotional myers swallowed a few chill pills during his fourstart demotion to the minors this year , when he remembered how to be more of a strategic starter rather than the blowitby em closer he was a year ago here s what rollins said about what we should look for in the early innings against the rays if he s spotting his fastball , he s gonna be tough if he s getting swings and misses , he s going to be tough if you see them fouling off a lot of pitches , you ll see his pitch count go up , and he s gonna have to go to his other pitches early which still can be tough , because he has a good curveball and has a great split but if he s hitting his spots getting swings and misses , then you re probably going to be looking at a real dominant brett myers  pregame lineup changes 7 50 pm couple of minor lineup changes from game 1 to game 2 , mostly because there are two righthanders starting \( tampa bay s james shields and philadelphia s brett myers \) instead of last night s two lefties but the top five in each lineup are still the same for the phillies , greg dobbs will dh instead of chris coste , and move from eighth to seventh with 3b pedro feliz moving down a spot dobbs is the ultimate platoon player in that he hits righthanders well \( 309940 in 217 atbats \) while almost never facing lefthanders for the rays , as usual cliff floyd will dh and bat sixth instead of willy aybar \( on whom my colleague karen crouse has a fine story today about his battle with alcoholism \) somewhat more surprising is joe maddon s insertion of rocco baldelli in right field to replace ben zobrist baldelli , still dealing with a debilitating mitochondrial disorder , generally has played only against lefties because he has hit them considerably better even though baldelli hit a threerun home run and delivered the gameturning single against the boston red sox in game 7 on sunday night , it seems weird to me for him to play , given that the phillies will be starting a lefty \( jamie moyer \) on saturday it probably says more about how the struggling gabe gross has ceased to be an option than anything else  game 2 hole in shields \? 6 35 pm welcome back to tropicana field , at least as seen via the internet i will be liveblogging the game again , with posts every halfinning , or until my fingerprints rub off for an idea of what you re in for , here s game 1 there are no refunds i have been around the rays for several weeks now , and have been hearing a lot about big game james , as in james shields , tonight s starter for tampa bay in what some \( including evan longoria \) believe is an allbutmustwin there s no question that shields has been the rays most reliable pitcher , at least until matt garza s emergence in the alcs but as much as one must respect shields , who went 148 with a 356 era in the regular season , i m not sure where all this big game business comes from assuming for the moment that the rays never played in any big games before this year at least for them and that you want your ace to stop losing streaks , here is shields s breakdown following rays wins and losses in 2008 after rays win 93 , 277 era after rays lose 45 , 493 era \( first start of season and finalday start when he pitched one inning not included \) shields simply has not stopped losing streaks in fact , he has more often than not prolonged them i would chalk this up to random variance , frankly , but the evidence of biggameness ain t exactly striking there isn t a whole lot for us to go on in these playoffs , where every game is probably big he won game 1 of the al division series against the white sox , but lost his two starts against boston , although he generally pitched well
dallas opponents of teaching evolution , in a natural selection of sorts , have gradually shed those strategies that have not survived the courts over the last decade , creationism has given rise to creation science , which became intelligent design , which in 2005 was banned from the public school curriculum in pennsylvania by a federal judge now a battle looms in over science textbooks that teach evolution , and the wrestle for control seizes on three words none of them are creationism or intelligent design or even creator the words are strengths and weaknesses starting this summer , the state education board will determine the curriculum for the next decade and decide whether the strengths and weaknesses of evolution should be taught the benignsounding phrase , some argue , is a reasonable effort at balance but critics say it is a new strategy taking shape across the nation to undermine the teaching of evolution , a way for students to hear religious objections under the heading of scientific discourse already , legislators in a halfdozen states alabama , florida , louisiana , michigan , missouri and south carolina have tried to require that classrooms be open to views about the scientific strengths and weaknesses of darwinian theory , according to a petition from the discovery institute , the seattlebased strategic center of the intelligent design movement very often over the last 10 years , we 've seen antievolution policies in sheep s clothing , said glenn branch of the national center for science education , a group based in oakland , calif , that is against teaching creationism the strengths and weaknesses language was slipped into the curriculum standards in texas to appease creationists when the state board of education first mandated the teaching of evolution in the late 1980s it has had little effect because evolution skeptics have not had enough power on the education board to win the argument that textbooks do not adequately cover the weaknesses of evolution yet even as courts steadily prohibited the outright teaching of creationism and intelligent design , creationists on the texas board grew to a near majority seven of 15 members subscribe to the notion of intelligent design , and they have the blessings of gov rick perry , a republican what happens in texas does not stay in texas the state is one of the country s biggest buyers of textbooks , and publishers are loath to produce different versions of the same material the ideas that work their way into education here will surface in classrooms throughout the country strengths and weaknesses' are regular words that have now been drafted into the rhetorical arsenal of creationists , said kathy miller , director of the texas freedom network , a group that promotes religious freedom the chairman of the state education board , dr don mcleroy , a dentist in central texas , denies that the phrase is subterfuge for bringing in creationism why in the world would anybody not want to include weaknesses \? dr mcleroy said the word itself is open to broad interpretation if the teaching of weaknesses is mandated , a textbook might be forced to say that evolution has an inability to explain the cambrian explosion , according to the group texans for better science education , which questions evolution the cambrian explosion was a period of rapid diversification that evidence suggests began around 550 million years ago and gave rise to most groups of complex organisms and animal forms scientists are studying how it unfolded evolution as a principle is not disputed in the scientific mainstream , where the term theory does not mean a hunch , but an explanation backed by abundant observation , and where gaps in knowledge are not seen as grounds for doubt but points for future understanding over time , research has strengthened the basic tenets of evolution , especially as advances in molecular genetics have allowed biologists to read the history recorded in the dna of animals and plants yet playing to the american sense of fairness , lawmakers across the country have tried to require that classrooms be open to all views the discovery institute has provided a template for legislators to file academic freedom bills , and they have been popping up with increasing frequency in statehouses across the country in florida , the session ended last month before legislators could take action , while in louisiana , an academicfreedom bill was sent to the house of representatives after passing the house education committee and the state senate in texas , evolution foes do not have to win over the entire legislature , only a majority of the education board they are one vote away dr mcleroy , the board chairman , sees the debate as being between two systems of science you 've got a creationist system and a naturalist system , he said dr mcleroy believes that earth s appearance is a recent geologic event thousands of years old , not 45 billion i believe a lot of incredible things , he said , the most incredible thing i believe is the christmas story that little baby born in the manger was the god that created the universe but dr mcleroy says his rejection of evolution i just do n't think it s true or it s ever happened is not based on religious grounds courts have clearly ruled that teachings of faith are not allowed in a science classroom , but when he considers the case for evolution , dr mcleroy said , it s just not there my personal religious beliefs are going to make no difference in how well our students are going to learn science , he said views like these not only make biology teachers nervous , they also alarm those who have a stake in the state s reputation for scientific exploration serious students will not come to study in our universities if texas is labeled scientifically backward , said dr dan foster , former chairman of the department of medicine at the university of texas southwestern medical center at dallas i'm an orthodox christian , dr foster said , and i do n't want to say that christianity is crazy but science , not scripture , belongs in a classroom , he said to allow views that undermine evolution , he said , puts belief on the same level as scientific evidence dr foster is a veteran of the evolution wars he met with mr perry in 2003 when the strengths and weaknesses argument last appeared , and more recently he worked to oppose an application by the institute for creation research , which supports the teaching of creationism , to award graduate degrees in the state \( it was rejected on april 23 , but the institute has said it will appeal \) this time around , however , scientists like dr foster see more reason for worry although the process might drag on till next spring , a stateappointed committee of science educators has already begun to review the curriculum requirements although the state education board is free to set aside or modify their proposals , committee members will recommend that the strengths and weaknesses phrase be removed , said kevin fisher , a committee member who is against the teaching of creationism when you consider evolution , there are certainly questions that have yet to be answered , said mr fisher , science coordinator for the lewisville independent school district in north texas but , he added , a question that has yet to be answered is certainly different from an alleged weakness mr fisher points to the flaws in darwinian theory that are listed on an antievolution web site , , which is run by texans for better science education many of them are decades old , mr fisher said of the flaws listed they 've all been thoroughly refuted
once again it is time to bid aloha to that sober team of mirthless entertainers , petraeus crocker it s hard to imagine where you could find another pair of such sleepinducing performers i can t look at petraeus his uniform ornamented like a christmas tree with honors , medals and ribbons without thinking of the great mort sahl at the peak of his brilliance he talked about meeting general westmoreland in the vietnam days mort , in a virtuoso display of his uncanny detailed knowledge and memory of such things , recited the lengthy list \( distinguished service medal , croix de guerre with chevron , bronze star , pacific campaign and on and on \) , naming each of the halfacre of decorations , medals , ornaments , campaign ribbons and other fripperies festooning the general s sternum in gaudy display finishing the detailed list , mort observed , very impressive ! adding , if you re twelve \( as speakers , both petraeus and crocker are guilty of unbearable sesquipedalianism , a word wickedly inflicted on me by my englishteaching mother it s one of those words that is what it says from the latin , literally using footandahalflong words we all learned the word for words that sound like what they say like click or pop or boom or hiss but i m sure the mercifully defunct famous writers school surely forbade using the sesqui word and onomatopoeia in the same paragraph \( you can have fun with both of them at your next cocktail party \) but back to our story never in this breathing world have i seen a person clog up and erode his speaking as distinct from his reading with more uhs , ers and ums than poor crocker surely he has never seen himself talking uh , that is uh , a , uh , matter that we , er , um , uh are carefully , uh , considering \( not a parody , an actual crocker sentence and not even the worst \) these harshontheear insertions , delivered in his less than melodious , hoarsesounding tenor , are maddening and their effect is to say that the speaker is painfully unsure of what he wants , er , um , to say if crocker s collection of these broken shards of verbal crockery were eliminated from his testimony , everyone there would get home at least an hour earlier petraeus commits a different assault on the listener and on the language in addition to his own pedantic delivery , there is his turgid vocabulary it reminds you of copspeak , a language spoken nowhere on earth except by cops and firemen when talking to eyewitness news its rule never use a short word where a longer one will do it must be meant to convey some misguided sense of learnedness and scholasticism possibly even that dread thing , intellectualism to their talk sorry , i mean their articulation no crook ever gets out of the car a perpetrator exits the vehicle \( does any cop say to his wife at dinner , honey , i stubbed my toe today as i exited our vehicle \?

traverse city , mich most of the houses on the real estate tour in and around this quaint resort town on lake michigan were in fairly good condition , empty and scrubbed clean of the sort of things that might bring to mind the previous owners the twobedroom on pine grove avenue was a charming cottage , maybe a starter house for a young couple , but who knew \? the ranch on sugar bush road was pristine down to its finished basement , which might have been an office , or a home gym there was no telling , but lots of quiet guessing by the 15 people who paid 5 each to board a packed minibus for three hours last weekend with a real estate agent every house had its back story , and none of them were going to be particularly pleasant this was not a parade of show homes , but rather the repo buyers bus tour , one in a series of such marketing excursions popping up across the country every house on the tour had one thing in common foreclosure the agent , sherry white , cheerful with a binder of the listings in hand , dwelled on the potential for rebirth in the homes not the carcass feeding , as one competitor characterized the appeal of the expedition ms white s tone was matteroffact banks owned the properties , she emphasized as the bus took off , so you 're not kicking anyone out of their home people on the tour also had one thing in common they were looking for deals among the repossessed still , not everyone was entirely comfortable with the cold mission of cashingin on their neighbors' misery \( and it was cold because the electricity had been turned off in most of the homes and the heat was at a minimum \) this feels like walking in a graveyard , said george foster , a local newspaper publisher looking for investment property i felt uncomfortable even coming on this tour for that reason there s a lot of pain in these houses and how they became available ms white said she had so many repossessed properties in her listings that it was just efficient to rent a bus and show them as a group she thought up a theme getting the grass green again the homes ranged in price from the 70 , 000s to the 300 , 000s , and most appeared to be primary residences , not second homes though she had not written up any offers from the tour , she said she was encouraged by the level of interest it s sink or swim in this area , ms white said of the troubled real estate market i decided to build a ship one participant , sandy piotrowski , said the tour was about being pragmatic it s pretty sad that there are so many houses on the market , but it s also a good thing to move these homes , ms piotrowski said in michigan , the unemployment rate has been higher than the national average since september 2000 with job loss has come home loss , only compounded by crisis in the subprime mortgage market census officials estimate that michigan lost 30 , 500 people in the year starting july 2006 , one of only two states \( along with rhode island \) to lose population in that time nevada , california and florida lead the nation in foreclosure rates michigan ranks sixth , with one foreclosure for every 409 households and for its 10 , 957 filings in february \( up 1784 percent from february 2007 \) , according to realtytrac inc , which manages a nationwide database of real estate information an older couple on the tour here were hoping to find a deal on a retirement house a young couple were looking for their first home others were looking just to be looking , and the chatter was about work and family and the weather but every once in a while , emotions buried just beneath the surface cracked through that was the case with the house on greenbrier lane while most of the houses were silent about their pasts , this one seemed to scream its history in the foyer , a trampledover card read happy 1st birthday ! and the walls still showed a child s scrawls in blue crayon hair pins and sweetarts were on the floor in a bedroom the kitchen was filthy , the bathroom unbearable , the garage door broken off the home , a 30yearold , 1 , 400squarefoot bilevel , was listed at 100 , 000 , about 35 , 000 less than its asking price in the spring of 2006 this was its second repossession \( from different owners \) in two years some wondered if it had been trashed deliberately as he walked through shaking his head , richard deskovitz , a retired teacher , asked , can you imagine the rage in someone s mind when they lose their home \? he took a moment to think about it others took shots at dark humor those are the colors you paint the walls when you think the bank s taking over , one person said there were giggles about the bright yellows and greens but others seemed moved by whatever lingered in the cold , dark air back on the warm bus , patty fitzgerald , an attendee who was looking for a retirement home , said of the house on greenbrier lane i do n't like to see that i could n't live in that house it s not like somebody died there , but somebody s heart died there this was the second repo tour for ms fitzgerald and her husband , steve , a retired stockbroker you know when you see the kids' things , the little swing sets in the backyard , remnants of a few broken toys on the carpeting , somebody s family took a dive , ms fitzgerald said somebody had a real hard time that s not a fun thing the fitzgeralds were hoping to see a house whose insides did not display lingering signs of pain but even from the outside , joe steffes , the tour bus driver , has a hard time looking he grew up in this area , has lived here for decades he knows people on these streets just tough times , mr steffes said , sitting in the idling bus outside one house i try not to think about it then it was off to the next address
we continue the series of earlyseason posts from our crew of independent bloggers , following up our partisan survey of the atlantic and northeast divisions with the outlook from america s heartland , that great , pulsing central division bill houlihan of where will the wings finish in the division this year \? i ve suggested to little gary that the wings should be listed with an asterisk atop the central from october forward as in \( clinched division \) i m still awaiting a response on that the best thing about going to a game at your team s rink \? simply being surrounded by an arena full of hockey geniuses is good enough for me i ve found that while carolina and atlanta fans are the most wellread , the hockey iq at the joe is by far the highest in the lower 48 the worst thing about going to a game at your team s rink \? proximity to an errant mikael samuelsson slap shot \? the one rule change that must be made is \? goalies should be fair game if they stray from the crease drill them early and often and if a goalie is three feet in front of the crease and draws an interference penalty \? that has to end  dirk hoag of where will the preds finish in the division this year \? just like every year since the lockout , right behind detroit in second place don t believe the hot air blowing out of the windy city ! the best thing about going to a game at your team s rink \? the atmosphere is raucous , much like college hockey opposing goalies are harassed , cell block 303 leads the crowd with chants , and , oh yeah , goal girls can t forget the goal girls the worst thing about going to a game at your team s rink \? i know this comes as a shock , but the preds don t actually sell out every game we could use more corporate sales to fill out the lower bowl the one rule change that must be made is \? media members proposing rule changes will have their credentials revoked repeat offenders will undergo intensive reeducation with drs george laraques and donald brashear  sarah riegel of where will the jackets finish in the division this year \? third detroit will run away with it again , and chicago will finish second , but st louis will be haunted by legace s palininduced injury and the jackets have to beat nashville someday , dangit the best thing about going to a game at your team s rink \? free parking on the street , chipotle burritos before the game and cheap beer at the r bar after wait , none of those are inside the rink hmm , copious empty seats mean my coat can have its own seat the worst thing about going to a game at your team s rink \? seven years without a sniff of playoff hockey has killed the early enthusiasm for the team so there are too many empty seats and too little atmosphere but as long as i have a seat for my coat the one rule change that must be made is \? i m not convinced more rule changes are what we need unless it s doing away with the shootout and loser point , in which case i m all for it  sean gallagher of where will the blues finish in the division this year \? thanks to the columbus blue nashes , the blues have a chance to avoid the basement fourth in the division and around 11th in the conference is about where they should end up the best thing about going to a game at your team s rink \? we re biased , but our fanrun gameday program \( st louis game night \) is a highlight for a lot of hardcore fans that , a 9 giganto beer and seeing all our friends in the upper bowl is like going home for christmas the worst thing about going to a game at your team s rink \? between the pantsless rat of a mascot , the towel guy who counts up goals and the people who insist on screaming , shoot ! , it s hard to pick one worst item instead , we ll just say , no , mr davidson mr checketts , we can t think of any one thing that isn t great the one rule change that must be made is \? twominute minors used to last for two whole minutes , up until the 1950s let s make all power plays last the entirety of the infraction , regardless of how many goals are scored you re welcome , nhl  chris block of where will the hawks finish in the division this year \? no question they re improved , but the results will be much the same because of a lack of depth and toughness up front and two unmovable , overpriced netminders third place , behind nashville , competing for the eighth spot in the west the best thing about going to a game at your team s rink \? the seats are filled and there s a buzz in the united center again blackhawks fans need not feel ashamed or live in anonymity any longer i can put my lucha libre mask away for at least a year or two the worst thing about going to a game at your team s rink \? an inexplicable bird mascot named tommy hawk ceremonial puck drops for old fourth liners and adam burish fans the one rule change that must be made is \? a ban on bob gainey from attending any future rules meetings
there are two ways to gauge how long it s been since the teenage comedy square pegs ran on cbs the first is historical it was canceled 25 years ago , after only one season the second is sartorial its star , , wore peasant skirts , baggy sweaters and oversize glasses square pegs ran such a long time ago that ms parker , now known for her glamgamine look on sex and the city , actually played a nerd her geek wardrobe is far from the only fascinating aspect of the series , whose entire 19 episodes have been released on dvd whether it was my socalled life last decade or juno last year , high school students in more recent movies and television shows tend to be portrayed as knowing , brooding outsiders obsessed with pop culture no music or movie reference is too obscure to slip past their braces to use the lingo of the series itself , square pegs now looks , like , prescient in a departure from most of the high school series that came before and many that followed , including saved by the bell and beverly hills 90210 square pegs was all about the outsiders the show , created by anne beatts , a former writer , featured ms parker s patty as one of several freshman oddballs desperate to be accepted by the cooler kids at weemawee high lauren \( amy linker \) is saddled with braces \( as well as padding to make her look heavier \) marshall \( john femia \) is a hyperactive chipmunk who longs to be a standup comic , while his friend johnny slash \( merritt butrick \) is a sweet , spacey introvert slash wears pastelcolored shirts and ties , and dyes his hair purple at one point , la the stars of new wave pop , and square pegs borrowed that sound for its declaration of independence from sitcom convention it must be the only network series that used elvis costello and the clash as punch lines and featured a theme song by the waitresses \( best known these days for the offbeat holiday tune christmas wrapping and the deadpan i know what boys like \) at the bat mitzvah of the protoyuppie muffy \( jami gertz \) , the entertainment is supplied by none other than devo the newgeneration touchstones did n't end there in square pegs the '60s and '70s are genuinely over when they are n't fretting over crushes on older boys or the horrors of wearing glasses , patty and her friends make blithe jokes about hippies and the breakup of the beatles a teacher asks his class about watergate and is greeted with blank stares a joke about ronald reagan , then president , is a vaguely affectionate one about popularity and stardom only 17 when the series began , ms parker delivers her laugh lines with the schoolplay smile she later employed on sex and the city when she s rejected by a hunky senior or gives advice to the lovestruck lauren , there are glimpses of a younger , stringbean carrie bradshaw confident yet insecure , creative yet desperate to be part of another , hipper world for all its timeliness , then , why was square pegs doomed \? inconsistency , for one thing the newwave jokes and saturday night live associations , which include strained cameos by bill murray and don novello , are undermined by cardboard characters like tracy nelson s jennifer , an uppity valley girl , and her secondhandstallone boyfriend , vinnie \( jon caliri \) along with the increasingly unwatchable movies of the period that starred snl graduates , square pegs revealed how the sardonic humor of the '70s was becoming compromised the series feels less like a precursor to the nuanced my socalled life and freaks and geeks and more like a preview of cornier , more wholesome sitcoms like hannah montana and zoey 101 another reason for the show s failure to connect with a mass adolescent audience may have been its overdose of popculture references teenagers of the early '80s surely understood jokes about slam dancing , but what did they make of more adult wisecracks about yul brynner , woody allen s funny movies and marlon brando s days as a protester \? it s one thing to make geek outcasts the centerpiece it s another to have them equate their status with attending a jill clayburgh film festival in what turned out to be the final episode , patty and lauren briefly become pals with jennifer and her equally meangirl buddy , ladonna \( claudette wells \) ultimately , though , jennifer spurns the two geek week is officially over , she huffs the quickwitted square pegs was itself rejected , but its legacy amounts to the true revenge of the nerds
gave his players the day off sunday their third break in seven days it was , perhaps , the only way to avoid more selfinflicted damage , on or off the court the past week was truly bewildering and disastrous , even by standards it began with a 23point loss in toronto and ended with a 26point loss in orlando , losses that pushed the knicks \( 1841 \) to a seasonworst 23 games under 500 there was plenty of mayhem and intrigue in between thomas , the knicks' coach and president , talked about needing a third point guard next season an apparent snub of the injured , who has one more year on his contract he declined to elaborate , clarify or commit to marbury eddy curry wondered aloud about his reduced role and rejected thomas s assertion that big men like curry were becoming extinct in the face of widespread speculation that he will be fired at season s end , thomas confidently asserted , i 'll be here this summer when questions about his future became uncomfortable , thomas abruptly cut short an interview session the daily news reported that thomas would remain as the coach but be replaced as the team president the new york post reported that marbury had been effectively banished from home games by thomas both cited unnamed sources and curry , perhaps summing up the team s mental state and the franchise s culture , blamed the news media for the knicks' calamitous season i think this season could have very easily gone the other way if we could have just stayed together a little and not let the media tear us apart , curry told reporters before the knicks' loss in atlanta on friday but i think we 're doing a good job right now of sticking together with little else to play for , the knicks seem ready to enter the recriminations portion of the season they have 7 weeks and 23 games remaining , and virtually no chance of making the playoffs the knicks' next loss will guarantee a seventh straight losing season , including five with thomas as the team president and two as the coach that defeat is almost certain to come this week , when the knicks play four tough games in six nights at madison square garden the resurgent new orleans hornets arrive monday , followed by the cleveland cavaliers , the detroit pistons and the portland trail blazers when the homestand is over , the knicks will fly to dallas for a date with the mavericks we 've just got to keep learning and we 've got to keep growing , thomas said saturday night , although it was difficult to see much of either the loss in orlando was the knicks' third by 20 points or more in six games , and their eighth of the season the knicks competed well for about a quarter and a half before falling apart , and they never made a legitimate charge in the second half friday s 6point loss at atlanta was perhaps more telling the knicks had the lead with 80 seconds to play but failed to score again while the hawks got three clutch plays from mike bibby the veteran point guard they acquired at the trade deadline the knicks got none from their guards thomas has been searching for a steady leader at point guard ever since he came to new york , or at least since the moment he realized marbury was not the answer the search will resume this summer , whether thomas is running the franchise or not , and regardless of whether marbury is traded , waived or retained a few weeks ago , it seemed there were three ways the knicks could become relevant or compelling in the season s final months with a major trade , a major winning streak or a dismissal of thomas but the trade deadline has passed , a winning streak of any length seems improbable , and thomas is still standing the only intrigue remaining is what thomas will say or do next i admire the players' commitment and their courage to stick in and keep competing , he said saturday , because they have n't given up yet on sunday , thomas gave them their third day off in a week
it s one of the oldest formulas in the record business , but some things never go out of style take a dozen or two of the biggest radio hits and bundle them as a handy , snapshotofthemoment compilation one series of such albums , now that s what i call music ! , has been a reliable blockbuster for 10 years by sticking to a simple , recognizable brand with a festive , uniform design aimed at the young , especially tween girls , the now cds each contain 20 charttopping hits britney spears has been featured 12 times and its 28 volumes have sold 61 million copies in the united states if you had an artist who could put out three records a year , none of which sold less than one million , you 'd have the best artist in the world , said bob mercer , the general manager of now , a joint venture of emi , universal and sony and that s all we have new entries in the series come out like clockwork three times a year , and routinely open in the top 5 of the billboard album chart but now , which began in britain 25 years ago and on tuesday celebrated its first decade in the united states with the release of two albums now vol 29 , with pink , pussycat dolls , lil wayne and 17 others , as well as a 10year retrospective is not immune to the souring music market overall album purchases in september and october were off 20 percent from the same period last year , and lately firstweek now sales have been about half what they were a few years ago the last two volumes have not cracked one million in sales , according to nielsen soundscan to offset this decline , the executives behind the albums are expanding the basic product line they have introduced a series of supplemental cds , like now that s what i call country , and are moving into an array of media new cds will allow access to a web site featuring acts below the usual superstar radar , and a deal with dada , a cellphoneservices company , will offer extra promotion of songs and ringtones from now artists in addition , the now team is in talks to create a network television show to highlight its acts , according to people close to the negotiations who were not authorized to speak now executives declined to comment on plans for a television show , but acknowledged that the new projects are part of a broad effort to stem losses we 're trying to make up for lost volume in the marketplace , mr mercer said once a crowded and lucrative field , compilations of hits exemplified by ktel s original hits by the original artists albums advertised on television beginning in the late 1960s have lost much of their appeal in the age of the la carte download , when consumers can pick their favorites and avoid the cost of a full album despite this , now has held on to unusual prominence , and artists and record label executives say it still packs significant promotional power they sell so many of those things , said darius rucker of hootie and the blowfish , whose recent solo country song , do n't think i do n't think about it , is on now vol 29 you get a lot of people who buy them for one or two songs , but might not know your tunes you hope to get a wider audience from it part of the series s appeal , for consumers and record labels , is its consistency a small staff works on the project full time , and many have been involved since the beginning jeff moskow of universal , who has compiled each entry since vol 4 in 2000 , said the albums were designed for immediate recognition by people who wanted to keep up with new music or could simply use a good party mix to qualify for the albums , a song must be successful on radio and the singles charts , but there is no strict formula , he added and while there is no quota for the labels that contribute the music , the partners in the joint venture have priority there is a great percentage of consumers who do n't necessarily plug their ipod into their car stereo , who do not make their own playlists , mr moskow said they rely on now' to do that for them the albums are programmed to resemble the mix of a dj , with barely a breath between the tracks and a scripted flow of energy from song to song the fastest and most aggressive come first , with ballads somewhere in the middle if there s a country song , it usually comes at the end although the albums can be downloaded from itunes , amazoncom and other services \( most of the time only as a complete album \) , now that s what i call music ! has remained focused on consumers who favor physical cds , as has kidz bop , a series for children that is similarly consistent and popular despite market share lost to downloads legal and illegal , cds still account for about 80 percent of all albums sold , according to the recording industry association of america a cd is sort of an ideal purchase for a family they buy it and listen to it in the car , said cliff chenfeld , an owner of razor tie , the label behind kidz bop they like a physical cd that is colorful and packaged well pursuing an audience still attached to cds has resulted in a bifurcated demographic for now , mr mercer said at one end is girls ages 8 to 13 , who may be too young to purchase music online at the other is women 24 to 40 , most of whom , according to now research , buy now cds for themselves , not their children it s a shortcut device for them to know what s going on in a world they had left 9 or 10 years earlier , mr mercer said of the women who buy now or they have children and they want to know what s going on in their children s world both age groups are reached through commercials on cable television , as well as placement at stores the albums are often an impulse buy and do well at bigbox retailers like walmart and target when the american version of now began , the major labels were reluctant to license songs to it because they feared it would cannibalize existing sales , said tom corson , general manager of the rca music group with quality control and aggressive marketing it has proved a success , he said , outlasting competitors like totally hits , which ran from 1999 to 2006 despite that success , and its increased promotion , now remains tied to the overall fortunes of the cd format , which in 2007 lost 175 percent of its market sales from the previous year there s a type of consumer that still buys physical , and they 're primed for this , mr corson said the now series , he added , will last to the extent that the physical market exists
it was startling for the yankees on thursday when alan horne , one of the team s best pitching prospects , had to leave his start for class aaa scranton wilkesbarre after two innings with a biceps injury it turns out that the injury is not too severe horne had a magnetic resonance imaging exam and was found to have a strained biceps muscle he will report to tampa and be shut down for a week , but the yankees are not concerned about longterm damage to horne , who had reconstructive elbow surgery in college it s not a rotator cuff , not a labrum , not a medial collateral ligament it s none of the stuff that concerns you as a longterm issue , said mark newman , the senior vice president for player personnel it s a pulled muscle not connective tissue , not the stuff that causes problems horne , 25 , was the pitcher of the year in the eastern league last season when he went 124 with a 311 earned run average for class aa trenton
portland , ore there is little zach randolph can do now , short of realigning the stars , space and time , to validate the trade that sent him to new york last june the are too disjointed and their defeats too voluminous , for anyone to change impressions at this point but randolph had a chance friday , for one evening , to reclaim a little lost pride and perhaps make isiah thomas look a little better the knicks expected to play the portland trail blazers , randolph s former team , without the services of eddy curry , who was ill that meant randolph would probably have the frontcourt to himself , and all the lowpost touches he could desire it was randolph s scoring lust that created friction with his old team in the first place , and made it easier to trade him for two marginal players the blazers , who have surged in randolph s absence , are confident they made the right move in obtaining channing frye and steve francis \( whom they later waived \) in exchange for randolph thomas , the knicks' coach and president , also insists he made the right move , although his team s winning percentage suggests otherwise when we traded steve , we were n't getting a lot out of him , thomas said and giving up channing , we gave up a quality player and a quality person , a young player who i think is going to have a tremendous career we got back a player who s already developed , who s already putting up 20 and 10 every night so on paper , i thought it was a good trade for both teams and winningwise , we 've had our difficulties , but it has n't been because of zach the knicks headed into friday s game with a 1431 record , including an 03 mark on this fivegame trip the blazers were 2619 and in contention for a playoff berth in the western conference , despite a very young lineup but thomas suggested the trade had nothing to do with the two franchises' divergent fortunes i think had we not made the trade and everything that s gone on within our season still occurred , we 'd still be struggling , he said none of this has anything to do with zach thomas said that randolph , who was averaging 17 points and 103 rebounds , had done everything that we thought he would do , in terms of scoring and rebounding the basketball he s been great in the low post he s lived up to my expectations frye , the no 8 pick in the 2005 draft , did not live up to expectations as a potential franchise player with the knicks , and has been a role player with portland thomas indicated that frye could one day post the same kind of statistics as randolph when channing develops , he 'll be a guy that can get 20 points and 10 rebounds , thomas said so we 've got that now renaldo balkman was apologetic and defiant as he returned from his onegame suspension balkman said he was sorry for decking the lakers' sasha vujacic with an elbow to the chin in tuesday s loss to los angeles but he called the contact unintentional i was pulling the ball across my face to drive to the middle , balkman said and he came into me it was an accident hitting him in the face i was creating space and he came up to me the play was ruled a personal foul at the time , but it was upgraded to a seconddegree flagrant foul when the nba reviewed it the next day balkman said he was kind of shocked when the league suspended him for wednesday s game in utah it was n't no flagrant foul , said balkman , who planned an appeal to recover his lost pay he accused vujacic , who scored 20 points in the game \( 12 in the fourth quarter \) of acting a bit i do n't think i hit him that hard , balkman said i think he exaggerated a lot he gets hit , all of a sudden he s hurt , and then he goes out there and gets a career high that can tell you a lot right there no knicks players were selected as reserves for the allstar game , extending the team s drought to seven years isiah thomas said he was disappointed but did not try to argue that any knicks were deserving of the honor asked if he had any future allstars in the locker room , thomas said i think we have some that eventually will be that but they 're not that now asked to name them , thomas said with a coy grin , when they 're picked , i 'll let you know eddy curry and quentin richardson skipped the morning shootaround because of flulike symptoms and were listed as doubtful for the game both players tried to play through the illness wednesday night in utah , but were forced to leave the game early
it was a night for parkas and wool caps and chattering teeth , which could have been tolerated had the home team played crisply , not turned every inning into an adventure better suited for a comic book the and their fans , then , had plenty of reasons to be displeased poor pitching , two errors , a scarcity of clutch hitting after a dispiriting 104 loss to the lastplace on monday night at shea stadium but nothing the mets did left anyone as riled up as nelson figueroa was after what he called unprofessional behavior by those in the opposing dugout it was the third inning , and the nationals had the bases loaded in the washington dugout , a few players , led by elijah dukes , started clapping rhythmically to try to unnerve figueroa , who had walked nick johnson to force in a run figueroa retired the next two batters and looked over toward them , clapping in his glove as he neared the mets' dugout , he lifted his arms over his shoulders and gave a mock cheer they were cheerleading in the dugout like a bunch of softball girls , figueroa , the losing pitcher , said i'm a professional , just like anybody else i take huge offense to that if that s what a lastplace team needs to do to fire themselves up , so be it i think you need to show a little bit more class , a little bit more professionalism they won tonight , but again , in the long run , they are who they are in the washington clubhouse , dukes said , it was funny , kind of softballish , but lastings milledge , the former met , gave a more expansive answer when told that figueroa was offended by their actions what were we supposed to do \? milledge said we 're not supposed to cater to anybody on the opposing team we 're not going to cater to him or anybody else whatever we 've been down the last couple of days , so we want to get something going if he do n't like it , then he s got to deal with it if anybody do n't like it , then they got to just deal with it the mets have answered more questions than they care to acknowledge about a burgeoning rivalry with the phillies or a fading one with the braves , all while one with the pesky nationals has simmered they had a benchclearing skirmish with them two years ago , when jos guill n charged pedro mart nez , and the nationals marched into shea stadium last september , during the final throes of the mets' collapse , and swept them in three games the faces , naturally , have changed , with brian schneider and ryan church switching teams , just as paul lo duca and milledge have joined the nationals washington , coming off being swept at home by florida , has scored at least 10 runs three times this season , twice against the mets the nationals snapped a 33 tie in the fifth by scoring three off figueroa , who surrendered six runs and five walks while hitting two in five innings they added four in the sixth off his successor , jorge sosa , who gave up four hits , including a tworun double to none other than milledge the game was played in 54degree temperatures accompanied by 20mileanhour winds and conditions described beforehand by manager willie randolph as more like early april or late september or late january for the fifth time in six games , the mets had more than 10 hits but they were frustrated by the lefthander odalis p rez , who added insult to insult by going 3 for 3 with two runs batted in trouble mounted in the fifth , when with two outs and johnson on first , figueroa walked the no 7 hitter rob mackowiak to bring up jes s flores we 've done a lot of that this year , when it comes down to it , randolph said we , as a staff , have done a poor job of getting through the seventh , eighth and ninth hitters it s so important to put those guys away flores , naturally , drilled a tworun double , putting washington ahead , 53 , and p rez followed by scoring flores with a sharp single to right throughout the inning , the bullpen remained silent , as if randolph were somehow willing figueroa on to finish the inning , which he did on his 108th pitch on his way back this time , figueroa did not look over he was upset , taking the blame for the walk to mackowiak , the walk to this guy , that guy and every other guy , hitting flores , pitcher getting three hits the nationals in the dugout proved just as bothersome to figueroa inside pitch although willie randolph said they were still evaluating their options , the mets seem set to push back johan santana s start by a day so he can pitch friday at yankee stadium , where he has excellent career statistics , and keep mike pelfrey in position to start thursday against the nationals pedro mart nez \( strained left hamstring \) is scheduled to pitch a simulated game wednesday in port st lucie , fla he will probably need to pitch at least one more time before beginning a minor league rehabilitation assignment matt wise , who flew to new york last wednesday expecting to be activated from the disabled list , returned to port st lucie to stay fresh as the mets ponder how to create room for him in the bullpen the mets are leaning toward starting the lefthander adam bostick on wednesday
washington bob marley , ganja smoking and dreadlocks are here how could they not be in what is billed as the first exhibition about the rastafari ever mounted in a major museum \? reggae , the ceremonial smoking of marijuana , and tightly coiled locks of hair could hardly be omitted when the smithsonian s national museum of natural history devotes a show to this jamaicanborn subculture most of us , in fact , know of rastafari only through these popular manifestations but what is rastafari \? is it a religion \? a way of life \? a political movement \? all of the above , as this exhibition demonstrates discovering rastafari ! reveals far more about rastafarian culture than familiar symbols and the show s modest size might suggest admittedly , the exhibition does not quite feel at home , squirreled away to the side before you enter a large , permanent show devoted to african cultures and peoples that is as bloated as this one is constricted and of course the rastafari exhibition does not really belong in the same museum as paleontological finds and collections of insects and gems that placement is a relic of the 19thcentury conception of the natural history museum as a temple devoted to exotic natural cultures and objects evolutionary predecessors of the scientific west yet the curator and anthropologist john p homiak spent years condensing his knowledge of the rastafari into this show , while also consulting with nearly a score of believers and cultural leaders it tells the story of a local folk religion that began almost 80 years ago with the belief that haile selassie the 20thcentury ethiopian emperor was the living god , the black messiah it grew to become an international movement , yet one that still has no central authority and no codified sacred texts as small as this exhibition is , there are enough history and material here to spur curiosity and wonder but there is enough omitted so that eventually you see how partial and partly skewed an interpretation the show represents as the exhibition points out , rastafari beliefs grew out of a particular experience slavery and its aftermath in jamaica and a particular view of how that suffering might be overcome in this case hardship was ameliorated by a hope adapted from the biblical dream of zion , that someday blacks might return to a land from which they were exiled ethiopia maps from the 17th and 18th centuries on display show that the country s name was broadly used to refer to the entire african continent , but there are also biblical references to a particular kingdom princes shall come out of egypt , a psalm proclaims ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto god in jamaica the stretching of the hands began as early as the 18th century and reached far as the show describes , these ideas were amplified by the charismatic , jamaicanborn black leader marcus garvey , who in the 1920s urged all blacks to see themselves in a common struggle he wanted them to view everything through a shared vision , to worship god through the spectacles of ethiopia he also predicted that a black savior would emerge from africa but until that happened , he worked as if none would appear he founded the united negro improvement association \( which had two million international members by 1919 \) and created the newspaper negro world \( which had a halfmillion circulation \) then , as if satisfying that prophet s expectations , ethiopia s prince regent , tafari makonnen , who had the honorific title ras , meaning head of an army , was crowned emperor of ethiopia garvey called on his followers to join together and lift up the hand of emperor ras tafari garvey did not foresee the kind of religion that would develop out of his messianic vision of ras tafari , who as emperor was renamed haile selassie \( which , in the ethiopian language amharic , means power of the trinity \) selassie , tracing his own lineage back to king solomon , was also not a modest man his official titles included king of kings , conquering lion of the tribe of judah and light of the world but by all accounts , he was also a brilliant speaker and statesman in 1935 , when he was leading a fight against mussolini s invasion of his country , he became a world figure , and he was crowned time magazine s man of the year in 1936 for a small group of ethiopian believers in jamaica , all this simply confirmed selassie s divinity and the fulfillment of prophecies the exhibition , though , becomes too abbreviated at this crucial moment it pays brief attention to leonard howell , sometimes called the first rastafari , who founded the first rastafari commune in jamaica in 1940 mr howell advocated a return to ethiopia and handed out postcard passports to his followers mysterious and allusive books like the holy piby unified black believers and then , in the show s narrative , came the gradual growth of this marginal movement , which gained in stature during the 1966 visit of selassie to jamaica the emperor pushed the eccentric religion into the mainstream , inviting its leaders to state receptions and handing out gold medals to figures who were , until then , widely scorned what selassie did in the political realm , marley did in the cultural realm , giving rastafari ideas worldwide distribution the exhibition celebrates those ideas there are examples here of folk art portraying selassie , and samplings of the decentralized religion s many subcultures and mansions organizations reflecting various versions of the belief there are also widely shared ideas , including a restricted diet called ital , avoiding meats and nonganja intoxicants and the spread of rastafari is illustrated with examples of communities in ethiopia formed by believers who settled there , and by rastafari groups flourishing even in japan but something strange happens in the midst of this narrative rastafari belief starts to seem almost sunny in nature , its messages homogenized into blandness the highly patriarchal beliefs of the rastas get only passing mention the ceremonial use of marijuana is invoked by a small textual panel and by highlighting selassie s speeches at the beginning of the exhibition , with their proclamations of universal brotherhood , the show makes it seem as if those ideas were fundamental to rastafari belief actually , the history is far darker , more disturbing and more intriguing in a recent book , rastafari from outcasts to culture bearers \( oxford \) , ennis barrington edmonds points out just how fierce the charismatic figures were who founded the movement mr howell , mr edmonds points out , recruited his first followers by advocating violence against whites and arguing for the superiority of the african race in the 1930s he preached that they should also withdraw their allegiance from the british crown his commune was subject to police raids , and he was jailed twice he was ultimately committed to a mental hospital , believing himself the incarnation of christ one of the key doctrines of rastafari was beating down babylon babylon was the metaphorical name given for european power , white man s culture , the established church and even the police this racist and radical notion plays no role in the exhibition , though histories of the movement in the rastafarians by leonard e barrett sr or a rastafari reader , chanting down babylon give it an important place this rebellious and hostile energy is the flip side of the devotional worship of selassie and his representation of black political power rastafari belief developed partly out of resentment , not just against whites , but against the black middleclass culture of jamaica this was one reason the oncedisreputable style of dreadlocks and the ceremonial smoking of marijuana became so important this opposition , in a subtler way , inspired the movement s wit and strangeness , and its playful provocations it helps explain rastafari beliefs , the kind of enmity they inspired , and the extent of the transformation in more recent decades as rastafari became more mainstream this is not apparent in the show it is almost as if it were reluctant to give any hint of something that could n't be universally hailed and it leaves unclear how much of the original racist conception remains some of this difficulty may grow out of mr homiak s admiration for the culture he has studied but part of it has the characteristic of many museum shows that begin , as this one boasts of doing , with an advisory team of cultural leaders that was consulted on all details of the exhibition to ensure that it communicates the most important aspects of rastafari to the public this is pandering and promotion , not scholarship , and it mars what could have been an even more fascinating show
10 59 pm wrapup with all this broken china on the floor , it s hard to know where to start picking up the pieces mrs clinton and mr obama showed themselves pretty adept at hurling plates , then reaching into the cabinet and pulling out cups and saucers too the audience looked none too happy , and it s not clear what effect this debate will have on saturday s primary here in south carolina but mrs clinton was not playing to the room , or , possibly , even to the state even when she was booed , which happened a couple of times , she pressed on , relentlessly , against mr obama she gave the air of being perfectly comfortable in attack mode \( has she ceded south carolina \? \) mr obama gave \( almost \) as good as he got , especially in taking on not only mrs clinton but bill clinton perhaps with an eye on the huge africanamerican vote here , he said that the attacks on him showed that a black man had become a credible candidate mr edwards turned out to be something of an honest broker tonight he sided with mrs clinton more than we ve seen in the past , but not totally , hitting her hard on one of his pet issues that she would be beholden to corporate lobbyists overall , he was relaxed and forceful and not so angry again , it s not clear that this debate changed anything in the big picture , except to provide more grist for the republicans full debate transcript 10 04 pm last question a bizarre last question why , if martin luther king jr was alive , should he endorse you \? mr edwards says because he s been fighting poverty mr obama says dr king wouldn t endorse any of them , but he would ask the american people to hold them accountable mrs clinton s answer is a little hard to decipher , but she seems to be trying to counter a previous argument that got her into so much trouble a few weeks back , when she suggested it took lbj to realize mlk s dreams she says now she wants to do what i can to make his legacy real so the night ends on that anticlimactic note 10 01 pm more on electability mr obama notes that in nevada , he attracted independents and some republicans don t assume that we can t reach out to people of all persuasions , he says mrs clinton says if mr mccain is the nominee , the general election will be about national security and she is best able to make that argument mr edwards says he s best , but turns the moment into a question to mrs clinton about accepting money from corporate lobbyists she says he s drawing artificial distinctions about not taking money from lobbyists while taking it from relatives of lobbyists and at some point this gets really hard to take now she and mr edwards get into a back and forth he says when somebody gives you millions and millions of dollars , they expect something she says trial lawyers have given him millions and millions of dollars sort of interesting to listen to the democrats talk about how they will take on john mccain 9 52 pm electability mr edwards predicts that john mccain will be the republican nominee ! he says the democrats need to nominate someone who can beat mr mccain across the country , not only in big urban areas but rural areas mr edwards and mr obama continue their side joke about how being a white male is such an oddity in this campaign 9 48 pm the bill question mrs clinton was asked if her husband was overshadowing her she calls him a tremendous asset and shifts into mechanical mode , not answering the question mr obama says he doesn t begrudge mr clinton and that he would expect mr clinton to campaign vigorously on her behalf as an expresident , mr obama says , mr clinton gets outsized attention he veers back into saying that mr clinton is misrepresenting his record , then , responding to mrs clinton s comments on what it takes to stand up to the republicans , calls for a new kind of politics 9 37 pm change of tone now they re friends ! tempers have definitely cooled since they all took a seat mr obama was asked if bill clinton was our first black president , as the author toni morrison had said , and he gave a warm and gracious answer that suggests maybe there can be healing out there somewhere he said mr clinton did have an enormous affinity with the africanamerican community and still does he said he was inspired by people like mr clinton and mr edwards who grew up in the segregated south but can change bill clinton embodies that and he deserves credit for that , he says , to applause then he added a very funny line i have to investigate more bill s dancing abilities before i could judge whether in fact he was a brother 9 32 pm moving beyond divisions mrs clinton works in the fact that she had gone to work for the children s defense fund out of college , trying to erase the lingering aftertaste of mr obama s charge that she was a corporate lawyer with walmart mr obama says the country wants to move beyond old divisions and notes that the contest has a woman , an africanamerican , and john mr edwards has a goodnatured look on his face like , what is this with these white man jokes \? they laugh 9 23 pm round two they re sitting down now , and this next part is starting off a little more relaxed mr obama has a funny moment , in talking about how each demographic will vote in their selfinterest , and noting that mr edwards is trying to get white males 9 14 pm commercial break ! as we head into a commercial break , wolf blitzer is promising us no rules in the next half of the debate was he listening during the first half \? 9 10 pm palate cleanser mr edwards is having a pretty good night maybe his 4percent showing in nevada has liberated him in some fashion he s looser than usual , and as we said before , without a dog in the fight , he s coming across as an impartial observer he s kind of a palate cleanser 9 05 pm health care mrs clinton is on fire on the topic of universal health care , truly universal , unlike mr obama s plan , which , she says , will leave out 15 million people it s a core democratic principle , she declares , one that she will go to the mat for she s fierce on this topic , and making a flatout play for the traditional democratic voters who have supported her so far in the democratic primaries it s called playing to the base she s also pounding mr obama in the process 8 50 pm letting it all out this has turned into a major confrontation , an unspooling of the months of oppo research done by each campaign , and it is hard to see how mr obama and mrs clinton ever patch this up for those of you who ever thought that one of them would choose the other as his or her vp , it s time to recalculate one possible lesson don t get into a fight with the clintons as mrs clinton said during her back and forth with mr obama , she knows how to take the incoming she s taken it for 16 years for better or worse , mr obama was less comfortable on the attack 8 49 pm edwards steps in mr edwards is assuming the role of honest broker here , suggesting he s out of the game himself but he but presses mr obama on why he voted present so many times in the illinois legislature mr obama says most of these votes didn t have political consequences 8 47 pm responsiblity the bankruptcy bill is now their vehicle for making accusations against each other and mrs clinton accuses mr obama of doing the bidding of the insurance companies on health care it is very difficult having a straight up debate with you because you never take responsibility , she says , drawing huge boos from the audience for the first time he suggests she will do anything to get elected 8 39 pm getting warmed up they are unloading everything they ve kept under wraps so far hmm , think there s a lot at stake here \? we need to get the transcript here , but it seems that mrs clinton was careful to point to mr obama s comments about republicans , as opposed to ronald reagan but he says she referred to his comments about president reagan mr obama says he said that reagan had been able to get democrats to vote against their economic interests \( which isn t exactly what he had said \) mr obama then slams her with a remark he seems to have been saving for a while while he was a community organizer , he says , she was a corporate lawyer sitting on the board of walmart mrs clinton brings up antoin rezko for the first time , a chicago businessman who has pleaded not guilty to federal influencepeddling and bank fraud charges mr rezko has raised money for mr obama over the years mr obama s campaign said yesterday it is giving charity more than 40 , 000 in past political contributions tied to mr rezko a lot more squabbling back and forth she defends her husband and when wolf blitzer , the moderator , tries to get the conversation back on the rails , she says , we re just getting warmed up if you missed this exchange , be prepared to see it hundreds of times between now and november 8 30 pm it s on mr obama is really irritated about a set of assertions made by senator clinton as well as her husband that are not factually accurate mrs clinton hits back hard , probably the hardest she has in these debates throughout this campaign she says records and words matter as soon as mr obama is confronted on his record , she says , he says that s not what he meant she bring up his recent comments about republicans and said he had said he really liked their ideas \( which isn t exactly what he had said \) this whole thing suddenly spins out of control this is a slugfest that is spiraling downward fast mr edwards is finally allowed to jump in , reminding everyone that there are three people in this debate , not two we ll recap as soon as we can 8 20 pm more mill mr edwards s father is actually in the audience , and the candidate gets some mileage out of his personal story mr obama credits mr edwards for his powerful story 8 16 pm money money money the first question is about the economy and how much money each candidate s plan would put in the pockets of the average taxpayer mrs clinton seems relieved that it is not about her husband we will have money for rebates , she says , without specifying how much mr obama takes the opportunity for a mild swipe at mrs clinton , saying he s glad she s talking about rebates because that was not part of her original plan mr edwards focuses on longterm solutions and mentions creating jobs in south carolina , but mr obama beat him to bringing up the mills , \( where , he notes , mr edwards s father worked , in case you hadn t heard \) 8 04 pm say cheese cnn likes to show viewers the photoop before the debate the cnn suits have told us that they think this format is more welcoming to viewers , so they don t feel like they re coming in the middle of a discussion 8 01 pm bring em out oh boy , back with the walkon entrances of the candidates , one by one no bounce in their step tonight 7 59 pm live from the palace hi everybody well , as if the democratic candidates haven t seen enough of each other lately , they re getting ready for another debate tonight , at the palace theatre in myrtle beach we re nearby in charleston , where we re thankful that the tv is inside it s freezing outside given the tensions of the last several days , and given that the debate is cosponsored by the congressional black caucus , and given that today is martin luther king s birthday do you think issues of race will come up \? viewers were annoyed during the last democratic debate when the moderators kept asking questions about race but somehow , this seems unavoidable tonight another big question tonight will bill clinton actually be at the table \? or just in the air \? we ll see tune in to cnn for the twohour debate and watch along with us related article issues take back seat at debate as obama and clinton tangle

the 12th triple crown champion , tagliaferri and his clients have experienced in 15 months the kind of success most horse people spend a lifetime chasing unsuccessfully the colt is undefeated , has earned more than 27 million in purses and is set to stand as a stallion in a deal worth at least 60 million , or perhaps as much as 120 million if he wins the triple crown iavarone has been the face of big brown s human connections , an oftenlargerthanlife crew that includes the brash trainer but tagliaferri , an investor who for more than 40 years has gravitated toward what he calls very vanilla propositions , had the vision that put them in the limelight , even while he stayed out of it since march 2007 , clients of tag virgin islands have invested more than 25 million in ieah for a 60 percent stake in its racing stables tagliaferri conceded that it was an unorthodox investment for a company that handles more than 300 million none of this would have been possible had it not been for a social encounter a couple of years ago at a yankees game , where iavarone pitched ieah s vision of a 23 , 000squarefoot , 17 million ruffian equine medical center as a potential investment tagliaferri was intrigued in 2007 , more than 154 billion was bet on horses in north america , more than 11 billion in purses was distributed and more than 12 billion was spent purchasing thoroughbreds , according to the jockey club this was a business unrecognized on wall street , but very much like wall street , said tagliaferri , 68 , whose firm first opened in 1983 in connecticut , before moving to st thomas in 2006 it s impacted by some of the same characteristics that drives commodities like gold it s risky , but biotechs can be riskier than horses , and believe me i 've seen biotechs of mine go down iavarone , 37 , and his copresident , rich schiavo , meanwhile , believed they had proved to be exceptional judges of horseflesh with a solid business model go out and buy proven horses , preferably off the beaten path , and run them at the highest levels it was , however , an expensive model so , on behalf of his clients , tagliaferri structured the financing on a perhorse basis with an option to collect interest or become a shareholder in ieah we were keeping our heads above water putting partnerships together , but we did n't have enough money to keep large pieces for the company , iavarone said we exploded when jim gave us the money to grow their arrangement was successful almost immediately iavarone purchased the sprinter benny the bull for 900 , 000 after a minor stakes victory in iowa , and he has gone on to win 18 million in purses and increase his value as a stallion to beyond 10 million kip deville was bought for 525 , 000 after a stakes victory in texas he has won 26 million in purses , including a victory in the breeders' cup mile that has increased his stud value to as much as 20 million before getting into business with ieah , tagliaferri said he was aware of iavarone s past work history , which included a fine and suspension for making unauthorized trades at the a r baron co brokerage firm , now defunct he also knew that iavarone had sold penny stocks , and was not the highprofile investment banker on wall street that he has portrayed himself to be what i was , what i am betting on , is mike s track record , tagliaferri said i have guys on wall street that have n't performed as well as him tagliaferri is in the process of getting a 20 million insurance policy on iavarone , underscoring the value that tagliaferri places on his partner tagliaferri said he believed that the fundamentals of a 100 million horse fund were in place ieah is setting up an investment committee , which , along with iavarone and his team of bloodstock agents , would act as a research and development component he said the biggest innovation would be the quarterly appraisal of the fund s value , which would allow investors to get in and out and instead of one horse , you 'd have many horses just like when you are holding a range of stocks , tagliaferri said iavarone said the company had developed a broodmare band of highquality fillies and at least two potentially highclass stallions , benny the bull and kip deville we 'd continue to buy proven horses , iavarone said , but we 'd be generating stallion fees , and selling their progeny at auction sales those are two steady streams of revenue when breeding farms came calling after big brown s victory in the , ieah turned down a 30 million offer for half of his stallion rights from the europeanbased coolmore while big brown is not a part of the projected fund , he is a goldembossed brochure promoting ieah credentials as successful horse speculators still , iavarone says none of this is about the money , though there is a great deal involved to prove it , he promises that win or lose , as long as big brown comes out of the belmont healthy , the colt will race for the remainder of his 3yearold year he is more than a hedge horse , he said he is a great one we believe he is the best horse in the world right now , iavarone said , and we 're going to prove it

for some of this year s davis cup teams , like israel s and south korea s , the wait to rejoin the world group has often seemed interminable but patrick mcenroe and the americans cannot quite believe they are being asked to play again so soon people keep saying , did n't you just win the davis cup \? ' said mcenroe , the united states captain i ca n't tell you how many times i 've heard that in the last few weeks mcenroe was speaking by telephone from vienna , where his newly crowned championship team , which defeated russia in portland , ore , in december , will put their title back on the line this weekend against two hostile elements the austrians and a heavy , indoorclay surface still , austria on the road is hardly the roughest assignment available that booby prize surely went to britain , whose reward for returning to the 16team world group was a trip to buenos aires to face david nalbandian and his argentine fans , some of whom still remember the falklands war to make matters more discouraging , the only murray on the british roster is jamie murray , a doubles specialist his younger brother andy , britain s top player by far , chose not to make the journey , citing concern about preventing a wrist injury it s a shame he decided it was best for him not to come here , jamie murray told the guardian it kind of affects the way we feel about him i think from what i 've heard he has n't actually said that he was injured , it was more of a preventive thing if he really wanted to push himself , he really could have come here to play the tie such absences are , of course , nothing new the top players have been blowing hot and chilly on the davis cup since jimmy connors was in power in the 1970s roger federer and rafael nadal are much more accommodating , but neither will be involved in this weekend s festivities federer has said no to the opening round for the last three years to keep his mind and body fresh for regular tournaments he participated in the world group playoffs in september , but he could not keep switzerland in the top group nadal is following federer s lead by declining to play \( on red clay , no less \) in spain s firstround matchup in peru , whose team , led by the veteran luis horna and not much more , is making its world group debut when is enough going to be enough for them really \? mcenroe said of the international tennis federation , which organizes the davis cup it s not a us problem anymore it used to be , well , it s just the us now , it s just about every other country except us no roger no nadal no murray you think murray s really hurt \? give me a break if mcenroe sounds irritated , he is much more inclined toward diplomacy than his older brother john , mcenroe has gradually grown more frustrated in his eight years as captain and he now is sounding off from the bully pulpit provided by the united states' first davis cup title on his watch i do n't know what else to do at this stage , he said what mcenroe still wants , even with his cherished cup in hand , is a format change that will allow promotion of the game s premier team event well in advance , perhaps transforming the final into a global happening instead of a local shouting point who outside portland and russia cared about the final \? let s be honest , mcenroe said he would like to keep the homeandaway format for the early rounds each year and then have the defending champion and three other teams come together in one site , preferably in the champion s country , for a final fourstyle extravaganza united states tennis association officials met with francesco ricci bitti , the itf s president , in melbourne during last month s australian open to start a dialogue on possible changes , but were met with little encouragement ricci bitti believes the cup is in a healthy place in terms of sponsorship , appeal and participation he is unconvinced that a format change is worth the risks of toying with an annual tradition and the passion it generates , particularly in this opening weekend when eight world group matches are being played from israel to peru he also wants someone to present him with a viable financial proposal but mcenroe maintains that risks are in order look , in the past the feeling was , we 're crying because we have n't won it lately , he said and i love davis cup more than anything , and i think it s such a unique competition , and there are obviously plenty of positives right now , as we experienced ourselves last year to win it with the home crowd and all that but it can be so much more than it is the best players should treat davis cup like it s a slam , he added there s got to be a way to create the right format where they will in the current situation , i would love for roger and rafa to be playing , but i can certainly understand that they do n't i 'd be disappointed if my guys decided not to play , and i 've been very lucky they continue to play but it would be hard for me to look them in the eye if they did n't and say , you 're not doing the right thing for your country' for now and the near future , andy roddick , james blake and the bryan twins are not interested in doing anything else during davis cup weeks winning in december was one of the emotional highs of their lives , a feeling underscored when none of them went past the quarterfinals at last month s australian open i 've said many times that davis cup means a lot to me it s a priority in my career that has n't changed since last year , roddick said i guess you could say the one good thing coming out of australia was that i had more time to prepare for this tie the australian open champion , novak djokovic , and the finalist jowilfried tsonga of france will be in action this weekend djokovic will lead serbia against russia in moscow , and in light of recent form , the serbs deserve to be viewed as slight favorites tsonga , the 22yearold whose grin is as flashy as his attacking game , will make his debut for france in romania the established stars might be wavering on the davis cup , but the game s newest stars are eager to juggle selfinterest and national interest , at least for now
cincinnati a victory here tonight would have tied the mets record for consecutive victories but none of the elements that had made them so strong in the previous 10 games were present as they fell , 52 , to the reds their strong pitching evaporated at the hands of john maine , but just as importantly , the side that had averaged 64 runs per game through the streak produced only two on a night when the starter needed the support most carlos delgado and fernando tatis have played a large part in setting the tone for the mets over the last two weeks on friday , they combined to go 1 for 5 in the 10 games before friday s defeat , delgado hit 400 with six runs batted in and three home runs , including thursday s moon shot over the rightfield bleachers he s feeling good at the big plate , he s hitting some balls the other way , and he s coming up with some big hits for us as well , manager jerry manuel said before friday s game obviously , when he s right he can kill you for a while over the same stretch , tatis hit 429 with 11 rbi and four home runs , much to manuel s surprise when he first saw tatis in spring training , he said , he took him on a splitsquad game to kissimmee , fla , a neverending bus ride away from port st lucie and his swing was as long as the trip , manuel said the mets hope this trip does not start to seem just as long
chicago presidentelect wants congress to pass a multibilliondollar economic and a bailout for the sputtering auto industry during a lameduck session next week but senator obama will not be there to vote on the proposals mr obama announced thursday that he would resign his senate seat on sunday , thus avoiding any obligation to show up next week and cutting short the odd overlap period when the next leader of the executive branch would still be a member of the legislative branch this is the first time in nearly a halfcentury that a sitting member of congress has been elected president in the past , this was not much of an issue since congress did not meet after the election or , if it did , took up mostly routine matters but next week s session could address the most urgent issue confronting the nation , namely how to pull out of the current economic slide the outgoing senate remains closely divided , with 49 democrats , 49 republicans and 2 independents who caucus with the democrats besides losing mr obama s vote , the democrats will most likely not have another of their members on hand either senator of delaware , the vice presidentelect , is not expected to participate in the session nothing in the rules prevents either mr obama or mr biden from voting as senators since they have not yet been sworn into their new jobs but the obama camp decided it would be inappropriate for them to act as senators when bigger roles are on the horizon the basic approach has been , he s going to be here in chicago setting up his economic not only his economic team , but the policies he wants to outline for the country as soon as he gets sworn in , so we hit the ground running , representative rahm emanuel of illinois , mr obama s designated chief of staff , said sunday on cbs s face the nation although losing two votes could hurt the democrats if next week s issues are divided along party lines , obama advisers played down the likelihood that congress would be able to agree anyway either lawmakers come up with plans that win significant majorities , or they will not go forward with votes , some democrats have said it s important to bear in mind that congress was wrestling with issues like an economic recovery program prior to the election and did n't come to a conclusion , robert gibbs , a senior obama adviser , said this week if congress does not come to an agreement , he said , it will be the first priority after mr obama is inaugurated and democrats return with stronger majorities in both houses this is a relatively rare situation in 220 years of presidential elections , only three other sitting members of congress have won the white house representative james a garfield in 1880 , senator warren g harding in 1920 and senator john f kennedy in 1960 garfield resigned from congress right after his election , and kennedy had no lameduck session to worry about harding showed up on the opening day of the lameduck session that followed his election and gave a short valedictory speech on the senate floor , taking note of the somewhat unusual circumstances of his presence and the delicacy about my position , according to congressional records he then boarded a train and returned to ohio , never casting any votes in his dual role as presidentelect and senator none of the senators elected vice president since world war ii al gore , hubert h humphrey , lyndon b johnson , walter f mondale or dan quayle faced a lameduck session after being elected , according to donald a ritchie , the associate senate historian senator alben w barkley , democrat of kentucky , the majority leader , had a brief lameduck session in december 1948 after he was elected vice president under harry s truman , but it lasted just two hours and was largely a formality like mr obama , mr biden must resign his senate seat before noon on inauguration day , jan 20 , but he has not disclosed his plans and it is not clear what political calculations , if any , are driving that decision in illinois and delaware , democratic governors will appoint successors , who will serve until the next election , in 2010 neither mr obama nor mr biden has publicly endorsed a successor , but mr obama did appear this week with tammy duckworth , one of the reported candidates to replace him in the senate he laid a wreath for in chicago on tuesday accompanied by ms duckworth , an illinois national guard helicopter pilot who lost both legs in iraq ms duckworth lost a race for congress in 2006 and is now the state s director of veterans affairs gov rod r blagojevich of illinois has not tipped his hand about whom he plans to appoint or whether he will do it in time for the new senator to participate in next week s session the list of other democrats mentioned in illinois is long , including representatives danny k davis , luis v gutierrez , jesse l jackson jr and jan schakowsky the state senate president , emil jones jr attorney general lisa madigan and several others if ms duckworth does not get the senate seat , she is seen by some as a possible secretary of veterans affairs in mr obama s cabinet , although some of his advisers favor keeping the current secretary , james b peake in delaware , the situation is more complicated gov ruth ann minner will appoint a successor if mr biden resigns before jan 20 but her term ends the same day , and the incoming governor usually decides when the swearingin ceremony takes place if ms minner s elected successor , jack markell , opts to take power before noon on inauguration day and mr biden does not resign until the last moment , mr markell would choose his successor whoever makes the appointment , the new senator will have to face election in two years to keep the seat for the remaining four years of the term mr biden won last week at the same time he was elected vice president the most intriguing possibility is mr biden s son , joseph r biden iii , the state s attorney general , who is known as beau but since he is scheduled to serve in iraq with the delaware national guard until next fall , that may be impractical many democrats speculate that someone might be chosen to hold the seat for two years so the younger mr biden could run in 2010 others mentioned as possible appointees in delaware include lt gov john c carney jr , who lost a democratic primary to mr markell , and secretary of state harriet smith windsor
frisco , tex the st john s and maryland men s soccer teams have a history of meeting in the tournament unfortunately for st john s , history repeated itself as it fell , 10 , to the terrapins in double overtime in the semifinals of the ncaa men s college cup at pizza hut park on friday night maryland \( 2230 \) scored in the 104th minute when striker graham zusi nailed a free kick from about 25 yards that fluttered past st john s goalkeeper neal kitson i'm very proud of our guys , st john s coach dave masur said they played really well against a great maryland team maryland is a very explosive , wellcoached and dynamic team , like they 've been all season we knew we had our hands full the red storm \( 1933 \) managed just three shots , with one in the second half and none in either extra period maryland had 19 shots kitson was stellar in goal for the red storm , with nine saves to keep the match scoreless until the final deciding boot by maryland i thought that neal in particular had a fantastic game in goal , masur said he made a lot of great saves to keep us in it masur also commended the senior defender rory quinn for helping the red storm handle the maryland attack for much of the evening i thought rory did a great job of really controlling the defensive midfield and helping out on their two central forwards , he said but in the end , maryland eliminated the red storm from the ncaa tournament for the fourth straight time we 're certainly disappointed in the loss and to lose in the second overtime especially , masur said it s been a little bit of a rivalry between us and maryland and to come out on the short end of the stick is difficult kitson echoed his coach s sentiments it s very disappointing , he said you get to this stage in the year and we worked real hard preparing for this game i thought we were going to stick it out and get through both overtimes it was a great free kick there s not much you can do about those the red storm hung tough against the terrapins in the first half and had two shots in the opening 45 minutes compared to four by maryland but in the second half , maryland opened things up and outshot st john s , 121 about two minutes into the game , the red storm was dealt a blow when the junior defender ben clack injured his hamstring and had to leave the game maryland will face its atlantic coast conference rival north carolina on sunday in the national title game the tar heels defeated no 1 wake forest , 10
tbilisi , georgia s prowestern president narrowly won reelection over the weekend , according to official results released sunday , but the main opposition candidate contested the outcome with returns from nearly all precincts in saturday s vote counted , president had received 528 percent , according to the central election commission , a slim majority that would allow him to avoid a runoff the main opposition candidate , levan gachechiladze , received 27 percent but the outcome was not as clean as the government had hoped for in november when mr saakashvili called early elections and declared a state of emergency to deal with antigovernment protests on sunday , mr gachechiladze said fraud had tainted the results , and by late in the day he had not conceded mr gachechiladze said a second round of voting should be held and called for street protests he told several thousand supporters at a rally in tbilisi on sunday , we have won despite pressure , despite intimidation , despite televised terror exerted against us the demonstration , which was peaceful , dispersed by early afternoon as orthodox christians , the majority of georgians , began celebrating their christmas eve supporters of mr saakashvili , an americaneducated leader close to the bush administration , had already claimed victory based on exit polling on saturday a statement by the international observer mission of the called the vote in essence consistent with most osce and council of europe commitments and standards for democratic elections , but noted violations observers said they recorded cases of the same individuals voting more than once at 12 polling stations , according to the statement , and said ballot boxes in 3 percent of the precincts they visited had not been properly sealed at a news conference in tbilisi on sunday , alcee l hastings , a democratic congressman from florida and the coordinator of the osce mission , declined to say whether voting irregularities were significant enough to reverse mr saakashvili s slender margin in response to the report , giorgi kandelaki , a spokesman for the justice ministry , said , to our knowledge , there were very few violations that could be regarded as serious the perception of a fair vote was important because the bush administration has cited mr saakashvili s government as an example of democratic success in a region where democracy has been scarce georgia is also valuable to washington because it is an ally in the iraq war with 2 , 000 troops in iraq , it is the thirdlargest contributor of troops there , after the united states and britain mr saakashvili , 40 , had about a year to go in his fiveyear term when , in november , he called early elections he hoped to win a new mandate after he declared a state of emergency on nov 7 and ordered a police crackdown on antigovernment protests in the dispersal of demonstrators , more than 500 people were injured , none fatally
sandra tsing loh , a writer and a performer , is the author most recently of mother on fire , a comic memoir of her struggle to find a school in los angeles for her child to attend \( \) as usual , bruce fuller and lance izumi , my fellow education watch contributors , make some fascinating points , none more startling to me than lance s casual throwaway that barack obama sends his children to private school as a rabid public school democrat , i crumpled in despair at the news look , i am not in politics , i get no money from foundations , i do not get invited to lecture on third world ecosustainability on luxury cruises i have no highly placed bluestate friends and i will soon be a divorced woman because my diehard democratic husband will not brook any dissent , public or private , about our party fair enough , fair enough , but here s the thing i do not know why barack and michelle obama cannot send their children to a nice public school in hyde park you understand that i am a bit unstable this election season \( i voted for hillary \) and i do my research by erratically googling from home and all i know about hyde park and , readers , i d love to be corrected if i m wrong is that even though real estate prices seem high , the brave little public schools in its zip code seem to be flailing their scores on www greatschools net are largely 2 s and 4 s \( on a scale of 1 to 10 , 10 being the best \) when you read the tea leaves as manically as i do , those low numbers suggest that few children of educated , middleclass children are attending the local schools rather , they ve withdrawn , with nary a ripple , into their whispery private enclaves let us not even touch the term community organizer , so buffeted about , by both sides , like a balloon at a rock concert let us just say that if mr and mrs obama a dynamic , harvardeducated couple had chosen public over private school , they could have lifted up not just their one local public school , but a family of schools first , given the social pressure \( or the social persuasion of wanting to belong to the cool club \) , more educated , affluent families would tip back into the public school fold and second , the presence of educated typea parents with too much time on their hands ensures that schools are held , daily , to high standards but the significance of educated families opting in to their local public schools goes deeper than that research done by richard kahlenberg , a senior fellow at the century foundation , indicates that poor children benefit hugely by mixing , daily , with middleclass children \( particularly those from families who value education \) conversely , as long as the deleterious effects of poverty , like rampant absenteeism and serious health issues , do not overwhelm the school culture , middleclass children suffer no ill effects furthermore , studies have shown that new immigrant children learn english faster and master the complex linguistic skills they need to succeed on standardized tests when they are in classrooms with native english speakers sadly , because of the widespread flight of higherminded families , ethnic segregation \( not to mention class segregation \) in public schools today is so extreme that only one in five immigrant children will have even one native englishspeaking friend so it is with huge grieffilled disappointment that i discovered that the obamas send their children to the university of chicago laboratory school \( by 5th grade , tuition equals 20 , 286 a year \) the school s web site quotes all that ridiculous john dewey nonsense about developing character while , of course , isolating your children from the poor a pox on them and , while we re at it , a pox on john dewey !

every once in a while i feel that it might be helpful to readers if i explained what it is i am trying to do in these columns it is easier to state the negative for the most part , it is not my purpose in this space to urge positions , or come down on one side or the other of a controversial question of course , i do those things occasionally and sometimes inadvertently , but more often than not i am analyzing arguments rather than making them or , to be more precise , i am making arguments about arguments , especially ones i find incoherent or insufficiently examined when i find an argument incoherent , it is not because i find the argument on the other side persuasive although that is the assumption made by those who lambaste me for being a conservative or a liberal , a hopeless fuddyduddy or a corrosive postmodernist , and address me in the confidence that they know on what end of the ideological or moral spectrum i am to be found but , in fact , a reader of a typical think again column will have no idea at all where i stand on the issues that catch my attention , because at least for the length of the column \( as opposed to real life , which is much longer \) , i am agnostic on those issues and interested only in the way they are playing out in our present cultural moment when , for example , i wrote three columns criticizing the atheist tracts written by richard dawkins , sam harris and christopher hitchens , i was motivated not by a belief in god which i may or may not have , you ll never know but by what i took to be sloppy , schoolboy reasoning that was passing itself off as wisdom i could have been an atheist myself , and i still would have found the socalled logic of these books weak and risible the difference between making arguments and analyzing them is not always recognized , and when it is missed , readers get outraged about things i never said this is this case with two recent columns , one on identity politics , the other on the shape of a possible obamamccain contest in the general election my point in the first column was that although identity politics was often a term of accusation as in that s just identity politics at least one version of it could be considered rational someone who believes that the racial , ethnic , religious or gender identity of a candidate makes it more likely that he or she will support and work for certain favored policies is not performing a base or discriminatory act by voting for that candidate the voter , of course , may be wrong the candidate may be elected and then go in a completely different direction but being wrong is not the same thing as being irrational , that is , without reasons of the appropriate kind but if the same voter were to pull the lever simply because of the candidate s skin color or gender or faith , and without regard to matters of policy , that would , i said , be a quite different act , an act , basically , of tribal loyalty , and it might well deserve the criticism it received this distinction between tribal identity politics and policy or interest identity politics could of course be challenged \( as it was by many posters \) , but the challenge would be to its cogency or adequacy , not to its agenda , because it has none the distinction is descriptive , not normative in offering it , i do not say , practice identity politics i only say that those who do take identity into consideration either by voting for someone on the basis of an identity affiliation or choosing a candidate because he or she is perceived to be friendly to identity interests are not doing something patently reprehensible is it the best thing to do \? is it good for the country \? these are real questions , but they are not questions i take up , although a number of readers take me to task for the answers they presume me to have given cdn expat writes that whether identity politics is rational is hardly the question the question is whether it is culturally and socially helpful no , it isn t that is expat s question and i have no obligation either to ask or answer it i m just asserting the rationality of identity politics , not giving my blessing to it whether its exercise is culturally helpful is not something i consider i just don t go there nathan nahm wants to push me into the same territory when he says that if by rational i mean behavior that maximizes what the actor intends to accomplish in the way of policy changes , then my analysis is certainly true but trivial if , however , i mean that such behavior should also be treated as ethically acceptable , then my analysis is not valid given a choice between being trivial and being ethical in any direction whatsoever , i ll take trivial \( although i might want to debate the judgment \) , because ethics is not something i m doing in these columns this doesn t mean that i think ethical questions are unimportant although i do think there are fewer of them than is usually assumed there are none , for example , in the current controversy about superdelegates it is just that if you want those questions raised and examined , you ll have to go elsewhere this might seem to be an admission that my perspective is severely limited yes , it is , but it is my conviction is that its limitedness is its strength and that were it to be expanded the only gain would be the pious fuzziness you can get from a thousand other commentators nahm traffics in piety when he imagines a white voter who supports a candidate because he thinks that the candidate is more likely to implement a school segregation policy \( eg in the late 70s \) such an action , he says correctly , would not fall into my disfavored category of tribal identity politics \( no policy considerations whatsoever \) , but it would , he adds , be ethically unacceptable because it is based on bigotry well , that s his opinion , and i don t have a contrary one i don t have one at all because i m not doing moral parsing and find it spectacularly uninteresting calling someone a bigot and claiming the high ground for yourself may be momentarily satisfying , but it does little except provoke a response in the same mode \( it s bigoted of you to say that i m a bigot \) an ethical argument from the other direction comes from a host of readers who assumed that i was offering a typically twisted liberal justification of the voting behavior of blacks who voted for barack obama because he is black , and of women who voted for hillary clinton because she is female they challenged me and my supposed liberalism \( an identification i neither affirm nor deny \) by brandishing the specter of a white male voting his white male interests and daring me to embrace it so you re ok with white males voting for a white male candidate in the belief that a white male candidate will share many of the same interests with white make voters \? but i m not saying ok or not ok to any instance of identity politics voting i was merely suggesting that an often scorned piece of political behavior could be characterized in a way that it could be seen as a reasonable exercise of the franchise it was the general category of behavior that i was defending , and i neither approved nor condemned any particular instance of it i was making an observation about the structure of political action i was not , in doing so , acting politically , and so criticisms of my politics \( which never came into view \) were inapposite the suspicion that i was a political agent in very thin disguise was strongly expressed by the hundreds of readers who disliked the column explaining why , in my view , barack obama would be at a disadvantage if he faced john mccain in the general election , in part because , given that matchup , the iraq war would become a republican talking point a lot of the fuss centered on my assertion that the surge in iraq had been implemented with some success i should have specified that the success i was referring to is a public relations success it may be true , as many have asserted , that the surge s primary objective to provide enough breathing space so that the political situation can be improved has not been achieved , and that the decrease in violence \( if it s real and not theater \) is due to many other factors but nevertheless , in the public mind , as opposed to the minds of people who have the leisure to write long posts to the new york times , things have improved and mccain will be able to present himself , however accurately or inaccurately , as a tribune of that improvement at least that s my judgment , and it s a judgment not on the issue but on the dynamics of a short campaign in the course of which any argument that takes more than one step to make is going to get lost what i think about the surge , if i think anything , is beside my point , which is tactical , not substantive this is true of all the points i attempt to make in the column by saying that the war could be turned to mccain s advantage were obama his opponent , i was not expressing an opinion on the war when tim bal lectures me , mr fish , you do not get it ! the war in iraq is an immoral and stupid war , it is he who doesn t get what i am trying to do i have no view of the war in this column i do have a view of the role the war will play in the strategies of the two parties that view is certainly open to challenge , but it is not a challenge to it to say that the war was stupid or immoral or a horrible blunder it would be a challenge to contend , as a number of readers did , that the war will , in fact , be a democratic plus because over twothirds of the populace now believes that it was a mistake \( a point that other posters countered by saying that the initial involvement was old , stale news and of interest only to the far left \) notice that a conversation between me and someone who said that would stop far short of deciding whether the war was actually a mistake and immoral the focus would remain on the tactical landscape and not on questions of morality and justice that s just what s wrong with my column in the eyes of a poster identified \( somewhat portentously \) as voices of the fallen stanley fish treats the iraq war a just another political game that people play are the 3 , 973 dead american men and women dead , 29 , 203 wounded and tens of thousands of iraqi dead migrating to mccain s side \? in other words , how can you reduce such a serious matter to the status of an opportunity for political advantage and ignore the real harm , the real losses , the real tragedy \? the answer is that were i to address myself to those matters , i would be entering the realm of moral and political \( as opposed to analytical \) judgment it is always a temptation to do that , and there is no dearth of people , not only in newspaper columns and tv shows but in bars , taxis , dining rooms and chat rooms , eager to do it too but resisting that temptation is the project of the think again columns , and while i cannot promise always to hew to that discipline , it will not be for lack of trying

san francisco in a sharp rebuke to supporters of a contested state ballot measure that banned , the attorney general said friday that the measure was constitutionally indefensible and should be overturned the attorney general , , had previously hinted of his opposition to the measure , proposition 8 , but made his legal opinion concrete on friday in a brief to the california supreme court , which is reviewing the measure proposition 8 must be invalidated because the amendment process cannot be used to extinguish fundamental constitutional rights without compelling justification , mr brown said in a statement opponents have argued that the proposition fundamentally altered the state constitution by taking away the right to marry from samesex couples , who had been free to do so since may , when the california supreme court legalized such marriages proposition 8 overturned that decision by defining marriage in california as between only men and women supporters of proposition 8 asked the court in a separate legal brief filed friday to invalidate the approximately 18 , 000 samesex weddings performed before the ban was passed the language , policy , history and intent of proposition 8 do not permit recognition of some samesex marriages but not others , read the brief , which was also written by the prominent conservative lawyer kenneth w starr none are valid or recognized in california opponents of proposition 8 said the brief was another effort to strip rights from samesex couples who were already hurting from the measure s passage this is an offensive attempt to rip away people s marriages , said geoff kors , the executive director of equality california , a gay rights group there was nothing in proposition 8 that was retroactive mr brown s action did not surprise supporters of proposition 8 it s no secret that the attorney general opposed proposition 8 during the campaign , said andrew pugno , the lawyer for the group behind the ban , protect marriage both sides have been waging a public relations battle supporters of samesex marriage have staged a series of protests since the vote , with a candlelight vigil planned in several cities on saturday opponents of samesex marriage have urged protesters to accept the will of voters the court could hear oral arguments as soon as march , and a decision is expected next year

san diego the misty fog that creeps ashore in the afternoons in coastal california occurs when cool ocean temperatures mix with heat on the land so it was no surprise when the intense heat coming from the shots being hit and the putts being made at torrey pines golf course on friday produced a brand of united states open marine layer like none seen before stuart appleby got hot , slamming home a 40foot putt for birdie at the 18th hole to close out his round of 70 and put him into the open lead at threeunderpar 139 caught fire , shooting 30 on his back nine for a round of threeunder 68 that vaulted him into second place at twounder 140 , tied with rocco mediate , who shot 71 , and robert karlsson , who added his second straight 70 davis love iii warmed up for the first time all year , shooting a 69 that vaulted him into a tie for fifth with d j trahan , lee westwood and miguel ngel jim nez , at one under , all of it framed by a mist that could not blur the picture that finally came into focus and that is woods , sore knee and all , looming large in his first tournament since the in april , in contention for his 14th career major championship he overcame every obstacle in his path to get here , shaking off the rust and taking care of , the hometown favorite with whom he played the first two rounds mickelson faltered on the back nine , driving the ball erratically and shooting 75 woods played down his surge at first , discussing his slow start \( two over par after three holes \) , not hitting the ball very well , the knee feeling a little sore but then he talked about what wins major championships focus , patience and putting i felt that if i played well in that back nine i could definitely get back to even par for the tournament and i would be right back in the championship , woods said , referring to the wild start that produced four bogeys , an eagle and a par at the easy par5 18th for woods to shoot 38 on the back nine his front nine and come back the way he did \? all of a sudden i started running them in there from everywhere , he said that was for sure woods pulled into serious contention by reeling off five straight 3s on his back nine , which began at no 1 with the most improbable birdie of the day he sent his drive at the 448yard hole way right , on the other side of a cart path , into a good lie next to a torrey pine rather than take a drop , woods elected to take a stance on the cart path his right foot slipped slightly during the transition in his swing and his left foot slipped at impact woods winced and limped out to the fairway to watch the ball fly onto the green and spin to a stop about 20 feet above the hole naturally , he made the putt for birdie he birdied the next hole , the short 389yard second , which he attacked with a 340yard drive his wedge shot checked early , but he made another putt , this one from 25 feet he then made birdie on the fourth hole and added one at the fifth , his fifth consecutive 3 and the one that put him into red numbers at one under par i just happened to just get a great break at no 1 , he said not only did i have a swing and a stance , but also had a lie where i could control my distance and it was just an 8iron up there just put the ball in the center of the green and move on from there but i was n't trying to do anything particular with that shot just trying to dump it in the center of the green and i had 157 to the hole and just trying to carry it over that front bunker no problem but as he was doing his thing , the australian appleby was doing his this could be his chance at a major championship , an opportunity to atone for the collapse at the 2006 masters he is well aware of how that has been perceived and does not shrink from the memory majors are not a comfortable zone , he said they 're not comfortable they 're not supposed to be comfortable that s sort of why there s only four of them a year , and they 're always on testing golf courses do i think that i am more comfortable \? yeah , i guess i might be i think as you get older , you 've got to find a way to be more comfortable with woods in the picture , and the weekend here , getting comfortable will be very difficult the entire tenor of the open will change this is serious business now , and no one is better at taking control than woods when the red light comes on and the collars get tight he has won six times at torrey pines , so there is one comfort zone he has won two united states opens , which is another and he knows how to close at a major i think that i was very fortunate to have won my first one very early , woods said , recalling the recordsetting and groundbreaking masters win of 1997 my first one as a professional basically so that , i believe that relieved so much pressure , the facts that i can always say that i know how to do this i 've done it before will he do it again \? knee or no knee , it is difficult to bet against it
jersey city oh , to be an referee your judgments are questioned , players and coaches scream at you , fans think the worst of you , sports radio hosts fillet you , and knowitall broadcasters foment negativity with misguided opinions sometimes when you listen to the announcers , said joe borgia , the league s vice president for referee operations , the perception becomes reality , and what they say , because they 're perceived as experts , hurts the credibility of officials borgia was speaking to reporters during a break in the nba s annual referee camp at a hotel here , where five hours on wednesday were dedicated to educating local and national announcers in an effort to \( hopefully \) show that referees deserve more respect the goal is not to get rid of criticism , but inaccurate criticism , said tim frank , a league spokesman we think it s hurtful when there s an interpretation explained incorrectly and it makes the referees look wrong the league knows what its officials are doing and what announcers are saying right and wrong every game is logged , so all announcer misinformation can be charted the league also vigorously monitors referees on every level , with inhouse observers supervisors and toplevel executives at every game between the announcers and the league , referees get plenty of feedback , some more instructive than others the media seminar conducted by borgia and bernie fryer , the league s vice president and director of officials , was designed to underscore the complexity of referees' jobs their proper positioning on the court the subtle distinctions between charging and blocking fouls that sometimes can be discerned only in slow motion and the differences between what they see on the court and what announcers witness at courtside \( for tv crews \) and beyond \( for radio announcers who are often farther away \)  on a video screen in the ballroom , they showed why kobe bryant s air punch toward an official merited a technical foul , why a frustrated but not disrespectful gesture by earl watson did not lead to one and why kurt thomas s angry fourclap gesture earned one overt actions , said borgia , the disrespectful ones , are always technical fouls and there was this wisdom from fryer just because a player flops does n't mean there is n't a foul the roomful of announcers took a 15question quiz that , like many standardized tests , contained nuanced questions mixed with misdirection for example a team has 30 seconds to replace an ejected player \( false an ejected player must be replaced immediately , but 30 seconds are given to replace a disqualified player \) or player b3 receives his 2nd flagrant foul of the game and is ejected the officials will use instant replay to confirm the ejection \( somewhat false the replay trigger must be of the more severe flagrant2 variety \) a sequence of eight videos followed , demonstrating how the right angles staked out by wellpositioned referees can sometimes offer better viewing posts than what is on tv \( until more definitive replays are rolled in \) what appears to be an offensive foul to announcers at courtside can be a defender a halfstep from establishing position  as borgia minutely analyzed what looked like a flagrant foul but which was really an offensive player slipping on his flight to the hoop he said , see how good we are frame by frame \? all the league wants , he added , are announcers familiar with the rules who will reverse incorrect calls of the game when replays show that the referees are right borgia and fryer s oftenentertaining presentation indicated a need to be viewed as untainted by the betrayal of one of their own , tim donaghy , who pleaded guilty to gambling on games he refereed as fryer analyzed calls from game 2 of the 2007 eastern conference finals between the cavaliers and the pistons , his tone suggested the sort of internal selfflagellation of the nba s referee review process with seven seconds left in the game , and cleveland trailing by a point , lebron james drove and , despite contact with detroit s richard hamilton , a foul was not called james missed his shot full speed , it does n't look like much , fryer said that reachin does n't look like he hit him but the replay revealed a foul that tnt s doug collins said during the game was not worth calling a second replay showed that james traveled fryer , however , said that missing the foul was brutal , absolutely brutal craig bolerjack , who is in his fourth season as the television voice of the jazz , said he was happy to watch the nba open up about its referee review process and i hope they understand that everything is happening so fast , that we all make mistakes , he said i'm impressed that they 're trying to be perfect , but none of us will reach perfection but you show your professionalism if , after you say , oh , that s a terrible call , ' by saying , on replay , i was wrong'
chicago the bustle of wrigley field on a game day fosters a tension as discernable as humidity from the more than 40 , 000 people who jam into the venerable ballpark , to the hundreds more packed onto rooftop bleachers across sheffield and waveland avenues , the noise at crucial moments in a big series can be deafening , almost terrifying jeff samardzija , the tousledhair former notre dame wide receiver from indiana , has seen and heard worse try catching passes in the final two minutes at notre dame stadium , with a safety ready to level you , and the pleas of the demanding irish faithful rattling in your helmet or , say , at michigan stadium , with 100 , 000 wolverines fans cheering against you so when chicago cubs manager lou piniella sent samardzija into the ninth inning of a 22 game with the archrival st louis cardinals on friday , samardzija making only his seventh major league appearance , after less than two full seasons of minor league play never flinched he pitched two scoreless innings in the cubs' eventual 32 , 11inning victory that he was just paying attention to his pitching , and not paying attention to anything else , was impressive , cardinals manager tony la russa said and when albert pujols attempted a delayed steal of second in the 10th , samardzija responded to his teammates' shouts by calmly stepping off the rubber and throwing pujols out the same situation happened to me in triple a this year , samardzija said the next day i stepped off , everything was good , and i actually made a bad throw to second it bounced in and he was safe so it was nice to learn from your mistakes and go do it right when it counts on sunday , in a 62 cubs victory , samardzija threw a wild pitch and gave up an runscoring double to pujols \( the run was charged to starter ryan dempster \) before striking out ryan ludwick to end the seventh that gave samardzija 12 strikeouts and a 154 earned run average in 11 2 3 innings samardzija s poise since he was called up from class aaa iowa on july 25 has been the talk of chicago when the cubs lured samardzija , a boyhood cubs fan , from a potential career in the nfl with a fiveyear , 10 million deal in january 2007 , general manager jim hendry said team officials could not decide whether samardzija projected better as a frontline starter or a closer samardzija started until being called up to the big leagues now he is a reliever next year \? that is to be determined , hendry said with closer kerry wood again fighting injuries , samardzija should see more important duty as the cubs , nearing the 100th anniversary of their last world series championship , chase a second consecutive national league central title on saturday , piniella described his faith in samardzija like this he pitched in the 9th and 10th inning yesterday i think that tells you something it tells me i like him and i 've got confidence in him and , piniella said charlie weis was tougher than i am that i can tell you so it s easier playing for an easygoing guy like me that facetious reference to his irascible notre dame coach cracked up samardzija curiously , samardzija has pitched more effectively as a cub than he did at any minor league level last season , samardzija went 611 in class a and class aa as he worked on his offspeed pitches instead of relying on his hard , sinking fastball returning to class aa tennessee at the beginning of this season , samardzija was 35 with an unimpressive 486 era , although he improved in his last five starts there success finally came at iowa in june and july a 41 record with a 313 era in six starts once he got up where he could smell it , his character kind of took over , hendry said it does n't happen often , but it happens with a guy like him he s one of those guys who likes to shine in the big moment we thought he 'd be a guy who , when he got here , could deal with the second deck he likes the big stage we understood that early on piniella learned that quickly , too samardzija gave up a gametying double to florida s jorge cant in his major league debut on july 25 two days later , piniella went back to him , and samardzija struck out three of the six marlins batters he faced to earn his first major league save obviously , playing in front of 80 , 000 people at notre dame pays big dividends , piniella said he s used to national tv , the exposure samardzija said i think it helped out a lot any time you can get experiences playing in front of that many people , especially when it s that many hostile people , it helps you out obviously they 're going to say anything they can come up with to try and get in your head i just laugh at it it does n't really bother me too much my brother and my dad have said a whole lot worse things to me than they can ever come up with none of this surprises brady quinn , samardzija s quarterback at notre dame , who is now with the cleveland browns quinn agreed with cubs officials and players who believe the notre dame experience prepared samardzija to handle a pennant race , in a town where it s gonna happen signs again dominate the north side in a pressure situation , a pressure down , he was someone i always trusted , because he was always able to make a play , quinn said in a telephone interview from the browns' training camp on berea , ohio i think he s going to be able to handle whatever the major leagues throw at him he s just that kind of guy
washington when senator was ready to deliver his endorsement of senator , mr kennedy did not call obama headquarters he got in touch with , the former senate democratic leader who had quietly been serving as the liaison between mr obama and fellow senators behind the scenes , mr daschle has played an intriguing role in mr obama s senate career and presidential campaign as a confidant and an early supporter who lent authority to mr obama s ambitions when others doubted the prospects of the young newcomer to washington now mr daschle , who represented south dakota in the senate until his defeat in 2004 , is becoming increasingly active on behalf of mr obama , serving as ambassador to bigname backers like mr kennedy , building support among american indians , pushing back against the clinton campaign and making personal appearances of his own after a stinging defeat at home , mr daschle has discovered the pleasures of campaigning when someone else s name is on the ballot it is all of the fun and none of the pressure , said mr daschle , who on monday was calling through a list of party officials who will serve as convention delegates , wooing them on mr obama s behalf i feel liberated mr daschle s strong advocacy of mr obama has torn his relationship with the clintons mr daschle worked closely with former president in his white house years and helped protect him from an impeachment conviction by the senate in 2001 , mr daschle welcomed to the senate from new york and used his clout to help her secure committee and party positions she sought but his enthusiasm for mr obama has made mr daschle one of the de facto leaders of a bloc of top democrats trying to steer the party away from another clinton presidency , earning him the gratitude of mr obama i suspect we would not be in the same place as we are today had it not been for him , mr obama said in a recent interview he brings enormous credibility , enormous knowledge , a huge network , good counsel and good advice the relationship between the two men began in 2004 , shortly after mr obama won the senate democratic primary in illinois despite being the democratic leader , mr daschle was locked in a far more difficult campaign than mr obama s through the summer and fall , mr obama made himself available to help senate democrats he did not travel to south dakota to campaign , but raised money for mr daschle after mr daschle s defeat , mr obama sought his help in hiring some key daschle staff members , calculating that a seasoned team could help him learn more quickly to navigate capitol hill pete rouse , mr daschle s longtime adviser , became mr obama s chief of staff , and mr obama has since absorbed several other former daschle political strategists and communications staff members after the 2006 elections , mr obama turned to mr daschle again at mr rouse s urging , mr obama confided his interest in a white house run to mr daschle , seeking guidance from someone who had nearly taken the plunge himself four years earlier , mr daschle had been on the verge of mounting a presidential bid , but ultimately declined the two met for a dinner at the downtown washington restaurant tosca , a favorite of mr daschle s , talking about mr obama s chances late into the night over italian food and wine at the restaurant s chef s table my message to barack was , do n't always think you will have another shot , ' said mr daschle , who now provides highpriced policy advice at the firm of alston bird you just never know what the future will hold mr obama said mr daschle s encouragement and his public endorsement within weeks of mr obama s announcement in early 2007 were significant factors in his decisionmaking he was able to give me a good assessment of my chances , mr obama said the fact that he was willing to sign on at a time when we were still putting it together gave other people confidence that this was n't just a flight of fancy there have been suggestions that mr daschle s advocacy of mr obama is driven by lingering resentment that his cooperation with the clintons over the years contributed to his own defeat in conservative south dakota mr daschle and close associates say that idea is without merit and that mr daschle simply sees mr obama and his relatively short washington r sum as a chance for the party to start anew mr daschle also dismisses any talk of interest in securing a top spot in any obama administration i think he and senator obama just clicked , said ranit schmelzer , a former daschle aide mr daschle has proved adept at bringing others into the fold as mrs clinton racked up senate endorsements last year , mr obama had only the backing of richard j durbin , his home state colleague from illinois mr daschle , though , was working to build relationships with his old friends some of whom still refer to him as leader and he urged them to watch the results in the iowa caucuses after mr obama s victory , senators took notice and despite mr obama s losing the new hampshire primary , some of the lawmakers mr daschle had been softselling were ready to sign on with mr obama tom has a lot of credibility up here , mr kennedy said , referring to the former lawmaker s standing on capitol hill should the primary campaign continue into the summer as a statebystate fight for delegates , mr obama might find another advantage in his alliance with mr daschle one of two states holding primaries on the final day , june 3 , is south dakota if we need that last delegate , i think he can make it happen , mr obama said
in the threadbare border towns of south texas , one of the country s poorest regions , enterprising locals like candelaria espinoza have long been paid to round up votes for candidates on election day there is even a name for these electoral soldiers of fortune politiqueras so when senator s presidential campaign arrived in south texas in february seeking an edge in its uphill battle against senator , ms espinoza was happy to oblige , for a price the campaign paid her and seven other members of her family 100 to 200 each to knock on doors , deliver fliers and get voters to the polls for the democratic primary on march 4 , which mrs clinton narrowly won i 've been a politiquera for 20 years , ms espinoza said in an interview last week outside her trailer in the town of pharr the money the clinton people gave me was about the going rate , more or less the espinozas were among at least 460 texans , most of them rural hispanics in south texas or africanamericans in houston , who received payments from the clinton campaign for this kind of work , according to a review of federal election commission records the records show that mrs clinton did something similar in , giving 38 , 300 to a state legislator , eugene r miller , who says he used it to pay more than 200 people to get out the vote in predominantly black neighborhoods in cleveland the payments , known in the political vernacular as street money , are a legal but controversial tool that mrs clinton employed at a time when she was desperately seeking a victory after losing 10 consecutive contests to mr obama as a practical matter , the payments are now little more than a footnote to a hotly contested race that seems closer to a conclusion after mrs clinton s poor showing in north carolina and narrow victory in indiana last tuesday but they underscore how her strategists , caught unprepared for a drawnout battle , turned to an oldstyle method of retail politicking to ensure muchneeded victories in the suddenly critical and ohio primaries not equipped with the volunteerdriven grassroots movement that has propelled mr obama s getoutthevote efforts , the clinton campaign hired more than three times as many local operatives as he to fill that role in those two states while mostly forgoing the use of street money in ohio and other places , the obama campaign paid about 150 people in texas , most of them college students , for campaign work the payments were widely dispersed , with only a handful in south texas and fewer than 20 in houston the clinton campaign made payments of 80 to 125 to more than 200 people in houston , and 100 to 200 to 170 people in the mcallen and brownsville areas near the mexican border the clinton campaign did not respond to several requests for comment hari sevugan , a spokesman for the obama campaign , drew a distinction between the money it paid to college students , who he said were enthusiastic supporters to begin with , and the payments by the clinton campaign , which he described as an effort to buy influence among important constituencies it is unclear whether the payments made much of a difference mrs clinton did sweep the border areas of texas by wide margins , helping her win the primary by about 100 , 000 votes , of nearly 29 million cast , but she had already had a strong base of support among the region s hispanics and mr obama carried houston and other urban areas where black voters formed a crucial bloc of support the payments' impact was even less clear in ohio , where mrs clinton won one of the two congressional districts where street money was used , but lost the other whatever its effectiveness , street money is burdened with negative overtones stemming from accusations over the years that paid operatives have manipulated elderly voters in some elections or given people cash in exchange for their votes but even when entirely legal , the trading of campaign money for active political participation can raise awkward questions mr miller , for instance , was a rare black politician who backed mrs clinton in ohio and had been under tremendous pressure from constituents in his heavily africanamerican district to support mr obama in an interview , he acknowledged that the 38 , 300 he received from the clinton campaign looks like i 've been paid off , but he said he had kept none of the money for himself after signing a contract with the campaign just before the primary , mr miller said , he hired people to carry signs at polling places , drive voters to the polls and canvass neighborhoods paying them was necessary , he said , because in the heavily black precincts of cleveland , it s not popular to be with hillary clinton while the use of street money is not uncommon in cleveland , in other places the expectation that it will be disbursed is more deeply engrained in the electoral infrastructure in philadelphia , some local democratic operatives openly groused about mr obama s reluctance to engage in the practice and his reliance on outofstate campaigners for the pennsylvania primary , which mrs clinton won in south texas , politiqueras are known to negotiate with rival campaigns to get the best price before deciding whom to support , said jerry polinard , a political science professor at the university of texaspan american , who added that recent votebuying scandals had given the practice a black eye with the attendant publicity that s emerged over the last few years , dr polinard said , there is an ethical question raised that some candidates do n't want to be associated with for all the controversy , the clinton campaign appears to have had few qualms about spreading street money around in texas in interviews , about two dozen people who had received such payments described similar services that they provided , including handing out leaflets , carrying signs and encouraging people to vote none said the money had influenced their decision to support mrs clinton , although several in houston expressed ambivalence about her larry blevins , a retiree and longtime democratic party worker in houston , said he would have preferred former senator john edwards , described mrs clinton as the lesser of three evils and remarked that he would even consider voting republican if mike huckabee joined senator john mccain s ticket but mr blevins , who was paid 80 by mrs clinton s campaign , put aside his doubts and agreed to round up friends and neighbors to vote for her he described such payments as a way of getting people more involved in rustling up support that s basically what getoutthevote money is , he said paying to get votes
the president , , denounced on tuesday what he said was a violent attack orchestrated by the against members of other unions at a conference on saturday in michigan the service employees' union sent busloads of members from ohio to the labor conference in dearborn to confront leaders and members of the california nurses association the service employees say the nurses sabotaged a major service employees' unionizing drive last month others at the conference said the fighting began when service employee members and officials tried to barge into the conference in a hotel banquet hall chris kutalik , editor of labor notes , a magazine sponsoring the conference , said a retired member of the united automobile workers was pushed , banged her head against a table and was taken to a hospital for a head wound there is no justification , none , for the violent attack orchestrated by seiu , mr sweeney said in a statement violence in attacking freedom of speech must be strongly condemned the service employees union said the hundreds of busedin members were not trying to push in rather , it said , nurses' union members and others at the conference used violence to keep out several of its members the service employees voiced dismay with mr sweeney s statement , saying he should focus instead criticism on the california nurses association for sending organizers to ohio , where it does not represent workers , to undermine the service employees' threeyearlong effort to unionize more than 8 , 000 nurses and other hospital workers at roman catholic hospitals john sweeney has the power to solve this problem , andrew stern , the service employees' president , said in a statement he should stop making excuses and protect workers labor leaders said it could be awkward for mr sweeney to condemn the tactics of the nurses' union , which belongs to the aflcio , in its battle with the service employees , which left the labor federation three years ago the nurses' executive director , rose ann demoro , defended her union s efforts to prevent a service employees' victory , saying that nurses should be in a separate union from other workers and that the service employees had negotiated a sweetheart deal with the ohio hospitals the nurses' tactics were so disruptive that the service employees moved to cancel the unionization vote referring to the nurses' leader , tom balanoff , the top service employees official in illinois , said , rose ann used the exact same tactics as corporate america in stopping ohio workers from organizing mr stern is also battling the president of his union s giant health care local in california , sal rosselli mr rosselli says mr stern is undemocratic and uses topdown methods on tuesday , a spokesman for mr stern , andrew mcdonald , said mr rosselli violated federal law by allowing just shop stewards and other union officials run to be delegates to the union convention in june doing so excluded 95 percent of the members of the local , united healthcare workerswest , from running the local issued a statement on tuesday saying it would hold a new election for delegates and acknowledging that it had made a mistake in not letting most members run
omaha people always ask lambert bartak about the time an umpire tossed him from a baseball game , a dubious distinction for an organist but that was just one song a perfectly timed rendition of the mickey mouse club theme \( mickey , mouse \) after a controversial call 20 years ago among the countless ditties he has played in more than 50 years at rosenblatt stadium bartak , a vibrant 89 , knows hundreds of songs by memory , or at least his fingers do he remembers only a handful of the precise moments when a particular song was played there was the time when the kansas city royals' class aaa affiliate , as part of some promotion , asked bartak to play take me out to the ball game backward buh , buh , buh , bartak said on friday , trying to sound out the final three notes of the chorus in reverse order everyone , now game , ball , old oh , it s a horriblesounding thing backwards , bartak said he sat , shoeless , in an enclosed booth , just a man and his weathered 1935 hammond organ , alone and anonymous in their timeless endeavor a ballpark organist is part of the unobtrusive background of baseball , or used to be , until most were quietly silenced by time and outsourced by recorded music but after decades of playing largely behind the scenes as an accordion accompaniment to johnny carson s early magic shows \( both spent childhoods in norfolk , neb \) , as a studio musician for a radio station and as a ballpark organist here during the college world series bartak can finally be seen as something more than a lithefingered provider of spacefilling background music he is a reminder of how ballparks used to sound , and feel , and how they increasingly do not according to the national baseball hall of fame , organs gained a place at ballparks after the chicago cubs brought one to wrigley field for a game in 1941 it was instantly popular in 1942 , the brooklyn dodgers added a fulltime organist at ebbets field other teams followed , and the trend peaked in the 1960s and 1970s their numbers have dwindled since the hall s director of research , tim wiles , traced at least part of the beginning of the end to a change in ownership for the mets after the 1979 season the longtime organist jane jarvis was nudged out at shea stadium in favor of canned music teams wanted their music to rock , not reverberate most major league teams do not employ organists anymore even the omaha royals , rosenblatt s primary tenants , stopped using bartak a few seasons ago it is possible that none of the players on the eight teams that made this year s college world series have played in another stadium with an organist the slow death of organ music may soon hit this event , where the organ still thrives as if there were no tomorrow , only yesterdays a new stadium is planned for downtown omaha in 2011 , and bartak doubts that there will be a spot reserved for an organist until then , he punctuates every third out with a threechord coda , and fills part of the still air between innings with a threesong medley he does not plan the song lists , relying simply on some indescribable intuition and the hundreds of song titles he has scrawled before him some are written on a yellow sheet from a legal pad some are on a manila folder some are on random scraps of paper some are on a newsweek subscription card , the kind that spills from magazines inexplicably , bartak has homemade sheet music for a few songs , including the national anthem and take me out to the ball game the sheets are withered and yellowed , and the ink has run bartak does not glance at them i know them all , he said it s really just a crutch at one break between innings , his medley included you are my sunshine , you do n't know me and something else vaguely familiar , which is the way most organ music sounds what else did i play \? bartak said , repeating the question , trying to jog his shortterm memory i do n't remember i probably just made it up the organ at the stadium , the same one that has been there all along , is in need of a makeover its pale paint is cracked in spots , worn away in others for years , it sat above the stands along the thirdbase line in a booth with a leaky roof and unmannered pigeons now it is well protected , almost like a museum piece , in a cramped glasswalled booth inside one end of rosenblatt s press box above the firstbase side the organ blocks bartak s view of home plate , and he waits for a raised arm from a man nearby who runs the stadium s sound system to start playing bartak plays in his stocking feet , because it is easier to move about the pedals a bowl of peanuts sits on the piano a pillow is taped to the wall as a backrest , and another pillow makes the bench softer to sit on inside the bench is more music , some newspaper clippings , crossword puzzles , pretzels and mms for most of the game , bartak s playing causes no ruckus and barely garners attention in the stands that is both the organ s charm and its curse , depending on your appetite for distraction but he is well known here , and receives warm applause when he is introduced before games when the seventhinning stretch arrives , the first few notes of ball game , as bartak s handwritten sheet music calls it , lifts more than 20 , 000 people to their feet and gets them singing for a moment , the organ is not just part of the ambient sound , but is plugged into the fans the video scoreboard shows bartak playing , and he gives a wave and returns the applause when the song ends the game continues and bartak disappears into the background , waiting for the signal to play again
i guess brad lidge was ready to make amends for that little hiccup in july two strikeouts , one foul pop , see ya the phillies just closed out game 1 with a 32 win , and it s a great opening punch to the rays they feel very confident at home , and any chance to steal a game is huge then again , that s what the red sox had every reason to think after taking game 1 of the alcs cole hamels pitched exactly as he was supposed to 7 strong innings scott kazmir pitched exactly as he was supposed to 6 very shaky innings , mostly early both bullpens , particularly grant balfour for the rays and the ryan madsonlidge combo for the phillies , were fantastic the phillies will be in a great mood tonight , but they have to be worried about ryan howard , who continued his october struggles with an 0 for 4 , threestrikeout night where he looked awful he was swinging too hard , then in the ninth with two runners on , seemingly a little spooked , he couldn t pull the trigger and struck out looking the rays will be annoyed after the loss , but manager joe maddon will be upbeat as always , and he has good reason it was an incredibly tight game that , because cole hamels is simply better than scott kazmir , went to the phillies i have two clubhouses to vamoose to see you tomorrow , folks  middle 9th here we go phillies 3 , rays 2 11 49 pm there s something beautiful about baseball that sets up situations like this at the allstar game this year , scott kazmir was the winning pitcher for the american league , in part because brad lidge gave up the winning run in the bottom of the 15th \( this is the same brad lidge who wound up converting all 41 of his save opportunities this season \) this is why we re now in st petersburg , with the american leaguechampion rays hosting games 1 and 2 of the world series well , brad lidge is about to come in in the ninth with the phillies holding a 32 lead , in a game that kazmir started if he converts the save , the phillies will have negated the homefield advantage that lidge squandered three and a half months ago and he s facing nos 3 , 4 and 5 carlos pena , evan longoria and carl crawford one irrelevant note one world series record has already been broken , but yet to be mentioned most interviews by a player not on the roster \( jonny gomes , rays , 832 \) paging ryan howard  middle 8th wish granted phillies 3 , rays 2 11 24 pm uh , grant balfour is back one of the rays top relievers this season at one point , he d given up something like 20 hits in 45 innings balfour was the primary culprit in the rays blowing a 70 lead to the red sox in game 5 of the alcs , giving up five runs he walked two of three batters in game 6 , leading to rays manager joe maddon to openly suggest that balfour was struggling , something that had to be noticed by the very emotional balfour \( maddon suggested he pitch even angrier \) balfour , throwing mid90s gas and surely still swearing to himself after almost every pitch , struck out shane victorino to end a firstandthird threat in the sixth and just retired the side in the seventh , keeping the rays in the game with two more times up as if the rays needed another effective reliever  end 7th mr consistency phillies 3 , rays 2 11 16 pm managers who prattle on about how they want their players to be consistent never seem to want them to be consistently , you know , bad but with cole hamels , charlie manuel doesn t have to worry about that this october here are hamels s pitching lines this postseason \( standard ip , h , r , er , bb , so \) take a look in particular at the last three 10 1 vs brewers 8 2 0 0 1 9 \( win \) 10 9 vs dodgers 7 6 2 2 2 8 \( win \) 10 15 vs dodgers 7 5 1 1 3 5 \( win \) tonight vs rays 7 5 2 2 2 5 \( we ll see \)  middle 7th thank you , fox phillies 3 , rays 2 10 55 pm twenty world series ago , after kirk gibson hit his home run off dennis eckersley , radio announcer jack buck declared , i don t believe what i just saw ! with his son joe calling the game tonight for fox , i can t believe what i just heard thanks to fox s having miked home plate umpire tim welke \( yes , i have the tv audio feed here at the park \) rays manager joe maddon , objecting to a nonbalk call on cole hamels when carlos pena was picked off , came out and made his case calmly but firmly welke listened and basically said , ok , i see what you re saying , we ll look at it later i hate it when managers waste time by arguing calls but maddon is so respected for picking his spots that when he does argue , umpires actually listen that can t hurt as this game let alone the rest of this series proceeds  end 6th who s pitching for rays \? phillies 3 , rays 2 10 47 pm assuming scott kazmir is done , it will be very interesting to see how rays manager joe maddon handles his bullpen from here on out chase utley and ryan howard will bat second and third in the top of the 7th , so a lefty will definitely be in how crazy will this place go if it s david price \? i ll bet maddon goes with more experienced jp howell this time , and then brings price in in the ninth  middle 6th kazmir survives \( toldja \) phillies 3 , rays 2 10 40 pm as predicted earlier , scott kazmir just finished the sixth inning without giving up a run , meaning he ll probably leave now having pitched six innings and yielded three runs a word on quality starts , which will surely be mocked yet again because kazmir has pitched the bare minimum to qualify for one you ll hear people whine , three earned runs in just six innings \? that s a 450 era ! boooooooooooo ! these are the same folks who usually bow at the altar of pitchers wins , but never seem to have a problem with a pitcher getting a victory in a 128 blowout despite giving up 6 earned in five innings a starting pitcher s win just means , basically , that his team outscored the opponent while he pitched five innings at least a quality start suggests a bare minimum of effective pitching  end 5th where have you gone , steve bartman \? phillies 3 , rays 2 10 32 pm i have to admit , i ve come to like tropicana field as i ve covered the rays pretty hard since august sure , it s a dreary dome , but the fans are pretty good , the staff is superfriendly and the parking is second to none but my confidence in the fans was just shaken , perhaps irretrievably how in the world did the fans behind first base let ryan howard catch bj upton s foul pop to end the inning with a runner on second and the rays rallying \? can you imagine if carlos pena ventures toward the citizens bank crowd in games 3 , 4 or 5 \? they ll steal his fillings , for crying out loud  middle 5th looking ahead phillies 3 , rays 1 10 11 pm i m sorry , but pat burrell was so inside and out of the baseline on that kazmirtopena muffed throw that he might as well highfived jason bartlett on his way by anyway so scott kazmir still got through the phillies big boppers , chase utley and ryan howard , in the fifth and still is down only 31 kazmir will almost certainly not face them again which means that a strategic decision by charlie manuel will soon be tested manuel batted utley third and howard fourth , which is not exactly rare for him but with the rays boasting three effective lefthanders in the bullpen jp howell , trever miller and david price there s little chance either of the phillies best bats will have a platoon advantage atbat for the rest of the game \( no righthander is batting between them \) just something to watch if the rays come back in the meantime  end 4th crawford s moment phillies 3 , rays 1 10 03 pm well , clearly the rays don t like being down by 3 carl crawford homered to right , which was nice to see crawford , the longesttenured member of the rays , has been a class act throughout many dreary years in tampa bay several years ago , when delmon young , josh hamilton , rocco baldelli and even thenshortstop bj upton were looking like they d form a great young outfield , crawford \( one of the team s only good players \) figured to be traded , a la joey gaithright but here he is , enjoying the fruits of his , and his team s , patience  middle 4th three runs down phillies 3 , rays 0 9 53 pm i ve had a chance to check it again , and it doesn t appear to me as if the rays have been down by 3 runs in this entire postseason 11plus games until now , thanks to carlos ruiz s runscoring groundout in the 4th how will this affect joe maddon s handling of the bullpen \? if the game gets away a bit , whom will he burn to save arms for game 2 \? it s been a while since he s had to think about that  end 3rd feliz and more phillies 2 , rays 0 9 42 pm anyone wondering why mike schmidt said during the lineup introductions that the phillies pedro feliz is one of the best defensive third basemen he s seen just got an idea why nice pick to start the 543 double play and end a rays basesloaded threat in the 3rd i had predicted that bj upton would strike out , and he actually did something worse if the fact that the rays have been down by 2 for three innings feels a little strange , it should unless i ve missed something it s pretty hard to triplecheck things up here , unless the homeplate umpire wants to hurt his collarbone the rays were down by 2 runs for just six total innings in 7 games against the red sox they never once were down by 3 or more  middle 3rd why people love utley phillies 2 , rays 0 9 27 pm three innings into the series , we ve already gotten an eyeful as to why the phillies chase utley is one of the most respected players in baseball first inning tworun home run third inning man on second with none out , ground ball to right side to move runner to third ryan howard and pat burrell didn t help matters by striking out immediately afterward but utley has already done one big thing and one small thing that baseball people really respect by the way , notice that scott kazmir settled down in the third , just like a few weeks ago \( see below \) let s monitor that in the fourth and fifth  end 2nd memory lane phillies 2 , rays 0 just remembered something cool as cole hamels coasts past his second inning in may 2000 , i went to a high school game outside san diego to see two top prospects who eventually never did much but the afternoon wasn t a total loss a sophomore lefthander had left scouts buzzing an excerpt from my story afterward what s that kid s name \? asks don lindeberg , the welltanned devil rays scout watching from the thirdbase line this is lindeberg s 55th year of scouting branch rickey hired him for the dodgers in 1946 but he still gets excited at another fresh arm a quick check of his roster shows that no 19 is cole hamels , a 6foot lefty just pitched a whale of a game held poway high to seven hits in 6 2 3 innings in a 31 win can t be more than 145 pounds soaking wet , but he s got an idea of what he s doing out there , lindeberg says he s a helluva follow follow means that scouts will have to wait for cole hamels he s only a sophomore told of lindeberg s praise after the game , hamels says , it s nice to get noticed , but he s too shy and inexperienced to offer much more his smile , full of braces , says it all  middle 2nd kazmir down , upton up phillies 2 , rays 0 9 10 pm don t assume that scott kazmir , the struggling rays starter , is in for a long night in game 2 of the al division series here against the chicago white sox at tropicana field a few weeks ago , kazmir was horrid for the first two innings he yielded two runs on 37 pitches in the first , and a walk and a single in the second inning prompted rays manager joe maddon to get two relievers up in the bullpen but kazmir got the third out before a run scored , and the sox never scored against him again in 5 2 3 innings in the rays eventual 62 win bj upton has made throws like the one that just nailed shane victorino several times this season he s emerging on the national scene just now , but people around the rays are quite used to this  end 1st escorekeeper \( 1 \) phillies 2 , rays 0 8 58 pm already , it s escorekeeper \( 1 \) please don t ask me why the official scorekeeper tonight gave akinori iwamura a single on his routine ground ball to ryan howard all howard had to do was toss the ball to cole hamels covering the bag instead he kept running with it , looking a little like brandon jacobs , and celebrated iwamura crossing first ahead of him by giving hamels a big hug and for all you wiseguys out there , i wrote that bit about howard s defense 60 seconds before that play  middle 1st utley goes deep 8 52 pm ok , so maybe the phillies hitters won t be rusty after the 6day layoff anyone notice that ryan howard swung harder on the first pitch after chase utley s home run than utley did himself \? one thought while watching ben zobrist catch jimmy rollins s slice on the first batter of the game before this postseason , zobrist , a former shortstop , had never fielded a ball in right field in his threeyear major league career he played only seven innings in right field in 2008 and never had an official fielding chance he did play seven innings out there during the alcs against the red sox interesting defensive tidbit to watch not unlike how ryan howard \( 1b \) and pat burrell \( lf \) , both poor defensive players , are still out there on the turf for the phillies tonight and not dhing  some pitching thoughts before first pitch 7 56 pm the rays scott kazmir and the phillies cole hamels face each other tonight as two of the best young lefties in each league the first thing to watch for with kazmir is whether he can locate his fastball even though kazmir has always been a model of inefficiency he has led the majors in pitches per inning each of the last three years that has been a particularly serious problem lately , although he did rebound during his game 5 start against the red sox he also must locate his slider , or he could be gone by the third inning hamels enters the series on a far better roll , but here s one thought everyone was talking in the raysred sox series about boston lefty jon lester looking a bit tired , and they usually cited his high total pitch count in 2008 hamels does not look like he s dragging , but with his second pitch tonight , he will pass lester for second in the majors in pitches this year \( regular and postseason \) , according to stats llc 1 cc sabathia , indians brewers 3 , 912 2 jon lester , red sox 3 , 738 3 cole hamels , phillies 3 , 737 4 tim lincecum , giants 3 , 682 5 aj burnett , blue jays 3 , 650 here are hamels s pitch and inning totals the last three years entering tonight 2006 2 , 178 pitches , 1321 innings 2007 2 , 906 pitches , 190 innings 2008 3 , 737 pitches , 2491 innings major league officials generally avoid having their young pitchers increase more than 40 innings from one year to the next , and hamels will have done that two years in a row just something to think about if hamels , even it isn t until game 5 because of the long layoff before tonight s game , starts looking a bit winded one final tidbit kazmir and hamels were taken nos 15 and 17 , respectively , by the mets and phillies in the 2002 draft who knows , maybe they ll eventually go down among the cooler pairings in draft history , joining 1980 world series third basemen mike schmidt and george brett \( drafted consecutively in the second round in 1971 \) and tom glavine and greg maddux \( both drafted in the second round in 1984 \)  sights and sounds from bp 6 25 pm because i am here and you re not , dear reader , i am compelled to relay the following sensory delights from early batting practice 1 \) a fox tech wiring third base for sound no word if it can also emit any sounds , such as , run , bj , run ! 2 \) xm radio s rob dibble berating a tech back in the studio because his earpiece wasn t working quite visible was his monstrous 1990 world series ring , which from where i stood may or may not fit into his mouth 3 \) mike schmidt announcing the starting lineups , presumably for fox on the take i saw , he finished saying , batting ninth , cole hamels , before signing off enjoy the 198 he clunked the microphone down on the dugout bench 1980 world series , he sighed nice 4 \) frank viola , the former new york met who does pre and postgame analysis for bright house sports network , strolling around saying hi to old friends it s too bad that viola wasn t here one game ago , because he surely would have bumped into tbs analyst ron darling viola and darling , of course , staged one of the great pitching duels of all time \( immortalized in a roger angell essay \) in 1981 while at st john s and yale , respectively , when darling nohit st john s for 11 innings but lost to viola 10 in the 12th i wanted to come see him , but i had a wedding , viola said it would have been good to reminisce 5 \) matt garza and andy sonnanstine , the rays scheduled game 3 and 4 starters in philadelphia , practicing bunting for games in which they will have to hit attention , charlie manuel garza s five attempted squeezes during one round produced maybe one that could have worked better than erick aybar s

they defeated tampa bay s prospects 53 in traverse city here s the story on the rangers website you can see this game tonight on the nhl network at 8 pm edt be sure to count the shots totals the stars and thrashers prospects have each won all three of their games and they face off today in the tourney s championship game james neal of the stars leads all tournament scorers with three goals , three assists in three games and stars cogm les jackson tell mike heika blogging in the dallas morning news , he s been our best player he s engaged in the game , he s engaged with the team , and he s on a mission he wants to make the big club which is probably the goal for most of the players in this tournament , the fourteam kitchener tournament or the threeteam oil country tournament board biz all the reports we ve seen have said the nhl board of governors did little yesterday and were merely updated on various agenda items by gary bettman and bill daly the stories that came out of the meeting centered on the nhl s fate in the wake of the current north american economic woes and financial market crisis but we suspect the owners were not passive listeners on matters like the nhl s international relationships but likely engaged in a discussion on how best for the league to proceed in these matters , perhaps debating the wisdom of negotiating a new transfer agreement , which mr bettman says he favors and the quick dismissal of further expansion talk outside the meeting was likely preceded by a recognition among owenrship of the current economic mess and how impractical it would be to grant new franchises with the financial sector in turmoil the nhl has not posted a transcript of mr bettman s post meeting press conference update we were wrong about that , it s on nhlcom , but it wasn t where we expected to find it , on the league s mediaonly website , hence our error ryan dixon in the hockey news has more quotes from bettman than most of the other stories on nhlkhl relations the nhl remains angry , quite justifiably , at alexander radulov s jump to the khl while under contract to nashville it also remains upset about its perception of the iihf s lack of action in the matter in the toronto star , kevin mcgran quotes the commissioner on possible nhl retaliation against the khl over the radulov matter , writing bettman suggested the nhl s involvement in the victoria cup , and other iihf events , could be at risk possibly , but i m not answering it with certainty because i don t want to appear to be the least bit heavyhanded in this situation , he said we will have to evaluate our options as this unfolds' there was more from nashville gm david poile that a new transfer agreement is needed \( quoted by lance hornby of the toronto sun \) , although it s unclear whether the owners as a group see an agreement in their collective interest poile s quote , right now , it s an issue for nashville , but it should be an issue all 29 teams are concerned with , seems to indicate there is not complete agreement on this but at least , despite their collective anger at the khl and iihf , they are not leaping to any retaliatory action poile also reiterated that he thinks radulov would like to return to the nhl \( i ve not talked to the player , but yes , i do believe he wants to come back \) , but still , no real evidence has been produced to substantiate that that hasn t stopped stories like this from mike brophy , writing on sportsnetca  these supposed beliefs that radulov wants to return are based on nhlpa head paul kelly s inside information which has yet to be corroborated that implied radulov is unhappy there and poile s knowledge of the player s sentiments before he signed with the khl that he wanted to prove himself in the nhl to us , that doesn t quite add up yet to what is being claimed jeez , might someone be engaging in a little disinformation campaign here \? meanwhile , we hear nothing from radulov and we saw a short mention in the russian sports press within the last week to the effect that radulov didn t want to discuss this matter any longer \( but we can t find the article just now sorry \) tim wharnsby in the globe and mail led with the lack of news on the expansion front espncom s pierre lebrun has a good overview and adds his own views of the meeting and he leads off with the news on the economic

the first time at rangers training camp in suburban greenburgh , and here are the stories and blog posts from the beat writers lynn zinser in the times writes about the team s adjustment to life after jaromir jagr and other assorted topics , adding the news the lyon messier will come to camp he s been with the rangers prospects in traverse city just wondering if there s a prospect camp for gms so lyon s dad can show his stuff in the journal news , sam weinman writes there s a bit less euphoria around camp compared to last season \( supply your own punchline \) , but the team is still aiming for the stanley cup , which only 28 other teams are doing this time of year \( the lone preseason surrender coming from maple leafs interim gm until we re relegated cliff fletcher \) plus weinman is

starting with the morning scrimmage between the blue team and the white team \( white won 43 \) mark herman in newsday thinks scott gomez and chris drury should share the captaincy in the bergen record , andrew gross interviews chris drury who hopes he can step it up in his second rangers season devils doings it s tough being an nhl coach , but is there a franchise whose coaches have experienced more turmoil than the devils \? between earlyseason and lateseason dismissals , postseason resignations and lifethreatening illness , none who have stood behind the devils bench seem to escape it and now , mark everson of the post has heard the whispers that devils coach brent sutter leans toward north american players and away from europeans , whispers that took shape after he immediately stripped patrik elias of the captaincy last season , and grew louder when karel rachunek and vitaly vishnevski became afterthoughts on a soso defense when sergei brylin left the team after 13 years to play in russia , he suggested that the way he was used by sutter was part of the reason for his departure in this morning s ny post , everson asks suter if the allegations are true sutter quickly took off his red and white roots varsity jacket , put down his virgin bloody caesar in the stainless steel tim horton s travel mug , turned off his ipod filled with gordon lightfoot , rheostatics , neil young , feist , kdlang , guess who , rush , the tragically hip and joni mitchell tracks , folded up his copy of central alberta farmer magazine , stowed his copy of grapes \( as told to stan fischler \) in his corner gas backpack and responded , that s nonsense that s not true decisions are made on players it doesn t matter where they re from it has zero to do with it i look at the team it doesn t matter what nationality they are it s not true the devils , as everson points out , still have elias , dainius zubrus and johnny oduya and they did sign bobby holik \( or what s left of him \) this summer he names nicklas bergfors , petr vrana , fedor fedorov and anssi salmela as players who all have a legitimate chance to make the team sneaky lou lamoriello , the devs gm , has been occasionally accused of creative rosterkeeping to evade the salary cap blogging for the bergen record , tom gulitti asked sneaky lou to clear up vitaly vishnevski s status it s been reported that the devils let him to to the khl s lokomotiv yaroslavl but are still paying him this season so they can retain his rights sneaky lou says they are not paying him and once the season starts his salary won t be counted against the devs salary cap , but they will retain his rights sneaky lou says he might put vishnevski on waivers at some point during the season lamoriello also told gulitti that staff at the rock have worked this summer on trying to improve the ice , which he attributes to the computer regulating the temperature but you never know until you start playing on it it has a lot to do with the balance in the building with the temperature , he said sneakily gulitti wrote yesterday that goalie kevin weekes would be ready to go from the start of camp after surgery in may on his arm to repair a torn bicep tendon in today s starledger , rich chere reports the devs have scott clemmensen in camp , just in case the best job in the nhl over the past 13 seasons has been devils backup goalie you get the best seat in the house and you re well paid for playing eight games a season if the devils want to lessen the workload on marty brodeur this season , sutter is going to need confidence in whoever is behind marty and he s going to want to check the guy s passport just kidding hey , brent is tough as rich chere points out , he fired his brother brian as coach of the whl s red deer rebels this summer on the island mike comrie , interviewed this morning on ottawa radio team 1200 called fiancee hillary duff a good little hockey girlfriend , which host steve warne said will probably cost comrie a new mercedes comrie , greg logan reports in newsday , has unannounced hip surgery in may \( hence the photos of the lovely couple which showed the hockey player on crutches

the long island rail road s etiquette bully has walked again john clifford , notorious for loudly and aggressively harassing fellow riders to make them behave better , was acquitted on tuesday of assault , disorderly conduct and other charges stemming from an ugly encounter on the long beach line last year judge larry stephen of manhattan criminal court said most of the witnesses had an ax to grind , and threw the case out and so mr clifford despite years of complaints , arrests and summonses , none of which have stuck is free to keep doing what he does abusing fellow commuters in the name of peace , quiet and civility do i admit to being domineering \? he said in court yeah actually , he admits a lot worse pouring coffee on people , cursing and berating them , slapping them for talking too loudly on cellphones and other sins he is a large \( 6foot4 \) former police officer , so it is easy to see why someone might be frightened when he comes after them , especially when he says as he did to donna decurtis that he knows their names and where they live , and that i can make your life hell it is true that many people have forgotten how to interact respectfully with strangers and carry their selfabsorbed behavior into public places on commuter trains , where random strangers are forced to tolerate one another in close quarters for long stretches , cellphone jabberers are a particularly obnoxious lifeform none of this excuses vigilantism the railroad has many problems , including keeping its trains running and helping riders hurdle the gap between cars and platforms it needs to do a lot more to instill a culture of decency and respect on board whether this means adding quiet cars , where cellphones are forbidden , or enforcing existing rules about loud conversations , feet on the seats and eating , it is important the judicial system also needs to recognize that harassing and threatening behavior like that repeatedly displayed by mr clifford is not only wrong , it could be downright dangerous that is n't an ax to grind it is just common sense
my first day at oxford took an unusual turn when a stranger walked up to me and said are you american \? and do you play basketball \? unbeknown to me , the man was brian porth , the firstyear coach of the oxford basketball team he happened to be at argos , the local catalog store , and was intrigued enough by my 6foot8 frame to ask if i was interested in playing my first instinct was to say no my last two seasons at penn ended with my body breaking down , culminating in back surgery i was in no rush to get back to working out three times a day and taking painkillers at night add the fact that i did not want my graduate education to be dominated by sports the way my undergraduate education was , and i was definitely hesitant porth assured me that english basketball was different he said oxford had only 10 regularseason games and had the gym only twice a week to practice he was willing to be flexible around my academic calendar no one , he told me , comes to oxford to play basketball a few days later , i stopped by the gym to play with the returning players on my first possession , i dropped off an assist to a cutting teammate in the united states , i would have expected him to say nice pass instead i heard cheers yes , in england , an assist is inevitably followed by cheers and a missed shot by unlucky , mate , unlucky the jargon on the court was strange , but that was nothing compared to tryouts , which consisted of 60 new players competing for three open spots so , 57 players were cut in an hour and a half , or one every 95 seconds the mode of evaluation was simple layups after a halfhour , porth divided the players into two groups twenty players who appeared to remotely understand the game were invited to stay the others were informed that their recently acquired dream of playing basketball was over after a fullcourt scrimmage , 20 became 3 , and the tryout was over why the rush \? well , oxford is on the trimester system , meaning classes start weeks after they do at most universities in britain so while teams throughout the country were practicing , oxford students were still drifting back to campus the university mandates that tryouts occur on the first friday of the term , and that leaves just five days before the first game with only a sunday practice scheduled before the game , porth wanted to use the time allotted to tryouts as an additional practice the gym at oxford is hard to schedule , and boxing was supposed to take over the court after us now , if it were badminton , we could get away with running a little late , but none of us really want to pick a fight with the boxers i was not worried about making the team , but i was worried about trying to play a game after just one practice it seems like a recipe for disaster , but the guys insisted that we were in better shape than last year for example , this year , we have a coach last year , the coach left during the season , and the team had to coach itself with two rhodes scholars on the team , intellect was not the issue but being a playercoach is not easy , and the team struggled to a 113 record after the season , oxford was relegated because of the lastplace finish that means the team did so poorly it was moved down a division picture florida state being moved to the ivy league after another lastplace finish in the atlantic coast conference so now , with just four days until our first game , i am taking a crash course in international basketball i am becoming used to the trapezoidal lane and the slick fiba basketballs while picking up a little british slang along the way it feels good to be competing again , and on wednesday , i will start my first game since penn played texas am in the ncaa tournament that , of course , is assuming our coach does not find a new frontline at argos in the meantime
to the editor re as clinton seeks gas tax break for summer , obama says no \( front page , april 29 \) it is encouraging when republicans and democrats find common ground on an issue , but the mccainclinton consensus on suspending the gasoline excise tax is simply a bad idea at a fixed 184 cents per gallon , federal taxes are a dwindling component of pump prices , which are primarily driven by supply and demand eliminating the tax would only encourage drivers to put off the hard decision on conservation and send more dollars overseas while politicians squirm , consumers seem willing to pay the piper rather than change their driving habits that will come if prices continue to increase , perhaps by raising the excise tax it would have to increase significantly to equal the tax europeans pay , and they have responded by driving smaller , more efficient cars combining the tax with a rebate would reduce the pain for drivers , while giving the rest of us a bonus for using car pools or public transportation allan ostergren director , institute for socioeconomic studies white plains , april 29 , 2008  to the editor if , as we learn in your april 29 frontpage article , lifting the gas tax for three months would save the average consumer no more than 30 , why is this clintonmccain idea even being discussed \? the simple remedy is to save money by driving less and help the environment at the same time does airing the candidates' plan on the front page serve any purpose other than a political one \? mel minthorn wilton , conn , april 29 , 2008  to the editor i must commend senators john mccain and hillary rodham clinton for advocating the suspension of the federal gas tax during the summer months while this tax abatement may not create huge savings for us motorists , it will provide some relief , and at this stage any relief is better than none this is why i must totally take issue with senator barack obama s opposition to the tax abatement in statements that appear in your paper , senator obama states at a north carolina rally that this will result in a savings of only 30 or a half a tank of gas well , perhaps to senator obama 30 may seem like nothing but for the rest of americans , any savings we can get to offset the huge cost of gas as well as the increased cost of daily staples , which have also risen as a result , would be much appreciated an extra 30 in my pocket this summer would be helpful as i cope to fill up my car , which i use frequently for work and to buy food james booth central valley , ny , april 29 , 2008  to the editor re the gasguzzler gambit \( editorial , may 1 \) i could n't agree more that suspending the federal gas tax is a completely unhelpful idea consumers need to change their habits , not have their current habits pandered to because of high gas prices , i now walk my fifthgrade son to school every morning it s a mile of exercise and good conversation for both of us it s particularly gratifying when we walk past long lines of suv s stopped at traffic lights , all going to the same place we are do we really want to make it easier for those drivers \? kevin griffith columbus , ohio , may 1 , 2008  to the editor at a time when environmentally conscious americans worry about the carbon emissions of their every action , thomas l friedman \( dumb as we wanna be , column , april 30 \) reveals that our lawmakers have not extended any stimulus for solar and wind energy production it is outrageous that america is not heavily invested in the research and production of new energy technologies , while the world s reliance on oil , gas and coal is spiraling out of control without innovation , individual carbon footprints will be lost in the fog of the earth s burning fossil fuels sharon aucoin north andover , mass , april 30 , 2008  to the editor thomas l friedman is critical of senator hillary rodham clinton s proposal of a suspended gas tax from memorial day to labor day , saying , good for barack obama for resisting this shameful pandering i must differ this suspension of the gas tax is no cure , and was not presented as such this is relief for people who must use their vehicles to go to and from work , their costs have doubled , but their incomes have not this savings can put food on the table , pay for a prescription or a visit to the doctor for those who do not live in ivory towers , and opine on theory , life is very real and very hard let s see this for what it is a muchneeded helping hand judith lacher new york , april 30 , 2008
the hearts of highly trained , competitive athletes are different from yours and mine they 're bigger , pump slower , and often churn out strange results during routine electrocardiograms \( ekg \) , a test that assesses heart rhythm these abnormalities have been dismissed for the most part as benign , adaptations to strenuous exercise but a study published last week in the new england journal of medicine questions that wisdom the study examined a database of several decades' worth of medical records of young , male , elite athletes in italy eightyone of the athletes were found to have wildly abnormal ekg readings if found in nonathletes , these readings would have triggered panic , since they seemed to indicate cardiomyopathy , an inflammation of the heart that can result in heart failure none of the 81 elite athletes showed other signs of cardiomyopathy , though , and they were cleared to play over the next 10 years , 6 percent of those athletes turned out to have cardiomyopathies two suffered cardiac arrests and one , just 24 , died suddenly none of a control group of 229 athletes with normal ekgs developed cardiomyopathies the lesson , the study s authors conclude , is that strange ekgs in highly trained athletes should n't be ignored they may be , in fact , an early marker for disease not yet evident , says dr barry maron , one of the study s authors all athletes whose heart tests are odd , he says , should be closely monitored and regularly retested the number of athletes at risk is very small , he cautions but any cardiac arrest that might , by chance , have been avoided , especially among young athletes , is a tragedy
you know you 're being manipulated from start to finish by inheritance , a documentary on wednesday on s series pov , but that does n't make its most powerful moments any less so the film , by james moll , is reminiscent of one of those talkshow reunions of longseparated twins , in that any spontaneity is suspect because you know the whole thing was arranged but this is no daytimetelevision frivolity mr moll brings together monika hertwig , daughter of the commander of a nazi concentration camp , and helen jonas , who as a teenage prisoner in that camp was compelled to work in the commander s house the camp in question , plaszow , and the commander , amon goeth , were central to the film schindler s list \( goeth was played by ralph fiennes \) , but mr moll wisely does n't make too much of the hollywood connection he realizes that the two women s emotional struggles are the heart of the matter for the first third of the film , as the women prepare to meet , it seems clear that ms hertwig has had the worst of it over the years born in 1945 , just before the end of the war and just a year before her father was hanged , she only gradually became aware of who he was and of his reputation as a brutal killer when mr moll brings the two women together at the plaszow camp memorial in poland , it is ms hertwig who breaks down but the emotions shift dramatically when the women go to goeth s villa , where ms jonas had lived in terror until oskar schindler rescued her \( after the war she moved to the united states \) her reaction as she revisits the rooms she once knew are visceral and immediate the cameras are forgotten throughout , mr moll illustrates the narrative with a remarkable collection of archival materials , right down to photographs of goeth s dogs then , just when you think he has wrung all the emotions out of his premise , the women jolt you again , describing how the wartime experiences affected their loved ones for decades after for some of them , there was no peace and there is none , really , for ms jonas and ms hertwig , as this wrenching film makes clear
kirkland , wash at the ' holiday party last month , teammates dragged matt hasselbeck onto the dance floor a crowd gathered around there went hasselbeck , 32 years old and bald , a quarterback whose coach once likened his running style to a giraffe on ice skates all the shaking and shimmying left teammates wondering if they were witnessing an audition for dancing with the stars it was n't pretty , but i was proud of him , receiver nate burleson said how many pro bowl quarterbacks would get down like that \? tom brady can have his broken records , brett favre his agedefying season , peyton manning his dozens of commercials , tony romo his popstar girlfriend in an nfl postseason heavy on quarterbacks of national renown , in a seahawks season hinging on his right arm , hasselbeck exudes a lesscelebrated , selfdeprecating cool he owns neither a comb nor the highest q rating in his family in fact , the hasselbeck clan made national news this week , and he was n't part of it in case you missed it , his sisterinlaw , elisabeth hasselbeck , is returning from maternity leave to her post as a cohost on the view i will say this i'm international , matt hasselbeck said we ca n't go out in public in british columbia victoria , bc , forget about it it s like pavel bure back in russia plus , we take alaska , hawaii , oregon and idaho hasselbeck sat in a hallway at the seahawks' facility as he said this , his right wrist wrapped in ice and propped on a training table this business about q ratings left him confused last time he checked , his 914 rating ranked eighth among nfl quarterbacks told that q ratings measure a celebrity s name recognition , he burst out laughing i thought you were talking about qb rating , hasselbeck said that s the only rating i care about on the surface , this seahawks season feels like 2005 all over again that year they won the national football conference west beat the redskins , their opponent saturday , at home in their first playoff game then went on to lose the super bowl that seahawks team found its identity in the best offensive line in football this seahawks team draws its identity from its quarterback he s the best player on our team , the offensive coordinator gil haskell said it is his team , and he knows that , and he s taken over that role with an assist from seahawks coach mike holmgren , of course their relationship dates to green bay , where hasselbeck was a sixthround draft pick and practicesquad quarterback and holmgren was the coach with the super bowl rings and the local street named after him two years after holmgren took the seahawks job , he traded for hasselbeck of all the quarterbacks holmgren helped make famous joe montana and steve young with the 49ers , favre with the packers hasselbeck is the only one holmgren handpicked they 've grown over the years , receiver bobby engram said of holmgren and hasselbeck they 're a little bit coachplayer , a little bit fatherson , a little bit studentteacher , a little bit parentchild all of that rolled into one growth required growing pains hasselbeck arrived in seattle an excitable , fiery young quarterback who once called his college coach a clown eventually , he bought into holmgren s system they grew to understand each other then one wednesday in early november , hasselbeck saw holmgren in the elevator of the team s practice facility by the way , holmgren told him i told everyone in my monday press conference we 're going to throw the ball more even though the elevator only goes between two floors , they rode up and down for a twominute conversation holmgren told hasselbeck he wanted to go back to his roots , spread the ball , throw to set up the run basically , what we do best is how haskell described it at that point , seattle was 44 shaun alexander was halfway through a season s worth of injuries hasselbeck would get the ball how he responded would dictate the seahawks' season the seahawks played host to san francisco next , and footballs went flying everywhere it reminded burleson of the seahawksgiants game last season , when receivers spread in fourwide sets and gashed the giants' secondary in a 4230 victory it reminded tackle walter jones of the 2005 playoff game against the redskins , in which alexander left in the first quarter with an injury and hasselbeck threw the seahawks into the nfc championship game engram said that s something our offense is capable of and from start to finish , this has been his best year hasselbeck reached career highs in yards \( 3 , 966 \) and touchdown passes \( 28 \) his 562 attempts were 49 more than his previous high and fourth most in the league teammates and coaches noticed a difference in how hasselbeck carried himself this season hasselbeck has always been a leader , but haskell said he directed other players more often during practice hasselbeck has always been quick to joke , but this season , alexander said , he seems more comfortable in his own skin than any other year i 've been around him he finally believed he is one of the best quarterbacks in football , alexander added he s always the guy who should belong to the top group , but it s easy to forget how many guys won their division four years in a row \? and went to the super bowl in the last four years \? our guy has but everybody forgets hasselbeck does not mind living in relative anonymity he can go to a restaurant and eat without getting mobbed , despite endorsements with campbell s , state farm insurance and reebok , among others he s not trying to create something magical for himself off the field , the quarterbacks coach jim zorn said he s a man of perspective , if you will but hasselbeck knows this the 10 games he passed for more than 248 yards this season , the pro bowl nod , the division title , none of that means anything if the seahawks fail in the playoffs i have n't done anything yet , hasselbeck said hasselbeck ranks as the top quarterback in franchise history , but his playoff career has been marked more by failure than success he owns a 34 record in the playoffs and an 02 mark in overtime , including the famous loss at green bay in 2004 hasselbeck said on national television , we want the ball , and we 're going to score then threw an interception the packers returned for the winning touchdown last season , hasselbeck sustained a rib injury in the seahawks' opener , tore the medial collateral ligament in his right knee in week 7 , broke two fingers in week 12 and took a hit against chicago in the playoffs that proved too much for his injured left shoulder after surgery on the shoulder , hasselbeck said , it took him until late september to feel normal again now , he finds himself surrounded by famous quarterbacks in the playoffs they might make more money , break more records and star in more commercials , but hasselbeck fits right there burleson said being out here on the corner of the map , people do n't really give him as much credit as he deserves plus , he can dance
danilo gallinari s rookie season is on hold , but not yet in jeopardy gallinari , the ' firstround pick , received a cortisone shot in his sore back thursday afternoon and is being prescribed extended rest as he tries to recover from a bulging disc the knicks announced friday morning that gallinari had received the shot his third since september on the recommendation of two specialists although the team did not announce a timetable , gallinari is likely to be sidelined at least a few weeks in the meantime , gallinari plans to seek additional opinions on his longterm management options , according to a statement from the team so far , none of the doctors consulted by the team have recommended surgery , an outcome that gallinari and team officials clearly hope to avoid it is being reserved as a last option the team is troubled , however , by his slow recovery gallinari injured his back in his first summerleague game , on july 14 , when knocked to the floor by robert traylor the pain has persisted for months , despite rest , physical therapy and two previous cortisone shots , which were administered before training camp gallinari felt well enough to begin practicing with the team in late october he played sparingly in the knicks' first two games but he seemed limited and the team shut him down the most recent magnetic resonance imaging test , taken tuesday , did not show any significant change from prior exams
greenburgh , ny forward sean avery remained the center of a swirl of attention tuesday without saying a word avery stuck to his vow not to talk to reporters during the rangers' series against the despite being the talk of the league after the nhl broadened its rules on unsportsmanlike conduct to include the stickwaving , goaliedistracting tactic he used in game 3 avery was not in the locker room after practice tuesday , but his teammates did the talking for him they are used to it none of his antics have taken them by surprise he is what he is , forward ryan callahan said he definitely gets under the skin of the other team that s his job and he s good at it the whole team likes that and enjoys how good he does his job avery sparked the current controversy during a fiveonthree power play for the rangers in the second period he faced goalie martin brodeur and waved his stick in brodeur s face brodeur swiped at him once , but otherwise tried to look around him at the shooters i heard the ref behind me warning him , said center chris drury , who skated close to avery i did n't know if sean heard it i just wanted to say , this is what the ref is saying' i did n't want to lose the fiveonthree drury , like most rangers , reacted to avery s theatrics with an amused shrug many said they laughed when you look at it , there were n't any rules like that , said the rangers' captain , jaromir jagr fiveonfive you wo n't do that because the other team would have an advantage fiveonfour but fiveonthree , i thought it was cool i thought it was smart jagr said he also understood the nhl s move to make it a penalty i think they did a good thing because everybody would be using it right now , jagr said it was so good , that s why they put in the new rule perhaps what most annoys opponents about avery is not his success as an agitator he researches ways to rankle them but his scoring ability avery has a goal in each game of this series , including the winner in game 2 , despite scoring only 15 goals in the regular season less than a minute after his stickwaving , avery set up in traditional fashion in front of brodeur , took a pass from center scott gomez and fired it into the net at the time , it gave the rangers a 21 lead avery raced back up the ice , pumping his fists him scoring , that s like pouring salt in the wound , the rangers backup goalie steve valiquette said , adding that he felt for brodeur when he saw what avery was doing he called avery s tactics contrary to the spirit of the game it went far past the usual stream of insults that avery usually hurls at his targets he really does n't shut up , ever , valiquette said he practices on me , i think , so he s warmed up for brodeur it is really annoying i can see how it affects marty i probably would have reacted a little differently sean would have been picking his teeth up off the ice if it was me if avery were only an agitator , he would be far easier to ignore but he has emerged as an allaround player , something that can be measured in the team s record when he is in or not in the lineup last season , the rangers went 1766 down the stretch after acquiring avery in the 57 regularseason games avery played this season , the rangers were 331410 in the 25 he missed because of shoulder and wrist injuries , they went 9133 those are certainly numbers avery can point to when he becomes an unrestricted free agent at season s end he is seeking about 4 million a year and cut off contract negotiations with the rangers in early march when they were not offering those numbers he made 19 million this season opponents may hate him , but avery s teammates appreciate him all season long he s been a huge player for us , forward martin straka said fans love him and they get us going when he s playing well he s got everything he s got good speed , he can play the body , he can fight , he can score goals the energy he s playing with , he s helping everybody everybody , that is , except brodeur slap shot rangers forward colton orr practiced for the first time since sustaining a broken toe late in the regular season
there have been many great jazz photographers but none more accomplished than herman leonard in a celebrated career that began in the late 1940s , mr leonard , now in his mid80s , is responsible for some of the music s defining images his geometrically balanced musician portraits in particular , with their suggestions of cool composure , have long captured what seemed like the essence of jazz ,

september 1987 was a month of ruin and renewal for  then a threeterm senator from delaware , mr biden saw his bid for the democratic nomination for president in tatters after he had been caught cribbing from other politicians' speeches he exited the race amid a chorus of washington chatter that the presidency would never be his yet just as his candidacy was ending , mr biden , as chairman of the senate judiciary committee , was leading the democrats in a successful battle against robert h bork , president ronald reagan s nominee to the supreme court and soon after , mr biden underwent surgery on two brain aneurysms had he continued running for president , friends say , the rigors might have exacerbated his health problems and even killed him the tumult of that period transformed mr biden he settled down into a role as a statesman of the senate , becoming a serious student of policy and government as the democrats' point man on crime and as a champion of the violence against women act , among other bills , mr biden became a close ally of labor unions , civil rights leaders and women s groups while he drew ire from some feminists over the treatment of anita hill during the clarence thomas hearings , in 1991 , he was also the only member of the judiciary committee to emerge with favorable marks from a majority of americans , according to a gallup poll he has become widely recognized as a respected voice on foreign policy , the two iraq wars \( against the first , for the second \) , the balkans conflict , global aids prevention and a wealth of national security issues from his perch as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , he has aggressively criticized president bush for his unilateralist approach to the world it was this expertise in foreign policy that helped raise mr biden s standing with mr obama , who announced in text and email messages early saturday that joseph robinette biden jr , 65 , was his choice to be the next vice president of the united states an irish catholic son of scranton , pa , the sort of white , workingclass city that mr obama is fighting to win this november , mr biden is in some ways a political elder brother to the 47yearold mr obama competitive and protective , far more experienced in government and politics , and already a veteran orator when mr obama was still finding his voice the two became colleagues upon mr obama s entry to the senate in 2005 and his appointment to the foreign relations committee mr obama was perhaps best known at the time for opposing military action in iraq mr biden , who had opposed the persian gulf war in 1991 , worked in 2002 with the committee s ranking republican member , senator richard g lugar of indiana , on a resolution that would authorize action to remove weapons of mass destruction in iraq but not to remove president saddam hussein the white house opposed the idea , which foundered mr biden ultimately voted for the war resolution that mr obama opposed since then , mr biden has been a critic of the bush administration s strategy in iraq and a leading advocate of partitioning that nation into three semiautonomous regions , for shiites , sunnis and kurds modeled somewhat on the division of bosnia in the 1990s , an effort he was involved in this socalled biden plan often referred to that way by mr biden himself has been somewhat praised by mr obama and other leading democrats mr biden achieved a major legislative victory last month when mr bush signed a measure cowritten by mr biden to increase spending significantly over the next five years to treat and prevent aids , malaria and tuberculosis overseas if al gore was a generational peer to bill clinton , and dick cheney was a guiding force to george w bush , mr biden has at times acted as bluntspeaking provocateur to mr obama , challenging the younger politician s ideas and assumptions in ways that mr obama said he wants from his running mate a man of strong and many opinions , with a puckish humor and an inability to say no to sunday news programs , mr biden also has been satirized as the personification of senatorial windiness , though in the of this past year he showed new discipline for keeping his comments succinct still , he has sometimes lapsed into gaffes in announcing his second bid for the presidency , in january 2007 , mr biden referred to his fellow candidate , mr obama , as the first mainstream africanamerican who is articulate and bright and clean and a nicelooking guy in a debate in december 2007 , mr biden had to defend himself upon being asked if he was uncomfortable talking about race , and won a vote of confidence afterward from mr obama himself i 've worked with joe biden , i 've seen his leadership , mr obama said i have absolutely no doubt about what is in his heart and the commitment that he has made with respect to racial equality in this country joe is on the right side of the issues and is fighting every day for a better america mr biden also said at another point in 2007 that mr obama was not yet ready for the presidency , a point that mr biden was questioned about in an august 2007 debate of the democratic candidates look , i think he s a wonderful guy , to start off with , number one , mr biden replied , before explaining his concern that mr obama and other candidates were wrong \( and he was right \) on steps to recast american policy toward pakistan \( mr obama said he did not see much difference in their approaches to pakistan \) compared with other relationships he has built in washington , where he is serving his sixth term in the senate , mr biden has little history with mr obama in mr biden s 2007 autobiography he mentions mr obama only once , and in the prologue section i served with the last of the southern segregationists , mr biden writes of his long senate career , but i was there to see carol moseley braun and barack obama sworn in the child of a car salesman and a graduate of the university of delaware and syracuse law school , mr biden had settled in the wilmington , del , suburbs to practice law and serve as a local councilman when he decided in 1971 to challenge a popular incumbent senator , j caleb boggs only 29 years old , mr biden won in a tight race he turned 30 in time to meet the legal age requirement to serve in the chamber a month later , driving in search of a christmas tree , mr biden s wife , neilia , and their three young children were struck by another car neilia and their 13monthold daughter , naomi , were killed his two sons were hospitalized but recovered mr biden considered resigning but was persuaded to start his senate term five years later he courted and wed a teacher , jill jacobs , whose photograph he had noticed in an advertisement for local parks they have a daughter , ashley in 1988 , mr biden underwent surgery to repair two socalled berry aneurysms in arteries in opposite sides of his brain the first of the aneurysms a ballooning of an artery tore without warning , leaking blood to cause neck pain and nausea mr biden wore a brace until the correct diagnosis was made he escaped without suffering a paralyzing stroke the second aneurysm apparently caused no symptoms and was repaired a few weeks after the first mr biden returned to the senate after a sevenmonth absence as he has grown in prominence , mr biden has commuted for years between washington and wilmington , so he is home every night he is close to his family his sister , valerie biden owens , has played an important role in all of his campaigns and managed his presidential bid last year and he is known as a doting grandfather , often sitting on the floor to play with his grandchildren mr biden has long been ranked as one of the least wealthy members of the senate he largely built his power base and expertise as the chairman or ranking democrat of two powerful senate committees judiciary , which he led from 1987 to 1995 , and foreign relations , from 2001 to 2003 and since 2007 on judiciary he became a leading advocate for the violence against women act , tougher drug sentencing laws and money for local law enforcement programs leading the hearings on clarence thomas s nomination in 1991 , mr biden came under fire from women s groups and women in congress who said that he initially gave short shrift to allegations of sexual harassment against the nominee by anita hill but he noted that ms hill had at first not wanted her identity disclosed even to mr thomas , making an investigation difficult polls after the nomination fight showed that mr biden , who ultimately voted against mr thomas , was credited by the public with presiding fairly over the contentious hearings and he appeared to suffer little lasting political damage more recently , mr biden voted against mr bush s nominations of john g roberts jr and samuel a alito jr to the supreme court during and since his time leading the judiciary committee , mr biden has been derided by some critics as the senator from mbna , or \( dmbna \) , because of his close ties to the credit card behemoth that was based in wilmington , del , until it was bought three years ago by bank of america employees of mbna corporation had heavily contributed to mr biden , pouring more than 214 , 000 into his campaign coffers going back to 1989 , making the company his single biggest supporter , according to the center for responsive politics moreover , in 2003 , after mr biden s son hunter had graduated from law school , mbna hired him as a management trainee and quickly promoted him to executive vice president after hunter biden left the firm to become a partner at a washington lobbying firm , the company paid him a 100 , 000 annual retainer to advise it on the internet and privacy issues mr biden also paid hunter s law firm 143 , 000 for legal services , including nearly 60 , 000 in outstanding bills just last month in another mbna connection that has raised questions , mr biden sold his delaware house for 12 million in the mid1990s to john cochran , a senior executive of the company who would become its chairman and chief executive campaign consultants for raymond j clatworthy , a delaware businessman who ran twice against mr biden , tried to make an issue of the sale in their race in 1996 , suggesting a sweetheart deal , but mr biden produced an appraisal of his home that matched the purchase price mr biden became an early supporter of a controversial bankruptcy law that was championed by the company and other credit card issuers and finally passed in 2005 , making it more difficult for consumers to erase their debts mr obama , who voted against the measure , recently skewered the presumptive republican nominee , senator john mccain , for backing the bill , saying it allowed banks and credit card companies to tilt the playing field in their favor , at the expense of hardworking americans a report last year by credit suisse , the investment bank , concluded the law had had a profound impact on the country s subprime mortgage crisis , leading directly to a rise in foreclosures mr obama has made the bankruptcy bill an issue on the campaign trail , announcing a plan in july to revise the law and give more protection to debtors he has argued that his opposition to the legislation demonstrated his support for working families , while casting mr mccain , who voted for the measure , as being in the pocket of credit card and banking industry lobbyists accompanying mr biden s respected legislative record is a personal touch that is renowned for verbal gaffes , usually a product of impolitic directness none was more devastating than the plagiarism incident that eventually forced him to exit the presidential race in 1988 during a speech at the iowa state fair , mr biden delivered a moving closing monologue about his family s humble roots it turned out that he had borrowed the passage from a british politician , neil kinnock , who had been describing his own personal history mr biden previously attributed the words to him on the stump but for some reason did not this time other revelations quickly emerged mr biden had plagiarized parts of a paper he wrote in law school , using word for word five pages from a law review article without attribution in a breezy moment with a voter in new hampshire he had dramatically embellished his college and law school accomplishments he had adopted parts of speeches by robert f kennedy without citation by 2007 , when he decided to try for the white house again , the political agonies of the '80s had been forgotten by many americans and mr biden himself pledged to be more careful if he won in 2008 memorably , at one of the democratic candidate debates , he was asked whether he could reassure voters that he would have the discipline to watch his words and language if elected yes , mr biden said , and nothing more , smiling as the audience laughed with approval
washington senator barack obama rejected criticism from republicans today about his ability to protect the nation from attack , responding forcefully to senator john mccain s advisers who suggested that mr obama employed a na ve view toward the threat of terrorism these are the same guys who helped to engineer the distraction of the war in iraq at a time when we could ve pinned down the people who actually committed 9 11 , mr obama said , speaking to reporters aboard his campaign plane in part because of their failed strategies , we ve got bin laden still sending out audio tapes , so i don t think they have much standing to suggest that they ve learned a lot of lessons from 9 11 the obama and mccain campaigns engaged in sharp backandforth throughout the day over which candidate was best prepared to prevent another terrorist strike on america the quarrel was reminiscent of a debate from the last presidential campaign , when president bush accused senator john kerry of massachusetts of being weak on terrorism , a charge that contributed to the democrats defeat senator obama is a perfect manifestation a september 10th mindset , randy scheunemann , mr mccain s national security director , told reporters on a conference call he does not understand the nature of the enemies we face former new york mayor rudolph w giuliani , a onetime republican presidential rival of mr mccain s , also weighed in , saying barack obama appears to believe that terrorists should be treated like criminals a belief that underscores his fundamental lack of judgment regarding our national security mr obama , as he flew back to washington late tuesday afternoon , responded what they are trying to do is what they ve done every election cycle , which is to use terrorism as a club to make the american people afraid to win elections , he said the furor was sparked by a comment mr obama came in an interview with abc news on monday when he spoke of how terrorism suspects could be successfully prosecuted and imprisoned the simple point that i was making , which i will continue to make throughout this campaign , is that we can abide by due process and abide by basic concepts of rule of law and still crack down on terrorists , mr obama said none of the folks that were speaking for mccain today have given us one bit of information that would suggest that as a consequence of the court s ruling , terrorists will be able to attack america more effectively
has had more air time this postseason than a lot of players and managers for nearly every pitch of the two american league division series games at angel stadium in anaheim , calif , he stood in his fieldlevel luxury box behind home plate his position placed him directly over the umpire s right shoulder and on millions of television screens , serving as a direct reminder that boras is front and center as always , impervious to the fuming and fussing he stirs up as baseball s most visible and unrelenting player agent it was only last october that boras came in for the heaviest criticism of his career when word got out during game 4 of the world series that alex rodriguez , his client of clients , had decided to opt out of his contract with the yankees people within baseball , and many who write about it , were infuriated , saying that boras had showed a lack of respect for baseball s traditions by letting rodriguez s intentions be known just as the were about to capture their second world series in four seasons many suspected , and said , that boras had deliberately leaked the news , thereby stealing attention from the red sox but a year later , there are no discernible signs that boras suffered as a result he remains the happy warrior of agents , finding himself in new controversies and moving right through them in baseball s league championship round , which opened on thursday with the los angeles dodgers playing at philadelphia , boras will be represented everywhere , with 10 active players on the four teams boras will not be as visible on television because the los angeles angels , and the boras client mark teixeira , were eliminated by the red sox in an al division series but boras will be up the road in chavez ravine , where he has a box at dodger stadium , watching another client , , lead the dodgers against the phillies in the national league championship series and rather than upstaging the world series this year , boras could be casting it should the dodgers and the red sox advance to the world series , there could be an allboras moment among his clients , with on the mound for boston , ram rez in the batter s box , jason varitek squatting behind the plate and outfielders jacoby ellsbury and j d drew converging on the ball in rightcenter field , should ram rez hit it to the opposite field of all the boras clients still playing this october , ram rez looms largest he drove the red sox to distraction in the first half of the season with assorted forms of misbehavior , and they finally traded him to los angeles , where he proceeded to tear into national league pitching for two months and carry the dodgers into the playoffs but that is only part of the story as a member of the red sox , ram rez was not automatically eligible for free agency boston could simply pick up his option for 2009 but the theory among many in baseball is that ram rez was acting out deliberately in the hope that the red sox would trade him , and that boras went along , knowing that if a trade did occur , he could insist that ram rez become a free agent after the world series indeed , the trade will allow ram rez to become a free agent , and boras will collect a healthy commission on a new deal all of this caught the attention of commissioner bud selig , who asked one of his deputies to look into the matter , which apparently led nowhere none of this made any sense to boras , who , during a recent interview in his offices in newport beach , a 45minute drive from angel stadium and an hour from dodger stadium , lamented that the news media portrayed him in an overwhelmingly unfavorable light sipping hot tea from a mug with his name on it , boras zeroed in on july , when ram rez was still playing for boston everyone said we went to manny and said , do n't do things on the field that you would normally do , ' boras said i can only say this when people raise that question manny hit 360 in july , led the team in home runs , rbi s , the whole thing what is it that manny was n't doing \? i would like to be responsible for manny hitting 360 actually , ram rez batted 347 , not 360 , and kevin youkilis , with 5 home runs and 20 runs batted in , slightly outdid ram rez s 4 homers and 16 rbi but the numbers were only part of boras s counterargument he was also willing to take on the notion that ram rez was n't always running hard in boston , was n't always trying i 've played the game a long time , boras said , and there are a lot of players that do n't run particularly hard a lot , and they are great hitters because they are trying to save their legs i see it as a matter of practice that you would like to see him run hard , but the fact is they do n't want to wear him out and that s the pace they play at whatever the merits of the controversy , boras will almost certainly have the last word because ram rez s onslaught with the dodgers virtually guarantees that some team the dodgers \? the mets \? will give him a lot of money for the next couple of seasons boras also seemed to come out on top in the other client controversy he encountered this summer , this one involving pedro alvarez , a third baseman from vanderbilt , whom the pittsburgh pirates took with the no 2 pick in the june draft after alvarez agreed to a 6 million signing bonus and a minor league contract with the pirates , the deal was held up by a dispute about whether major league baseball improperly extended the negotiating deadline some questioned whether boras was using technicalities to get more money out of the pirates , particularly because a player picked after alvarez had received a signing bonus of 62 million ultimately , the pirates and boras agreed to a new contract that will pay alvarez at least 64 million and as much as 8 million over four years reflecting on the criticism , boras said i only get the negativity because it s written so much , about here he goes again doing something different , it s always about money seventy percent of what we do is not about money it s about advancing players and getting players to be better when i have families come in when we represent the premium people in the draft and they look at me mothers , fathers , players and thank me for what you do , boras said , adding that the criticism did not bother him and certainly not , he said , when the criticism is coming from a writer who is without the facts boras again maintained that he was unfairly made the fall guy in last october s rodriguez uproar i did n't disclose anything , he said i tell everybody i did n't the disclosure certainly did n't help me , he added , because it hurt my negotiating position with the yankees rodriguez ultimately resigned with the yankees for a fortune 10 years , 275 million and will not be in play this offseason but ram rez is , as is teixeira , who could end up with the biggest freeagent contract of any position player that will mean more spotlight time for boras , even if he is n't standing behind home plate
beijing s second olympics has been a success compared with her traumatic first , four years ago the occasion then understandably overwhelmed her in and out of the pool in athens , where at 15 she was the youngest american athlete even though her two medals here so far represent improvement , it has not gone according to plan or dream for hoff , who won five individual events at the united states trials and elicited lowgrade comparisons to michael phelps for her versatility and her roots \( they grew up training at the same club in baltimore \) phelps s american supporting cast , so impressive at last year s world championships in melbourne , australia , has not yet been as productive in beijing other star swimmers are making mockeries of their personal bests in this recordsmashing olympics , in which 16 world marks have already been broken , but hoff is struggling to keep pace with her past as well as her rivals' present wednesday s 200meter freestyle was the latest example , as three women went under the old world record , and none of them were hoff federica pellegrini of italy her arms sweeping high above the water with her elegant stroke won the gold in 1 minute 5482 seconds the time was 63hundredths of a second better than her world mark set in the heats although pellegrini looked in command at 100 meters , her big lead was looking smaller by the last turn it was smaller still as she willed herself to the finish with sara isakovic of slovenia closing hard in the adjacent lane 4 and pang jiaying of china doing the same in lane 6 pellegrini surprisingly failed to win a medal in the 400 freestyle , in which she also holds the world record but she managed the expectations in style this time , with isakovic taking silver in 1 5497 and pang the bronze in 1 5505 when i won i said finally ! finally ! ' pellegrini said i have been expecting to win this race for the last four years i feel avenged hoff could not say the same , finishing fourth in 1 5578 , an american record and her first personal best in beijing , but not nearly enough to threaten the top three i would have liked a medal , hoff said but i got my first pb of the meet and i got the american record , so i ca n't be upset with that now it s on to the next race that , in light of hoff s overstuffed , phelpsian schedule , was less than an hour later in the women s 200 individual medley but with stephanie rice of australia and others feeling fresh , hoff could not mount a serious challenge in a terrific race , in which rice did not take the lead until very late in the final freestyle leg , she managed to break her world record to win in 2 0845 , just ahead of kirsty coventry of zimbabwe , who finished in 2 0859 natalie coughlin of the united states held off hoff to win the bronze medal in 2 1034 hoff was fourth in 2 1068 , nearly a second slower than her personal best in a couple of events , i'm right there in a couple , i'm a little off , said hoff , hardly lingering in the mixed zone i was n't at my best in the im , but i swam my best with one individual event remaining , the 800 freestyle , hoff has a silver in the 400 free and a bronze in the 400 individual medley , an event in which she held the world record before coming to beijing six medals is no longer a possibility , and a gold does not look likely either with rebecca adlington , the british teenager who caught hoff on the final stroke of the 400 , now looking like a favorite in the event that adlington considers her best to compete for gold here , world records have been practically a requirement , and the running tally hit 16 after the morning session on wednesday , when six more world marks were beaten with this olympic meet at only the halfway mark , the swimmers have already broken as many world records as in last year s world championships , which had been considered chock full of records the tone was reinforced immediately wednesday in the semifinals of the men s 100 freestyle s signature event , it has been transformed by the new bodysuits and by a new wave of talented , creatively trained sprinters in the first semifinal , alain bernard , the powerfully built frenchman , began compensating for the crushing disappointment of his anchor leg in the 4x100 freestyle relay on monday , when he lost a big lead to jason lezak of the united states bernard won this semifinal , breaking eamon sullivan s world record in 4720 seconds and leaving lezak in third place less than five minutes later , bernard s record was eclipsed by sullivan sullivan , from australia , won his semifinal in 4705 seconds , practically looking back at the clock as he touched the wall the record has an excellent chance of falling again in thursday s final , but lezak will be the only american with a chance at it garrett webergale , who won the event at the trials , and was part of the goldmedalwinning 4x100 freestyle relay team , missed the top eight with a time of 4812 seconds he was hardly the only sprint favorite to falter filippo magnini of italy and brent hayden of canada , who tied for first in the 100 at last year s world championship , missed the final , too time is indeed marching on in beijing
baghdad the government of prime minister is systematically dismissing iraqi oversight officials , who were installed to fight corruption in iraqi ministries by order of the american occupation administration , which had hoped to bring western standards of accountability to the notoriously opaque and graftridden bureaucracy here the dismissals , which were confirmed by senior iraqi and american government officials on sunday and monday , have come as estimates of official iraqi corruption have soared one iraqi former chief investigator recently testified before congress that 13 billion in reconstruction funds from the united states had been lost to fraud , embezzlement , theft and waste by iraqi government officials the moves have not been publicly announced by mr maliki s government , but word of them has begun to circulate through the layers of iraqi bureaucracy as parliament prepares to vote on a longawaited security agreement that pact sets the terms for continued american presence here after the united nations mandate expires dec 31 , but also amounts to a framework for a steady reduction in that presence such a change will undoubtedly lessen american oversight of iraqi institutions while some iraqi officials defended the dismissals , saying there had been no political motivation , others pointed to the secrecy involved as supporting their view that those removed had lost their posts without good cause each of s 30 cabinetlevel ministries has one inspector general these oversight officials are supported by varying budgets and staffing although some of the inspectors general have been notably quiet , others have vigorously investigated both current and former ministers and other senior officials , and the top echelons of iraqi officialdom have found ample reason to fear them in one case , investigations of a former electricity minister landed him in jail before he escaped and fled to the united states , and an oil ministry inspector general detailed extensive smuggling and extortion schemes that he said bedeviled the industry a former public works minister , a kurd , complained before she fled the country that her ministry s inspector general at the time , a shiite , had been hyperactive and had brought charges based more on political considerations than actual wrongdoing how many of the ministries have received orders to dismiss their inspectors is a matter of disagreement among iraqi governmental officials , but their estimates range from a handful to as many as 17 several senior iraqi and american officials agreed that seven to nine inspectors general had already been dismissed or forced into retirement in one case , at the education ministry , the post became vacant when the inspector general died senior iraqi officials and four of the dismissed officials , many of whom asked not to be named for fear of government reprisals , said inspectors had already been removed in the ministries of water resources , culture , trade , and youth and sport in addition , inspectors have been removed from the cabinetlevel central bank of iraq , and from two religious offices , the sunni endowment and the christian endowment , whose leaders carry the rank of deputy minister one senior iraqi official said that the list of ministries whose inspectors had been dismissed also included the ministry of foreign affairs , but the ministry s public affairs office denied that on monday three senior advisers to mr maliki declined to comment substantively when contacted about the dismissals definitely i know about it , all the details , said yasseen majid , a press adviser to the prime minister but you know all the story , so why are you asking me \? it s not my specialty it s an administrative issue but adel muhsin , mr maliki s coordinator of anticorruption organizations and himself the inspector general at the health ministry , said any suggestion that there had been political motivation for the dismissals was false this is absolutely completely nonsense , mr muhsin said the cabinet committee that recommended the changes , he said , was made up of mainly professional people , not political people therefore , the selections it is 100 percent based on professionalism the united states embassy in baghdad did not respond on monday to a request for comment on the dismissals but stuart w bowen jr , who leads an independent oversight office in washington , the office of the special inspector general for iraq reconstruction , and who is currently working in iraq , said he knew of six of the dismissals he said the inspectors general were vulnerable because once their offices were created , the united states provided little support and training for what was a startling concept for the bureaucracy , which was shaped by the secrecy and corruption of the saddam hussein era whatever the precise tally , the events have begun provoking accusations that mr maliki , who has never been an advocate of having his government s inner workings scrutinized , might leave the posts vacant or stack them with supporters of his party , dawa the secrecy surrounding the moves has magnified suspicions that the government aims to cripple the oversight mechanisms put in place after the invasion the government put a publicity blackout on it so they can do anything they like , said sheik sabah alsaeidi , a shiite lawmaker with the fadhila party who heads the integrity committee in the iraqi parliament when parliament recently proposed a law formalizing the professional requirements that must be met by a candidate for inspector general , mr saeidi said , mr maliki s cabinet strongly opposed it they want it to become a political appointment , mr saeidi said of the oversight position they are trying to restrict anticorruption efforts all over the country at least two of the officials who were forced out were christian women , hana shakuri of the culture ministry and samia youssef sha'ia of the christian endowment but most are simply senior sunni and shiite technocrats who have been at their posts for years and in several cases were originally appointed in 2004 by l paul bremer iii , the top administrator for the coalition provisional authority hassan alsafi , who was forced out of his position in the ministry of youth and sport after being placed on what he said was a government list of incompetent inspectors , said that he had degrees in law , economics and auditing , and was involved in the earliest anticorruption efforts in iraq after the invasion if i am not competent , prove it , said mr safi , who said that he had already filed a lawsuit to force the government to renounce its assertion that he was not performing his job properly mr maliki s stance on oversight was most vividly illustrated by his longrunning feud with judge rathi alrathi , the former head of the commission on public integrity , an oversight agency created by the coalition provisional authority after mr rathi s corruption investigations repeatedly embarrassed the maliki government , the prime minister s office supported corruption charges against mr rathi himself mr rathi s backers considered the charges to be trumpedup ultimately , mr rathi was forced out and fled iraq in the summer of 2007 , saying he had received numerous threats to his life he was recently granted asylum in the united states , said chris king , a former united states embassy official who was a senior adviser to the integrity commission mr king said there had been continual political interference in mr rathi s investigations when the commission or an inspector general built a case against an official , mr king said , frequently that member of the iraqi government would then go lobby the american ambassador and the prime minister the prime minister eventually replaced mr rathi with judge rahim alogaili mr muhsin , mr maliki s anticorruption coordinator , said the judge was one of three cabinetlevel officials serving on the committee that had recommended dismissing the inspectors general the others were mr maliki s chief of staff and the head of iraq s board of supreme audit none of the three officials responded to requests for comment on monday it was mr rathi s former chief investigator , salam adhoob , who testified before congress in september that a previously undisclosed report by the board of supreme audit had concluded that 13 billion in american reconstruction funds had been squandered through corruption mr king said that the inspectors general were in many ways one of the last firewalls preventing the iraqi government from keeping its operations largely in the dark after the integrity commission , mr king said , the only remnants of an independent investigatory arm looking into corruption in the government are the ig s , or inspectors general
seoul , held upright by straps in his wheelchair , clad in a dark suit , lee sangmook was delivering a lecture on marine geophysics on the projector screen behind him at seoul national university were animated diagrams simulating the way the world s seas could have been formed to display each scene , dr lee , who is paralyzed from the neck down , used his mouth to operate a bottlelike computer mouse linked to his laptop sip from the open tip of the mouse to click left puff out to click right sip and nod to scroll scrolling is the most difficult one , said dr lee , who can talk , but whose lung capacity has shrunk to 40 percent of an average person s despite his paralysis , the result of an automobile accident two years ago , dr lee , 46 , remains resolutely focused on his work in the process , he has become a model for disabled people in south korea , where they still face prejudices and are expected to withdraw from active life in the south korean news media he is frequently compared to another quadriplegic scientist , the british astrophysicist stephen hawking dr lee modestly discourages such talk , saying the similarities are superficial despite rapid economic and cultural development , south korea still lacks social awareness of its disabled citizens and the facilities to aid them families with disabled members often keep them at home , sometimes hidden away , ashamed of their existence and afraid of discrimination in fact , dr lee s decision to continue teaching at the nation s most prestigious university has put him at odds with his wife and parents , who would prefer that he concentrate on restoring some motion to his limbs dr lee was injured on july 2 , 2006 , during a geological field trip in a california desert , when the car he was driving overturned he emerged from a coma three days later , but his fourth cervical vertebra had been fractured nevertheless , he was back at work in early 2007 every time he tested out a new device and adapted it for his own use , dr lee said , he felt a little thrill , as if he had solved a scientific problem he felt blessed when he found ezcaller , a device that allowed him to make and answer phone calls just by clicking his mouse and he eventually settled on an onscreen keyboard program called clickey , which allowed him to type by selecting each character with a click or a puff during a recent lunch with his colleagues , dr lee amazed onlookers as he touched a microphone on the headrest of his wheelchair with his right cheek to recline the chair to prevent bedsores on his way back to his office from the cafeteria , dr lee used his right cheek again , this time to shift the wheelchair into a mode that buffers the shock when he uses his head to steer it on a bumpy road it s like downhill skiing , he said lee sangmook was born in seoul in 1962 and moved to indonesia when he was 12 , after his father , a banker , was transferred there as a teenager , he became fascinated with national geographic , devouring every issue of the magazine in the school library in jakarta and stoking a desire to travel to remote places around the world one day , he recalled , his father came home , somewhat tipsy after drinking with colleagues , and suggested that sangmook become a scientist of an unconventional kind his father was convinced that oceanography was the field of the future the son was so motivated by this first mantoman talk with his father that he eventually went on to study oceanography at seoul national university his father later changed his mind and pressed him to become an herbal doctor , a position of considerable status in south korea that would allow him to one day look after his aging parents or at least to stay close to them but becoming an herbal doctor meant a lockedup life for him , said lee yujene , 45 , dr lee s younger sister he refused relentlessly it was the first time he defied our parents he went on to do his dissertation at the massachusetts institute of technology and the woods hole oceanographic institution he conducted postdoctoral research on the midocean ridge south of iceland and the southwestern indian ocean he later spent about three months a year at sea on a research vessel for the korean ocean research and development institute before joining his alma mater s faculty in 2003 none of his globehopping played well back home his father took to calling him the sailor , annoyed that his oldest son was away from home for so long when his friends' children had settled jobs , ms lee said that changed when dr lee accepted the teaching position our father was happy once my brother got his professorship , his sister said but then came the accident , and the shattering new reality that he had lost the use of his limbs the occupational therapists at the rehabilitation hospital in the united states immediately showed him seven models of a device that could serve as his computer mouse he quickly got the hang of using one , so that he was discharged after only three weeks he returned to south korea ready to go back to work , and armed with the means to do so the university was enthusiastic about having him back , and made sure he had all the space and facilities he needed to do his work a colleague donated 100 , 000 , which he used to customize his minivan to accommodate his wheelchair and , with the

reader comments tend to run toward criticism and cynicism nature of the beast satisfied fans have no reason to write unhappy fans need a venue to vent \( we ve all been there click here for a rundown of acts of rage committed after giants losses \) but this week it was refreshing to read a comment from a patriots fan praising the giants \( and their fans \) for their approach in the new england game saturday night in fact , the whole night was refreshing the giants played with passion , with abandon , as did the patriots for a few hours , it was the way it ought to be but let s allow the reader , becky , to have the stage here s her comment as i diehard , lifelong patriots fan all i can say is that i left the game the other night with huge admiration and respect for the giants and for their fans i lucked into a great last minute seat and although i was alone and surrounded by giants fans i was treated with great kindness and respect from beginning to end this despite my extremely loyal , extremely constant , extremely loud vocal cords and despite the fact that i unwittingly doused all my neighbors with a beer \( which one of them had just bought for me \) in my enthusiasm over a patriots touchdown i am also very grateful to the giants for playing to win the game was totally thrilling and great ! besides , although i understand that the smart thing to do is to preserve your player s health for the playoffs , on another level i just can t believe that too many giants starters would have wanted to ride the bench saturday what really is the difference between that and throwing the game \? what kind of player and what kind of fan would really want their team to lay down and roll over for national television and for sports history \? i hope that none of the giants injuries turn out to be serious , because as a result of saturday , i will be cheering for them in every post season game they play \( unless of course , they are playing the patriots \) btw , re the officiating , i do remember turning to my neighbor at one point and saying , if my team had just received that call i would be pretty mad too however , i don t see an orchestrated conspiracy here , i see subjectivity and chance , sometimes the calls good and bad go your way and sometimes they don t it is all just part of the game thanks new york giants and fans for making this one of the most fun nights of my life ! update becky has allowed herself to be identified she is becky bradshaw she added , i live in nyc now but my great hometown is newburyport , massachusetts note are there giants fans out there who want to offer their perspective on saturday night s game \?
irving , tex it was not as if dallas cowboys quarterback tony romo did not have enough on his mind heading into sunday night s game against the  a victory was crucial to keeping dallas s postseason hopes alive , and the cowboys' 208 triumph still does not ensure a wildcard playoff berth romo was facing an aggressive giants defense that had the sixthhighest sacks total in the league he was still sore after playing three of his previous four games wearing a splint to protect the broken pinkie on his throwing hand and he was coming off a wrenching loss to pittsburgh in which his late interception provided the steelers their winning score in addition to all that , romo was saddled with the certainty that his pass distribution would be intensely scrutinized in the wake of s reported complaints to coaches that romo favored tight end jason witten when steering the dallas offense the discord led to a series of secret meetings last week at the cowboys' practice facility and reports that owens and witten exchanged harsh words during friday s practice i think they kissed on friday , cowboys coach wade phillips said but what they do on their own time , i have to stay away from in a postgame interview with owens and witten by his side , romo said we have a lot of highly competitive individuals on this football team that want to win and i really give credit this week to wade phillips and the coaching staff , and to t o and jason , for drumming this whole thing up to take away from the pressure of the game i thought it was really intelligent and i'm proud of them good job despite such efforts at levity , there seemed a palpable tension before kickoff owens and witten stood several yards apart during warmups and did not acknowledge each other but once the game began , the cowboys found sufficient unity to succeed romo spread his 20 completions among nine receivers witten led dallas with nine passes thrown his way and five receptions , but it was the rookie running back tashard choice who had the most receiving yards \( 52 on four catches \) after a week in which owens appeared to have divided another team he had previous conflicts with quarterbacks in san francisco \( jeff garcia \) and philadelphia \( donovan mcnabb \) he claimed the controversy was nothing but a newsmedia fabrication honestly , i do n't know where none of this stuff came from , said owens , who caught three of the six passes thrown his way for 38 yards it was a lie , unfair i had to deal with this all week it was just something we had to deal with , but we stuck together and knew what was important , and that was this game today romo and witten are known to share a close friendship witten was part of last january s controversial traveling party to a mexican beach resort with romo that preceded a 2117 playoff loss to the giants after that game , owens tearfully asked reporters not to blame the loss on romo s byeweek vacation but according to numerous published reports , owens engaged in a different kind of crying about romo last week , persuading wideouts roy williams and patrick crayton to join him in complaining to the offensive coordinator jason garrett that romo was too readily looking for witten at their expense owens s grumbling was not borne out by statistics before sunday s game , romo had thrown 87 passes this season to owens and 80 to witten but witten had caught 57 of his chances , and owens only 43 since the start of the 2006 season , owens had been targeted 50 times more often than witten \( 336286 \) , but witten had caught 15 more passes than owens \( 201186 \) witten s reliable hands can certainly engender trust and no one complained when romo connected with witten on a flare pattern on thirdand9 for a first down with three minutes remaining and the cowboys leading by only 6 points the conversion drained the life from the giants , and choice burst up the middle for a 38yard touchdown run on the next play witten did not deny a conflict with owens , but said , i know a lot of it got blown out of proportion , and i'm really not sure how i got brought in the middle of it he added , it s a lot easier for me to do my job when you have a great quarterback and a great receiver outside sometimes those things happen when you have star players , but i'm glad it s behind us time will tell if that is the case but with his team s playoff hopes still alive , phillips was optimistic i said it was overblown i think it was , he said but , whatever , teammates have to play and it is a family i'm not saying what happened or what did n't happen , but brothers get in fights then they come back because they 're family and they fight for each other and i think that s what happened today
when you wrote the washington post oped article in november 2005 in which you recanted your 2002 vote authorizing military action you also stressed the importance of ending the mission honorably , which you defined as leaving an iraq behind that was relatively stable you had a threepronged plan to steer reconstruction work to the iraqis , begin a gradual process of withdrawal and establish a more efficient program of training the iraqi forces why did you believe at that point in time that this was the best course of action \? you have to understand the construct in which i think about this in a bigger picture i think the responsibility of the president as the commander in chief is to think about this incredibly important issue of iraq and what do to in iraq , but to think about it in the context of what it means for america s leadership in the world i think it is a critical component of how we reestablish ourselves as the kind of moral leader in the world that is essential for there to be stability of the world because we are the preeminent power , when america is not leading there is a huge vacuum of leadership and iraq plays a significant role , but not the only part in how we reestablish that moral leadership so , number one , that is the bigger context in which i think about the entire iraq question it was two years ago , and i believed at the time that there were a number of things we needed to be doing , including those things that you just described i have not read the oped for a long period of time , but i would be willing to bet that i proposed taking out eight to ten brigades you did not have a specific number , but you said a significant number of forces that is the range i was thinking then and still think and the reason for that is that i thought we were confronted with very difficult choices , none of which were attractive , and my job and the commander in chief s responsibility is to maximize the changes of success , especially in the context of the bigger worldview i do n't think you can treat iraq as hugely important , but you cannot deal with it in isolation it has to be considered in the context of how america should be leading and the kind of foreign policy we should be conducting over the long term how did you go from a plan that emphasized the gradual reduction of forces and training of iraqi forces to a plan that calls for removing all of the forces within ten months \? because it is now two years later at that point , what i was suggesting was , again let me go back to the bigger picture the question from my perspective is that i have never believed that there was a military solution in iraq , do n't believe it today i think the issue is how do you maximize the chances of achieving a political reconciliation between sunni and shia because i think that political reconciliation is the foundation for any longterm stability in iraq they have now , at this moment , had well over four and a half years to make some serious progress toward a political solution they have not done it , and so what we have been doing has not worked it clearly has not worked and my view is that we need to shift the responsibility to them , make it clear that we are leaving that is where the eight to ten brigades come from then , as aggressively as can reasonably be achieved , to continue a steady redeployment until all combat troops are out in roughly nine to ten months now i am not married to that specific timetable if my military leadership came to me and said we need another month or some additional time , i would certainly take that into consideration what they are saying but it is my job as commander in chief to set the policy parameters , which is exactly what i was doing under your concept you also withdraw the american trainers and advisers who have been working to build the new iraqi army and police that s correct why did you decide on that \? there are some people who have been critical of the bush administration s approach like the iraq study group , which was cochaired by former secretary of state james baker and former congressman lee hamilton , that called for withdrawing combat brigades but simultaneously expanding the training effort what effect do you think your plan would have on iraqi forces \? i 'd say a couple of things about it number one , there have certainly been studies indicating that when an american embedded trainer is in an iraqi unit that they become so dependent on that trainer that they do not develop their own selfsufficiency secondly , if we were going to actually going to do what was necessary to continue this training operation we would have to have somewhere between 40 , 000 and 60 , 000 troops to support themto protect them , support them logistically , all of the above and to me that is a continuation of the occupation of iraq and now we go back to what i said at the very outset the continued occupation of iraq undermines everything america has to do to reestablish ourselves as a country that should be followed , that should be a leader one of the most comprehensive studies on this was done in september by general jim jones i know general jones and he looked at this and said the iraqi security forces cannot stand entirely on their own in the next twelve to eighteen months and that for the foreseeable future they would depend on air support , logistics , intelligencethese sorts of enablers that are provided by the americans would n't your plan essentially pull the rug out from underneath the nascent iraqi security force while we are trying to transfer more responsibility onto their shoulders \? i think it is a fair question my judgment is that the critical component is not military the critical component is political even bush said when he proposed the surge that the purpose for the surge was to create a security environment that would allow some serious security progress well , we have had some diminution in violenceno doubt about thati think in part because baghdad is largely a shia city now , and the ethnic groups have been segregated but , the bottom line is that there has been some diminution in violence and still there has been absolutely no political progress and the reason is because america continues to stay there and prop up these political leaders who are making no serious effort to make progress the fundamental tenet of the way i examine and make policy judgments , which is the job of the president , under these circumstances is that is not my job to make daytoday military decisions on the ground it is my job is to set the policy priorities , and i believe is that the correct policy framework is that what we have been doing is not working we have to shift the responsibility to them now i would add that there are people who have proposedi think governor vilsack did it , i think at some point governor richardson did itan immediate and total withdrawal i do n't support that i think that does not allow adequate time for serious political progress to be made i think we have to make it clear that we are leaving with a definitive statement of a withdrawal of eight to ten brigades and then we need to continue that redeployment while we intensely work with maliki , as weak as he is , and the sunni leadership , as fragmented as it , is to make some political progress and that has to be married to an intense diplomatic effort in the region , particularly with the iranians and the syrians if america is no longer occupying iraq and america is leaving , both syria and iran have an obvious in interest in their being some level of stability in iraq they do n't want refugees coming across their borders if you are the iranians you do n't want to have a broader civil war because you are a shiadominated country in a sunni dominated muslim world it could be dangerous for them so i think they have their own countries interest in helping to provide stability ifand it is a big ifif american is leaving today you mentioned the recent national intelligence estimate on iran as you know , there were two national intelligence estimates made public this year on iraq and the one in january examined a scenario in which american forces would be withdrawn in twelve to eighteen months , the life of the estimate and in that nie they said it would lead to a significant increase in the scope and scale of sectarian conflict , intensify sunni resistance to the iraqi government , have adverse consequences for national reconciliation they said the iraqi security force might not survive as a nonsectarian institution and they said that massive civilian casualties and forced population displacement would be probable but under that theory we could be there for years just for the purpose of hoping that the sunni and shia political leadership start making political progress they have had four and half years i mean really how many american lives and how much american taxpayer money are we going to continue to expend waiting for these political leaders to do something , because that is precisely what we are doing i absolutely believe this to my soul we are there propping up their bad behavior now that is not to suggest that we have not done some very good and constructive things when i thought about this policy and when i think about the issue of iraq and when i am asked about it , i think about every man and woman i have met , every family member i have met , who are putting their lives on the line and put their lives on the line in serving this country in iraq and they deserve a command in chief who respects them , that cares about what they are doing , and who will do everything in his power to maximize the chances of success i believe that this maximizes the chances of success because if you look at the underlying foundation for this entire problem that exists in iraq now , it is not military the problem is political , and unless and until they make some political progress nothing is going to change so you fundamentally disagree with the nie assessment \? i disagree with it if it is suggesting that america continuing to stay there for some relatively unlimited amount of time is going to force these political leaders to make progress it did n't say that it said that the consequences of withdrawing over a short time would be increased civilian casualties there is no other way to interpret that that means that american should stay there over an extended period of time waiting for some political progress to be made because the bottom line is , and i believe that the iraqi study group reached this conclusion , i think there is consensus around this concept , unless and until that political reconciliation is reached there ca n't be stability there in a number of your presentation including to the council on foreign relations you also talked about keeping a quick reaction force in the region and one of their missions would not be merely to respond to terrorists but to respond to genocide if the withdrawal of american forces did lead to widespread killing in iraq , which certainly is a possibility of course it is would you send that quick reaction force back into iraq to protect those civilians \? i would do several things all at the same time as we begin to redeploy out of iraq we would be intensely involved at a high level in the political process between sunni and shia we would be intensely involved in the diplomatic process with other countries in that region of the world and simultaneously with that we should be building an international consensus that i believe can be constructed , and i will come back to that in a minute , on how to respond if in fact genocide breaks out i think america has the responsibility , i think the world has a responsibility , if that kind of humanitarian crisis were to develop and i think what that we have failed to do , first of all , in the leadup to iraq , and as best i can tell we have n't done now , is we have not engaged the international community in a constructive way for a unified international response if this humanitarian crisis were to begin so if you are asking me would the quick reaction forces be available for that yes , but that is a judgment that i would make under the circumstances having already done the very difficult spade work between the place we are today and that place so that we would know who is with us , who is willing to participate , what the parameters of our involvement would be i think that genocide in general is a huge moral issue facing america and the world wherever it occurs , and it is not just an american issue and i think it is something we should be preparing for would the quick reaction force be available for that \? if i judged that it was the right decision to send american troops in , yes but i will give you a parallel example i do not believe it would be the appropriate thing to do to put american troops on the ground in sudan where there is clearly been a genocide going on in western sudan and darfar i am not suggesting the situations are parallel i think our troops there would actually do more harm than good and i think that is a judgment we would make under the circumstances , so i would not prejudge that would you be prepared to send the forces back into iraq even if you did not have foreign allies \? that is just entirely too hypothetical you have spoken a lot about america s moral role in the world definitely do you think we have a moral responsibility at this juncture to safeguard the iraqi population \? the iraqis did not ask us to invade that s right it was a decision that the bush administration made you were among those who voted to authorize the use of military force i voted for it we took down their governing structures and dismantled their army we made a number of mistakes there is no doubt about that over the past year we certainly had some success in dampening the violence and reducing civilian casualties do we at this juncture a moral responsibility to safeguard the interests of the iraqi population \? or , is it your sense that we have done everything for them , that it is really up to them \? that is a very important question for the president of the united states because it is very much a judgment call do i believe that we have had a moral responsibility \? i do the question is how long does that moral responsibility continue and at what juncture is it the right decision to end what we have been doing and shift that responsibility to them my own judgment is , let s assume for a minute that come january 2009 we still have a significant troop presence in iraq , which i think is likely if that is the case then i think another nine to ten months of american troop involvement and expenditure of taxpayer money with an intense effort to resolve the political conflict and intense diplomacy , then at that point america has done what it can do senator obama was in iraq once , two years ago senator clinton , who is on the armed services committee , has been there three times a member of your campaign staff said that you had sought to go but had not been able to go what happened \? we made a request i believe it was last summer i made a request to go and followed it up with a formal request in writing , and we got an informal voice answer no not at this time after general petraeus and secretary gates took over , post rumsfeld leaving \? oh yeah we continuedthis has gone on for months nowto push the case and asked for a formal request for them to give us a written answer so we could continue to pursue it we still have gotten no formal written answer to our request all we got was an informal telephone call saying no what was their rationale \? i do n't think there was one if secretary gates or general petraeus or the white house would facilitate a visit you would go \? yes sir , absolutely my hope is that after february the fifth when this nomination is in all likelihood going to be resolved , that at that point , when i believe i will be the democratic nominee , that they will facilitate it and i would be able to go on iran , during the herziliya conference in israel in january you made a comment that under no circumstance can iran be allowed to have a nuclear weapon , that all options have to be on the table do you still hold to that view \? i very much hold to the view that any president of the united states should never take any option off the table , but i think there is a very smart path for america on iran that has not been pursued , and it is what we should be doing before we talk about anything else that is what we should do my view is that the political situation inside iran is such that admandenejad has been left by a lot of the political elite , by some of the religious leaders and by a lot of the population his people who ran into council elections got clobbered there is a significant moderate element within the iranian population , a significant proamerican element within in the iranian population we do n't have much economic leverage with the iranians but our friends in europe do certainly the european banking system does what america in my judgment should be doing is working with the europeans to put a very clear , proposal on the tablea very public proposalto the iranian people we know form the nie report that it appears they stopped making nuclear weapons program in 2003 if we did not verify that they have stopped and will continue to not pursue nuclear weapons and if we continue to have verification of that then we will help them with their economy , us and the europeans if they wo n't , then there will be serious economic sanctions and consequences that to me is the smart path because there is an enormous opportunity to drive a wedge between a political leader who is not very popular in his own country and engages in extraordinary bellicose language toward us and israel and our allies , and a lot of iranians who actually i think tend toward being pro american the statement you made in israel was that under no circumstances can iran be allowed to have a nuclear weapon what that implies is that if diplomacy did not work and if you tried economic sanction as the next stop and the sanctions were not efficacious you would turn toward a military option i think it would be foolish for an american president or a presidential candidate to say what they would do in the future under some hypothetical situation of that gravity i have told you what i think we should be doing right now iraq has changed a great deal in the past year certainly , the level of violence is down in baghdad and other areas i think that a lot of that is because of the fact that the sunni and shia have been separated to a large extent but the spiraling sectarian violence , whatever one attributes it to , is down there has been movement on the local level with the tribal leaders it is a bit of a dynamic situation it is very much a dynamic situation you would be president a little more than year from now it is not clear exactly what iraq would look like at that point in time under what circumstances would you reassess your plan to rapidly withdraw from iraq \? if there was political movement on the part of the iraqi leadership and they were beginning to reconcile , and if they said they still needed american forces there to secure the country , would you reassess your views \? if the field commanders , none of whom are calling for this kind of rapid reduction at this point in time , if they came to you and said that they needed to keep american forces there longer would you reassess your view \? it is entirely too hypothetical i ca n't tell you based on circumstances that i do n't know what they would be at that point of time what i told you is exactly what i would plan to do as president i would plan to have all combat troops out of iraq at the end of nine to ten months , certainly within the first year if my field commanders came to me and said this ca n't be done we need some more time i would certainly pay some attention in what they said about that but that is exactly what i plan to do we obviously would keep troops there to protect the embassy in addition to the quick reaction forces and possibly the humanitarian workers i think it s in the white book \( the edwards book of campaign issues \) yes on pakistan , what motivated you to try to reach out to musharraf \? i had some things i wanted to urge him to do i thought he should hear from one or american presidential candidates , the serious contenders , about our perspective because bush is going to be gone in little more than a year and i thought it was important that he hear my perspective i was n't sure it would be the same as bush s where were you when he called \? in the bus \? i was right there i think they patched me through the embassy to islamabad he was friendly he remembered our meeting from years ago in islamabad and i told him it was a sad day for his country and for the democracy movement within his country , and i thought that it was really important moment for him and for pakistan and then i did the three things you heard me talk about i urged him to continue the democratization process , and he assured me he would as i have said many times today already i think that has to be taken with a lot of cynicism given his history secondly , and this is one of the most important thing i wanted to say to him , i urged him to allow independent investigators in to determine what happened and then , third , we talked about the elections i said do you plan to go forward with the elections \? because the election wo n't mean a thing if they do n't have opposition parties , if they are not secure , if it is not verifiable , if they 're not open and fair at the momentremember this is just hours after the assassinationhe had not made a decision how long did it take to return your call \? it was n't long a couple of hours how long did you talk to him \? 28 minutes , maybe 30 i'm guessing for a while we spent a fair amount of time talking about benazir bhutto i told him i had met her at a conference i told him what my impressions of her were , that she was a brave woman i asked him some question about what he knew about what had happened he would n't say much when you say we have to be a calming presence in that region , what do you mean \? i mean i think it is very important for both the president of the united states and for presidential candidates , when they are faced with this kind of very volatile international crisis to stand on american principlesdemocracy , open , free and fair elections , all the things that we believe inbut to do it in a way that does not ratchet up an already dangerous situation which means what \? it means the way you interact with the other leader it means the way you talk to america about the problem because you want to present strength and calm , and not walking away from any principle that we represent does it mean that you would not cut off aid summarily to pakistan \? i would not do that there are a group of things that i would do first of all , i think that we should be pushing very hard for independent investigators i think that is a big thing i think that we need intense diplomacy we need to reform the way we do aid i think we need to develop a worldwide infrastructure similar to nato for dealing with counter terrorism last , we need to develop an expertise that does not appear to exist today , at least not in the depth that it needs to exist in our government , on pakistan and the intricacies of what is happening in pakistan the intense diplomacy , tough , there are multiple components of that we have got to make sure the nuclear weapons are secure we have got to make sure the elections are open and fair , and are verifiable and secure we have got to push towards securing the northwest territories where al qaeda is operating in terms of reforming our aid , we have about 10 billion we have done in aid for pakistan , and a great of that has gone to military systems that did nothing but prop musharraf up it did not help to fight terrorism it did not help educate the people of pakistan when i was therethis was years agomeeting with musharraf , i asked him directly so your people hate america , what can we do to change that \? and he said the single most important thing is that we have no education system because we have no real education system our kids get educated in places that does not make them open to what america represents that conversation was one pieceit is not the only pieceof the reason that i proposed that america be investing somewhere in the 3 to 4 billion dollar range a year in leading an international effort to provide education to kids in places like pakistan and africa and the muslim world , which i think is an important component thank you for your time thank you for making the trip here my only criticism is that you did not talk about training outside of iraq , the training of security forces basically what you seem to be implying is that we are out of the training business for training the iraqi soldiers oh no i think we can do training outside of iraq well , go ahead so your point is that you would continue it outside you 're looking at me it s the one thing you forgot well , you 're the one who made the point it s not in the white book i looked i have talked about this in the past i think we can do some ongoing training outside of iraq i think the problem of doing the training inside of iraq is the troop level that is required what you can do outside iraq is limited of course , it is limited you have to take the forces there away from the fight , and you ca n't do unit training there s not very much you can do outside iraq but you can do some you can do some you can do some
so , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad made his annual foray to our humble island yesterday , but an absent sarah palin still managed to steal some of his thunder marcia kramer of wcbs reports that politics and diplomacy were not a good mix at monday s protest rally against iran at the united nations she explains  hillary clinton and sarah palin didn t participate in the stop iran now rally and there were a lot of hard feelings about it it was a simple sign that read we want sarah shame on the rally organizer howard webber from brooklyn held it as important an event as this is , you needed a unity of democrats and republicans to show ahmadinejad that we re not going to accept a nuclear iran buddy macy of little fells , nj , felt much the same way i m so disappointed , upset , macy said she would have brought 10 , 00020 , 000 more supporters of israel people who were curious were stopped because of partisan action the brouhaha started after clinton pulled out after she learned palin was invited three organizations supporting the rally threatened to pull out unless palin was disinvited she was but organizers didn t stop there they were furious monday about the political signs brought by some at the rally , like an antiobama sign that said , jews against obama ahmadinejad times columnist clyde haberman doesn t think any parties did themselves credit  within the jewish coalition , a leftright divide became evident on the right , some said it was mrs clinton who had played partisan politics but people on the left saw no equivalence between the democratic senator and the republican governor only one of them is a candidate inviting ms palin , they charged , tilted the rally toward the republican national ticket an impression not likely to be dispelled by the many signs on monday supporting senator john mccain and none backing senator barack obama reports in the jewish press said that rally organizers reached out belatedly to the obama campaign it agreed to take part but then the organizers had second thoughts , and disinvited every politician , ms palin included all that did was anger some jews on the right in the end , the entire episode had turned into a political embarrassment , wrote the forward , a jewish weekly so it always seems to go when mr ahmadinejad is in town chances are good that he will be here again next year maybe by then yet another group of new yorkers will have figured out how to get it wrong however , david bernstein , writing at the volokh conspiracy , thinks the jewish left has the black eye  has any political organization squandered its credibility as quickly as j street , a new organization that promotes itself as a peacenik alternative to aipac \? supposedly , the machers at j street thought that aipac was not properly representing the jewish community s views on israel because aiapc is too rightwing it s become obvious , however , that the j street founders problem with aipac is not that it s too rightwing \( in fact , despite claims emanating from leftwingers about aipac s rightwingedness , aipac rarely deviates from supporting current israeli government policy , and its leadership has been largely democratic for decades the architect of aipac s prominence beginning in the 1980s was former ted kennedy staffer tom dine \) , but that it is too nonpartisan aipac , as a nonpartisan proisrael lobby , cooperates with both republicans and democrats , exactly as a nonpartisan lobby should j street , it turns out , wants to be an adjunct of the democratic party , and apparently wants to discredit proisrael jews who cooperate with the republicans the obvious response would be to try to engage her to try to support j street s perspective , not to try to prevent her from speaking especially since neither j street \( nor anyone else \) really knows whether palin s overall views on the middle east might be to its liking unless , of course , j street , whose leadership is composed of leading jewish liberal democrats , was serving the interests of barack obama and the democratic party , and not its purported , propeace , proisrael mission and for those of you dying to know what the governor of alaska had on her mind , haaretz has reprinted the text of thespeechthatneverwas right here
huckabee thank you thanks so very much you guys have been waiting i hear we have between 800 and 1 , 000 people packed in this place please do n't call the fire marshal \( laughter \) first of all , i want to say a special word of thanks to the people in michigan they 've been wonderful to us over the past few days you know , we were outspent 50 1 , and for us to be able to do as well as we did is a remarkable testament to some incredible volunteers up there i congratulate mitt romney he won a great race he worked hard he , of course , has a great base there , but our hats are off to him for his victory there tonight so it looks like that i won iowa john mccain won new hampshire mitt romney won michigan ladies and gentlemen , we 're going to win south carolina ! \( applause \) we put a flag in the ground here saturday we 're going to make it real clear , that the firstinthesouth primary is going to give their support to the firstinthesouth candidate who understands that this nation needs leadership , and leadership that comes right from the earth and right from the heart of the people months ago , when none of the other republicans were talking about the economy , when they all said it was doing great , i said you better keep your eye on it , because if you just not spend your time talking to people , but if you spend some time listening to people , you 're going to find out that there s a world of hurt out there in america now , all of them are realizing that what i said months ago is true and we need the kind of leadership that not only sees it first , but does something about it first , and that s what i pledge to the people of america \( applause \) give me a chance to lead , and we will lead this country and we 'll change the tax system and we 'll also make it so that your government does n't work against you in your job , but helps work for you , because good government ought to facilitate the free enterprise system it ought not to complicate the free enterprise system that s why we need lower , not higher taxes it s why we need a government that understands that mothers and fathers raise better kids than governments do get the government off mom and dad s back and let them raise their families it s why it s also true that over the past few months , people who said , who is this huckabee guy \? where is he coming from \? i 'll tell you where i'm coming from i'm coming from you , and a lot of people around this country are realizing that it s time that the presidency and that the government is not headquartered so much in washington , dc , as is headquartered in the small towns across this country , where people do the work and put food on the table for their families and get their kids to school and they basically just want a government that is as small as it can be , but what government there has to be does two things one , protects our borders , protects out security and makes it so we 're safe in this nation and the second thing , leaves us alone so that we can live our lives and live in this free enterprise system and give small business a chance to survive and even thrive that s what america s really looking for \( applause \) and that s what they 're going to get when we get elected \( applause \) i'm deeply grateful for the kind of support we 're getting in south carolina and today , when we were here in rallies in sumter and in rock hill , huge crowds , enthusiastic crowds and we told folks , look , between now and saturday , we do n't want you to just go and say , oh , i 'll vote for you we want you to go and say , i 'll vote for you and i 'll get folks out there to go with me to vote and i 've said , if you 're going to vote for me , do n't let anything keep you from it if you 're not going to vote for me , do n't even show up \( laughter \) if you know somebody that s not going to vote for me , let the air out of their tires saturday \( laughter \) you know , a lot of these politicians will say , now , it does n't matter who you vote for , as long as you vote you 'll never hear me say that , because it matters who you vote for ! \( laughter \) \( applause \) and i want to tell you something for the past several months , it s been our desire , our commitment , and now it is our determination that we 're not just going to do well in south carolina you know , the campbell \( ph \) family and i'm so grateful for mike campbell and his family they 're kind of the gold standard of south carolina politics and every year since 1980 , when they picked ronald reagan when he was in fourth place and he was the republican candidate that the establishment did n't like and did n't want , back even then , the campbell family said , this is who we 're going to support and they picked a winner and every presidential election since that time , the campbell family has batted 1000 they have n't been wrong yet and i want to make something absolutely , perfectly clear we are n't about to let the campbell family down in 2008 \( applause \) they 're going to still be picking a winner this week \( applause \) david beasley s been here with me he and i have been governors together , close friends our wives are close friends and i can tell you that there s nobody more fired up for us in all of south carolina than david beasley and folks , over the next few days , i'm sure you 're going to hear some things , well , here s all the stuff about mike huckabee that s fine just remember , you know , as my pastor used to tell me as a little kid , when you 're getting kicked in the behind , it proves you 're still out front so we 'll probably take a little kicking out here \( applause \) all that does is prove we 're still out front and i want you to help us this week let me tell you why it s so important because we need to prove that electing a president is not just about how much money a candidate has it s about whether he can lead this country and reflect the views and the values of the people that really are the heart and the soul of america end
bradenton , fla the were so ravaged by injuries last spring that they used 11 starting pitchers before memorial day taking no chances this time , they prepared as a starter in case injury struck again so far , the yankees' starters are healthy , and wednesday was time to acknowledge that pleasant reality chamberlain is back in the bullpen , officially , with none of the socalled joba rules attached they 're not going to sell as many tshirts , chamberlain said you 've got to be prepared at the time if they need a couple of outs , you have to be ready chamberlain and ian kennedy have been pitching on the same day this spring training , and kennedy will start against the toronto blue jays on thursday in dunedin chamberlain will work in relief the rest of camp , starting thursday asked if chamberlain might switch to starting later this season , manager joe girardi said we have not gotten that far i'm just going to put it this way we consider him a starter in the future girardi , general manager brian cashman and the pitching coach dave eiland informed chamberlain in a meeting before the yankees' trip here to face the pittsburgh pirates in the first night game at mckechnie field chamberlain , who allowed only one run in 24 relief innings last season , did not complain everybody s done a good job this spring , and everybody s pushed each other , chamberlain said this is the best for the team , and right now that s the role that it s going to be i have no preference whatsoever when you look at it in the big picture , it s never about yourself , it s about the team chamberlain , kennedy and phil hughes are essential to the yankees' plans , but they are younger than 24 and will work within innings limits chamberlain has the fewest professional innings 116 and to be a starter again , he would probably need a stint in the minors it s difficult , because you 've got to build him up , girardi said the bestcase scenario is everyone stays healthy and pitches really well when chamberlain was promoted in august , he was given a day off for every inning he threw with no such restrictions anymore , girardi was asked if chamberlain could be used the way mariano rivera was in 1996 rivera was 26 then chamberlain is 22 and he had already worked almost 500 professional innings before 1996 girardi knew almost precisely how many innings rivera pitched that season 107 2 3 and he did not sound eager to use chamberlain as much obviously , from a work standpoint , his body could physically handle it , girardi said but we have to watch him carefully phil hughes allowed seven runs over four innings in the yankees' 129 victory against the pittsburgh pirates the performance swelled hughes s spring training earned run average to 771 , with two starts remaining , but he said he was not concerned hughes said that his changeup needed work , but that his mechanical flaw of overstriding in his delivery could be corrected it s really just stay back and do n't try to do too much , hughes said it s a fixable thing the wind was blowing out for the first night game at mckechnie field , which opened in 1923 jorge posada , nick green and chad moeller homered for the yankees , and the pirates hit three off hughes i look at the first home run and the second home run , and i'm not sure they 're home runs on a normal evening , joe girardi said and we had a couple , too melky cabrera and shelley duncan are facing threegame suspensions for their roles in a march 12 brawl , but they are likely to start the season on the active roster duncan said his appeal would not be heard until after opening day , and bob watson , baseball s disciplinarian , said he would not return from a trip to japan until march 28 that is a friday , and the yankees start the season against toronto on monday , march 31 they are off the next day federal prosecutors said they planned to seek a new indictment against barry bonds , hoping to correct problems with the original indictment in the case united states district judge susan illston said the original indictment was faulty but refused to throw out the charges she ordered the government to narrow the charges or bring a new indictment before proceeding bonds was indicted last november by authorities at the united states attorney s office in the northern district of california on charges he lied before a grand jury about his use of performanceenhancing drugs unsigned and thus far unwanted , barry bonds still wants to play this year i'm not going to retire , he told tuesday i do n't think that s going to happen i'm working out i'm training he added i 'll come back in july if i have to it depends on the circumstances bonds , 43 , has not received an offer i want to win a championship or else i want to keep trying to win a championship until there s nothing left inside me , bonds said i can still play the chicago cubs' kerry wood missed a oneinning relief appearance wednesday in mesa , ariz , because of lowerback spasms the development was a little bit of a setback , but nothing , nothing serious , manager lou piniella said
