san diego , sept 16 five years after a serial killer , or killers , began attacking prostitutes and other young women here , the san diego police are still searching for suspects and a special task force has begun investigating the investigation itself the killings began in june 1985 with the slaying of donna gentile , a 22yearold prostitute whose battered body was found in a remote part of san diego with small stones and gravel stuffed in her mouth since then there have been 42 other victims the investigation intensified this month after a grand jury report harshly criticized the police department s conduct in investigating a ring of highpriced call girls in 1987 although the grand jury s investigation did not focus on the series of killings here , it raised several questions about police misconduct , concluding among other things that some san diego officers had hired prostitutes as a result , officials have called in outside experts to help with the inquiry into the 43 deaths and into the actions of the police 'we want a solution' questions have been unanswered for much too long , mayor maureen o'connor said in an interview all of us , the chief , city manager and council , are very frustrated we want a solution although the grand jury could not find enough evidence to warrant criminal charges , its criticism of the police department has led to heightened scrutiny of the department and speculation that the conduct that tainted the callgirl operation may also have harmed the investigation into the killings something serious may be awry in the police department , the san diego union said in an editorial last month but only a thorough investigation will confirm whether the suspicions are founded or are just sensational rumors the expansion of the police task force brings in officials from the district attorney s office and the office of the state attorney general one unit of the enlarged force will look into the multiple deaths and the possibility that not one but several serial killers have been at work here focus on first victim there appears to be several groupings of cases , and that would lend itself to there being two or three or maybe four people doing a number of them , said bonnie dumanis , a deputy district attorney who is the task force spokeswoman a second unit will focus on the death of miss gentile , believed to have been a police informer who was also known to have been involved socially with police officers shortly before her death , she testified at civil service commission hearings about her relationships with two police officers , one of whom was later dismissed and the other demoted before she was killed , miss gentile gave her lawyer a videotape that spoke of her fears , saying , i feel someone in a uniform with a badge can still be a serious criminal the lawyer , doug holbrook , told the union , two things bothered her that a police officer might have somebody harm her , or that someone she might have turned in would get her stones seen as a signal local news reports have speculated that the stones and gravel found stuffed in her mouth could have been a signal that she was killed because she had spoken too much the third branch of the task force , headed by a deputy attorney general , will pursue allegations of police misconduct , including , in the words of the chief deputy district attorney , brian michaels , the possibility that one or more police officers might be involved in one or more of the murders ms dumanis said , any policeman who had an association with a prostitute needs to be looked at the shortage of details that have been made public about the investigations has led to widespread public speculation most recently , attention has been focused on a review the police made of a cache of private videotapes , apparently in search of links between miss gentile and highly placed lawenforcement officials the videotapes were seized from the home of a local television entertainer known as shotgun tom kelly , who taped private parties attended by prominent people although all 43 killings remain unsolved , the task force has aggressively pursued a variety of approaches one focus of the investigation involves reports of violence against prostitutes who survived and identified their attackers six of the attackers are serving prison terms , but none have been publicly linked to the killings in another approach , officers tracked down the rolodex madam , karen wilkening , whose call girl ring was the focus of the grand jury investigation earlier this year ms wilkening had fled to the philippines to avoid charges of pimping and pandering in the call girl case , and the task force hoped to examine her records in search of a possible link between miss gentile and police officials ms wilkening was brought back from the philippines , tried and convicted of pandering and conspiracy last year and is serving a 44month sentence but ms dumanis said the information from her card file , reported to include the names of influential people but also said to have been stripped of some wellknown names , has n't been real helpful most promising has been the arrest in december 1988 of alan michael \( buzzard \) stevens , who is scheduled to go on trial this month in the strangulation death of cynthia mcvey , a 25yearold prostitute an 18month hiatus for 18 months after his arrest , ms dumanis said , there were no further slayings of prostitutes mr michaels , who is prosecuting the case , declined to say whether he intended to link mr stevens to other killings there 'll be some little revelations , i'm hoping , in the buzzard stevens case , he said but they will be small and you 'll have to listen for them since july , however , ms dumanis said , there have been three deaths that fit the criteria of the task force of women 14 to 45 years of age , nude or partly nude , their bodies abandoned in remote areas apparently separate from where they were killed , and usually killed by strangulation the task force spokeswoman said it could not be determined whether the new slayings were related to some or all of the killings that occurred before mr stevens s arrest facial features reconstructed the latest focus of the investigation appears to be one of the earlier victims , an unidentified young woman who was killed in october 1986 investigators call her pala jane doe because her body was found on the pala indian reservation for reasons ms dumanis would not disclose , the young woman s body was recently exhumed and , using an unusual reconstructive method , a likeness was molded based on the shape of her skull and has been displayed to the press complete with glass eyes , false eyelashes and a wig , the reconstruction , bearing a slightly startled expression , was described by ms dumanis as 80 percent accurate photo donna gentile , who was the first of 43 victims of a fiveyearlong series of slayings in san diego \( associated press , 1985 \)
los angeles you can still be a pioneer by going west in this sprawling city , and three years ago the art dealer james corcoran did just that he was the first major dealer to move his gallery from west hollywood to santa monica , about 10 miles away , where he says the air is cleaner and the customers are closer other dealers quickly followed suit , and today the rivieralike setting could with some license be called the soho of the west coast without question santa monica is where it s at , said sandy starr , the gallery s director what s happened now is that for the first time a great number of galleries have clustered within walking and driving distance of one another , and the centralization is a marvelous thing it s become a real promenade installed in a capacious red brick building on fifth street , the bustling gallery handles wellknown california artists like ed ruscha , billy al bengston and kenneth price , and also shows artists represented by new york dealers , like frank stella , anthony caro and vito acconci refugees from high rent the market has picked up gigantically , mr corcoran said , and his gallery doubles its business every year most of the people we sell to live near here pacific palisades , santa monica canyon and malibu it s easier for them to get here , and there are no traffic problems on saturdays as there are in west los angeles , where you can get stuck for half an hour in your car more than a dozen other dealers have now ensconced themselves in santa monica , many of them emigrants from congested highrent areas like west hollywood some are new in the business , and others are branching out from new york or elsewhere those who have arrived from west hollywood include richard kuhlenschmidt , daniel weinberg , karl bornstein and michael kohn among the newcomers are linda cathcart , former director of the museum of contemporary art in houston , and fred hoffman , a onetime university teacher and print publisher , both of whom have opened galleries in a multidealer complex on colorado avenue new york is represented by blumhelman , tatischeff and luhring augustine hetzel , all branches of manhattan dealerships and from san francisco has come dorothy goldeen , who two years ago moved into an impressive space on ninth street none of the dealers complain about business to many of them los angeles seems to be recovering the vitality of the 1960 s and early 70 s , when the city had a bustling art scene that later faded they cite the growth of the museums in the area , including the getty , the los angeles county museum of art and the museum of contemporary art , as well as the establishment of an international art fair , now in its fourth year several foundations , established by the local entrepreneurs eli broad and frederick weisman and the late financier j patrick lannan , are actively supporting and buying art a new local art magazine , art issues , published by gary kornblau , has made a modest beginning , and the internationally minded journal of art has established a bureau in los angeles , where its executive editor , jan butterfield , resides both magazines contribute to a muchneeded critical dialogue 'more reasons to stay' there are now support structures , mr kuhlenschmidt said there are more reasons for artists to stay here and work not only are more people buying here now we 're also selling a lot to collectors from other places , including new york and europe although they agree that santa monica is hot , some dealers express the view that los angeles has a long way to go before it can be considered a major art scene one is irving blum , of the blumhelman gallery in the 1960 s , he was a partner in the ferus gallery on la cienega boulevard , which showed the most challenging talents of the day the los angeles scene is always two steps forward , one step back , mr blum said it s needed some centrality , and santa monica has provided it but the truth is , it has n't happened yet that la has become a major art center with 30 or so galleries , there just is n't the density that new york has everything seems to be focused here now , and that s great but the ongoing problem is that collectors will still only spend up to a certain level when they want to spend more , they go to new york that makes the situation ultimately provincial he was seconded by paul kantor , who for 40 years has been dealing in 20thcentury masters as well as contemporary art you ca n't sell 20thcentury masters here now , he said , pointing out the dearth of other dealers in his field once you get over 1 million , there are no major buyers they will not step up to the 3 million or 5 million or 15 million picture the international scene is gone there is no major collection of 20thcentury classics the holdouts not every los angeles dealer has made tracks for santa monica there are still important galleries in other parts of the city the most notable is the margo leavin gallery , a vast complex fronting on north robertson boulevard in west hollywood ms leavin , the doyenne of dealers in los angeles , opened her gallery in 1970 and now handles wellknown new york and west coast artists , from donald judd and claes oldenburg to john baldessari and alexis smith
to crack open a new book and read its dedication and acknowledgments is typically an occasion for me to relive an experience years ago , when i was a midshipman one night i was assigned to stand watch on the fantail of our ship with a young enlisted man while we looked over the inky pacific , illuminated by a long strip of moonlight , he poured out a story of his sad youth , especially of his unloving parents though barely able to make out the sailor s face , i felt a bond born of sincere selfrevelation then , several days later , we happened to meet in a passageway i noticed the sailor had a large tattoo on his arm , a heart with the inscription mother authors , whether of fiction or nonfiction , pride themselves on uncompromising honesty and courage , on originality and style but when the time comes to put the finishing touches on their books , they , like the young sailor , are inclined to suspend judgment they become perfunctory and reach for smarmy cliches or the trite to decorate their work the result is that the front of the book is rarely worth reading for proof , consider the fruits of a survey of 50 books taken off my shelf at random first , half of those dedications in which the relationship to the author was clear were to spouses this is not only unimaginative , it s not particularly reassuring about the clearheadedness of the author after all , one out of every two marriages ends in divorce these days second , not one of the acknowledgments in these 50 books had anything negative to say about anything or anyone of course , the idea of acknowledgments is to thank people , not lambaste them yet , as every writer knows , praise means nothing if it is not balanced against criticism how , indeed , does one measure authors who see around them only unfailingly helpful librarians , cheerful typists , utterly candid sources and selfless scholars who , contrary to the reality of academe , always make constructive comments and on time \? the only example that comes to mind of genuine frankness was an acknowledgment in which the author complained about the new york public library and having stumbled on it so long ago , i now ca n't recall the name of the book not that authors get much guidance howto books on publishing say plenty about choosing typefaces and fashioning bibliographies but acknowledgments and dedications are treated as if they were naughty activities best left out of polite conversation if the author wishes to have a dedication page , says one guide on writing books , he should phrase the dedication as simply as possible the chicago manual of style talks about dedications as matters for the author to determine , though it discourages the unusual or interesting extravagant dedications are things of the past humorous ones are inappropriate in a serious book it s one of those things that you are supposed to know how to handle , like your wedding night , the essayist joseph epstein told me he had written briefly on acknowledgments in the middle of my tether , including in his choice comments the most nearly adequate acknowledgment he ever received it read i am indebted to joseph epstein for \( among other things \) directing me toward alexander herzen richard h rovere , a journalist , parodied acknowledgments 25 years ago in the american scholar \( where , coincidentally , mr epstein s essays appear \) the tone of acknowledgments , rovere understood , is better satirized than described he began his parody this way like the six that preceded it , this seventh volume in my life of raison d'etre owes its existence to many people besides its author as d'etre himself once said , slightly paraphrasing his great contemporary , washington irving , e pluribus unum is a motto that could be as aptly applied to the work of scholars as to the young republic to which both d'etre and the incomparable creator of the leatherstocking tales made such signal contributions acknowledgments are a curious achievement of pretension , hyperbole and banality still , no one about to send a book to the publisher should feel intimidated by this final task a rigid formula eliminates virtually all choice , both in overall structure and in phrasing wouldbe authors can simply follow the stepbystep process outlined below , using the quotations \( culled from real books \) much as kids cobble together mr potato head at the very beginning , call into question your facility with words one of the best techniques is to suggest your debts are beyond your capacity to describe it would be impossible to acknowledge adequately all the assistance i have received from scholars , libraries and editors or i have accumulated more debts than i can possibly repay here any glossary for acknowledgments puts two words right at the top , indebted and invaluable , as in i'm indebted to for invaluable help photocopying the manuscript and coping with the many paper jams we encountered along the way the phrase constant encouragement and advice is essential deeply grateful is a must use cheerful to describe those who did the most menial chores for you
the artworld news from london , just two sundays ago , concerned heinz berggruen , a 75yearold art dealer who made his career in paris between 1948 and 1980 from 1982 to 1988 he kept an apartment in the carlyle hotel in new york since then , he has lived in geneva and what was the news \? that he had agreed to make a fiveyear loan \( renewable by mutual agreement \) to the national gallery in london of 72 paintings and drawings by paul cezanne , georges seurat , vincent van gogh , pablo picasso , georges braque and joan miro all were from the private collection that he had been building , trading up and in general perfecting for more than 40 years for london , it was a considerable coup the loans will have a twofold effect on the national gallery they will enormously reinforce its present holdings of cezanne and seurat and they will transform the final phase of its collections by making deep forays into the 20th century \( those forays will be due above all to the loan of no fewer than 40 picassos , but the arrival of two important miros one dated 192425 and the other dated 1955 will introduce an esthetic not previously represented in the national gallery \) in new york , reaction to the berggruen news was understandably less euphoric than in london during his years in new york , mr berggruen had given the metropolitan museum 90 paintings and drawings by paul klee , and for several summers he had lent not only the small version of seurat s poseuses but a noble swath of paintings by cezanne it would have been asking too much of human nature if the met had not hoped for further benefactions but it is the collector s right to search for the place in which his collection will be most at home and do most good in mr berggruen s case , the national gallery in london seemed to him just right not least , perhaps , as a result of one or two happy coincidences , like the fact that his painting of a treelined path near chantilly is first cousin to a painting by cezanne of the same subject that was already in the national gallery on the day that this critic first heard that the berggruen loan agreement had been signed , he was walking round the annenberg collection , which can be seen through aug 5 at the national gallery of art in washington , and is scheduled to move later to the los angeles county museum of art \( aug 16nov 11 \) and the metropolitan museum of art \( mayoctober 1991 \) as elsewhere \( and most recently when the collection was shown at the philadelphia museum of art \) the annenberg vase of roses by van gogh was very much admired now that so much has lately been written and said about van gogh s irises , we look with a new intensity at the other flower paintings that , like the irises , date from the end of his short life the vase of roses is in the top flight of that particular group , and we may surmise that it was on the evidence of the painting , as much as because of anything else that the doctors had to say , that van gogh was officially pronounced cured three days after he had completed it but my particular object that morning was to see the painting by georges braque that was added not long ago to the annenberg collection entitled the studio , and painted in 1939 , it is the forerunner of braque s postwar studio paintings a series that has few equals in the 20th century for their mingling of grandeur and subtlety , finesse of touch and complexity of intent it is their forerunner , and it is also their equal when we see how braque makes wallpaper flowers rhyme with real ones , and how he uses the wicker seat of a studio stool as a source of directional energy toward all four corners of the canvas , we know that we are in the presence of a great painter together with picasso s lapin agile of 1905 , which entered the collection in november 1989 , it suggests that the powerful and still expanding sensibility that governs the annenberg collection has not yet got set in its ways what could be more natural than that that stillexpanding sensibility should keep all its options until the right permanent place for the collection had presented itself \? meanwhile , people are bound to talk , and to speculate there is nothing that museums the world over covet quite so much , right now , as a major private collection that is intact , unearmarked , unpromised and unentailed wherever such a collection is known to exist , daydreaming is permitted daydreams can lead to action , moreover wherever the final destination of a major collection has not been made known , a museum director is in duty bound to wonder whether it might not be available if not for acquisition at any rate for loan in either the short or the long term that was the motivation of the reina sofia art museum in madrid when it got quite some way with negotiations for the berggruen collection to be shown in madrid this year those negotiations fell through but a loan , whether long or short , can be a wonderful thing rarely has a museum done a better day s job than when the national gallery of scotland secured from the duke of sutherland the longterm loan \( still in being \) of some of the greatest pictures ever painted interested visitors to edinburgh do not forget their first sight of the three paintings by titian the three ages of man , diana and actaeon and diana and calisto that are part of the sutherland loan paintings of this order change the whole climate of a museum , and it is an ineffective director that does not do everything that he can , short of breaking and entering , to get them

washington , april 5 in a sweeping agreement with washington to reduce trade barriers , tokyo pledged today to take actions intended to make it easier for foreigners to invest in japan and do business there the japanese steps range from cutting restrictions on large retail stores to altering tax policies so that more land will be available for commercial and residential use the agreement is the result of an ambitious effort to deal with the underlying causes of the united states' huge trade deficit in the past , trade talks between the countries have focused on raising sales of specific american products to japan or curbing japanese exports no quick effect seen the promised changes were greeted by american officials as a positive step in a longrunning effort because it will probably take years to carry out some of the steps , carla a hills , the united states trade representative , stressed that there was likely to be very little shortterm impact on the trade deficit with japan , which last year totaled 49 billion but she said the agreement should facilitate capital flows and walk the two countries toward greater parity i told the japanese i wanted a comprehensive blueprint with sufficient specifics so that i could call it a down payment , mrs hills said this is a good blueprint , sufficient to call a down payment richard t mccormack , under secretary of state for economic affairs , told reporters that the talks were a rare instance in which two governments have sought to address the entire range of domestic policies that affect their international economic relations world s largest economies the united states and japan are the world s two largest economies together , they account for about onethird of the world s total output of goods and services the agreement was the result of intense overtime negotiating sessions this week at the state department the agreement was formally announced at 7 30 pm in washington to accommodate prime minister toshiki kaifu , who also announced it early friday morning in tokyo the agreement followed narrower accords intended to increase access to the japanese market for american supercomputers , communications satellites and telecommunications equipment it also follows a meeting between mr kaifu and president bush in palm springs , calif , on march 2 and 3 at which the japanese leader pledged his utmost to ease trade friction sensitive to political reaction in tokyo , japanese negotiators here portrayed the agreement not as a response to threats to restrict the flow of japanese goods into the united states , but as an effort to improve the quality of life for japanese consumers and to integrate japan s economy with the world s most of the measures are subject to approval by the japanese parliament the new measures are listed in an interim report the two governments published on the socalled structural impediments initiative , the formal name of the effort to deal with broadbased obstacles to trade this week s talks , which were extended to four days , from the original schedule of two , were the fourth round of negotiations since the initiative began in july a final report is due next july the bush administration s goal is to make it as easy for americans to do business in japan as for the japanese to do business here the japanese government acknowledged that prices for most goods and services there were higher than in most other countries and agreed that price levels in the future should be a barometer of the initiative s success monitoring procedures have not yet been worked out in detail reaction from politicians on capitol hill , initial reactions were guarded put me down as a skeptic who s seen too many agreements in which the results did n't match the rhetoric , said lloyd bentsen , democrat of texas and chairman of the senate finance committee but max baucus , democrat of montana and chairman of finance committee s trade subcommittee , said he was encouraged by the first steps he added , however , that much remains to be done in tokyo next week , the two governments are to begin another round of negotiations over trade in wood products , a sector in which the administration contends that the japanese practice widespread trade restrictions senator john c danforth of missouri , the ranking republican on the trade subcommittee , said the talks had been worth pursuing , but noted that in any commercial agreement with japan , seeing is believing the changes promised by tokyo include increasing investment in public works making the intricate japanese distribution system more accessible to outsiders stiffening antitrust penalties changing tax policies to open more land for commercial and residential use providing import clearance within 24 hours for foreign goods , and curbing the anticompetitive practices of japanese industrial groups what the us pledged the united states , in turn , promised to work on the structural causes of its large trade deficits but unlike the japanese , the americans did not list any new policy initiatives , but rather echoed proposals already made by the bush administration for example , the united states pledged to improve education , bolster savings and investment , and cut the cost of capital , all familiar proposals that were part of the state of the union address
charlotte , nc , march 9 for the longest time , it looked as if north carolina state and its beleaguered coach , jim valvano , would extend their bumpy season but the squad that came to the atlantic coast conference tournament with only seven scholarship players , a likely lameduck coach , and five losses in its last six games wore out against georgia tech , and lost , 7667 the yellow jackets \( 226 \) will play duke \( 247 \) in saturday s semifinals after clemson \( 247 \) faces virginia \( 1810 \) , an overtime victor over north carolina i feel for the young men who 've toiled through a difficult season , said valvano , who denied he felt relieved by concluding his 10th year as the wolfpack coach receives support and those young men say they feel for their coach , perhaps none more than the junior point guard , chris corchiani if coach valvano leaves , i leave , he said after the game , repeating a pledge he made earlier this week he s been treated unfairly , and i just ca n't see myself being associated with a program that does n't support a coach who s been good for this institution georgia tech s players were sympathetic , too it s really sad , said brian oliver , who had 22 points , 14 in the second half , as the yellow jackets won a conference tournament game for the first time in four years i wish there was something the coaches could do , and even the players , to make things better , but i guess it s out of our hands confronted by a firestorm of criticism in the wake of allegations of pointshaving by former wolfpack players and the admission by a former player , charles shackleford , that he accepted money from an agent while at north carolina state , valvano has been negotiating a release from his contract with the school willing to stay if the university would like me to continue as the coach , that s what i would like to do , valvano said if they do n't want me to , then we 'll have to deal with that acutely aware of its recent failures in the event , georgia tech scored the game s first basket , then fell behind for more than 31 minutes the wolfpack led by as many as a dozen points in the first half , powered by a 2415 edge on the boards and 22 points from its guards , rodney monroe and corchiani monroe finished with 20 the wolfpack controlled the firsthalf tempo and held georgia tech , which leads the acc with seven 3pointers per game , to 1of10 shooting from long range for the game , the yellow jackets were 2 for 17 on 3pointers but after trailing by 8 points with 12 28 remaining , the yellow jackets found their rhythm and outscored the wolfpack by 132 to take the lead for good , 5451 they got a little tired , and we finally got our intensity back , said dennis scott , who led all scorers with 23 points the wolfpack pulled to 5452 on a free throw by brian howard , then withered , scoring only 15 points the rest of the way they shot 28 percent in the second half north carolina state , which is on probation and cannot play in the national collegiate athletic association tournament , concluded its season 1812 duke , which has beaten georgia tech twice this season , raised its record to 247 against maryland , breaking open a close game midway in the second half to coast to a 10484 victory the winning margin was the largest by a duke team in the 37year history of the acc tournament maryland dropped to 1813 clemson \( 247 \) won its first tournament game in a decade by outlasting eighthseeded wake forest , 7970 virginia s 9285 victory was its first over the tar heels in this event since 1976 , when the cavaliers captured their only acc title the fourthseeded tar heels forced overtime by scoring the last 4 points of regulation scott williams s follow of a king rice miss tied the score at 8181 with just under five seconds left in regulation williams then blocked a lastsecond shot by virginia s john crotty but virginia refused to fold in overtime and extended the tenure of coach terry holland , who will be leaving the team after 16 seasons to become the athletic director at davidson sophomore sensation the cavaliers survived thanks in large part anthony oliver , a sophomore guard who made 10 of 11 shots on the way to scoring a careerhigh 23 points oliver quickly erased north carolina s 8584 overtime lead by hitting consecutive jumpshots , giving the cavaliers an 8885 advantage with 59 seconds remaining virginia never trailed again the cavaliers were led by bryant stith , who had 18 points in the second half and 32 over all to accompany 11 rebounds , 6 on offense

boston but that was then this is now clemens , who turned 28 years old aug 4 , has evolved in both style and substance as a pitcher some people notice it others do n't he s changed since i came over here , said one of his teammates , mike boddicker , who joined the red sox from the baltimore orioles in mid1988 he s a smart pitcher he s not a thrower clemens won his 20th game of the season last thursday night against the indians in cleveland this is the third time in five seasons he has reached that total , and he has done so with a flourish a 195 earned run average , four shutouts in his last eight starts , an eightgame winning streak and , in august , a 60 record and an earned run average of 109 he has allowed just 48 base runners in 49y innings and has n't given up a home run since the break for the allstar game clemens , who will next pitch tomorrow against dave stewart and the oakland athletics , could become just the second american league pitcher to finish a season with an earned run average under 200 since the dawn of the designated hitter in 1973 the other was the yankees' ron guidry , who went 253 with a 174 era in 1978 clemens could also join steve carlton , sandy koufax , jim palmer and tom seaver as the only pitchers to win three cy young awards although his style may have changed in subtle ways , batters no doubt see the same clemens they have always seen opponents are batting 228 against him this season , 189 with men on base , 174 with runners in scoring position , 158 with two or more men on and 135 with a runner on third different \? i do n't really see any difference , said wade boggs , boston s third baseman there has been some change as far as maturity goes he was a raw talent as a kid , but he s matured now basically , though , he s the same this is one way that he s the same roger is the kind of guy who , if he loses to you in dominoes , he 'll stay up until 2 in the morning trying to beat you so he can go to sleep , said marty barrett , the boston second baseman that s the way he is clemens s intense nature has never left him after he beat the toronto blue jays , 10 , for his 19th victory in a critical meeting between the two teams last week , he sounded as if the game was still circulating through his system i thrive on situations like this , he told reporters after the game i was a little sluggish , and it was the kind of day when you throw hard even when you do n't really like it i had to rely on emotion and adrenaline clemens restricts his chats with the press to the days he pitches and is firm in this rule so it is left for those who know him to discuss the changes they have seen in him seaver , now a yankee television broadcaster , pitched for boston in 1986 seaver said he had not seen clemens pitch this season but had studied his record well when i look at the numbers and see how he struggled' last year , then ended up winning his last few decisions when he could 've packed it in , that says something , seaver said he s a different pitcher now in the sense that he s still learning and progressing he continues to be a better pitcher he s still overpowering , but there s more knowledge to draw on he has two wells to choose from clemens began throwing a forkball two years ago , and this has made him even harder for batters to hit i think he s more dominant now because of the forkball , said tom brunansky , who joined the red sox from the st louis cardinals this season it makes the batter a little more hesitant you see it coming , and then the bottom just falls out of it with more pitches to choose from , clemens has perhaps become less reliant on his fastball he 'll finish the season with 200 strikeouts again , his fifth consecutive season of 200 or more , but he has struck out 10 or more batters in a game only 3 times this season still , his strikeout rate remains a marker by which others judge him and a symbol of his power when he strikes out 10 or more , his record is 332 with six nodecisions when i was in baltimore , boddicker said , he had unbelievable stuff he 'd make some pitches that would make you wonder what he was throwing , or make you feel he was just toying with guys he does n't have the 95mileanhour stuff , but he s learned he can get by with less he spots the ball better , and he knows when to bounce a breaking ball or throw a forkball in the dirt boddicker said clemens s minor ailments a bad back , shoulder trouble had caused him to make adjustments that he might not otherwise have made injuries can force you to change , boddicker said he s learned to pitch through stuff having more help has also benefited clemens the red sox are on their way to the american league east title because of their pitching , which has been surprising if nothing else clemens may have 20 victories , but boddicker has 14 , greg harris has 12 and , going into yesterday s game with the yankees , dana kiecker and tom bolton had combined for 13 clemens does n't have to do everything alone in '86 , he stopped so many losing streaks that we just expected it , said the boston outfielder mike greenwell there was a lot of weight on his shoulders we still expect him to win , but we expect everybody else in the rotation to win , too roger is still the same person he s what we call a gamer he s a battler , and he expects to win every ball game he bears down more when we 're down by a run or two clemens has won just once in four playoff and two world series starts , but , greenwell said , he 'll be better in the playoffs than he was before he s been there , greenwell continued by the time we got to the playoffs in the past , he was run down because all the weight had been on his shoulders but it s not there now , and that s a plus for us clemens may also have demanded less from his body earlier in the season so that he could hold some power in reserve for later in august , he threw three complete games in , july , two in june , none he is the game s most dominant pitcher he has a 11550 career record , has not lost a start since july 20 and has an earned run average of 080 during his current victory streak he has n't permitted more than two earned runs in a game in more than two months and his role as boston s single most important player seems to suit him now more than ever i do n't think roger in '86 was comfortable about being the no 1 guy , not from a maturity standpoint , seaver said i get the feeling he s very comfortable now photo roger clemens may be en route to a second mvp , award and a third cy young title \( reuters \)
albany , june 19 new york s highest ranking judge is pressing the court system he heads to give the public greater access to the records of civil court settlements where there is evidence of danger from consumer products , environmental contamination or other hazards in current practice , defendants in these suits often make secrecy a condition of the settlement , arguing that it is necessary to protect trade secrets the chief judge of new york , sol wachtler , is not alone in seeking less secrecy the practice of sealing court records in cases where public hazards may be involved is increasingly coming under attack in the nation as an abuse of the public court system recently texas and florida adopted rules aimed at reducing the number of court settlements that are sealed rules under study in new york such rules are under consideration by the court s administrative board , made up of judge wachtler and the presiding justices of the state s four judicial departments if the board recommends the changes in rules , public hearings will be held and the matter will then go to the sevenmember court of appeals , presided over by judge wachtler judge wachtler and other advocates of greater openness , including most plaintiff lawyers , argue that the public s right to know often outweighs the defendant s right to privacy i think that when you have the courts being used for redressing a wrong , it is the public that is providing and paying for the court procedure and making it available for private litigants , judge wachtler said in an interview these litigants should not then say to the public , 'it s none of your business' safety issues suggested when the record of a settlement is sealed , the chief judge continued , no one knows whether we can really eat the fish out of the hudson or buy ge toasters closing the record has become the routine , and i think it s high time that we consider whether there should be a presumption of openness noting that new rules were still in the drafting stage , judge wachtler stopped short of advocating specific changes but in recent letters and in interviews , he has indicated that he will press for rules that make it more difficult for civil court records to be sealed in cases that could have important implications for the public no reliable statistics exist on how many civil court settlements in new york state are ordered sealed by courts each year but experts say itcould run well into the thousands of the 58 , 135 civil cases set to go to trial last year , more than 35 , 000 were settled before a trial was completed it is not uncommon for court records to be sealed simply because both parties to the settlement agree to secrecy , many lawyers and judicial officials say the state s civil court dockets are so clogged , they say , that judges do not want to encourage more trials by rejecting the terms of settlements speed fosters secrecy the judges in new york are underpaid and understaffed , said bert bauman , presidentelect of the new york state trial lawyers association , who has been pressing for adoption of new rules it s expedient to move their cases as fast as they can if two parties come in and say they want to seal the record , they 're not going to look twice a case that is frequently used to illustrate the potential hazards of sealing court records is a 1988 settlement between the xerox corporation and a rochester family that contended it had been made sick by pollution from the company s plant there xerox agreed to a settlement with the family , with the stipulation that the court record be kept secret , a condition that both the family and the judge accepted questioning whether other families in the area might also have been harmed by the pollution , the health departments of monroe county and new york state later sued to have the record reopened in his decision to reopen the file , judge joseph fritsch of state supreme court in rochester wrote that the court has the inherent power to amend its order in the interest of justice , and in this case , in the interest of the public welfare and good debate among lawyers the prospect of new rules that would make it harder to seal court records has ignited a debate among lawyers defense lawyer groups have opposed new rules , while plaintiff lawyer groups have lobbied in favor of them i have never had an issue come before my committee that has generated so much debate , said george carpinello , chairman of the advisory committee on civil practice , which is to make a recommendation on new rules to the court system s administrative board within the next few weeks defense lawyers argue that sealing the record is often the only way to protect proprietary information the practice , they say , encourages settlements and cuts the backlog in the state s civil courts i think confidentiality is extremely important in the litigation process , because it encourages settlements , said blair fensterstock , chairman of the product liability committee of the the city bar association but members of the plaintiffs' bar argue that the public is being denied access to information that could be of vital interest there should be no settlement in exchange for a promise of confidentiality in cases where there are hazards , said mr bauman of the new york state trial lawyers association the press and the people have a right to be involved photo chief judge sol wachtler \( associated press \) \( pg b5 \)

thank heavens for the japanese ! george rossi exclaimed they are making the office leasing numbers look respectable at the world trade center mr rossi has been the trade center s general manager for sales and leasing for the last 13 months he has 10 million square feet of office space to think about , and it is no secret that these are not happy days for the downtown manhattan office market people talk about a vacancy rate there hovering around 14 percent when secondary , or nonprime , space is considered separately , the rate may be 20 to 25 percent but at the world trade center , mr rossi is happy to say , the vacancy rate is only 7 percent , or 700 , 000 square feet , of which 500 , 000 square feet are available currently tenants who now occupy the other 200 , 000 square feet intend to leave when their leases expire many people have worried that a heightened presence of japanese interests in the new york city economy symbolizes a setback to american enterprise but for a landlord who has seen occupancy fall from 98 percent to 93 percent , the increased japanese presence , particularly the banks , is a blessing the trade center s experience helps put in focus the importance of asian financial institutions to the new york city office market by the end of this year , close to 10 percent of the office tenants of the world trade center will be japanese concerns the figure is 750 , 000 square feet already the leading japanese banks among them fuji bank , daiichi kangyo bank , yasuda trust and banking and sumitomo bank ltd occupy 350 , 000 square feet that figure will soon go up to 440 , 000 square feet , mr rossi says the trade center s special affinity with the asian financial world extends beyond its relationship with the japanese the total space occupied by all asian banks , bankservice firms , investment banks and currency traders amounts to 826 , 000 square feet , compared with 800 , 000 square feet by similar american institutions and 236 , 000 square feet by european financial institutions the even better news , he says , is the rapid expansion of japanese regional banks in the united states they often make the world trade center their first location for the awayfromhome headquarters on a squarefoot basis , none of this has compensated for the trade center s occupancy losses these are mainly a result of the decline in tenants in the shipping business many have either closed or moved to less expensive secondary space , mr rossi said the center s biggest tenant , dean witter reynolds inc , has left about 300 , 000 square feet of space since its peak occupancy of 13 million square feet in the 1980 s dean witter reynolds has its world headquarters at the world trade center the biggest loss of all in the 1980 s has been the steady departure of new york state agencies gov mario m cuomo set that in motion when he took office for his first term in january 1983 the state was occupying two million square feet of space at the time its agencies had moved in during the dark days of the early 1970 s , one of the most dismal real estate markets of new york city s postdepression history the trade center was developed by the port authority of new york and new jersey and opened in december 1970 governor cuomo thought that state offices ought to be dispersed in less prestigious locations of the city , where rents were lower and office occupancy might give the subcenters an economic lift the state has been moving out of the world trade center ever since its occupancy is down to two floors occupied by the governor s office itself , plus two floors that will be vacated this summer by the end of this year , the state will occupy less than 100 , 000 square feet most of the space that the state yielded was rerented in the mid1980 s in the middle 30asquarefoot range , mr rossi said but in the last two years rents have fallen about 2 a square foot a year annual rents are now 28 to 40 a square foot in recent months the market and the center sustained the additional blow of the shrinkage in the space needs of shearson american express , and the collapse of drexel burnham lambert inc together , those events have put about 750 , 000 square feet of space that had been committed back on the market the silver lining , for the present , is therefore the japanese expansion it has a positive effect on downtown employment as well although the trade center management lacks precise figures , it notices that space leased by japanese banks is often filled with workers , some occupying cubicles as small as 60 square feet photo george rossi , the general manager for sales and leasing at the world trade center , where the vacancy rate is 7 percent \( media photo group inc \)
trumbull , conn , jan 25 when the trumbull little league allstars won the little league world series in williamsport , pa , last august , the young victors and their families expected a small hometown parade , a couple of plaques , a few local newspaper interviews and not much else , save for a lifetime s worth of memories what they received , however , were more than 50 requests for public appearances on the big league \( a k a rubber chicken \) banquet circuit , a taboo television commercial offer from pizza hut and a seemingly nonstop stream of telephone calls from advertising agencies , network television producers and national sports magazine writers we had no idea what was going to happen , said kenneth paul , whose 13yearold son , andy , was a pitcher on the trumbull team the team s 14 members happily partook of many of the events , including an appearance at the white house with president bush and a barbecue with gov william a o'neill andy paul also threw out the first ball during a game at the major league world series in oakland last october and chris drury , another pitcher , was featured in sports illustrated magazine 'enough is enough' the barnstorming ended this week , though , when trumbull little league officials received a letter from the president of little league inc , creighton hale , warning them to stop all public appearances or risk losing their charter league officials said the parade of events had gone on far too long they said they were worried about overglorifying the victory and feared for the players' psychological and academic wellbeing what we 're saying is enough is enough , said stephen d keener , a league spokesman we just do n't think this is healthy the parents of the players agreed , although a few were peeved by the league s intrusion and the tone of the letter it was almost over by itself , said tom galla , who managed the champions and whose whose 12yearold son , david , played second base but the little league stepping in , this takes the pressure off us to say yes or no to people over the hill at 13 \? others were concerned that their children might be forever known as nothing more than the williamsport boys , washed up and over the hill at 13 their education is far more important than celebrating the world championship , kenneth paul said parents also said the league s action had probably been in response to the team s attempt to sell autographed baseballs as a way to raise money for the town s babe ruth baseball league , in which most of the team will play this year the plan , which was modeled after a smilar fundraising device used by another little league team a few years ago , never got off the ground we made zero , galla said league officials in both williamsport and trumbull , a suburban town of about 35 , 000 people about 60 miles northeast of new york city , believe the celebration was so intense and prolonged because the team s victory marked the first time since 1983 that an american team had won the world series the trumbull team defeated kaohsiung , taiwan , 52 the last american team to win the series was from marietta , ga parents seek advice after the victory , the team was mobbed during a motorcade through trumbull , and thousands attended a victory celebration at the local high school football field parents , meanwhile , huddled with little league officials , as well as officials with the connecticut interscholastic athletic conference and the national collegiate athletic association they wanted advice on what sort of appearances would be appropriate and would not threaten the children s amateur status just in case one of these kids really becomes an athlete , galla said he added that initially parents were split on how to respond to all the attention some parents wanted to take advantage of the myriad offers others wanted to keep the lowest profile possible the parents then decided to meet every two weeks to vote on offers for appearances , which were all done on a nonprofit and volunteer basis little league officials forbade commercial endorsements , and none of the parents felt compelled to mount a legal challenge to the rule a parade of requests there were an unbelievable amount of requests , and we did n't know what to accept or not accept , galla said what we did take , though , were in good taste and did not exploit among the players , the reaction has been muted to the league s decision my own son , he s 12 years and he s oblivious to what s going on , galla said i imagine most of them are the same way they just kind of shrug one of the first events to be canceled because of the league s order was an appearance that was scheduled for feb 4 at the connecticut sports writers' alliance gold key dinner in new haven during the past five months , though , the team has appeared on abc s good morning america and in the macy s thanksgiving day parade they also have been named honorary chairmen for the connecticut chapter of mothers against drunk driving and have made onfield appearances at yankee stadium , shea stadium and in fenway park no trip to disneyland galla said the only possible regret was that the team did not get a trip to disneyland , which was rumored to be in the works before the league issued its order we almost expected it , he said he also said that moments after the victory a television announcer approached one of the young players and asked him what he was going to do next , now that he had won the world series it reminded me , galla said , of the commercials where they ask joe montana or somebody right after they won , 'what are you going to do next \? ' and they say , 'i'm going to disneyland ! in this case , the player had not been prepped he was thinking more about a promised dip in the hotel pool than a trip to see mickey mouse he yelled out , 'we 're going swimming !

hard by a bronx subway yard , men battle each autumn sunday in a game so ancient it is played in gaelic myths but this fall in america s proudest home of irish sports , the fighting has not ended with the games the strife involves a struggle for the lease on a scraggly pitch called gaelic park , a place that can be called a stadium only for its tired bleachers and a smattering of seats recovered from ebbets field more than of sport , the clash is sewn of politics , cultural nationalism and the confrontation in america of two irelands , the old and the new and running through it are charges of questionable dealings by the metropolitan transportation authority , which governs the cityowned land on one side stands the 90yearold icon of gaelic sports in america , a daggertongued former saloon keeper who is named john o 'donnell but always called john kerry , for the irish county of his birth behind him stand a former governor of new york , a former city council president and the chief of the city s transit workers union facing them is a younger irish generation who , like thousands in the new world before them , stopped at gaelic park not only for irish football and the ancient hurling , but for friends , legal advice and jobs for nearly a decade , immigrants have brought new life to the dowdy corner of 240th street and broadway but as members of a newer generation , from undocumented laborers to corporate executives , have sought to shoulder the park into step with modern ireland , they say they have been jostled back by an arcane system of loyalties reminiscent of tammany hall and in the middle , the mta between the two groups , uncomfortably , is the metropolitan transportation authority last year , after some prodding and nearly half a century of mr o 'donnell s unopposed control , the authority opened the park s lease to competitive bids but in june , the authority s realestate staff tentatively chose mr o 'donnell and his eight children to run gaelic park for 20 years , pending approval by the agency s board the officials rejected bids by the christian brothers of manhattan college and by several groups of prominent irishamericans who offered equal rent , similar management policies and as much as three times the money for renovations now the transportation agency is being showered with charges of favoritism from other bidders and officials of the group running irish sports in the area , the gaelic athletic association of greater new york after spending a year on this , i could not honestly tell you how the o 'donnell group prevailed , except by their political connections , said the association s lawyer , frank g hoare it raises a question of the mta s impartiality it raises questions about the whole process was it a joke \? transit officials insist it was not they say mr o 'donnell and his family were selected largely because they had demonstrated their ability to run the park effectively to complaints that the o 'donnells ran the park into the ground \( they face a 1 million lawsuit by a woman who last year fell through the stands \) , the officials answer that the family could not finance needed improvements on a shortterm lease almost an ethnic secret this is n't a conventional realestate transaction , said the transportation agency s director of real estate , frederick s harris in his seven years as chairman of the transportation authority , robert r kiley said he had never been lobbied harder than over the park s lease sixtytwo years after the park opened in what was an irishamerican neighborhood on the edge of riverdale , it remains almost an ethnic secret but among patrons , the future of gaelic park is an obsession it s much more than a playing field , said niall o 'dowd , publisher of the irish voice newspaper it s a place where the irish community meets itself and it s almost an emotional thing with people , because it is the repository of irish games greek gods were still wet behind the laurels when irish mythological heroes were smacking hurling balls with curved threefoot sticks known as hurleys or , in gaelic , camans likened to field hockey and lacrosse , in the modern game , each side s 15 hurlers bat the ball , or slitter , into the soccersized goal \( for three points \) or over its uprights \( for one \) hurling and gaelic football , a far younger rugbysoccer hybrid , have been intertwined with irish nationalist politics since the gaelic athletic association s founding in 1884 by a cabal that included rebels of the secret irish republican brotherhood while support for the irish republican army may burn less strongly among recent immigrants , the mix is still evident in gaelic park as the games are played , provisional ira keychains are sold from a table of books like the british war machine in ireland among the legends of latterday gaelic sports , none are more colorful than the man who saved what was then called inisfail park from that notoriously english game , soccer , after new york s gaelic group went bankrupt at the end of the depression golden age of gaelic sports
looking for a ship by john mcphee 242 pp new york parrar , straus giroux 1895 when john mcphee explains in his characteristically lucid way the difference between ullage and innage , the subtleties of the plimsoil mark , and the length of a tridentclass submarine , and the manner of a fathometer tracing the contour of the sea bottom , it is hard not to think of him as doc , the plainspoken polymath , the voice of experience doc is methodical and thorough , even to the point of being a teeny bit ponderous while the rest of us are generalizing like mad and cracking feeble jokes , doc is simply nodding and taking notes he has the sort of patience that makes people nervous , and an almost exasperating sanity in looking for a ship , ' an account of his voyage with the united states merchant marine , doc does n't get rattled when pirates board at guayaquil doc understands the anxiety of seamen eager to be employed if his neurons seemed hyperactive , they had some reason to be and is n't it just like doc to put it like that \? when a storm blows the ship sideways , doc does n't say exactly how he felt , but rather enumerates things that fell onto the deck the alarm clock and all the rest of his clobber in chile , doc reads charles darwin en route he reads nathaniel bowditch , the father of modern navigation and author of the basic text , and takes pulses he knows the age of everyone on board he is patient no record here of his losing his temper and he is restrained only eight obscenities , all told , in this account of sailors \( i find doc s habit of enumerating to be infections \) when the ship is moored in the steamy colombian port of buenaventura , another man might have gone boozing and roistering in the waterfront dives with the crew i certainly would have siezed the chance to watch this bunch of levelheaded sailors lose their marbles but doc heads for the hills we wanted to see the jungle rising to the cordillera occidental typical ! ! goodhearted , frugal , truthful , fluent , decent and humane , john mcphee is doc to his fingertips in the past , i have trusted him on tennis champs , on geology , physics , alaska , camping , the construction of the birchbark canoe and a score of other subjects in an interview in a recent issue of sierra , the magazine of the sierra club , mr mcphee was reported as saying , my next book could be about a ketchup manufacturermy next book could be about anything as it happens , this , his next book , is about the sorry state of our merchant marine why should n't i trust him on that subject too \? if mr mcphee sayd the peruchile trench is steep and the continental shelf is extremely narrow , i believe it if he reports an exasperated man is saying , another day in the life of walter mitty heavens to murgatroyd , we 're stuck in the lock , i believe that mr mcphee reported it correctly when a man says , unchallenged , five more years , there wo n't be no more merchant marine it s going down the guts , you have to take it more or less as written this is the last gasp of the merchant marine mr mcphee allows himself to be fanciful only now and then now is his reference to the fact that his spanish is purely functional and his grammar tartare then is a passage beside which i have marked joke in the margin of my copy i found no others the sentence read as follows the author alex haley is noted for riding on merchant ships as a way of isolating himself from distinctions and forcing himself to write he could write a book called 'routes' surrendering to his subject while remaining somewhat obscure himself , a technique that he has just about perfected , mr mcphee follows the progress of a man named andy chase who is looking for a ship to work on after quite a lot of hullabaloo , andy lands himself a berth on the stella lykes , bound for the west cosast of south america mr mcphee also boards but as a paying passenger , and he ranges over the ship reporting on the moods and experiences of the rest of the crew it emerges that andy is the greatgreatgreatgrandson of nathaniel bowditch but even this cannot make him colorful enough to occupy the center of the book , and he is nudged aside in favor of capt paul mchenry washburn , the stella lykes s skipper , who is both a brilliant captain and a selfmade eccentric on a heroic scale a poor student , a runaway , a circus performer \( he walked on glass and did fakir tricks \) and an amateur boxer , captain washburn , earned his master s certificate the hard way , under the tutelages of skippers such as dirty shirt george price and terrible terry harmon here is terrible terry in a storm do you know how to pray \? then try that that s the only thing that s going to save us now captain washburn has made a delightful gift for the non sequitor he understands columbus and is sympathetic \( columbus \) did not produce , and that was the bottom line he was a maverick , an adventurer he was not a follower of the party line come to think of it not to compare myself with columbus some of those adjectives kind of fit me mr mcphee obviously agrees , and a few pages later quotes rather a nice washburnism \( the captain speaking from the bridge \) i would rather be here for the worst that could be here than over there \( on land \) for the best that could be there

moscow , july 3 the conservative pillar of the politburo , yegor k ligachev , roused delegates to the nationwide congress of the communist party today by deploring the five years of president mikhail s gorbachev s rule as a period of wavering and blind radicalism his lament for the undermining of old values was reinforced by the chief of the kgb and the defense minister , who both warned against efforts to divorce their institutions from the party vladimir kryuchkov , the kgb chairman and a politburo member , ranged afield from security matters to warn against the tendency toward capitalist economics and the growing number of millionaires , and to pledge his lifelong allegiance to the party applause for ligachev the banner of mr gorbachev s reformers was carried alone today by foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze , who declared that the soviet union would benefit from german reunification , and said the military had spent the country into ruin excerpts from speeches , page 6 mr ligachev s speech drew thunderous applause from the same audience that on monday clapped with gusto for the liberal favorite , aleksandr n yakovlev , who helped mastermind many of mr gorbachev s most farreaching changes in domestic and foreign policy there may be no better indication of the reigning confusion in the communist party than the enthusiasm generated by two men with such different visions 'centrist waffling' criticized in part , that reflects the fact that party leaders are polarized into camps the hardliners cheer mr ligachev , the reformers mr yakovlev but in the lobby of the kremlin palace of congresses , some delegates , members of the bemused center , said they had clapped for both speeches simply out of a hunger for someone with a clear and decisive program at least these are both clear , distinctive personalities , said vladimir zhenin , a delegate from sverdlovsk what people ca n't understand is gorbachev , who maneuvers between the two poles they do not understand this centrist waffling the congress , the 28th since the party was founded by anticzarist revolutionaries in 1898 , comes as the party is being bled by defections and challenged by assertive local and national legislatures splintering of the party mr gorbachev s goal is to minimize the splintering of the party and keep a semblance of unity as the congress replenishes the party leadership and revises its platform four of the 18 full and candidate politburo members , none of them leading figures in mr gorbachev s team , have announced plans to resign because of age or ill health his two closest allies , mr yakovlev and mr shevardnadze , have also hinted they may leave the politburo to devote their full attention to their government jobs both men are members of mr gorbachev s presidential cabinet , which has eclipsed the oncedominant politburo in importance while the party faithful listened to reports from its top leaders today , boris n yeltsin , the maverick communist who is probably the most popular delegate to the congress , snubbed the party gathering to convene a session of the russian republic parliament , over which he presides gorky park protest in a pointed demonstration that the party is no longer the leading political force , mr yeltsin assembled his parliament and pushed through the appointment of two prominent radicals to chair parliamentary committees nikolai travkin , who quit the communist party in the spring to organize a new democratic party of russia , was selected to head a committee on local autonomy sergei krasavchenko , a marketoriented economist , was made chairman of a committee on economic reform a more brazen slap at the party came from a coalition of democratic insurgents , who rallied outside gorky park in protest of the party s conservative slant nearly 2 , 000 people , a modest crowd by today s standards , came to attack mr ligachev and to praise the latest improbably populist hero oleg d kalugin , a retired kgb major general stripped of his rank for his assertions that the secret police continue to infiltrate political dissident groups ritual of accountability down with the communist party ! and the party is a corpse ! they shouted with delight , pointing angrily down the moskva river at the party s opulent and exclusive hotel what we 're seeing in the kremlin will all be over soon , said one speaker yuri f karyakin , a member of the soviet parliament , said , they 're celebrating their 'victory' as we speak this victory by the scum who have bound us all our lives the politburo members were paraded before the party congress on its second day to give personal accountings of their work since the last congress in 1986 , a ritual of accountability imposed by the restive delegates for the first time later this week they were supposed to answer written questions gorbachev s topical speech the party leaders are by now so well known from glasnostera press and television that nothing they had to say came as a surprise mr ligachev , while professing loyalty to mr gorbachev s policy of perestroika , systematically attacked several of the major changes introduced by mr gorbachev , including the legalization of private ownership of industry later he appeared in the lobby to elaborate for reporters , deploring the unification of germany as a blow to soviet security , and demurring when asked if he would accept a draft to challenge mr gorbachev as party leader delegates who admire mr ligachev said today that , at age 69 , he is more likely to retire asked about mr gorbachev s opening speech on monday , mr ligachev said it was topical limited support for pluralism he attempted to answer all the questions that alarm us today , he said maybe he did n't manage to find the right answers to all the questions but that s another matter the heads of the kgb and army rejected proposals to limit communist party influence by withdrawing party cells from military and lawenforcment agencies the russian republic parliament has adopted such a policy as the basis for a new constitution mr kryuchkov , while declaring his support for pluralist democracy , said kgb officers have chosen to be communists of their own free will he said from the highest party forum , i would like to say the following i will be together with the party , which is renewing itself and society , until the end of my life he also warned against abolishing state economic controls , suggesting that that would mean chaos it would be a fatal mistake to thrust the country into the embrace of the elemental forces of the market , he said he said failure to adequately control private enterpreneurship had already led to social stratification that could cause disorder an entire stratum of millionnaires now exists , he said there are tens of thousands of them already the defense minister , gen dmitri t yazov , said the army was 400 , 000 men short of full strength because of widespread draft evasion , encouraged by university leaders and some newspapers theories of departization , depolitization can be heard quite often these days , he said i find this idea groundless in theory and harmful in practice our army is being used only for its main purpose it must be a reliable guarantor of socialist statehood , stability in the country , maintaining peace in the world general yazov , who is 66 , had to be helped back to his seat when he was suddenly taken ill as he concluded his speech he later left the hall on his own photo soviet citizens protesting yesterday in gorky park in moscow against the conservative movement , led by hardline communists like mr ligachev , that is gathering momentum at the party congress \( reuters \) \( pg 6 \)
an intense , costly search has failed to find a medical or environmental cause for the bizarre illness of 34 triborough bridge toll workers , leading bridge officials to suspect that the symptoms may have been psychosomatic the mystery of the sudden , flulike symptoms has drawn experts in epidemiology , environmental contamination and occupational health yet it is unlikely to ever be solved after spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on environmental testing , bridge officials say they will not order interviews by psychologists or otherwise explore whether the outbreak was started or prolonged by psychosomatic causes , for fear that the toll workers and their unions would explode in anger the final assumption from my point of view , said one official of the triborough bridge and tunnel authority , was that we had an environmental incident and we had a lot of tense people around it just kind of selfperpetuated 'a political hot potato' the official added it s a political hot potato to go on the record and say that it s psychological the unions will go wild bridge authority and union officials both suggested that at least the first and most serious cases of nausea , headaches and chest pains reported between feb 16 and 22 may have had a real but undetected cause city health officials and other authorities say it is possible that an environmental toxin at levels too low to register could have made the toll workers sick they say that the contaminant also could have come and gone , or that workers could have had a variety of lowgrade , unrelated , undiagnosable illnesses bridge officials and doctors who examined the sick workers said the symptoms were genuine the bridge officials would voice their belief that the outbreak had a psychological element only on condition they not be named but medical experts said many aspects of the triborough bridge episode match the profile of a malady known to scientists as epidemic psychogenic illness , or epidemic stress syndrome as part of the syndrome , groups of people under stress suffer real but largely subjective symptoms dizziness , nausea , headaches and eye irritation for which no clear medical cause can be found the symptoms appear and subside quickly , and sometimes recur they are contagious virtually by word of mouth when others under similar stress hear about or see evidence of the illness , they too can fall ill while apparently more common among grade school choirs and high school marching bands , the phenomenon has been documented among telephone operators , assembly line workers and others who perform simple , repetitive tasks at a fast pace doctors say fears of pollution can add to the problem , and women , for unknown reasons , are about twice as likely to fall ill as men did 'anxiety' play a role \? there is no test that you can do that will prove it , said dr richard j levine , chief epidemiologist at the chemical industry institute of toxicology in durham , nc what you can do is to rule out other major causes and note features about the outbreak that resemble those of other incidents that have been attributed to epidemic psychogenic illness , he said union officials , who have fought for years with the authority over job safety , for the most part bridled at the suggestion that the outbreak may have been psychosomatic most insisted that workers had succumbed to a toxin in the air or heating system but some union officials admitted that they also suspected psychological factors i think the first 20 or 25 actually experienced heavy , nonbreathable fumes , said anthony m mauro , president of the bridge and tunnel workers' union after that , he said , anxiety may have befallen the others testing paint and oil days after the triborough outbreak began , four toll workers at the newburgh exit of the gov thomas e dewey thruway with similar ailments were also sent to doctors the triborough incident officially ended at 1 45 pm on feb 22 , when the last toll worker was sent to a hospital about three hours later , senior managers of the bridge authority began to join toll takers in their booths full time , said sheila l kennedy , a spokeswoman for the authority since the first toll taker was sent to a hospital on feb 16 , the authority has tested everything from wall paint to heating oil air monitoring began that day more sophisticated testing equipment was added five days later thomas m downs , president of the authority , estimated the cost of the investigation at close to a million dollars other officials said later that the bill might be much less ruling out coffee grounds with help from the city departments of health and environmental protection , the state department of environmental conservation and private laboratories and consultants , the authority checked the smokestacks of factories for miles around , the heating system of a nearby sewage treatment plant and other potential offenders they ruled out contamination by coffee grounds , coins , uniform launderers , heating ducts , air vents and drinking water blood tests on the workers sent to hospitals showed no high levels of carbon monoxide , as would have been expected had they been overcome by automobile exhaust although air monitoring is expected to continue , officials say they have given up hope of finding a culprit our job was to crawl through every possible environmental explanation , said albert f appleton , the city s commissioner of environmental protection we did that and found none dizziness , headaches and nausea all of the most seriously stricken workers were examined at nearby hospitals and released
the white house insisted four months ago that a highprofile meeting between brent scowcroft and deng xiaoping did not violate its ban on highlevel exchanges the same white house now declares that inviting a chinese minister to an international conference on air pollution and climate change would violate that same rule the white house admits that china , the world s biggest coal burner and thirdbiggest carbon dioxide producer , belongs at a conference on the greenhouse effect and no treaty on global warming would be very useful without china s participation but officials say that negative reaction to the scowcroft mission forced the administration to give its old rule a newly strict interpretation how perverse what began 10 months ago as a sensibly measured response to the tragedy in tiananmen square has been turned into a travesty by its authors the administration would do well to return to its original principles just days after beijing used tanks and rifles against student democracy demonstrators , mr bush announced the following guidelines for american policy because china was home to more than a billion people , washington would make every effort to keep open essential channels of communication but because china s top leaders had gravely offended fundamental american values , they would not be honored with prestige visits by highlevel administration officials no good cause would be served if the us ended diplomatic contacts on matters affecting its own national interests that s why ambassador james lilley has remained in beijing secretary of state baker , and lowerlevel state department officials , have continued to talk to the chinese about cambodia and arms exports none of this has caused an outcry among americans nor would many hackles be raised by inviting a chinese environmental official to the greenhouse conference the sort of thing that truly offends people was mr scowcroft s televised toast to the butchers of beijing and mr bush s acquiescing in china s demand that he veto a bill extending the us visas of chinese students surely the administration understands the distinction between public gestures and working diplomacy mr bush fashioned a principled policy around just this distinction 10 months ago if he really wishes to heed public opinion , he might begin applying that policy now
santa clara , calif , jan 4 the incentive for winning national football league divisional playoff games this weekend is clear and concise for the participants a victory earns a trip to the conference championship games on jan 14 and keeps super bowl xxiv title hopes alive and it earns respect and admiration from peers , fans and even critics one other incentive , however , cannot be underestimated the more you win , the more money you earn it s money time ! yelled guy mcintyre in the san francisco 49ers' locker room after practice today each player in the playoffs , win or lose , earns 6 , 000 for playing in the wildcard game , 10 , 000 for making the divisional playoff games and 18 , 000 for the conference championships if he makes it to the super bowl in new orleans , he will make an additional 36 , 000 if his team wins or 18 , 000 as the consolation prize for several of the league s younger , lesserpaid playoff participants , all of the accolades are nice but the chief prize is the cash few guys like to say that , said mcintyre , but it s the truth a look at the ingredients of the dash for the cash vikings \( 106 \) at 49ers \( 142 \) 4 pm tomorrow , channel 2 for the third straight season , these teams meet in a national conference divisional playoff game in san francisco minnesota startled the 49ers in 1987 , winning by 3624 in 1988 , san francisco dumped the vikings , 349 the focus of this matchup centers on two areas the receivers jerry rice and anthony carter , and the 49ers' offensive line versus the vikings' defensive front carter was magical against the 49ers in '87 , traipsing for a playoffrecord 227 receiving yards rice grabbed three touchdown passes against the vikings in the '88 playoff game carter and rice are two of the league s most dangerous and exciting receivers and watch each other closely carter , in an earlyseason interview in sports illustrated , said that he envied the way rice was featured in the 49ers' offense and that he could be as productive if the vikings looked his way more frequently carter disappears in the vikings' offense on occasion , but there have been indications from minnesota s coach , jerry burns , that it wo n't happen on saturday we 've got to make sure , said burns , that our big knockers knock mention carter to rice and rice smiles anthony was a little off , because we spread the ball around a lot here , rice said everybody is involved in this offense i watch him from the sidelines when we play them you have to people say i'm faster , but i do n't know that s one of the ways anthony beats a lot of guys because he s deceptive they think he s not moving that fast and then he blows right by them he s a little more acrobatic than i am , and that s probably the biggest difference between us the one thing anthony has over me is experience , because i'm still learning a lot that he already knows but rice has two super bowl rings and was the super bowl s most valuable player last year that experience counts for plenty in five career games against the vikings , rice has 20 catches for 322 yards with five touchdowns and a long catch of 59 yards carter , in five games against the 49ers , has 20 catches for 445 yards with three touchdowns and a long catch of 67 yards carter has also burned the 49ers as a punt returner and will probably be used in that role on saturday minnesota s defensive front , led by keith millard and chris doleman , led the league in sacks with 71 the war in the trenches favors minnesota , but the 49ers hope to counter with quick releases from joe montana coupled with what the 49ers' offensive linemen say will be their best performance we 're being looked at as the weak link , said the 49ers' right offensive guard , bruce collie we do n't like it the only way to change it is to do something about it bills \( 97 \) at browns \( 961 \) 12 30 pm , tomorrow , channel 4 this is the first postseason meeting for these american conference teams , which have not met since a 1987 regularseason game won by the browns , 2721 , at home cleveland has won four straight over buffalo and six of the last seven the browns finished with victories over minnesota and the houston oilers buffalo dropped three straight games before beating the jets in the season finale to claim their second straight american conference east crown it s been a year of highs and low , but we 're high right now , said marv levy , the bills' coach so are the browns bernie kosar s arm ailments have healed and the cleveland defense set club records for fewest points allowed \( 254 \) and most sacks \( 45 \) the game features kosar and the bills' jim kelly , both former miami hurricane quarterbacks kelly struggled this season despite tossing a careerhigh 25 touchdown passes the browns' secondary is menacing its 27 interceptions led the american conference thus , this game could largely hinge on the performance of thurman thomas , the buffalo running back he is elusive , quick and has a starting burst second to none thomas rushed for 1 , 244 yards and six touchdowns this season and the bills' chances are slim if he does not break loose the browns allowed only two runners to gain 100 yards against them this season , but their chances will be almost nil if they cannot contain thomas and the bills' pro bowl receiver , andre reed , the afc leader in receptions \( 88 \) and yards \( 1 , 312 \) steelers \( 107 \) at broncos \( 115 \) 4 pm sunday , channel 4 denver clobbered pittsburgh two months ago , 347 for sure , they 're not the same team , said dan reeves , the denver coach the way they 've improved is impressive , particularly in turnovers pittsburgh made eight turnovers in a seasonopening 510 loss to cleveland but by season s end was tied with denver for the afc lead in takeawaygiveway ratio with plus 11 pittsburgh s 2623 wildcard playoff victory sunday at houston helped boost the steelers' road record to 63 pittsburgh has beaten denver in their last two playoff games \( in 1978 and 1984 \) this is unquestionably a tall order for pittsburgh , the league s youngest team with 12 rookies , the most in the league denver finished with the conference s best record , had a defense that allowed the fewest points in the league \( 226 \) and an offense with a 1 , 000yard passer \( john elway \) , rusher \( bobby humphrey \) and receiver \( vance johnson \) the steelers desperately want a halftime lead when leading at halftime this season , pittsburgh was 90

the manufacture of sterling flatware is among the oldest industries in the nation none of the leading silversmiths is less than a century old , and some trace their origins to before the american revolution from one generation to the next , these companies had always considered their market to be forever green in their view , silver virtually sells itself only recently has it occurred to them that americans might spend more of their discretionary income on sterling if it were advertised more heavily silversmiths have long advertised in bridal magazines to reach newlyweds , their primary market , who account for 46 percent of all sterling flatware sales and about 30 percent of all sales of holloware serving pieces like tea sets , pitchers and bowls but to stir interest among other customers , the silversmiths guild and the silver trust international , a group of mining companies , recently embarked on a 500 , 000 advertising campaign in october , the groups began placing advertisements in vanity fair , metropolitan home , bon appetit , gourmet , house garden and southern accents \( the south has always been very strong for sterling , according to mr johnston of the guild \) the advertisements show tables attractively laden with silver flatware , bowls , trays and other items , proclaiming sterling as the eternal element of style one target is people over the age of 45 the older people have more discretionary income than any group , including baby boomers , and they are the fastestgrowing segment , said william weydemeyer , president of the national tabletop association and chairman of taunton silversmiths , which makes silverplated products these are the people who grew up with our product by contrast , the children of the baby boom are considered a lost generation for sterling having grown up in the politically radical 60 s and 70 s , this huge postworld war ii cohort got married late and without traditional fanfare during the hippie era , big weddings were out , mr johnston noted people were getting married in the pasture with a guitar and no one was giving silver presents but the industry believes that with a little prodding the group could return to a more elegant table their psychographics may augur well for silver sales having paired up and formed households based on dual incomes , these baby boomers are now tiring of fastpaced living and eating on the run they are raising families and want to look back to the home , mr johnston said that has fueled sales of practical things like kitchen tools and housewares , agrees lawrence h wortzel , professor of marketing at boston university , but he says that to project that to silver , we are on a little more tenuous ground still , he adds , my viscera tell me that if crystal , china and silver manufacturers do some intelligently creative promotion , they could really increase their sales in the 90 s silversmiths have attempted to modernize their images to reflect contemporary lifestyles towle , for example , runs advertisements showing a silver fork sticking into a carton of chinese takeout the overall message is that sterling is for everyday eating , that the utensils can be tossed into a dishwasher and , it is emphasized , the more sterling is used , the less it must be polished most silver makers have even introduced more modern designs , though they note that the bestselling patterns these days , like wallace s french regency , are updated versions of traditionals
besides increased television coverage , one reason for auto racing s current state of vigor worldwide is the extent of participation by major automakers almost every carmaker in the united states , western europe and japan is involved in some form of motorsports and with that participation comes the pressure for the private racing teams they support to produce results michael kranefuss , the director of ford motor company s special vehicle operations , heads the company s racing activities speaking with journalists last month in new york , kranefuss stressed ford s intent to win the manufacturer s title on the nascar winston cup circuit that honor has eluded ford in recent years even though it has had a proven race winner in the thunderbird , particularly in the hands of bill elliott solid roster for ford speaking of last season , kranefuss said , i think our strategy , which we set out on a couple of years ago , which was to be with a number of teams with an equal chance of winning , did n't work out that way we had moments of brilliance , winning three or four races in a row , and then it was back into nowhere land ford supports a solid roster of winston cup teams , including the elliott family , robert yates , jack roush , junior johnson and alan kulwicki s driverowner operation but with the exception of elliott \( whose season was spoiled by a broken wrist \) and roush \( who spent last year learning along with his driver , mark martin \) , none of these teams showed the racebyrace consistency of dale earnhardt s chevrolet and rusty wallace s pontiac after the season s last race , at atlanta , kranefuss held a meeting with the ford teams based on his statements in new york , the pressure to perform will increase one source of added pressure , he said , was more television coverage of nascar racing a few years ago , sponsors rarely saw a race in which their car was running now , with cable television , they can see all the races when the cameras focus on the frontrunners , kranefuss said , sponsors expect to see the name of their product changing an attitude i think the times when people liked to treat racing with a certain amount of indifference by saying 'we need a lot of money but can we guarantee you anything \? no' that attitude will have to change , kranefuss said the key for team managers , he said , would be keeping what he called the racing craziness alive within a team while also figuring out how the money must be spent to guarantee virtual consistent success in order to be able to do that in nascar racing , you need drivers , good drivers , kranefuss said i like to believe that we have got most of the promising drivers with a lineup that includes elliott , martin , kulwicki and davey allison , ford has young talent behind the wheel but they need the right support , kranefuss said and in his postseason message to the racing teams , kranefuss said he stressed conservative car preparation as fast as a winston cup car is , the engineering is in some ways primitive compared with what s in a passenger car no electronic fuelmanagement systems are used , frontwheel drive is unheard of and the v8 is in no immediate threat of being replaced bill france s biggest problem perhaps is whether he s going to be able to buy enough carburetors five years from now , kranefuss said in a joking reference to nascar s leader holding down budgets the payoff is that by controlling technology and using components that all have been proved over 500 miles , nascar is able to keep all the cars competitive while holding down annual budgets to 2 million a car , which is low by professional racing standards the question for ford , kranefuss said , is how it can help the driver set up his car so that it wo n't change much the answer , he said , is to get the fastest teams to be more cooperative in telling ford how they do it well , then you deal with the old thing like , 'we do n't really want to tell you because you 're going to tell the next guy , ' kranefuss said that s got to change , at least with respect to major aspects of the setup to help convince them , kranefuss points out that any progress in aerodynamics and engine development comes through the resources of ford so they need us as much as we need them , he said
esther truzman , the class secretary , fiddled with her notes and spoke up the club has to be a nice space a lot of clubs , you walk in and they 're so blah hot rod last year was nice , but the music was n't so hot a possibility was broached by larry kang , the senior class president meltem bozkurt , the class vice president , shot him an oh , brother look a lot of hoodlums go there , she said it s a good place to go if your aim is to get beaten up we better settle on the boat soon , interjected mr kang do n't worry , said ms bozkurt , effusing confidence it s going to be the greatest prom ever the greatest as on many afternoons of late , the members of the prom committee at the edward r murrow high school in brooklyn were huddled in the principal s conference room , assailed by decisions although this was only october , nerves were already fraying as the trio embarked on its longest odyssey in economics the dogged task of choosing among the gaggle of businesses that wanted to make their senior prom an unforgettable and profitable experience the high school prom is an american institution , and at thousands of high schools across the country , from rural schools in south dakota to innercity institutions in chicago , students like the murrow committee members were doing exactly the same thing that s why the staging of proms has coalesced into a substantial industry worth millions of dollars , pursued by hotels , boats , dance clubs , photographers , disk jockeys , balloon makers and limousine companies for small businesses that serve promgoers , the parties allow massive sales in one night , though they sometimes have to dangle discounts or other incentives to land the contracts it s a cutthroat business , said nathan tsukroff , head photographer at g b s photography , which will shoot the murrow prom we know of companies that get the business by citing a low price and then , on prom night , the price is suddenly three times higher this is not highprofit business , but there s a lot of it , and you make your money on volume sifting through options there are even companies that tackle the arrangements and book the halls and the entertaintment like promoceans , the manhattan company that is doing some work for the murrow students its founder , steven salsberg , has been booking proms for 12 years a prom disk jockey before he formed his company , he now arranges some 35 affairs a year , most of them on boats , bringing his company revenues of more than 750 , 000 the large number of enterprises competing for prom business means more possibilities have to be scrupulously sifted through by young adults entrusted with tens of thousands of dollars , even though they 're often bewildered about how to stretch an allowance through a full week it is not for the weakkneed senior the murrow prom committee consisting of mr kang , ms bozkurt and ms truzman , with carl lefton , a genial art teacher , as the faculty adviser started its planning early to lock in the date it wanted wednesday , june 13 after all , roughly 300 private and public high schools in the new york metropolitan area hold proms during the prime prom months of may and june some 500 students were expected to attend the murrow gala , and the plan was to charge 80 a person , enough to cover the affair itself and a party afterward at a manhattan club that meant a total budget of 40 , 000 i hope it s enough , ms truzman said hotels , party rooms and boats were all eager to welcome prom students , especially the prom factories like the big catering halls marina del ray in the bronx and terrace on the park in queens , as well as hotels like the waldorfastoria and the plaza many of these flooded high schools with promotional literature , often gushy testimonial letters from satisfied schools , saying things like , i was astonished by the caring , the kindness , the helpfulness , the work ethic , the skill , the efficiency and the smiles of each and every person on your incredible staff staying on land seemed awfully pedestrian to the edward murrow committee in recent years , it has become de rigueur at murrow and many other schools near the water to charter a boat , and the committee wished to prolong the aquatic tradition they emphatically did not wish to repeat last year s somewhat odious result , when the boat was n't scrubbed after the previous party on it we went there in formal wear and all , ms bozkurt said , and like the floor had gum stains on it , and you thought , like why did n't i wear shorts \? to begin the hunt , ms bozkurt called metropolitan charters , which offered the dinner yacht mystique at 48 per person it was keen enough to get the business that it invited the murrow committee for a complimentary cruise on oct 30 the boat s promotional package vowed the mystique is the place where memories are made we have a single goal in mind to make your prom or afterprom the talk of the town ! ! ! seeking a ship mr kang and ms bozkurt liked that talk , but the moment they boarded they squinched their eyes it was simply too small knowing this , the two seniors proceeded to have a wild time and scarfed down monstrous quantities of food we felt a little guilty , ms bozkurt confided afterward but only a little meanwhile , mr lefton contacted promoceans it said it was in the process of acquiring its own boat , but it would n't be available in time
washington , oct 29 the supreme court agreed today to decide whether the constitution protects a prisoner , already represented by a lawyer on one criminal charge , from being questioned by the police about a separate crime without the lawyer s presence the case is an appeal by a wisconsin man who was awaiting trial on robbery charges , on which a public defender had already appeared for him at a court hearing detectives entered his jail cell at night to question him about an unrelated murder they read the prisoner his rights under the supreme court s miranda decision , which guarantees a suspect s right to have a lawyer present during police questioning the prisoner waived that right the prisoner then agreed to talk , and gave incriminating statements , eventually pleading guilty to the murder after a judge ruled that the statements were admissible in court the appeal requires the court to define the sometimes elusive relationship between two separate constitutional provisions that give criminal suspects the right to a lawyer fifth and sixth amendments one provision , part of the sixth amendment , guarantees to defendants the assistance of counsel in all criminal prosecutions the sixth amendment protection applies only after judicial proceedings have begun the other constitutional right to counsel has been found by the supreme court to be a part of the fifth amendment s protection against compelled selfincrimination the fifth amendment protection applies any time a suspect is in custody , regardless of whether an official prosecution has begun in the wisconsin case , the defendant , paul mcneil , clearly had a sixth amendment right to counsel on the robbery charge , on which proceedings had begun , and just as clearly had no independent sixth amendment right to have a lawyer present while being questioned about a murder , on which no charges had been brought the question is whether by availing himself of his sixth amendment rights on the robbery charge , mr mcneil had automatically invoked a fifth amendment right not to be questioned about any other matter without the presence of a lawyer disarray in lower courts state and lower federal courts are in considerable disarray on this question while the wisconsin supreme court ruled in mr mcneil s case that the questions about the murder were permissible , the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit , which includes wisconsin , ruled in a similar case in 1987 that the questioning on a second , unrelated case was prohibited for that reason , the state of wisconsin supported mr mcneil s appeal to the united states supreme court , mcneil v wisconsin , no 905319 the state told the justices that wisconsin law enforcement officials needed a clear rule that they could understand and apply the supreme court has addressed a related issue several times over the past 10 years , ruling in several cases that the police could not initiate a new interrogation of a suspect who had invoked his right to counsel under the fifth amendment one such case , a murder appeal from mississippi , is now before the court awaiting decision but those cases did not have the added sixth amendment complication of the wisconsin case there were also these other developments today as the court resumed work after a twoweek recess federal appeals accepting an appeal from a virginia deathrow inmate , the justices agreed to decide whether federal courts should hear the cases of state inmates whose appeals in state court have in effect been forfeited through inadequate legal representation the case , of a man convicted of raping and murdering his sisterinlaw , raises an important question for state inmates who file federal court petitions for writs of habeas corpus , which challenge the constitutionality of a trial or sentence federal courts require in nearly every instance that a state inmate first seek a writ of habeas corpus from the state courts inmates who fail to follow proper state court procedures can therefore lose the right to a federal habeas corpus case in this case , the virginia supreme court dismissed the inmate s habeas corpus appeal because his lawyer had filed it one day late , 31 days instead of 30 days , after a lower state court had rejected the petition when he tried to take a habeas corpus petition to federal court , both the federal district court and the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit , in richmond , dismissed it on the ground that he had not first brought a proper case in state court the inmate s supreme court appeal , coleman v thompson , no 897662 , argues that when the statecourt case has been bungled through a lawyer s mistakes , the federal courts should waive the usual procedural rules and hear the petition themselves utility s charities the court let stand a ruling by new york state s highest court that a state cannot constitutionally permit regulated utilities to include charitable contributions among the expenses that are passed on to customers as the new york public service commission had done for nearly 20 years , many state utility commissions permit utilities to include their charitable contributions as part of the rate base , to be paid by customers , rather than as an expense to be borne by stockholders in the form of reduced earnings but the new york court of appeals ruled last may that the policy violated the first amendment guarantee of free speech by , in effect , forcing the customers to subsidize causes that were not of their choosing two utilities , new york telephone , a unit of the nynex corporation , and the rochester gas and electric corporation , appealed to the supreme court \( ny telephone v cahill , no 90255 \) their petition said that no one in her right mind would confuse the full payment of one s telephone bill with endorsement of whatever ideological or social messages might lurk in the phone company s charitable contributions suburban schools the court refused to intervene in a longrunning school integration suit involving kansas city , mo , and several suburban school districts in an earlier phase of the case , a federal district judge in kansas city outlined a plan under which the suburban districts would voluntarily accept black students from kansas city as transfer students but none of the students who applied to transfer were accepted a group of them brought a lawsuit against three suburban districts in 1988 the federal district court dismissed the suit , but the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit , in st louis , reinstated it , ruling that the students had the right to try to prove that the districts' actions were based on racial discrimination the case was lee s summit school district v naylor , no 90391 prison haircuts the court let stand a ruling by the united states court of appeals for the second circuit , in new york , that new york state prison officials could not constitutionally require inmates who adhere to the rastafarian religion to cut their hair the rastafarian religion , which originated on jamaica , forbids its adherents to cut their hair followers wear their hair in long strands known as dreadlocks a new york state prison regulation requires all inmates to have an identification picture taken with hair no longer than one inch but the appeals court ruled that the regulation violated the rastafarians' first amendment right to the free exercise of their religion , and that the state s purpose could be achieved by photographing the inmates with their hair pulled back into a pony tail the state appealed to the supreme court , arguing that this alternative was inadequate for a proper identification \( coughlin v benjamin , no 90307 \)
to the editor for me , as a nationally syndicated advice giver to single people for more than 15 years , success and the single woman by mary anne myers \( oped , march 22 \) struck a nerve as ms myers says , corporate and news media bureaucracies are mostly stuck in the stale thinking that equates unmarried with instability her examples come from women s experiences , but i have letters in my file from men telling the same tale of losing out to a married man with a family at home the battle of the sexes finds a moment of resolution through the shared role of victim it s ironic to juxtapose the modernity of postfeminism with the dark age mentality of marriedequalssettled , but that very incongruity could account for the tensile strength of single women for those women are incredibly , wonderfully strong despite the weight of public opinion and professional diminishment against them , they still refuse to knuckle under and marry anyman that is one of the most powerful aftershocks of the movement they began women want to marry a special person , a companion and friend , above all a partner who sees them as equals deserving of reciprocity and who will augment their individuality yes , women these days want a nurturing mate or none at all that is the astonishing truth in the letters that come to me , and it should buttress every unmarried woman reading this susan deitz new york , march 22 , 1990 the writer is a columnist for the los angeles times syndicate and author of single file \( new york , 1989 \) drawing
in 1974 , a few months before a chorus line opened at the public theater , a member of the original cast named wayne cilento announced in rehearsal that his wife was expecting a child the cast , which had been together for several months and had begun to think like a family , exploded we 're going to have a baby ! brian cilento is now 14 years old , just a few months younger than the landmark show his 26 surrogate parents were conceiving like every family , the chorus line clan has had its share of conflicts time has resolved some but others are beginning to spill over publicly , spurred by the simultaneous closing of the show scheduled for april 28 the date was first set for march but delayed because of a surge in ticket sales and this month s publication of the original cast s memoir , on the line the creation of 'a chorus line' \( morrow \) recognition and money are often flashpoints in families and this one is no exception when the tony and pulitzer prizewinning show closes at the shubert theater it will have grossed in excess of 277 million in the united states alone , according to variety that figure is of great interest to those members of the original cast who gathered around a tape recorder in a manhattan loft in early 1974 their memories became the source for a chorus line , the story of 17 dancers auditioning for roles in an unnamed broadway musical the fact that they signed away the rights to their stories 15 years ago for 1 is of even greater interest who should get money from the show and who should receive credit for its creation are questions that have been asked before , but perhaps never more bluntly than now in recent interviews with original cast members , the mood was that of a family confronting a major rite of passage , mixing sadness , resignation and defiance one of the most poignant questions for the dancers has never changed why are n't you famous \? the archetypal musical that pays tribute to the unsung , the members of the chorus line , ironically has not sent stars spinning into public orbit whose idea of success \? sputtered baayork lee , who has since forged a career restaging a chorus line all over the world ms lee s resentment was echoed by thommie walsh , with whom she has cowritten the original company s story , on the line , with robert viagas the emphasis is always negative , mr walsh said priscilla lopez won a tony playing harpo marx and wayne cilento has been nominated twice for his choreography and it s never mentioned other people are very happy selling antiques and looking at beautiful sunsets in arizona whenever anything is successful in this business you feel the pressure to live out the american dream , said donna mckechnie no matter what you do it s not enough ms mckechnie s career attracted the greatest amount of media scrutiny for the way in which it fulfilled the life of her character like cassie , she was romantically linked with chorus line s director and cochoreographer michael bennett \( the model for zach , the director in the show \) , to whom she was married for a brief time she remembers bennett saying , at the very beginning , that 'a chorus line' must stand alone he said , 'you ca n't compete with it you mus n't try to use this as a barometer' the more than 6 , 000 performances since the show opened in previews at the public theater on april 16 , 1975 , trace an arc of history , from the decline of the vietnam war to the retreat of soviet communism , as well as four american presidencies the entire original cast has also survived an era in which the theatrical community has experienced a drastic number of casualties , including bennett , who died of aids , and the show s cowriter james kirkwood and lyricist edward kleban , both of whom died of cancer while a majority of the 27 performers are still in some area of show business , a substantial number have taken other career paths among their ranks are an interior designer , a psychiatric nurse and a marketing administrator in the cosmetics industry at this point none of them appear to care about stardom instead , they seem to exude the sanguineness of adults in midlife who have shaken off the pressure of expectations and matured comfortably within their chosen fields they also maintain an unusual familial connection as kelly bishop , who won a tony for playing the sharptongued sheila , said , they feel like my brothers and sisters now , to a person if anyone puts down any of them in front of me , i'm right there to defend them they are my family those ties were reinforced over the years by intermittent landmarks a spectacular reunion performance in 1983 to mark the musical s record as broadway s longestrunning show , michael bennett s death in 1987 and a los angeles benefit for aids in 1988 in addition , during dry spells in their careers , many of the cast would return to the musical the experience would be both reassuring and unsettling , as homecomings can be
for nearly two years now , don king and mike tyson have emerged as the siamese twins of boxing siamese twins joined at the money clip one is seldom seen in public without the other and last tuesday , as king apologized meekly and weakly for having protested that james \( buster \) douglas did n't deserve to be the new heavyweight champion because of a long count , the promoter kept using the word we , meaning himself and the dethroned champion who was sitting nearby but if you have options on douglas s next few fights , king was asked , why do n't you use 'we' when talking about him \? with a cackle , the promoter spouted that we was a familiar word among boxing people , that the late yank durham , once joe frazier s manager , often used we to couple himself with his heavyeight champion thank you , don king thank you for sharpening the point of the question yank durham was entitled to use we , as so many other managers do , because yank durham was a manager , not a promoter in boxing , a promoter is n't allowed to be a manager in boxing , this is the ultimate conflict of interest but during tyson s estrangement from bill cayton , the dethroned champion s manager of record , don king walks and talks in public defiance of boxing law as if he were tyson s manager no person , reads the world boxing council bylaws , is permitted to act concurrently both as manager of a boxer and as promoter of a wbc championship contest involving the same boxer , and so as to avoid any potential for a conflict of interest , no contest will be certified by the wbc if any person acts in such dual capacity king argues that he s merely an adviser , a friend to tyson , and jose sulaiman , the wbc president , accepts that explanation as if it were written on a stone tablet sulaiman , of course , also accepted king s protest that douglas had been granted a long count near the end of the eighth round but a promoter should n't be allowed to be even an adviser if king wants to be tyson s adviser , fine if he wants to be a promoter , fine one or the other , but not both in the records of the new york state athletic commission and other boxing organizations , bill cayton remains tyson s de jure manager but it s obvious that king is now tyson s de facto manager for proof , simply consult the videotape of king s brazen protest of douglas s long count as a promoter , that was none of king s business but as tyson s adviser , it was king s business king also acted as larry holmes s adviser throughout that heavyweight champion s reign not that king invented conflict of interest in boxing on july 28 , 1952 , rocky marciano , who would dethrone jersey joe walcott as the heavyweight champion two months later , arrived early at the madison square garden lobby to weigh in for his fight that night with harry \( kid \) matthews , who was late al weill , then the garden matchmaker for the international boxing club , was whispered to be marciano s undercover manager although no proof existed but as robert k christenberry , then the chairman of the new york state athletic commission , waited impatiently for matthews , he turned to weill where s matthews \? the chairman asked how should i know \? weill replied all i know is , my fighter s here weill had called marciano my fighter that afternoon , christenberry granted the garden 24 hours to get a new matchmaker otherwise , the chairman threatened to lift the garden s license that night , weill resigned as matchmaker he openly managed marciano for the remainder of the undefeated champion s career but with his brazen protest , king is now vulnerable to inspection , if not investigation , at a time when boxing is under siege instant critics of the notsosweet science usually jump on a soap box only when a boxer is killed in the ring but this time king s shabby treatment of douglas has aroused and annoyed even those who ordinarily do n't care that much about boxing as a promoter , king should have hailed douglas s triumph as a boon for boxing but as an adviser , he whined over tyson s loss the moral is , do n't try to rewrite the storyline of an unbettable underdog who not only defeated the undisputed , undefeated and supposedly unconquerable champion , but also beat him clearly and soundly and the result is , politicians and other caring persons are wondering who is don king and why was he taking mike tyson s side when he s supposed to be a neutral promoter \? in washington , rep bill richardson , democrat of new mexico , talked of introducing federal legislation to police promoters and such organizations as the world boxing council , the world boxing association and the international boxing federation other politicians , such as jim florio , the governor of new jersey , a casinoboxing state , also threaten to question boxing s law and order not that a federal boxing commission is necessary if properly operated , a nongovernmental national boxing commission would provide enough clout to regulate promoters the public perception is that boxers and their managers are free agents just waiting to listen to the best deal the reality is that although three primary promoters exist \( bob arum and dan duva in addition to king \) , the best boxers are tied to longterm contracts or options king , for example , has acknowledged holding quite a few options on douglas , reportedly for five or six fights eliminate the longterm contracts eliminate the options and eliminate don king s dual role as mike tyson s promoter and manager don king has n't dared to call mike tyson my fighter , at least not when anybody in authority was listening but when asked about using the word we to link himself with the dethroned champion , he instantly identified with a manager , yank durham , not a promoter surely a freudian slip that deserves to be ruled a knockdown , if not a knockout
montreal , may 21 jacques menard has a tan , a fourwheeldrive jeep , a good golf stroke , volunteer duties at oxfam , gold cuff links , a pool , and a watercolor of the montreal stock exchange hanging on his office wall but like any selfrespecting executive in new york or chicago , he bridles at the word yuppie none of us see ourselves as yuppies , said mr menard , who became a company director at age 29 and is now , at 44 , a vice chairman and managing director of the canadian brokerage firm burns fry ltd he added , delicately we went rather quickly into leadership positions we did n't have time to engross ourselves in the consumer culture the we that mr menard speaks of is a new generation of french canadian business leaders many of them were catapulted at young ages into highlevel jobs left open by englishspeaking canadian executives who fled quebec when the separatist government of rene levesque took power in 1967 heated talk of independence their successful rise in professions that were once the exclusive preserve of englishspeaking canadians has captivated quebec so much so that the phrase newly confident quebec business class is repeated so often as an epithet that it has taken on a singsong lilt but the entrepreneurs are of particular interest in quebec these days as heated talk of independence sweeps the province for the first time in a decade it is taken very seriously partly because several prominent montreal business leaders , men like michel gaucher , chairman of the steinberg supermarket chain , or claude beland , president of mouvement desjardins , quebec s largest credit union association , have stated that quebec is strong enough economically to survive on its own it s the most established , grayhairatthetemple types that are saying we are not

revolution that among other things saw quebec s birth rate fall from among the highest in the world to among the lowest in a survey conducted in 1967 , french canadian parents were asked what profession they would prefer for their sons overwhelmingly , the priesthood was the first choice when the question is asked today , business is invariably at the top of the list there are now more

business policy at hautes etudes commerciales , explains that quebec s new fascination with business is inspired by patriotism as much as selfinterest until recently , the collective challenge for quebecers was to preserve french language and religion , which is why most quebec students went on to teaching or the priesthood , mr toulouse said now the collective challenge is the quebec economy 'american style , ' gallic flair though newspapers often attach the words american style to their titles , most quebec business people reject the notion , taking pride in their gallic flair snapping

rrmost kentuckians have probably never ridden the new york city subways at rush hour if they did , it would probably remind them of blue grass day at keeneland in many ways , keeneland is america s snootiest race track open in lexington , ky , just three weeks in the spring and the fall , it is a plaything of the local breeders there is no racecaller to enlighten the masses , and the clubhouse is a truly private club in the grandstand , typical racetrack behavior is simply not tolerated keeneland fans do not loudly call the rider of their losing bet a thieving bum nor do they overturn trash cans when the stewards post a questionable disqualification on blue grass day , though , the gentility becomes lost in a crush of bodies that makes derby day at churchill downs seem almost uncrowded by comparison when the blue grass was run three days ago , a crowd of 22 , 000 filled a place that comfortably holds half that many , and daylong rain doubled the congestion by driving everyone inside walking from one end of the small grandstand to the other took 20 minutes 15 if you were in enough of a hurry to elbow through and have beer and burgoo spilled on you it was annoying but also a bit exhilarating with just 30 days of racing a year in lexington , a town with probably a higher percapita interest in horse racing than any other , every day of racing is a special event none is more special than blue grass day , the track s richest and most famous race and often a telling preview of the derby the ordinary racegoers who attend the blue grass are willing to put up with a lot many of them have to park nearly a mile from the entrances in muddy fields once inside , they can rarely get an unobstructed view of a race , and the betting lines are brutally long in the absence of a publicaddress system , many seem not to know when a race is going off the fields are small , and overbet favorites win more than their usual share none of that seems to matter , though , when it is blue grass day and when one of their own is running this year , lexington had such a colt , and they could n't root enough or bet enough , gladly taking a measly 260 for 2 for the pleasure of backing summer squall most of what summer squall proved saturday was merely confirmation he is fast , versatile and gritty the day s revelation was how much of a local hero he is , and how clearly he will be kentucky s horse in the kentucky derby on may 5 it helps that he is the only kentuckybred among the three derby favorites \( mister frisky was born in florida , then raced in puerto rico and california , and champagneforashley is a new yorkbred \) it counts that some of the 28 dogwood stable partners who own him are lexington breeders , and that his trainer , neil howard , is a popular local horseman what matters most , though , is that the blue grass was a homecoming for summer squall , the only derby starter who will have made most of his previous career starts in kentucky he was sold as yearling at the keeneland sales pavilion in july 1988 , barely a furlong from the track finish line where he won his career debut nine months later he made his next two starts at churchill downs , winning a pair of stakes races , and he returned to kentucky last month , winning the jim beam at turfway park in florence , ky , before the blue grass you do n't have to come from kentucky to like him summer squall won over new yorkers in the hopeful at saratoga last august , when he showed unusual aggressiveness and nerve for a 2yearold by butting his way through a narrow hole in midstretch he impressed floridians making his season debut in the swale stakes on march 17 , relentlessly chasing the brilliant sprinter housebuster while returning from a sevenmonth layoff in the blue grass , summer squall looked beaten on the stretch turn , when land rush charged up outside of him and thrust a nose in front summer squall visibly responded to the challenge , hung in and then fought back , and finally drew off by himself in the final furlong racing fans are respectful of mister frisky , because 16 victories without a defeat makes you a good horse regardless of where you have been racing or what you have been beating they are intrigued by champagneforashley , who is unbeaten in five starts and has had moments of brilliance but their hearts go out to summer squall , a small colt with an extra spark of courage the best part of a trip to keeneland can be leaving if you drive out the back way the road heading north is a winding twolaner that quickly leaves the race track behind and weaves through acres and acres of horse nurseries , one blending into the other you are sure you will never find the highway , and not sure that you care all you can see in any direction is mile after mile of fence , black posts changing to white at the property lines one tall hill follows another , and the drive is like a slowmotion ride on the world s longest , gentlest roller coaster there are horses in the fields , distant specks at first who come into focus as mares or foals as you get closer every few hills , you see a racegoer s car pulled over to the side and the racegoer hanging over the fence , just watching and breathing it all in most of the derby winners have come from kentucky s fields , and you can understand why the locals get especially proud and excited over a summer squall you can also understand , at least for a few moments on a sweet april evening in the bluegrass , why they run a derby in kentucky every year , and why you keep coming back

moscow , april 3 a week after the kremlin barred foreign correspondents from the crisis in lithuania , they were invited today to get their news directly from the new office of the presidential press secretary and its inaugural occupant , arkady maslennikov waiting in an office just past the the spassky gate of the kremlin , mr maslennikov turned out to be a smiling , confident , garrulous practitioner of the art of making a president sound omniscient and irreplaceable this is an art labored at endlessly inside the washington beltway but long neglected here across centuries of such negative image making as ivan the terrible and brezhnev the stagnant the creation of the spokesman s post was further evidence of president mikhail s gorbachev s intention to cut a new executive swath for himself clear of many of communism s traditional kremlin shadows the human touch all sides of the life of the country political , economic , cultural , social are included in the sphere of president gorbachev s attention , the 58yearold former journalist was soon declaiming of his boss he disclosed how mr gorbachev has his ranking ministers seeing not only to the failing economy and the lithuanian crisis , but also to the police confiscation and slaughter of that poor farmer s five pregnant milk cows that angered people so the other day in the north caucasus and to those earnest army veterans proposing still another memorial medal for the nation the latter is the stuff of human interest stories , and mr maslennikov appeared well aware that mr gorbachev , for all his dynamic chase after a brighter national future , is often criticized for being aloof from the people the spokesman also showed the requisite knack for never allowing his client to be less than galvanic in any single sentence if necessary , the president will create operative groups for leadership and coordination of the activities of various bodies of power in various different directions , mr maslennikov said , in a typical answer to one question about the new powers recently enacted for mr gorbachev lest anyone imagine a napping president in the kremlin , he also took care to describe minimal differences and maximal coordination of forces under mr gorbachev s baton as participants at one presidential meeting concentrated their attention on the questions of the perfection and renewal of the soviet federation mr maslennikov , an economist by education who worked more than 20 years as an editor and correspondent for pravda , the communist party newspaper , was fatalistic about the notion of a first 100 days for mr gorbachev s new presidency , noting that a honeymoon from criticism is something unaimaginable in these chaotic days in the nation whatever you do those 100 days are going to pass anyway , he said at least that s the way i see it the press secretary was pravda s london correspondent when he first met the future president in 1984 when mr gorbachev visited the british capital as party secretary and drew one of his early favorable bursts of western publicity as the communist most likely last summer , mr gorbachev had him installed as the press spokesman at the supreme soviet , or parliament , and this week he promoted him , an ascension reflected in the spokesman s selfconfidence , in which he was even willing to plead ignorance and stare unapologetically back at a questioner i do n't know of any big events in the next two or three days , he said , speaking like the spokesman of a government that has such a daily diet of crises that manufacturing news , as in the current doldrums reported from washington , can only seem a distant luxury salary \? 'i do n't know' i do n't know what his salary is , he answered another questioner , not bothering to say he would get back with an answer from the time i have worked with president gorbachev i have not noticed any health problems , he replied to another of the staples of western presidential press coverage slowly seeping within moscow s executive beltway i think our president is a physically strong man , strong enough to deal with the nations responsibilities , he said , the westwinglike forthrightness seeming to grow with each reply by the end of the new press secretary s hourlong debut , none of the correspondents were complaining about being thrown out of lithuania they crowded around smiling at him , begging further tidbits and getting his office phone number and the name of his secretary , yelena gregorievna bobish , the better to begin seeking luncheon dates photo the new soviet press secretary , arkady maslennikov , holding his first news conference yesterday \( agence francepresse \)
washington , july 21 the arizona businessman who secured 185 billion in federal savings and loan subsidies with lobbying help from a former aide to president bush was also able to buy an insolvent oklahoma bank at a favorable price despite his failure to meet federal standards for such purchases the businessman , james m fail of phoenix , is under investigation by a senate subcommittee that is studying how he acquired 15 insolvent texas savings and loans , using 70 million in borrowed money and a personal investment of 1 , 000 senator howard m metzenbaum , the ohio democrat leading the senate inquiry , has called that deal with the defunct federal home loan bank board an abomination , the worst case to emerge from the savings and loan scandal unusual treatment previously undisclosed details on the sale of the oklahoma bank , obtained from records and in interviews with participants in the deal , show that mr fail and his lobbyist , robert j thompson , received unusually swift and favorable treatment from another regulatory agency , the federal deposit insurance corporation senior fdic officials acknowledged that the agency had erred in approving mr fail so quickly the fdic s chairman , l william seidman , said friday in an interview that the agency should have deferred action or chosen a second bidder we did n't stick strictly to the rules he slipped through , mr seidman said he duped us mr seidman also said that he did not know why the agency s screening process broke down and that his dealings with mr thompson , including a few phone calls and a meeting with the lobbyist and his potential investors , were routine mr fail and mr thompson declined to be interviewed a spokesman for both men , lance morgan , said today that mr thompson arranged an introductory meeting in january 1987 between mr fail and mr seidman , at which there was a general discussion of acquiring troubled banks the disclosure of mr fail s deal with the fdic is one of the first to link the agency , which oversees commercial banking , to irregularities in its application process and the involvement of a politically connected lobbyist critics of the federal home loan bank board , which supervised the savings industry , have said political manipulation was commonplace there in contrast , the fdic and mr seidman , its chairman since 1985 , have a reputation for probity and sound financial judgment last year , congress established the resolution trust corporation to clean up the savings and loan disaster and mr seidman \( pronounced seedman \) was given the additional title of chairman of the trust corporation in both deals involving mr fail , officials in washington were unaware of or ignored the objections of local regulators who thought mr fail s legal problems should disqualify him as a suitable buyer mr fail , who is 64 years old , was indicted in 1976 in alabama on charges of securities fraud the charges were dropped and mr fail agreed not to conduct new business in the state in the same case , his insurance company pleaded guilty to securities fraud , a felony one day after mr fail submitted background and financial information that did not disclose his indictment but did mention the guilty plea by his company , the fdic approved the sale , agency officials said background questions the agency s background form , which officials tried unsuccessfully to get mr fail to submit , asks specifically if the applicant has ever been indicted in seeking to explain why mr seidman and the other fdic board members approved mr fail even though he had not filed the required form , alan j whitney , the fdic s spokesman , said mr fail had filed other documents as a substitute , adding , it is less likely in the future we 'll accept alternate forms mr morgan said mr thompson is quite sure that federal and state regulators in oklahoma city and dallas knew of mr fail s indictment and that this information was provided in a timely manner mr thompson was a campaign aide to george bush in 1980 and served as legislative aide when mr bush was vice president the meeting in january 1987 with mr seidman included edwin a locke jr , an associate of mr fail mr locke said mr fail was also at the meeting mr seidman said he remembered the meeting with mr thompson and mr locke , but not mr fail s presence , though he said mr fail could have been there the lobbyist how the process moved so smoothly mr locke , who worked closely with mr fail during the deal and later became president of the oklahoma bank , said mr thompson had played a key role in moving the process along without the standard forms mr morgan said mr thompson had no role whatsoever in preparing the documents or deciding what documents were submitted to the fdic but mr thompson s recollection , mr morgan said , was that all the documents required by the dallas fdic s office were submitted mr locke , a new york investor , said he and mr thompson s father , victor m thompson jr , and cousin donald c mcneill had received 50 , 000 each for helping mr fail acquire the oklahoma bank in dealings with regulators , they presented themselves as potential buyers or agents , with mr fail remaining in the background mr locke denied he had knowingly tried to mislead officials by serving as a standin for mr fail a fallingout
to the editor father s vanishing act called common drama \( news article , june 4 \) is poignant and distressing it is , however , incomplete i do not condone a man s abandonment of his children either emotionally or financially yet in my most vulnerable and anguished moments , a hint of understanding arises as to why a man would so act it is a man s pain and grief , his loss and deep sadness , that you fail to address leaving my kids was the hardest thing i ever did though three and a half years have passed , and though i have a coparent arrangement that allows my kids to sleep in my home three nights a week , it remains painful i know many men in similar circumstances none are inclined to abandon their children but the courts , the news media and psychosocial pundits address a man s feelings with disregard and insensitivity you write , children s advocates say it is difficult to find a policy solution that would change the behavior of fathers i would suggest that when the pain and sadness of fathers are given as much billing and attention as the demands for financial compensation at a time of great loss and vulnerability , then the behavior of fathers may be more responsive you and your quoted experts make fathers wrong when they are often as much the victim as the spouse and children they leave love and concern for all the parties could well lend balance and balm to a situation that cries out for healing and new direction robert s black new york , june 15 , 1990
houston , march 12 as campaigning for the texas gubernatorial primaries reached a peak last week , secret negotiations were conducted by two highpriced media consultants , each representing a top contender in the republican race although spokesmen for the two campaigns differ on what exactly was said by the consultants , within hours both campaigns hurriedly called television stations across the state to halt broadcasts of advertisements in which the candidates had accused each other of political or financial misdeeds slashing assaults of that sort have become an increasingly common weapon in recent elections across the country , but the republican truce , as it became known , is just one indication that negative advertisements have apparently failed to produce results for any of the candidates in the hardfought texas races a barrage of political ads nonetheless , the voters , who go to the polls on tuesday , have been subjected to a barrage of caustic television commercials from virtually all of the major candidates aides to several said their seeming inability to score substantial gains with negative advertisements illustrates the potential weaknesses of a tactic that has been very successful elsewhere for instance , the republican race demonstrated how launching a televised offensive against a wellliked foe can sometimes backfire the democrats learned that the impact of negative advertising can be diluted in a field of candidates and some of the efforts have failed because they lacked a single memorable image like the willie horton advertisements that george bush used in the 1988 presidential campaign against michael s dukakis to portray the massachusetts governor as soft on crime no clean kill no one has scored a clean kill by going negative this time , and the campaign has shown that attack ads can be totally unproductive under certain circumstances , said dick leggitt , a campaign consultant for clayton williams , the midland businessman who is the clear frontrunner in the republican race spending by candidates here , most of it on television advertisements , exceeded 25 million early last week , making this among the most expensive state primary campaigns in the nation s history the size of the state alone has dictated a heavy reliance on television advertising for candidates trying to reach voters scattered across 19 major media markets as a result , texas has served as a giant laboratory for television campaigning techniques over the past few months lessons learned here may be carried to other states later this year by the horde of media consultants who travel from election to election selling their expertise to politicians each major candidate employed a large political consulting firm based in washington or new york to oversee the design , production and broadcast of television advertising on the democratic side bob shrum and bob squier , two veteran campaign consultants , faced off , while the truce among the top republicans was negotiated by don sipple , acting for kent hance , and dick dressner , speaking for mr williams but big names have been no guarantee of success tom luce , a dallas lawyer , was advised by richard wirthlin , who held prominent positions in ronald reagan s campaigns , and bailey , deardourff associates , one of the bestknown political consulting firms but mr luce has consistently ranked third among the republican candidates in recent polls republicans trade barbs mr hance , chairman of the texas railroad commission , which regulates the oil industry , tried and failed to undermine his leading opponent with an advertisement suggesting that mr williams had tried to buy influence with a state official by making a 1 , 000 campaign contribution the official in question is jim mattox , the state s attorney general , who is a candidate in the democratic gubernatorial primary after the advertisements had been broadcast for about a week , the williams campaign responded with a hardhitting commercial that accused mr hance of flipflopping on issues , noting that mr hance switched to the gop in 1985 after being elected to the state legislature and to congress as a democrat a few days later the hance and williams campaigns struck their truce and both advertisements were withdrawn hance started losing points in the polls right after the negative ad went on the air , said richard murray , a political scientist at the university of houston who has conducted a series of campaign polls for the houston chronicle and the dallas morning news he added , people seem to find williams very likable by virtue of his personality alone , and hance seems to have done himself nothing but harm by going on the attack mr williams has spent more than 8 million , which is more than all his opponents' expenditures combined the money has financed an unrelenting television campaign that began last september , months before any other candidates began advertising if recent polls hold , mr williams should get more than 50 percent of the vote tuesday , avoiding a runoff scheduled for april 10 ads can be too complicated mr murray said the hance advertisement violated a cardinal rule of negative campaigning because it was too complicated for 30 seconds of air time in fact , none of the negative advertisements broadcast here have generated the kind of brutally incisive images achieved in president bush s 1988 campaign the lack of clarity was evident also in the democratic primary , which has produced a much tighter and more negative race than the republican primary mr mattox , a politician with a reputation for exploiting his opponents' weaknesses , appears to have gained the most in a campaign that has bloodied three of the democrats' top votegetters state treasurer ann richards , former gov mark white and mr mattox are running about even in the democratic race , recent polls say , and they have been accusing each other of sins from simple lying to having , as ms richards put it , the best resumes money can buy at one point the democrats produced a clamor on the airwaves as each candidate launched similar advertisements attacking the other two simultaneously when several of these doublebarreled messages appeared in quick succession , the only way to figure out who was sponsoring an advertisement was by noting which of the three was not under assault at the moment we know it got confusing for the public , said kelly fero , spokesman for the mattox campaign , people started losing track of who was saying what about whom along with officials of other campaigns , mr fero said the democrats' cacophony showed that negative advertisements are not as effective in a race with several candidates as they are in a oneonone contest having apparently drawn the lesson , mr mattox began taking more careful aim with advertisements that had ms richards as the focus with several candidates trying to outdo each other in their stands on crime , mr mattox s latest advertisements highlight ms richards s endorsement by the editors of endeavor , a newspaper written and produced by convicts awaiting execution in texas prisons
for oil companies , iraq s invasion of kuwait has created a host of uncertainties about prices and supplies but there is no question that the mideast crisis , however it is resolved , has the potential to reshape the industry not since the embargoes and sharp oilprice increases of the 1970 s have oil companies faced the prospect of coping with a new , if asyetundefined , order among their major crude suppliers in the organization of petroleum exporting countries and not in a decade or more has the industry had as promising an opportunity to influence critical decisions on how and where the united states will meet its energy needs in coming decades and to reverse what it considers excessive sensitivity to environmental issues there is the potential for a changed environment for the industry , more so than at any time in the past 10 years , said bernard j picchi , an analyst at salomon brothers the issues have now captured the attention of everyone in washington and of the man on the street for the first time in more than a decade , congress and the administration are likely to focus seriously on whether the united states has endangered its own security by becoming overly reliant on foreign oil the country imported half of its oil needs in the first half of this year , a record and on whether the industry should be provided with financial incentives to reverse a decline in domestic exploration and production after years of seeing new domestic drilling projects thwarted by environmental concerns , and despite a public image badly damaged by recent oil spills , the industry could get a renewed and possibly more receptive hearing for its argument that a fear of accidents should not cripple the nation s ability to supply more of its own energy the national security aspects of oil had been completely subordinated in recent years to the environmental concerns , said john h lichtblau , head of the petroleum industry research foundation in new york now you have the emphasis coming back to the security aspects if there is a conflict between the two , it may no longer be automatically resolved in favor of the environmentalists investing the profits assuming that crude oil prices remain relatively high , the crisis will have the immediate effect of generating more profits for many oil companies , although lower earnings from refining operations could hold down their gains companies will have to decide how much of those profits to invest in new exploration and production and where that investment should go the chevron corporation , for one , decided earlier this month to spend an additional 100 million this year to produce more oil in existing domestic fields others are seeking new places to drill abroad , including the soviet union analysts and industry executives say some companies might respond by putting more emphasis on their production and marketing of natural gas , which although plentiful and inexpensive relative to crude oil is still the poor relation of the industry other companies might make more extensive commitments to developing alternativefuel businesses none seem likely to diversify outside of the energy field the momentum for change could evaporate if the crisis is resolved quickly and barring widespread shortages or dramatically higher prices , the federal policy formulation process is likely to move slowly congress , which virtually ignored energy policy issues while oil flowed abundantly and relatively inexpensively over the past decade , has an understandable aversion to adopting any measures to help the industry at a time of rising prices oil company rhetoric notwithstanding , policy changes in washington to encourage more domestic production could never eliminate the nation s need for foreign oil new domestic production is unlikely to offset the decline in output from sites that are slowly being pumped dry at the giant prudhoe bay field in alaska , for example , production is expected to decline from 13 million barrels a day to 500 , 000 in 10 years in any case , the major companies continue to see more potential for new finds abroad i do n't care how much you drill in this country , you will never be able to replace imports with domestic sources , said robert k watson , a new yorkbased energy specialist at the natural resources defense council , an environmental activist group still , there are some indications that the pendulum is beginning to swing back in favor of whatever domestic sources can be found just a few days after the invasion of kuwait , the senate approved an amendment to the defense authorization bill requiring that the president take steps to reduce the nation s dependence on foreign oil among the steps required by the amendment , offered by senator frank murkowski , a republican from alaska , would be opening to exploration and production federal lands that have previously been off limits , including the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge in alaska \( see box \) avoiding hard choices the legislation , which still faces a long battle before it could become law , also calls for oil import fees , tax and other incentives for domestic production and further conservation efforts the actions , virtually all of which are supported by oil companies , would be required whenever imports exceeded 50 percent of the nation s oil needs
cbs was deluged with telephone calls yesterday , some from people supporting andy rooney , others praising the network s threemonth suspension of the 60 minutes commentator network spokesmen would not say exactly how many calls had been received the action against mr rooney was taken thursday following complaints that he had made remarks that were offensive to blacks and homosexuals he apologized for being imprecise in the remarks about homosexuals and denied having made comments critical of blacks mr rooney s future with cbs news was left in doubt the suspension will cost mr rooney onequarter of his annual cbs news salary , which has been reported at approximately 800 , 000 mr rooney s colleagues at 60 minutes have been instructed by cbs not to comment on the suspension but walter cronkite , the former news anchor who now sits on the cbs board , gave mr rooney unqualified support yesterday , another former senior cbs newsman did so 'blunt in talking the truth' it seems to me you have to judge the whole man , said fred w friendly , a former president of cbs news and now director of the columbia university seminars on media and society referring to mr rooney s denial of the racist remarks attributed to him in the advocate , a national gay newspaper , mr friendly said some of us who have known andy rooney for 50 years 48 , in my case know that andy is blunt in talking the truth if andy rooney said he never said that , i would believe it some of mr rooney s colleagues said that his suspension was partly due to a letter he wrote to the advocate that was published this week with an interview he gave the newspaper mr rooney described an act of lovemaking between men in explicit language and said that he found it repugnant he wrote , aids is a largely preventable disease , and noted that he thought there was growing public resentment about being taxed to pay for the health care of people suffering from selfinflicted diseases asked about his reaction to the letter and to similar comments made by mr rooney during a special program shown in december , mr friendly said that social commentators had always made remarks that offended some people , adding , i would tell andy to keep his mouth shut but i would n't fire him , not somebody of his stature ben h bagdikian , a professor in the graduate school of journalism at the university of california at berkeley and a widely published author on the social impact of television , also expressed sympathy rooney reflects on events there are growing tensions among ethnic groups and groups with different sexual preferences and the tone in our society has not been a warm one in the last 10 years , mr bagdikian said when you add that to the condition of the networks in which they are nervous about their earnings and about pressure groups , anybody can be seen as offensive and as a financial liability in a syndicated column distributed late yesterday , mr rooney reflected on the circumstances surrounding his suspension he denied having made racist remarks and added it is not clear yet to me whether i have been destroyed or not , but i know that a denial from anyone does not carry anywhere near the same weight as an accusation the accusation against me came from an angry gay organization which had decided that , while the media might be relatively indifferent to the complaint of gays that they had been wronged , it is difficult for any news organization to stand up against a charge of racism the column concludes for all the hurt to me , i am even sorrier for the hurt to gays , blacks and cbs news none of them need more trouble ,
amman , jordan , sept 6 i lost my job , mr ismail , who is 50 years old , told visitors to his new home , a leanto made of blankets and plastic walled by scuffed suitcases , all that most of the asian refugees from kuwait were able to save in their headlong flight for safety across iraq s borders i lost my pension , i lost my savings , i lost my household , i lost everything before aug 2 , i was feeling myself to be rich now , i am feeling myself to be a beggar when president saddam hussein sent his troops into kuwait five weeks ago , he seized a country with a seat in the united nations but he also destroyed a society , sending the pieces of it the rich , the welltodo , and the poor scattering across the deserts at the pitiful refugee camps that have sprung up in the no man s land along the iraqijordanian border , where the numbers of hungry and sick asians continued to spiral upward today , the pieces of that society have come together again , but this time in a different order , and in a way that has caused rich and poor to see each other in new and revealing ways a world turned upside down since the invasion , mr hussein has inveighed against kuwait s rulers for running a corrupt society in which hundreds of thousands of foreigners , most arabs and asians , did most of the work while the ruling sabah family and other wealthy kuwaitis idled but judging by opinion in the refugee camps , whatever resentments there were rapidly dwindled as the foreigners houses were looted by iraqi troops , and as asian and other women were raped when food began running out in the stores , as it did in some areas of kuwait by midaugust , even those who had hoped to sit out the invasion , like mr ismail , decided to run for the safety beyond iraq s borders a week ago , when the minibus that carried mr ismail on the 1 , 000mile journey from kuwait passed through the iraqi frontier post and deposited him at what has become known as camp no 2 , in a sunscorched landscape bleak even by the harsh standards of most arab lands , he was cast into a world turned upside down pulling together to survive like a banker sent to prison , he had to accustom himself in an instant to a place where the advantages of money , of education , of connections , were as nothing in camp no 2 , he was a poor man , and not only because all he had in his pocket was the equivalent of 585 the new society of the desert has been one where those who do best are the strongest and most practical , in some cases the most wily with the meager food supplies reaching the camp meaning that some people have eaten only once every other day , and then only a few tinned sardines or pieces of bread , spotting the arrival of trucks from amman quickly and scampering after them across the sands has become a necessity usually , it is the young men who arrive first , and supplies run out long before the lineups for the middle class , the accountants and company secretaries and quantity surveyors who can

in the structured society of kuwait in the leanto with mr ismail were truck drivers , sweepers , and airconditioning mechanics , along with some men who had no job at all though from india , one of the world s most classconscious societies , they learned to pull together in a way unthinkable at home thoughts on life s inequities to avoid dehydration in sevenhour water lineups , a roster was arranged to provide a semblance of privacy for ablutions , stones were gathered in the desert and stacked in a crude semicircle money was pooled to buy food biscuits and canned sardines from the jordanian traders who drove their vans to the edge of the camp when jordan s desert police accused the traders of gouging and drove them off , parties were organized to set off across the desert in search of the traders' new locations , sometimes miles away across the horizon in the long days there has been time for reflection , and much of it , among the indians at least , has been about the inequities of life before the invasion i think god made this place for me and all other peoples like me to teach us a lesson , said gregory lobo , a 32yearold car salesman from mangalore who had spent

chet forte s next arena will have none of the cachet of his more noted backdrops the 54yearold forte , a former national basketball scoring champion at columbia university and later an emmywinning director of monday night football , is scheduled to appear next friday morning at the federal courthouse in camden , nj there , in a building that doubles as a post office , forte will plead not guilty to a series of tax and fraud charges the most serious contend that he lied to banks and mortgage companies in order to secure loans to keep financially afloat the government says the money was used to help pay off atlantic city casino debts that reached hundreds of thousands of dollars this represents a shocking fall from grace for a charismatic figure who was a heroic player in the 1950 s , the golden age of new york city sports , and who then turned his talents toward creating the distinctive look of monday night football in its heyday , the arrival of abc s crew in a city before a monday night game often generated nearly as much hoopla as the teams themselves as monday night football grew , so did forte s reputation yet forte now acknowledges that he was addicted to gambling , much of which was done in the glitter of las vegas , nev , but which also included furtive phone calls to bookies it cost him his home in the prestigious community of saddle river , nj , where it had been appraised at more than 15 million a sheriff s auction to satisfy creditors three weeks ago fetched 908 , 000 the house , which had been mortgaged several times in recent years , leading to the current charges , went just a few days after his mercedes was repossessed he moved his wife and daughter to midlothian , va , where they are living with his mother forte , whose annual earnings were believed to be more than 500 , 000 for many years , told the court he could not afford a lawyer , so he is being represented by a public defender the lawyer , lawrence s lustberg , says of forte he s the poorest guy i ever represented if you do it from the standpoint of debt he s a million dollars in debt forte commented on his situation through lustberg , who advised him not to be directly quoted however , lustberg relayed questions to forte and then paraphrased his responses , through forte s words , as well as those of longtime associates and old friends , a picture emerges of a talented , driven man who lived on the edge , in the words of one former superior at abc forte left abc three years ago to go into independent production he said , through lustberg , that he would like to continue working but has been told that no one will hire him until this case is resolved also , forte added , he is having heart problems forte suffered three heart attacks in 1987 , lustberg said , and also underwent two recent operations for skin cancer in addition , forte told lustberg that he has a lung condition that also might be cancerous forte said that he recognized his gambling was a terrible addiction , and realized the problems it has caused his family as well he said he had not gambled for a year and a half although he said he was not undergoing any therapy now , he did not rule it out in the future but lustberg said , this is obscuring the fact that he was more than a gambler , an allusion to forte s reputation as a talented television man indeed , howard cosell , who worked with forte on monday night football , recalls forte as a quality producer and director , as good a director as there was in his time cosell was best man at forte s wedding forte was married 13 years ago , when he was 41 years old until then , he lived with his mother at their home in saddle river , but was known as a highliving bachelor who enjoyed being in the public eye forte viewed monday night football as his show , lock , stock and barrel , cosell said he was an emotional man , cosell said he had fits of temper he was a strong little fellow cosell added that forte was always a compulsive gambler and everybody knew it i remember we were flying to houston when ali was going to fight cleveland williams , cosell said , and we landed in a private airport and chet went right to a phone and called his bookie he never hid it in fact , people familiar with forte s situation when he was at abc said , senior officials at the network were concerned enough to discuss forte s gambling among themselves , although they concluded it never affected his performance or prejudiced his judgment on what to show current abc officials declined to comment terry o'neil , now executive producer of nbc sports , worked with forte at abc in the game behind the game , a book published last year , o'neil recalled driving to a game in forte s limousine , with forte reading a newspaper as we rode , it was actually the starting pitchers of major league baseball who were keeping forte s interest he winced behind reading glasses , mumbled about tom seaver s last outing , made his selections , and marked them with a ballpoint pen when we arrived at the director s truck , chet s first move would be to call his bookie this was hardly an unusual scene , associates say
indian wells , calif , oct 17 a small bag full of charred prehistoric bone chips locked inside the evidence cabinet of a district attorney is the focus of the latest and most peculiar twist in a nationwide debate over the status of american indian relics the bone chips were unearthed in the desert in indian wells , 100 miles east of los angeles , by an independent archeologist named david van horn he now faces a criminal trial for treating the bones as an archeological find rather than reporting the discovery to the local coroner , as is required by california law under the law , the coroner would notify the state s native american heritage commission , which would determine the bones' probable descendents and turn the find over to them for reburial move to protect rights the law is one of a number that have been enacted around the country in the last decade to strengthen the rights of indians who claim personal and religious ties to the relics of their ancestors the prosecutor in the case , richard erwood , who is the deputy district attorney of indio , said he believes mr van horn is the first archeologist to face a prison term under the law essentially the debate is over whether indian relics like the bone chips found by mr van horn are scientific material for study and display or sacred remains that should be reburied under pressure from indian rights groups and over the objections of many scholars , the smithsonian institution and stanford university have given ground in the latter argument and agreed over the last year to return parts of their collections of indian relics to the tribes for reburial the prosecution of mr van horn has raised protests among archeologists , who see it as an absurd extension of a movement that could hamper scientific research archeologist s complaint how are you going to do archeology and learn about man s past if you 've got the state of california burying the stuff as fast as you can find it \? mr van horn asked none of us wish to offend people by excavating their relatives , he said but here we are talking about completely anonymous prehistoric individuals for whom , in many cases , it is impossible to determine their tribal affiliation , to say nothing of their sex , age or anything else mr van horn , who has a doctorate in classical archeology from the university of pennsylvania , works on contract for developers , who are required by law to scout for archeological remains before beginning construction when he found the bones 18 months ago on a windswept patch of desert along highway 111 in indian wells , he sent them for a routine laboratory analysis in doing so , prosecutors say , he violated a law that gene gilbert , a state investigator , said had been aimed at these weekend people who go out and tear up grave sites as a result , the pebblesized bone chips now rest in a paper bag inside an orange formica evidence cabinet in the nearby city of indio in the bag are four smaller plastic bags marked finger bones , skull bones , hand bones and tooth root excavator , or grave robber \? when the chips , probably charred in a cremation hundreds of years ago , are brought into court as evidence next month , mr van horn will face as many as three years in prison under a statute that equates his excavation with grave robbing this certainly seems to be the ultimate in terms of an extreme case , said mark lynott , the president of the society of professional archeologists in lincoln , neb , which has established ethical codes for the profession i do n't know of any other example where an archeologist has been prosecuted for what others in the profession consider to be a standard archeological research project but larry myers , executive secretary of the native american heritage commission , suggested that scientific research had begun to disregard the rights of indians have they really been able to justify the large number of remains that are out of the ground \? he asked there are limits to scientific research mr myers , who is of pomo indian heritage , continued they know enough about the diet they know enough about righthanded and lefthanded they know that everyone suffered from arthritis do they really need to know more \? 25 million dug up walter r echohawk , a lawyer for the native american rights fund in boulder , colo , a leader in the movement to rebury indian relics , said , it has been estimated that between 300 , 000 and 25 million american indians have been dug up and are in various curio shops and museums mr myers said indian claims to relics go beyond the question of direct biological connections , which can be hard to determine with prehistoric bones he said indian religions hold that all people placed in a particular area by the creator are related mr van horn thinks he has the right to say what to do with remains just because he found them , he said many scientists see the views voiced by mr myers as profoundly antiintellectual clement meighan , a professor of anthropology at the university of california , los angeles , said , if you destroy all the significant collections in all the museums , you 've just wiped out the total history of the indians in north america at the smithsonian institution in washington , the collections are used by doctors , dentists and forensic pathologists in solving crimes biological researchers are developing technology to extract antibodies and genetic material from the bones that could add to knowledge about indian life momentum with indians nevertheless the momentum appears to be with american indian groups seeking what they call repatriation of the relics a halfdozen states , including california , nebraska and massachusetts , have passed laws in recent years giving indians a voice in the disposal of such remains twentytwo states have passed laws against disturbing american indian burial sites last august the smithsonian reached an agreement with indian leaders that is likely to lead to the return of the skeletal remains of hundreds of indians to the tribes the announcement was seen as a turning point in the debate because the smithsonian s collection of 18 , 600 skeletal remains and thousands of burial artifacts is the largest in the country last may , stanford increased pressure on institutions that display indian artifacts by handing over hundreds of indian skeletons and funeral objects to representatives of the ohlone tribe for reburial photo indian bone chips unearthed from an archeological excavation in california fall under the protection of a state law requiring their reburial gene gilbert , a state investigator , examined the bone fragments \( bart bartholomew for the new york times \)
oh , brouthers ! q an answer several weeks ago cited dan brouthers , a pre20th century player , as the first baseman with the highest batting average in baseball history , 342 are there any other significant facts about him \? a brouthers , like many star players of his time , was a blend of fact and legend lefthanded all the way , standing 6 feet 2 inches and weighing about 200 pounds , he might have been the ted kluszewski of his day he certainly swung the bat like one during a period when home runs by batters were as scarce as complete games are these days by pitchers , brouthers \( it rhymes with smoothers \) smote 106 home runs , some of which sent observers into the kinds of exaggerations that made the tape measure a part of baseball equipment he also hit 205 triples , eighth best in major league annals of any century , and 460 doubles so as a slugger , brouthers was the real thing he was no slouch as a runner either , with 235 career stolen bases , and his batting eye was certainly nothing to wink at over 1 , 673 games with 11 teams in three leagues from 18791904 , brouthers rapped 2 , 296 hits he won batting titles five times \( with a high of 374 in 1883 \) , and he closed his career with the new york giants in 1904 , being retired five times by pitchers that season before retiring for good in a comeback attempt at 46 years old , after eight years away from the major leagues for many years after that , brouthers served as a press box attendant at the polo grounds he died in 1932 thirteen years later , he was elected to the baseball hall of fame site of mays s catch q when wille mays of the giants made his spectacular catch during a world series game against cleveland , who hit the ball and in which ball park was the catch made \? a the catch heard round the world was made at the same site the polo grounds in new york as the shot heard round the world three years earlier , when bobby thomson s dramatic threerun home run in the ninth inning against the brooklyn dodgers won a playoff game and a pennant for the giants mays s catch won nothing but praise from friend and foe and fan it came with none out , cleveland runners on first and second , the score tied at 22 in game 1 of the 1954 world series , and it preserved the tie , which was broken two innings later by another giant gamewinning threerun homer , this one by dusty rhodes , a pinchhitter the overtheshoulder catch by mays , about 460 feet from home plate , deprived vic wertz of a certain triple and the indians of two runs cleveland never recovered from it the giants won the next three games for a fourgame sweep and the indians have never been back to the the world series the nickel curve q in baseball , what s a nickel curve \? a it s a pitch that s not worth two cents to scouts looking for pitching talent a pitcher with a nickel curve has one that is either too slow or too straight to do him any good , and one that s probably not worth more than a plugged nickel indy 500 records q when arie luyendyk of the netherlands won the indianapolis 500 this year , his average speed of 185981 miles an hour set a record for the 500mile race , bettering by 15259 mph the mark of 170722 set by bobby rahal in 1986 had an indy 500 record ever been broken by such a wide margin \? a absolutely not , not even by half that margin so extraordinary was the pace set by luyendyk this year , that 11 drivers who trailed him in the final standing also eclipsed the average speed record achieved by rahal four years ago when rahal broke the mark rick mears set in 1984 , his margin of improvement was 711 mph that margin of growth in the record compared well with those of ralph depalma in 1915 \( 737 mph \) and wilbur shaw in 1937 \( 751 \) but none of the three were any match for luyendyk , who was the first winner whose average was more than 100 mph higher than ray harroun s 7459 mph in 1911 , when the gentlemen at indianapolis first started their engines a pair of auto firsts q in february , derrike cope won the daytona 500 for his first nascar victory in may , arie luyendyk won the indianapolis 500 for his first cart victory what other drivers accomplished their first nascar or cart victories at these two prestigious events \? a the firstvictory feat happened once before on the nascar road and several times on the cart usac road , but never in the same year in 1970 , pete hamilton , driving a plymouth for richard petty engineering , captured the 1970 daytona 500 , averaging 149601 miles an hour he had never before won a nascar race four years earlier , graham hill of england won the indy 500 , averaging 144317 mph he had never before won a united states auto club race \( usac ran the indycar show before cart was created in 1978 \) among the dozen or more other indycar drivers who made their usac breakthroughs at the indy 500 were troy ruttman in 1952 and george robson in 1946 but no other daytona 500 winner except hamilton and cope ever made his stockcar breakthrough on the nascar circuit since it began in 1959 question box is a regular feature of sportsmonday readers are invited to submit questions concerning any aspect of sport statistics or strategies , rules or records the address is question box , sportsmonday , the new york times , 229 west 43d street , new york , ny 10036 questions not published cannot be answered individually
after half a decade of denying , deploring , hinting at , acknowledging and sheepishly celebrating their mutual sexual attraction , tony micelli and angela bower have agreed they do n't know their feelings well enough to discuss the future sam malone , having spent five years getting together and breaking up with diane chambers , has been chasing rebecca howe for 28 months to no avail and earlier this month , hannah miller and marty gold trotted into their first new year together in a state of carefully cultivated ambiguity these virtuosos of irresolution are , of course , couples in sitcoms \( nbc s cheers and abc s who s the boss \? and anything but love \) whose plots depend on endless sexual tension between their protagonists soapopera characters pair and part , tiny bits of glass in an incessantly turning kaleidoscope of romance the leading figures of such detective comedy dramas as moonlighting and remington steele had at least a fig leaf of mystery to cover the teasing quasi romances that kept many viewers coming back for more but pity the writers of sitcoms whose very backbone is perpetual flirtation week after week , they must keep the question will they or wo n't they \? up in the air , tapping it back and forth eternally over the fatal abyss of denouement like a sisyphean volleyball at the same time , they have to get an average of three laughs per scriptpage \( at least they have to crack up the laugh track that often \) , some 50 to 100 laughs each show luckily , they need n't hurl their starcrossed protagonists directly at one another every week episodes often center on supporting characters or turn on mishaps that overtake the whole ensemble the principals can date other people , pretend they do n't care for each other that way , can even for a while stop pretending and admit the truth but no matter what else happens , when the last frame freezes at the end of the show , the attraction obstacle seesaw that is its centerpiece must be in motion to keep it teetering , writers use with varying degrees of panache an abundance of readily identifiable plot devices for example trapped by a storm , a deadline , an automobile breakdown , etc , the characters involuntarily spend a night in each other s company this particular device has long been a favorite think of clark gable and claudette colbert in frank capra s 1934 comedy it happened one night for the protagonists of endlesslove sitcoms , the experience is practically de rigueur tony \( played by tony danza \) and angela \( judith light \) did it in a twopart season opener of who s the boss \?

, tony happened upon angela in the tub for that matter , it worked three or four millenniums ago , when actaeon chanced on the bathing goddess artemis there are also the kisses onadare , the kisses toprovetheywo n'taffectus , the hugs that begin as huddling together from fear or cold or friendship but end in passion anger promotes useful blurtingsout of smoldering attachments jealousy is good to compel a reluctant acknowledgment of desire these elements recur so relentlessly not , of course , because the scriptwriters lack imagination but because they work audiences enjoy seeing them among other things , they confirm the pleasant suspicion that the neighbor \( or shop clerk or colleague \) who always smiles so warmly harbors flattering desires to the involuntarily unattached , they suggest that love or sex is just around the corner and though it may be the latter , sometimes leering suggestion that gives these comedies their surface glitter , in these days of the singleadult household it is just as likely the former the peep show of hidden intimacy , the genuine caring revealed in sudden flashes between the characters that keeps viewers tuning in and what will the new decade bring besides , inevitably , more of the same \? if the differences between anything but love and its predecessors \( cheers was first telecast in 1982 who s the boss \? in 1984 , and anything but love came on as a midseason replacement last year \) are any indication , there will be at least a few changes for one , in the 80 s it was the women \( angela , diane and rebecca \) who were neurotic and uptight on anything but love , it s marty who is angstridden , hannah who is the chirpy optimist to the extent that accepting vulnerability in men and confidence in women represents an advance in civilization , that s progress on the other hand , while rebecca is sam s employer and angela is tony s , the novice hannah \( though lately she s gaining on him \) launched her journalistic careeer by using the established marty as a mentor an altogether more traditional female male relationship , and arguably a step backward but the biggest difference between the older shows and anything but love is the contrast between sam malone s almost antediluvian womanchasing one thinks of him as a sort of woolly mammoth of sexism sunk in a tar pit full of playboy magazines and marty s emancipation tony of who s the boss \? is no womanchaser in fact , he s notably tender and nurturing but the show has always been shot through with the sliest of doubleentendres and manchasing jokes , courtesy of angela s randy mother anything but love , on the other hand , though it stands in danger of falling into that same trap \( joseph maher has recently been brought in to play the critic brian alquist , who leers and smirks at every opportunity \) has in marty a shining example of a sexually liberated hero , one who is drawn to women whose ambitions and accomplishments match his ownmarty is perfectly comfortable with both a female boss and a female friend the exact nature of that friendship , of course , has yet to be worked out but who knows \?

atlanta , april 1 it comes every seven years in georgia , like a scourge of locusts , bringing a plague of troubles for some car owners it comes when the more than six million passenger vehicles in the state change license plates the trouble is not simply the long lines that car owners must endure but the risk they run of ending up with new numbers that might have belonged to stolen cars at worst some drivers will land in jail overnight , and at best others will suffer steely glares usually reserved for suspected felons all of that happened to a valdosta couple traveling in indiana last month , said paul sumner , the tax commissioner in that south georgia city the couple was stopped by the state police and jailed overnight while their children were put in the care of a foster family until the next morning the police finally determined that the couple s car , with newly issued georgia plates bearing the same numbers as that of a stolen car listed on the national crime information center computers , was not stolen theron collins , a 71yearold valdosta resident , left his motorcycle on the side of a florida highway when he had engine troubles and went off to find a mechanic along came the florida highway patrol and impounded it as stolen after six hours , a lot of explaining and phone calls and 35 , he got back his motorcycle i went and got a new tag after that , said mr collins , and i 'll just take my chances that i do n't have the same problem with a different tag the two cases are among more than 40 that have already surfaced this year , state motor vehicle officials said the mixups stem from a variety of peculiarities and inefficiencies in the georgia automobile license system that make it more problematic than those in other states the state changes tag design every seven years , and the change takes place in a fivemonth period ending may 30 the state tries to assign old numbers to different counties so a police officer could check the county designation on the tag and avoid confusion even though the numbers are duplicated but the practice does not always work out so neatly in other states , said fritz cornwell , an analyst with the r l polk company , a detroitbased publishing company and statistical agency for the automobile industry , the tag changeover is not on such a regular schedule when it occurs , he said , the issuing of new tags usually takes a year or more , so that numbers are taken out of circulation for a while before being reused other states avoid the duplication problem by issuing tags with different letter and number configurations adding to the problem in georgia , the tags are sold by 159 elected county tax commissioners rather than by one state agency , providing about 100 million annually to the counties none of the county computer systems are compatible with the state system , so once tags are issued , records can take six to eight months to move from county offices to state offices and onto the national crime center s computer network but this has more serious ramifications than someone being detained by outofstate police , said clint moye , director of division of motor vehicles , recalling a recent incident in tift county in central georgia a thief broke into a man s home , robbed him , bound and gagged him and then stole the man s pickup and fled the robbery victim had suffocated on the gag by the time the police discovered the crime , mr moye said , and it was late at night before they determined that the thief was probably driving the man s truck the victim had just gotten new tags for the truck and the police had to get the county tax commissioner out of bed , dressed and down to her office in order to get a tag number to put out to other departments , mr moye said they finally did , and down in south georgia they came across the truck , abandoned , but its hood was still warm there are people literally getting away with murder because of this system efforts to change the system have proved politically controversial over the years as county governments sought to protect this revenue source and avoid costly changes but the state legislature did make one change in its session that recently ended georgians no longer have to wait seven more years for the ordeal to begin the tag change is now scheduled every five years

washington , march 19 the former chairman of the house intelligence committee testified today the reagan white house assured him in 1985 and 1986 that the national security council was obeying a congressional ban on aid to the nicaraguan rebels but instead of complying , the witness said , the security council staff was secretly supplying the contras with arms , money and military advice the former chairman , representative lee h hamilton of indiana , testified at the trial of john m poindexter , a former national security adviser to president ronald reagan mr hamilton suggested , as he has in previous hearings and trials arising from the irancontra affair , that the reagan administration withheld crucial information and lied to lawmakers about the national security council s efforts on behalf of the rebels for more than a year and a half the deceptions were carried out , he said , in a succession of letters and meetings the system simply does n't work if we lie to each other in government , said mr hamilton as he concluded his daylong testimony as one of the final prosecution witnesses in the trial of the former national security adviser mr hamilton said he had been given assurances not only by mr poindexter but by robert c mcfarlane , a former national security adviser , and oliver l north , a national security aide , that the ban was being obeyed a tense moment in trial mr poindexter , a former navy rear admiral , faces five charges , including conspiring to deceive congress , obstructing congressional inquiries and making false statements about the iran arms sales and efforts to aid the contras at a time when congress barred direct assistance to the rebels mr hamilton s testimony was broken at one point by a shocked silence in the courtroom after the lawmaker made a seemingly damaging reference to mr poindexter s testimony before the irancontra congressional investigating committees in 1987 mr poindexter had agreed to testify to congress on the condition that none of his statements would be used against him in any subsequent criminal proceeding after mr hamilton s remark , richard w beckler , the chief defense lawyer , leaped to his feet to object and later asked judge harold h greene of federal district court to declare a mistrial the judge refused answering a prosecutor the reference to mr poindexter s congressional testimony came as dan k webb , the chief prosecutor , was questioning mr hamilton about a november 1986 meeting with lawmakers in which mr poindexter is accused of making false statements about the iran arms sales mr webb asked whether mr poindexter told legislators at the meeting that he had destroyed an order signed by president ronald reagan in november 1985 that authorized american participation in an israeli shipment of missiles to iran he did , answered mr hamilton , appearing to refer to mr poindexter s congressional testimony mr poindexter told congress in 1987 that he destroyed the order because he regarded it is as a politically embarrassing document that described the arms sales as little more than an armsforhostages exchange judge greene said the mention of the destruction was harmless because both the prosecution and defense attorney had previously referred to the incident and mr north , a former aide to mr poindexter , was asked about it in his testimony last week 'mr congressman' is questioned under mr beckler s sometimes sarcastic crossexamination , in which he referred to mr hamilton as mr congressman , the defense lawyer sought to point out mr poindexter s contention that the national security council was exempt from the congressional ban on contra aid , leaving it free to engage in a wide range of support but mr hamilton , referring to the congressional ban by its legislative title , the boland amendment , rejected the assertion i was never told at any time that it was the position of the national security council that boland did not apply to them , he said i had plenty of reason to believe that it did apply to them at the november 1986 meeting , mr hamilton said , mr poindexter told lawmakers about the iran arms sales but left out key parts of the episode , including the diversion of the profits to the contras and the american involvement in the israeli missile shipment in 1985 mr hamilton recalled that mr poindexter s omissions came after mr poindexter told lawmakers as he began the meeting that the president told him he wanted the full story to be told

anchorage , march 12 a former tanker captain today blamed the third mate for the grounding of the exxon valdez , but conceded under crossexamination that the accident would probably not have happened if capt joseph j hazelwood had stayed on the bridge instead of going below the former captain , shiras walker , testified for the defense that captain hazelwood , the only one of the exxon valdez crew to be charged in the nation s worst oil spill , was not to blame for the march 24 accident in prince william sound asked whether he believed that captain hazelwood s absence from the bridge contributed in any way to the grounding , mr walker replied , none at all but during crossexamination , assistant district attorney mary anne henry asked , is n't it true that if captain hazelwood was on the bridge where he was supposed to be , this would n't have happened \? mr walker replied i might disagree with that supposed to be' but if captain hazelwood was on the bridge during those maneuvers , this accident would n't have happened
west point , ny , oct 9 every time mike mayweather , an allamerica candidate , runs over another white line for army this fall he puts glenn davis , chris cagle , pete dawkins and other black knights of the past further in his dust each yard gained extends mayweather s career rushing record at west point , and the running total now is 3 , 434 yards the chunky 5foot8inch , 190pound halfback has averaged 1475 yards rushing a game , second only to michigan s jon vaughan s 168 , and has scored six touchdowns in army s three games mayweather has already been named to one allamerica team , that of playboy magazine when he was invited along with 23 other college players to attend playboy s preseason photography session in florida , the authorities at the united states military academy hesitated what would this do for the academy s image \? a different setting but their consent was consistent , in keeping with a different kind of military academy on a saturday morning walk around the place , before a game at michie stadium , one perceives an open , informal atmosphere and the natural inclusion of women and minoritygroup cadets in the corps two decades ago there were none of the former and few of the latter the starting backfield of the army team is composed of black studentathletes with mayweather , the left halfback , the gem his presence , that of calvin cass , bryan mcwilliams , callian thomas and several others is a tribute to a specific recruiting effort by the academy and the football staff headed by jim young because outstanding high school players often have the national football league as an eventual goal , it requires persuasion to convince them a service academy and fiveyear service commitment or career is in their best interests that kind of recruiting has been a key to jim young s successes , said bob casciola , the broadcaster and former coach who is a strong admirer of mayweather a student leader mayweather is a cadet lieutenant in company h3 of the 3d regiment and his domicile is the macarthur barracks he is a senior , an academic management major with a ranking in the lower third of a class of 870 it has been a struggle to get this far i feel like i 've been here about 20 years , mayweather said recently what sticks out \? i 've grown up here i 've learned how to be poised in all situations never to give up i 've learned that you can do anything you put your mind to i 've learned to be flexible they want officers who can work under stressful conditions , and in that respect i would say they have accomplished their goal it s harder to be a football player here than anything else there is so much going on you are expected to meet the demands of classwork , of the corps and then come out and practice football it s a load 'with the flow' mayweather carries the load well ed warinner of the coaching staff said mike does n't internalize the stress that goes with being a cadet he just moves with the flow mayweather is from st louis where he grew up in poor circumstances , the youngest of 10 children his father died when he was 6 what helped the most , he said , was a private school , st louis country day , which he attended on a grant it was entirely different from where i had come from , he said exclusive , rich people , but a great place i learned a lot of different perspectives and what of football \? football has given me the opportunity to meet different people , to see what was going on it s been the center point of my life mayweather s biggest day at the point came in the second game this season when he ran over the virginia military institute s defense for 227 yards on 29 carries he ran inside and he ran outside , said warinner and afterwards he was telling us he had to improve his blocking even in army s horrendous 5214 loss to wake forest last saturday , mayweather distinguished himself with his third straight 100yard game , gaining 119 yards on 27 carries , and also returning 4 kicks for 79 more in army s wishbone offense , the left and right halfbacks block for one another on the devastating sweeps in the opening game this year mayweather more than once leveled the holy cross cornerback and then cass turned upfield with the ball for a big gain i really liked that , mayweather said afterward when we get that wishbone going , it s sweep right and sweep left you feel kind of invincible everybody works together works for each other when he leaves next spring after graduation , mayweather will not soon be forgotten at his present pace he will break his own singleseason rushing record of 1 , 177 yards set last season and extend the army career mark to almost 4 , 700 the old career record of 2 , 957 yards belonged to davis , the heisman tropy winner of 1946
since the early 1980 s , the territory between painting and photography has been defined by the difference between unique , handmade originals and images that are photomechanically reproduced but such a distinction is not so sharp as it first appears as the work of an artist like andy warhol makes clear , the seemingly distinct domains of originals and reproductions can be made to overlap warhol and robert rauschenberg achieved such an overlap by incorporating the techniques and look of photomechanical reproduction into their paintings but relatively few artists have ventured in the opposite direction , taking a painterly path while adhering to the givens of photographic reality one who has is paul laster , whose pictures called tape transfers are now on view at hirschl adler modern mr laster s work is an unusual hybrid , incorporating elements of photography , drawing and collage his canvas or ground is a reproduction of a classic 20thcentury photograph by the likes of edward steichen , florence henri or man ray to this onceremoved historical image , he adds an overlay of transparent tape in which has been embedded ghostly fragments of still other images , including fragments of text the result is a complex net of pictorial information divided into two planes a blackandwhite photographic layer and , partly obscuring it , a pattern of discontinuous , mostly abstract color bacchic dance \( 1988 \) , for example , features an array of colorful , jazzy rectangles over florence henri s wellknown selfportrait , itself a photocollage in the false mirror , an andre kertesz image of children dancing is covered with jagged strips of type in fool s house and the and picture , the images embedded in the tape are shaped like oval pastilles mr laster s patterning is not entirely a matter of whim he seems eager to approximate the appearance of geometric abstraction , echoing painters like piet mondrian and graphic designers like paul rand his generic , stereotypical renditions of this essentially modernist vocabulary are at once amusing and deflating they are like the photographs underneath them inadequate reproductions of the real thing to complicate matters even more , mr laster appropriates his titles from 20thcentury painting bacchic dance comes from a work by andre derain , the false mirror from rene magritte , fool s house from jasper johns and the title date line with a photograph by lee miller borrows its title from kenneth noland this conceit is left for the viewer to decipher , although the sources are spelled out in the show s checklist and accompanying catalogue despite their conceptual and visual layering , the 25 pictures in the show offer immediate perceptual pleasures and a good deal of wit besides how often , for instance , does one get to see an image by henri cartierbresson covered with a screen of grass and foliage \? mr laster does especially well with fashion pictures , deflating their earnest glamour with ebullient overlays of floating squares and triangles still , these are small works \( the largest is 28 by 23 inches \) , and they wear the demeanor of drawings , not paintings taken together , they can feel slightly fussy and , in what is mr laster s first oneman show in new york , obsessive to the point of repetitiveness but as sophisticated parodies of the history of painting and photography , his refractive images still manage to charm the paul laster exhibition remains at hirschl adler modern , 851 madison avenue , near 70th street , through march 31 allan mccollum john weber gallery 142 greene street through tomorrow hung six high on the walls and arranged in eight rows on no fewer than 14 tables , allan mccollum s drawings cast the idea of original works of art in a new light there are more than 2 , 000 drawings in all , each one unique , the gallery says but despite their putative individuality , they seem cast from a single mold indeed , they were drawn by mr mccollum and a cast of 25 assistants with the aid of 200 templates , which were combined in what seems to be a potentially endless series of variations the drawings , framed in black , have solid , bilaterally symmetrical shapes that resemble a cross between toy tops , ornamental lamp housings and rorschach blots mr mccollum has used this device before , of course , most recently in a show of palmsized sculptures called individual works , 10 , 000 of which were displayed on a huge table two years ago at the same gallery and later in the whitney biennial his surrogates of 1983 essentially sculptures in the form of blank paintings made a similar point about the simultaneity of repetition and variation , only without the templates but it is still amazing to confront the lengths to which the artist is willing to go in his zeal to disabuse viewers of their sense of art s preciousness clegg and guttmann 'the free public library' jay gorney modern art 100 greene street through april 7 the use of photographs to construct catalogues of visual information has a long tradition , as followers of the work of bernd and hilla becher are well aware but clegg and gutmann s installation of photographs of library shelves gives that tradition a twist accompanying the photographs is a card catalogue of the sort found in public libraries , in which one can find a crossreferenced guide to the books depicted in the photographs the card catalogue is arranged not only by author , title and publisher , but also by the color of the book s cover \( hooray for yiddish is listed under red , the wholetruth home computer handbook under green \) as usual with this team of artists , whose bestknown works are stylized group portraits , the photographs function mainly as tokens in a conceptual game but here the issue is the documentary capabilities of photography , which makes one wish their large color pictures had more texture and detail still , the photographs together with the card catalogue supply an amusing and somewhat disheartening commentary on the state of western culture and of the bookpublishing industry , for that matter william wegman and victor schrager pace macgill gallery 32 east 57th street through tomorrow once again , william wegman has set out to prove that you can teach a new dog old tricks in this case , he has his second weimaraner , fay wray , suffering the same kinds of hilarious indignities he once visited on his first pet , man ray in 20odd largeformat polaroids made in 1989 , mr wegman shows fay wray standing on blocks , encased in windowscreen material and dressed in fashionable gowns as amusing as all this is , however , none of it is especially new but the show s sense of deja vu is eased by the presence of eight small color images that constitute the puppy portfolio these pictures show us fay wray s latest accomplishment , a litter of pups , as well as mr wegman s continuing ability to make a virtue of happenstance in the most delightful image , the artist has stacked the newborns on a piece of furniture as if they were furry , stuffed knickknacks in the company of mr wegman s amusements , victor schrager s work seems dour , though it , too , has the capacity to spin humor out of incongruity mr schrager assembles his photomontages methodically and purposefully , using reproductions of medical , scientific and news pictures as raw materials here , these appropriated images appear in the shape of egglike ovals , giving the overall picture a sense of threedimensionality , or else as the sides of a box that is seen in an exploded view to understand what mr schrager is getting at , it helps to think of the pictures as maps for example , zone \( 1989 \) compares the shape of a torso to an upsidedown zipcode map of manhattan or one can imagine them as graphic timelines , in which images of president john f kennedy in the dallas motorcade , the golden arches of mcdonald s , a trophy and the faces of president richard m nixon and bob hope trace the state of the american dream photo date line , 1989 , a tape transfer by paul laster , at hirschl adler modern
phnom penh , cambodia the road from ho chi minh city to phnom penh leads backward in time , from a primitive rural 20thcentury society to a still more primitive 19thcentury society the road out of ho chi minh city , the old saigon , is thronged with traffic bicycles , motor scooters , pedicabs and oxcarts carrying women in conical hats to market with their produce auto traffic slows to the pace of bicycles , which dominate the road along the road are reminders of the vietnam war on one side , behind a wall topped with barbed wire , are the barracks and other buildings once used by american soldiers nearby are the prisons and reeducation camps where hanoi has punished the vietnamese who cooperated with the united states the road leads past the war museum displayed there , around a quiet garden , are an american tank equipped with a flamethrower used in burning villages of south vietnam a 28ton howitzer used by american forces in numerous criminal acts against vietnam a helicopter gunship used by us imperialists and dozens of american bombs , grenades and machine guns exporting rice again outside ho chi minh city are vast fields of rice , being harvested by men and women of all ages vietnamese say their economy is now as healthy as at any time since the war , and they report that vietnam exported rice in 1989 for the first time in years the drive from ho chi minh city to the border with cambodia represents nearly half of the sixhour drive to phnom penh , even though it covers only onethird of the distance travel through vietnam is slower because traffic is heavier and there are more settlements than in cambodia , which is more sparsely populated at the border are two soaring arches one labeled vietnam , the other kampuchea separated by a no man s land this is the route on which vietnamese troops withdrew recently after occupying cambodia for more than 10 years customs inspectors on both sides of the border carefully search western visitors riding in trucks and cars local smugglers and peasants using more primitive means of transportation pass through the gates much more easily a smugglers' market a few hundred yards from the official border crossing point is a path where thousands of vietnamese and cambodians pass back and forth every day without receiving so much as a glance from the immigration and customs inspectors in an open field there , they have set up a smugglers' market for buying and selling bicycles , motorcycles , blue jeans , cigarettes and other goods from thailand , singapore and even japan both vietnam and cambodia allow such transactions as a way to satisfy their people s appetite for consumer goods differences between the two countries become evident immediately after crossing the border the vegetation is lusher in cambodia scores of palm trees mark the cambodian side of the border for some reason , there are none to be seen on the vietnamese side the conical hats favored by vietnamese women give way to multicolored check scarves , elaborately tied on the heads of cambodian women there is much less traffic on the frenchbuilt road in cambodia a car can speed along at 35 miles an hour , compared with an average of only 25 miles an hour in vietnam pedestrians and all manner of vehicles immediately give way in response to a long , loud blast of the horn in cambodia such tactics are ineffective in cutting through the traffic snarls in vietnam many cambodian houses are built on stilts , near the rice paddies that line the road little boys ride water buffalo through the paddies oxen and cattle sleep under the houses at night the houses and straw huts have no source of electric power not far from the border is a site where local residents report that hundreds of vietnamese soldiers were killed by the khmer rouge , cambodia s fanatical communists , in the late 1970 s \( vietnam , for its part , says its invasion in december 1978 was justified as a response to numerous raids into its territory by pol pot s khmer rouge forces \) cambodian village militiamen armed with assault rifles are stationed at checkpoints along the road to phnom penh they rarely stop traffic , and when they do , they quickly allow free passage in return for a package of cigarettes or a small amount of money but motorists are delayed for half an hour by cambodian road workers making routine repairs on a small bridge among those who must mark time are two cambodian teenagers , a brother and sister , who explain that they are students of banking at a college in ho chi minh city they say they are returning to their home in phnom penh because their mother has just been shot to death , apparently by khmer rouge guerrillas , in battambang province near the border with thailand across the mekong river in another halfhour , the traveler reaches the mekong river , which is crossed by a ferry jammed with cambodians on either side of the river there is the helterskelter bustle of moneychangers , beggars and vendors selling sugar cane and rice cakes but farther on , a roadside restaurant offers more delicacies the unwritten menu includes coconut milk , turtle eggs , squab , doves and snakes , kept in cages with their mouths sewn shut so as not to alarm squeamish customers the road then follows the river into phnom penh , which seems eerily quiet as there is not enough traffic to fill the broad colonial streets and boulevards visitors know they have arrived at their destination when they see a landmark like none other on the journey from ho chi minh city cambodia s royal palace compound , where norodom sihanouk and other godkings once ruled the buildings have slender white columns , graceful spires and multilayered golden roofs that end in ornamental squiggles curling toward the sky photo in ho chi minh city , bicycles still outnumber cars on most streets , but on the road to phnom penh , the views get more primitive still \( nyt robert pear \)
americans in the besieged capital of kuwait spoke yesterday of a modern city transformed overnight into a war zone of rattling gunfire and explosions by iraqi invaders who seized government buildings , commandeered police cars and chatted on street corners as residents cowered behind locked doors while most telephone communications in and out of kuwait and iraq were cut off and only sketchy details of the fighting were available , an occasional call got through to a group of about two dozen americans trapped in a hotel in kuwait city in reports conveyed to the new york times through their employer on condition that they , their hotel and their multinational company not be identified for fear of jeopardizing their lives , the americans recalled the sudden onset of the fighting on thursday and two days of battle swirling around them marching troops at 2 am they told of being awakened at 2 am by the terrors of marching troops and rumbling tanks on broad avenues in the predawn darkness , of the roar of gunfire and explosions in the distance and of jet fighters screaming low over modern skyscrapers downtown yesterday , the americans , looking out over shuttered homes and glass skyscrapers saw bombs and artillery shells exploding near the center of the city in the morning later , they said the bursts of gunfire and explosions began to fade as the iraqi troops apparently consolidated their hold and the city fell under the eerie calm of a military occupation an aroundtheclock curfew was imposed , the americans said , and the normally bustling streets were deserted except for iraqi troop and tank movements businesses were closed radio and television broadcasting was shut down residents remained in their homes hotels stayed open for guests , who ventured out of their rooms only to dine in cafeterias on the premises or to meet and talk in the lobbies all primary government buildings , including the emir s damaged palace , were occupied by iraqi troops no known injuries none of the 3 , 000 to 4 , 000 americans who live and work in kuwait were known to have been injured in the invasion , though 14 american oil workers were reported captured and while iraqi troops took over the sheraton hotel as a military headquarters and entered other hotels to take food and supplies , the hotel housing the americans who answered questions for the times was not invaded or fired on nevertheless , for a few of those americans , the two days of exploding shells and small arms fire had taken a harsh emotional toll a couple of people broke down very briefly , a spokesman for the americans' employer said but they were nervous only when the gunfire was near there s some fear , no question about that , when you start hearing and seeing gunfire and artillery shells but they 're reasonably confident they 'll get out there was no way to tell how long it would take to get the americans out , the spokesman said , although plans for an evacuation were being made i'm sure the us will arrange to get us out , a trapped americans said in a conversation with his company i'm not worried about that i just want it to happen quickly unable to make calls out of kuwait , many of the americans passed messages through their employer to worried relatives in the united states most of them are just saying , 'i'm all right , do n't worry' , the spokesman said we 're looking at various evacuation contingencies for them , which must be kept secret the americans said that they had adequate food and water and that lights and air conditioning at the hotel were operating most of the time , though they said there were intermittent power failures most of the americans were older men , some with their wives , who had been working in kuwait for six months to a year , the spokesman said a few , including a man who was a diabetic , had medical needs that were being supplied by a pharmacy in the hotel , the spokesman said the americans , he said , reported seeing many tanks and military vehicles marked with a red triangle over a white circle that contained a unit number the insignias , they said , of iraq s most battletested frontline troops , the republican guards , who fought for years against iran while iraqi troops did not enter the americans' hotel , a group of invaders did go into the messila beach hotel , where a colleague was staying a group of iraqi troops went into that hotel , into the cafeteria , and sat down and had some dinner , the spokesman said they talked to the americans who were in that hotel it was all very friendly then they got up and walked out again other foreign nationals caught in the embattled city spoke to the associated press or reuters in bahrain and other nearby countries when a line to kuwait opened occasionally they , too , described scenes from the occupied city , told of panic buying by local residents as the invaders arrived early on thursday , and spoke of the strange sights of warfare in a modern metropolis , of their personal fears and the uncertainties of settling in for a siege panic buying grocery stores and gasoline stations , some of which remained open during the early hours of the invasion , saw long lines of panicbuyers , and many of those trapped in the city expressed concern yesterday that supplies might not last in downtown kuwait , which as late as 1954 was a mudwalled backwater that jutted into the persian gulf like a fist and had gates that opened onto an endless desert , the streets and skyscrapers were deserted and the normal flows of people , buses , taxis and cars were gone from spoklike roads leading to the modern suburbs at one usually busy intersection , an american said , iraqi troops with machine guns , mortars and rocketlaunchers stood about , chatting and eating at the nearby sheraton hotel , where guests had been abruptly evicted , scores of iraqi soldiers wandered in an out like so many tourists cars parked askew some streets were littered with private vehicles , parked askew , as if abandoned in haste and knocked about by tanks many curbs , sidewalks and lawns had been damaged by the hundreds of heavy military vehicles that entered kuwait while radio and television were shut down , a defiant lone voice continued broadcasting from a desert radio yesterday , calling for resistance and pleading for help how long will the world remain a spectator while peace is being slaughtered \? the voice of occupied kuwait demanded it was laden with sadness and desperation in its final hours in the name of god , the compassionate , the merciful this is your kuwait o arabs o brothers o beloved brothers o muslims your brothers in kuwait are appealing to you hurry to our aid but no help came , and at midafternoon , the voice in the

america s cup syndicates from the united states are reacting with cautious optimism to a new proposal asking them to share their basic technology for designing new boats science applications international corporation of san diego set the plan in motion this month by offering to invest 150 , 000 in the idea the company was instrumental in developing sophisticated technology for dennis conner s successful stars stripes campaign in 1987 to win back the america s cup from australia the science corporation has asked other companies and individuals to join the program , which it refers to as pact , partnership for america s cup technology the 1 million project would extend over a sixmonth period organizers plan a fundraising program to pay the costs the corporation would spearhead an effort to improve the computer software for designing new boats and creating a mechanism to predict their performance sponsorship concerns conner , who plans to lead a 1992 campaign for the america s cup , said last week in a telephone interview from san diego that the pact money would be well spent but he expressed concern that the pact budget might take away sponsorship money that might otherwise go to individual defense syndicates it has been difficult for american teams to raise money for a 1992 campaign the teams are waiting for the new york courts to determine , once and for all , who should be awarded the america s cup if the san diego yacht club is allowed to keep the contested trophy , the united states teams will race as defenders of the cup if the court awards the trophy to new zealand , american yachtsmen would have to compete as challengers the final hearing on the dispute is scheduled for feb 8 at the new york court of appeals in albany a written decision is expected at a later date yachting teams from other countries appear to have a head start on american efforts no matter which way the courts decide , the foreign sailing teams know they will race as challengers only new zealand is faced with the prospect of defending the cup that knowledge enables the others , particularly the european teams , to secure sponsorship , conner said nothing to sell time is something you can never buy , conner added they have their funding in place the americans do n't we do n't have anything to sell more than five groups from the united states are interested in starting a 1992 campaign for the america s cup but none are beyond the preliminary stages of forming design teams , which include the skeleton group put together so far by conner a decision last year to abandon the traditional 12meter yacht in favor of a new america s cup class for 1992 has become an equalizer for defenders and challengers but the european challengers are more organized than american yachtsmen two weeks ago , a group of 11 challengers banded together as the european america s cup class association the organization plans its first preamerica s cup race series in september to belong , a syndicate must have an america s cup yacht under construction , or a boat completed in one year the countries represented are italy , denmark , france , britain , scotland , spain , sweden , yugoslavia , finland , the soviet union and germany the group does not include japan , a nation with two cup syndicates and substantive sponsors john marshall , general manager for pact , says that it is in the best interest of the united states teams to share basic technology lacking in strength with none of the american syndicates showing much strength because of the litigation , this will be the kind of kickstart they need , marshall said last week i visualize this as something that will put into place the basic tools so that designers can go off and do their own work peter isler of san diego , an america s cup veteran who has formed his own cup syndicate for 1990 , said recently that he supported the pact plan at this point , the american effort needs all it can get , isler said it s good for everybody to stand in its way for competitive reasons does n't do anybody any good not everyone agrees chuck inglefield , chairman of the yankee syndicate of cleveland , has questions what happens to all that data afterward \? inglefield asked last week if this is something that will help all of the americans get out of the box on a level playing field , we 're all for it but at this point , it s a mystery to us

many investment managers , who oversee funds with billions of dollars of company shares , want more of a say in how american corporations are run and more of them are starting to use their financial muscle to try to obtain it the recent effort by several state pension funds to influence the selection process of a new chief executive at the general motors corporation is but one example of the new assertiveness of large investors increasingly , pension and mutual fund managers are challenging what they consider the inefficiency and wastefulness of many american corporations seats on the board sought while some are seeking better communication with directors , others want a seat on the board , either for themselves or for an appointed representative their stated aim to improve corporate performance and thus increase the value of their shareholdings we 're going to be as active as we can be , said roland m machold , who oversees new jersey s 28 billion in pension fund money for thousands of the state s employees institutional investors are becoming increasingly important in the marketplace because the funds under their control are growing sharply while individual investors are leaving in droves and as the investment funds hold everlarger portions of major american companies , they feel they face no alternative but to get more involved they cannot sell their holdings without taking big losses because the act of selling would drive down the value of the shares the trend toward investmentfund activism , should it gain momentum , would represent a significant shift in the balance of power in corporate governance , reducing the dominance of managers and giving greater influence to major shareholders the new activism differs markedly from earlier efforts in the past , public pension funds typically pushed ideological goals putting pressure on companies to withdraw from south africa , for example but this time , the fund managers are pursuing mainly a business agenda moreover , academics and financial executives observing this trend assert that the critical ingredients for waging a successful campaign appear to be falling into place the main ones include a nucleus of pension and mutual fund managers willing to abandon their traditional role as passive investors and take the lead in getting more involved in company policies encouragement in washington from members of the bush administration for their efforts , and , perhaps most important , increasing economic necessity 'an ownership culture' taken collectively , said robert a g monks , president of the institutional shareholders service inc , a washington proxyadvisory firm , these steps are the beginnings of the development of an ownership culture more aggressive owners could well pose a challenge to sleepy chief executives or those who treat their companies as personal fiefdoms to be sure , fund managers are not owners in the traditional sense they are fiduciaries , making investments on behalf of others , like employees or investors nevertheless , some of the country s leading institutional investors are exhibiting the kind of assertiveness associated with owners these are some of the examples the fund managers of new york and california have been successful in getting general motors management to discuss the criteria used to select and monitor the company s new chief executive california s public pension fund has asked the directors of ual , the parent company of united airlines , to investigate the company s decision to pay 58 million in investment banking fees for a failed managementled bid for the company other large investors , including the public pension fund of massachusetts , are supporting that effort two large moneymanagement companies , fidelity investments and the mutual shares corporation , have made changes in their investment policies to make it easier for them to join others in influencing managements and boards fidelity s general counsel , robert c pozen , says his fund managers also work behind the scenes with companies they are concerned about california s fund manager has submitted shareholder proposals to avon products , trw and occidental petroleum to establish shareholder advisory committees that would work closely with the boards of those companies california s pension fund has also written a letter to the securities and exchange commission seeking 48 regulatory changes that would facilitate communication among large shareholders and give shareholders a greater say fidelity has expressed its support for such an effort others ready to move clearly , efforts to date have been concentrated in a handful of public funds , like california s but other fund managers said that did not reflect a lack of interest on their part , but rather a calculated decision to push the betterorganized funds to the forefront we 've basically said , 'you guys take the lead , and we 'll join you where it s appropriate , ' said paul f quirk , who oversees the massachusetts public pension fund system
a 28yearold manhattan security guard arrested in the dormitoryroom rape of a freshman over the weekend worked for columbia university for months despite a police record including convictions for

after being treated for superficial wounds , the police said the 17yearold victim was cut on her arms and hands but not seriously injured , they said for university officials , the rape underscored the problems of loose hiring practices among many of the private security companies that institutions like columbia depend on for protection psychological impact for students and others at columbia , it also heightened the sense of vulnerability on a campus that has long grappled with its status as an academic sanctuary within blocks of tough manhattan neighborhoods it has made a big impact psychologically , said nina perales , a thirdyear law student we sit around here talking about security and how people are always getting mugged , she said at the columbia college women s center , where she is program director everyone feels more afraid when they can no longer say it was a stranger it was familiarity , the authorities said , that gave mr darby passage into mcbain hall , a student dormitory at 562 west 113th street mr darby , who had recently worked in the dormitory for a few weeks checking visitors' identification , was said to have entered the hall on the morning of the rape with two student acquaintances university officials said that minutes before he surprised the victim at knifepoint by entering her unlocked door , he identified himself to a suspicious dormitory supervisor and said he was making a security check he was able to enter and leave 20 minutes later without signing in , they said , because the guard at the door knew him the guard has since been reassigned a police spokesman , officer anthony mazzola , said mr darby s record included guilty pleas on three misdemeanors gambling and promoting gambling in june 1983 and impersonating a police officer in february and april of 1988 no time served in prison in none of the instances did mr darby serve time in prison charges of possession of an illegal weapon and stolen credit cards were dropped in september 1982 , and other charges of disorderly conduct and harassment were dropped in a pleabargaining agreement in the february 1988 case the april 1988 felony charge was similarly reduced in return for mr darby s guilty plea , officer mazzola said dominick a moro , columbia s security director , said the university had little choice but to depend on its private contractors and a slow state records system for information about the backgrounds of guards hired from outside security companies normally , the background checks take three to six months but he said that as long as new officers swear that they have never been convicted of a crime , they routinely go right on duty , pending a state fingerprint check that might show them to have lied university officials said mr darby was hired in late september work in dormitories summit security services in elmhurst , queens , provides most of the 60 contract officers who augment columbia s 100member police force working exclusively as dormitory guards , they earn about half the 11 hourly average paid to campus police officers a man who answered the telephone at summit said company officials would be unreachable until today university officials defended their oncampus security record mr moro said the rape was the first such attack reported since a female student was stabbed in an attempted rape in 1985 a graduate student was raped in a columbiaowned apartment on 121st street early last december leaflets and fliers but their view was questioned by students interviewed yesterday leaflets from mr moro s office alerting students to a sexual assault were answered over the weekend by studentwritten fliers headlined , what the security alert did n't say similar messages stressing that the attack had been a rape were distributed to phone answering machines through a new campus telephonemail system cydnee a blattner , a columbia college senior who helped write the messages , argued along with a number of other students that university officials' efforts to depict the campus as safe kept them from adequately publicizing the crimes that did occur i 've come up against a lot of secrecy and a lot of effort to avoid publicity about crime that happens on or around the campus , she said columbia has a responsibility to let people know if they know , they can make intelligent decisions about what to do photo the arrest on rape charges over the weekend of a security guard who worked for columbia university has heightened the sense of vulnerability on the campus everyone feels more afraid when they can no longer say it was a stranger , said nina perales , right , sitting next to sara j wassarman in the columbia college women s center \( the new york times ruby washington \) \( pg b2 \)
minutes after the new yorknew york series began , chris nilan , the chief intimidator for the rangers , skated toward pat lafontaine , the chief scoring threat for the islanders , and punched him in the head on the ice at madison square garden minutes after the series ended , ken baumgartner , the chief intimidator for the islanders , walked up to bernie nicholls , the chief scoring threat for the rangers , and shook his hand in a garden hallway between those scenes , the teams played five games , and the islanders lost four of them they lost lafontaine for three games with a concussion \( when james patrick checked him , legally \) they lost jeff norton for one game with another concussion \( when troy mallette checked him , illegally \) and they lost the respect of even the tolerant hockey establishment when they started a brawl of vengeance after game 1 emotions run high they lost games they might have won , because of unnecessary penalties and uneven goaltending and the lack of a finishing touch around the ranger net the series sparked bitter words after some injuries , and plenty of sound and fury from the fans and the news media who warmed to the citysuburban competition the islanders lost twice by just one goal , but lost four games , just the same , and today they are on their various ways home now that the rangers are moving on to the next round of the stanley cup playoffs , the islanders must contemplate what they learned in their first return to playoff competition since 1988 our goal was to make the playoffs , and we barely snuck in , said coach al arbour , alluding to how the team qualified after its last game of the regular season i'm not satisfied we cannot stand pat we have to do a little bit of surgery trottier concedes frustration arbour sent a major hint about that surgery when he benched bryan trottier , alan kerr and derek king for the final game trottier , a center , a future hall of famer and the only current member of the team to have played on all four stanley cup championship teams in 198083 , finished his 15th season with 13 goals and 11 assists in his four playoff games , he had one goal it s pretty disappointing , trottier said of the benching it s frustrating when you ca n't participate in the playoffs , but he stopped speaking as his voice cracked and his eyes grew moist the series exposed several islander weaknesses that had been lurking in the relative shadows of the regular season trottier , a center who sometimes plays left wing , tries his best , but has little left in his fuel tank the islanders have scant scoring power from the wings of their forward lines on the left side , david volek had one goal in five games , don maloney had no goals in five games , and king had none in four on right wing patrick flatley scored thrice and randy wood once kerr was 0 for 4 the islanders are a centeroriented team , with lafontaine , brent sutter and hubie mcdonough quite capable of filling the net with pucks but none of these three are classic setup artists players who make linemates more productive by feeding them fat passes the islanders need this sort of player to bring more production from the flanks a vow to return on defense , the series underlined the importance of norton , who had one goal and three assists and quarterbacked the team on the power play when he was n't sidelined with injury we 'll be back , norton said after game 5 we learned never to give up it gave a lot of us a taste of the playoffs other defensemen , including veterans like doug crossman , gerald diduck and gary nylund , gave honest effort , but were unable to keep ranger forwards from cruising the goal crease and putting themselves in position for deflections traffic like this made life difficult for the goalies , mark fitzpatrick and glenn healy , who achieved mixed results when sharing the starting role and replacing each other during games when things got out of hand important acquisition the wild card is baumgartner , acquired in a trade with los angeles in late november he swung between the defensive and forward lines and played with an unusual mixture of abandon and restraint although he was suspended for one game for the brawl in the opener , he avoided fighting penalties for the rest of the series when he was in , the rangers had to skate with their heads up sutter , the captain , just missed sending game 5 into overtime when his shot sailed wide of the goal post in the final seconds he played the latter part of the series with a shoulder injury he refused to use as an excuse you ca n't accept losing , sutter said after the final game you ca n't be happy just getting in the playoffs

taken in , for example , frozen and starving , by a family in the midst of a happy christmas banquet of goose and plum pudding , john soon finds himself hustled by these people \( his relatives \) into a sadistic lunatic asylum and there tossed into a maggoty cell with his father , chained up as a mad murderer since john s birth over and over , john endures stomping by the heavyfooted irony of a fate so inexorable that readers are likely to go numb or start idly wondering if they are reading either a political satire on the miseries of mrs thatcher s england or the longest deadpan literary joke in print for mr palliser appears to have set out not merely to write a dickens novel but to write all dickens novels we meet the strange young girl in a great crumbling estate , the floating prison hulks and mysterious legacy of great expectations the debtors' prison and suppressed codicil of little dorrit the heir s convoluted name change and presumed death by drowning of our mutual friend the loathsome fatherson business team and the vast realestate development scam of martin chuzzlewit the stormy night , carriage chase and foiled elopement of the pickwick papers the pauper child of secret parentage kidnapped by a gang of thieves of oliver twist in addition , mr palliser seems to be deliberately trying to outdo dickens in replays of specific scenes in the sadistic boarding school in the quincunx , children pull plows and fight savagely for cold potatoes at a trough whereas nicholas nickleby stops squeers' beating of the crippled smike , when john tries to stop the evil master quigg from whipping the crippled stephen , he is knocked unconscious and his friend lashed to death so , throughout the quincunx , evil plods from triumph to triumph and finally ends as a sad story of defeated will its plot pounds its characters flat here even evil lacks the life dickens gave his outrageous curmudgeons , humbugs and hypocrites mr palliser delights in no pecksniff , no heep , no pompous pumblechook or imperturbable jingle there is no micawber still , so starved are today s readers by a minimalist diet that insists fiction can never be too spare or too thin and so rich in contrast is even imitation dickens that the quincunx is propelled by the power of its prototype you read the first page and down you wonderfully fall , into a long , large , wide , full world of fiction drawing
gov mario m cuomo of new york is defying the odds against incumbents this year because \( a \) republicans miscalculated by presuming that he was invulnerable \( b \) even after serving for 15 years in state government , he manages to be regarded as a political outsider \( c \) the antiincumbent tide may be greatly exaggerated \( d \) all of the above the correct answer is \( d \) with election day less than three weeks away , almost nobody realistically doubts that mr cuomo will win a third term in sharp contrast to three other democratic governors from the northeast who chose not to run again and at least two republicans who are considered vulnerable about all that is left to ponder is whether mr cuomo s victory margin will hit a record high and whether voter turnout will plummet to a record low , and why the gop s misjudgment mr cuomo had raised 7 million by last spring , and potential challengers were duly intimidated but they either failed to detect , or felt unequipped to capitalize on , two trends detected in some publicopinion polls while the governor was still personally popular , fewer people were impressed with his performance moreover , many new yorkers said they were dissatisfied with the direction in which they thought the state was going a wellfinanced , articulate challenger who offered a convincing rationale for his candidacy could have given mr cuomo a run for his money none of those qualities seemed to apply to pierre a rinfret , the republicans' nominee of last resort that no more credible candidate could be enlisted also reflects the decline of political parties , which no longer can absorb campaign debts or bruised egos republicans have been deprived of an opportunity to deflate the presidential trial balloons that are sent up periodically on mr cuomo s behalf he has been denied the chance to hone his skills for a more challenging national campaign the odd man in mr cuomo served in albany as secretary of state and then lieutenant governor before being elected governor in 1982 , but he has largely avoided the curse of incumbency mario never had the personality of an incumbent , said david garth , the media strategist he always has someone to be in moral conflict with the mayor , the legislature , the president as a result , it always looks like he s an outsider he has also often been on the cutting edge of issues , saying that new york s problems are not unique and that many stem from federal abdications mario has always sounded the antiwashington , anticonventionalwisdom alarm , said robert d squier , a political consultant to dr john k silber , the boston university president , whose victory in last month s democratic primary for governor of massachusetts was viewed as evidence that voters crave a fresh approach william mulrow , an official of mr cuomo s campaign , analyzed dr silber s platform and said that although his politically unconventional views sound fresh , most of what he proposes has already been tried or accomplished in the past eight years in new york state the mixed blessing of incumbency many voters are incensed about being taxed more for benefits that they never seem to reap but newness alone in a challenger is not enough among statewide incumbents , only comptroller edward v regan , the lone republican , appears to be vulnerable in a period of economic uncertainty , mr rinfret has helped define his own race as one between an erratic newcomer and an experienced political tactician this is a time of uncertainty , confusion , even occasional moments of chaos , mr cuomo said people want strength mentioning presiden bush and mayor david n dinkins in the same breath , he said , there is a sense in the people that government is not being clear , decisive and giving effective leadership weaknesses the media seizes upon dinkins s 'ambivalence' they love to charge you with ambivalence , mr cuomo said bush \? look what they 're doing to bush flipflop this is a very important characteristic not being able to make the decision that s what the people see and that is what the media is playing up and i understand it rather than capping the number of terms an official can serve , mr cuomo would reduce the edge of officeholders by publicly financing campaigns but the twoterm governor dismisses the notion that incumbency is now a fatal liability we see two dots , we draw one line and we think we have a rhombus , said mr cuomo , whose oblique angles comprise a candidacy that may not always seem to be politically symmetrical but is in surprisingly good shape
defending the honor of his sullied team , dave stewart said we won 103 games during the season we did n't win in the world series does that make us a smut ball club \? it just means the other team beat us in four games in the immediate aftermath of the cincinnati reds' stunning victory over the oakland athletics , stewart was having difficulty reconciling the fourgame humiliation with his team s dominance of the american league during the season on the surface , it was n't easy to understand why the team generally recognized as the best in baseball should be embarrassed for the second time in three years in the ultimate series but the reasons are there , not so far from the surface that they ca n't be seen underachievers as good as the athletics are , they did n't play up to their abilities while the reds , as they did in beating pittsburgh in the national league playoff , played about as perfectly as a team could in a short series they had the perfect kind of team to win a short series , syd thrift , former general manager of the pirates and the yankees , said they had speed , defense and a bullpen of all the great players there were supposed to be , the reds' relievers were the only ones who showed it the athletics' great players did not show it stewart , winner of 20 games for four successive seasons and a dominant postseason pitcher as well , lost two games , suffering a legitimate beating in the first game and succumbing to a late reds rally in the fourth when he had only one run to work with dennis eckersley , considered the best lateinning relief pitcher , gave up the gamedeciding run in the 10th inning of the second game , duplicating his pivotal firstgame loss in the 1988 world series the athletics scored only eight runs in the four games , none after the third inning in any game jose canseco , hampered by injuries , had 1 hit in 12 times at bat \( 083 \) , mark mcgwire 3 in 14 \( 214 \) , dave henderson 3 in 13 \( 231 \) , willie mcgee 2 in 10 \( 200 \) as a team , the athletics batted 207 and left 30 runners on base the a s did not execute key plays defensively canseco failed to catch billy hatcher s fly ball that went for a triple and led to the tying run in the second game mcgwire s error on a ground ball preceded six unearned runs in the third game stewart s errant throw on a sacrifice bunt contributed to his and his team s demise in the fourth game randolph sums it up we just got outplayed , willie randolph said , offering a more realistic view than stewart we know who we are we know we 're human we know we can be beat no one on this team believes what they read or hear we got outplayed we did n't do much on execution and they did the reds , their manager , lou piniella , said , played four excellent games in the pennant playoff against the pirates , remember , the reds made a bunch of brilliant defensive plays , their relief corps stifled the pirates and they had a succession of big hits , as well as having two big hitters , paul o'neill and hal morris in the world series , they continued their bigtime play jose rijo allowed one run and nine hits in 15 1 3 innings in winning the first and final games their relief corps gave up no runs in 13 innings , giving them a postseason record of one earned run in 31 1 3 innings \( and none in the last 30 \) they had two hitters , chris sabo and billy hatcher , who consistently produced critical hits sabo batted 563 and hit two home runs billy hatcher batted 750 and rapped five extrabase hits this club played four excellent games , piniella said we won because we outplayed them the reds played much like the chicago white sox performed against the athletics during the season , when they won 8 of 13 games does that mean any team that adapts its style of play to that employed by the reds and the white sox can knock over the athletics next season \? no , because the necessary ingredients do not come readymade the reds did show that good pitching can make it difficult for the athletics to win unless they themselves get outstanding pitching we do n't blow people out , jamie quirk said we 're not a 92 or 72 club we 're a fourrun team why no offense \? but they were n't even that against the reds did the oakland hitters experience a collective slump or did the reds' pitchers pitch that well \? did the hitters , for some reason , quit after the reds took early leads \? all i can go by is the guys' approach at bat , randolph said , responding to the question from his veteran s perspective everyone was ready for their atbats if you just go up and go through the motions , that s one thing if i felt our hitters were n't bearing down and not getting good atbats , i 'd say it was our hitters but that was n't the case they went up and battled in other words , the socalled best team in baseball was n't good enough and they will not be remembered as the best team in 1990 , despite what stewart says the athletics of 198890 , in fact , can be remembered in the context of the last team to win three consecutive pennants but only one world series the baltimore orioles of 196971 the orioles won a total of 318 games in that span and they beat cincinnati in the 1970 world series but they lost stunningly to the mets the year before and they lost to the pirates the year after no one remembers those orioles as the best team in baseball during that time nor were they elevated to dynastic heights to be considered the best , the a s will have to gain the ultimate four victories of the year
washington , feb 6 a chemist for the food and drug administration today accused the agency of deliberately stalling the development and use of tests to determine whether milk is contaminated with possibly hazardous antibiotics the chemist , dr joseph settepani , said in a hearing before the subcommittee on human resources of the house committee on government operations that at the agency public relations damage control took priority over public health initiatives whose necessity has become increasingly obvious he said the agency wanted to avoid angering the dairy industry or reaping bad publicity for itself antibiotics are not permitted in milk , but some tests of samples taken in the last two years have detected an array of antibiotics , presumably because farmers use them illegally or fail to clear permitted antibiotics from a sick cow before taking milk antibiotics can cause allergies in people , and widespread use could help contribute to the development of more resistant strains the organism is supposed to fight in the most recent results , announced on monday , the fda said that its most reliable test had found no residues of one antibiotic , sulfamethazine , in a nationwide survey of milk but the agency said other tests had found some residues dr settepani , who helped devise some of the tests , called the fda s announcement irresponsible because it ignored reliable tests and relied instead on the results of what he called an unproven test it is misleading at best to take any results seriously until the bugs have been worked out of the new procedure , he said he said the agency had steadfastly refused to support the development , evaluation , or use of tests that would spot the drugs dr settepani said the agency has repeatedly and unfairly sought to discredit one test , charm ii , which detects a broad array of sulfa drugs representative ted weiss , the manhattan democrat who serves as chairman of the subcommittee , said he had obtained an internal memorandum written by dr george mitchell , associate director for surveillance and compliance at the agency , to dr gerald b guest , director of the agency s center for veterinary medicine 'avoid criticism of hhs dr mitchell wrote of the tainted milk issue , the hhs goals are to end media interest in drugresidue tainted milk as soon as possible and avoid criticism of hhs or any other government agency after today s hearing , dr guest said of the memorandum i do n't know where those ideas came from i think he overspoke and is probably sorry he did he said he did not feel the agency officials were too soft on the milk industry attempts to reach dr mitchell were unsuccessful , but the fda said dr guest spoke for the agency dr guest acknowledged that the agency needed to do more to test for residues , including at least a dozen more antibiotics and other chemicals that are not being checked he said that more milk samples were being tested and that in the next six to eight years more tests will be developed beginning in december , the agency took 70 samples of milk from store shelves in 14 cities the first round of tests , done with the charm ii , showed 36 had antibiotic residues the test can detect levels down to 5 parts per billion and can identify many antibiotic contaminants the level at which the fda considers taking action to destroy the milk is 10 parts per billion a second test done on the 70 samples showed 12 that were contaminated with levels from 20 to 300 parts per billion the fda then did a third test , mass spectrometry , and found that none of the samples were contaminated the third test cannot detect levels below 20 to 30 parts per billion and can detect only the antibiotic being sought , fda documents showed dr michael jacobson of the center for science in the public interest , a nonprofit nutrition group in washington , said , after initially finding residues using a very sensitive test , then they used a less sensitive test and said they could n't detect the residues and therefore they 're not there that s wrong

london it was alec mccowen s 64th birthday there were bluebells in the woods near chichester , where he was playing the tyrannical father in a stage adaptation of henry james s washington square so he did what any other sensitive person would have done under the circumstances he went for a contemplative walk there i was in this lovely place , he recalls , and suddenly , without realizing it , i found myself reciting bits of st mark s gospel it was then i realized i had to do it again that was on may 26 , 1989 , five years after mr mccowen had decided quietly to retire the solo performance that had won him international applause he had after all played it in the west end and on broadway , to students at princeton university , to invited guests at jimmy carter s white house and to no less than 400 bishops at an anglican conference and that seemed to him more than enough biblical recitation for one lifetime yet here he is again , opening at the lambs theater on wednesday with all 16 chapters of what scholars agree to be the first and most authentic biography of jesus the gospel of st mark it was back in 1976 that mr mccowen began to wonder if a oneman show might somehow be extracted from the bible charles laughton had achieved considerable success in the 1930 s with excerpts that included the story of nebuchadnezzar and the fiery furnace and no one seemed to have followed his lead but mr mccowen could find nothing he thought the right length in the old testament , and ended up wondering if it would n't anyway be more interesting to tackle the new if you are a christian you hear excerpts from the gospel in church , but people never seem to read any of them all the way through perhaps i could provide that , like a talking book but john struck mr mccowen as too mysterious for the theater , matthew as too didactic and luke as too poetic for an actor with his feisty style it was in some despair that he turned to mark , whom he remembered as the weakest of the four i started learning little passages to see if it would come alive , and instantly realized it was absolutely right the style had a blunt , astringent quality which suited me and it was a gospel of action not teaching , one which had plenty of episodes and dwelt on none for too long while he played the lead in peter shaffer s equus in new york and toured britain as shakepeare s antony , mr mccowen learned st mark , three verses early each morning for 16 months but without much belief in the project s ultimate success when mr mccowen finally summoned up the pluck to deliver the gospel to four friends , they disconcerted him by going into a huddle afterward and discussing jesus s character , oblivious of his presence do you think it will work \? he asked well , of course , they replied impatiently , and continued their debate as he later realized , their reaction was actually a compliment and when in 1978 he gave his first public performance of st mark s gospel for a nervous management in the northern city of newcastle , there was definitive proof of the gospel s power to arrest and intrigue the key moment came when a little old lady seized him after he had finished one evening and said with open astonishment what critics and audiences were soon to be repeating all over england and america it was as good as a play it was not of course the first time mr mccowen has made a text look and sound good in his native britain he has a name to compare with derek jacobi and ian mckellen , if not quite with john gielgud and alec guinness during a career now spanning almost 50 years , he has appeared at prestigious addresses in roles ranging from the troubled psychiatrist in equus to malvolio in twelfth night , from the ascerbic alceste in moliere s misanthrope to shaw s professor higgins , accumulating several major awards and a reputation for energy and punch combined with sensitivity and wit as he notes with a grin , his credits also include a jesuit priest in rolf hochhuth s representative , a cardinal in the agony and the ecstasy , a pope in peter luke s hadrian vii and a man who thought he was god in john bowen s play 'after the rain' religion and the religious have always interested him , but that does not mean he brings any formal faith or conventional beliefs to st mark s gospel though his family was congregationalist , his religious upbringing was actually somewhat confusing his grandfather was a lay preacher , frightening in the intensity of his piety but his father took a more casual view of the christian messiah , talking of him as if he were a member of the family dear , dear , where s jesus now \? he would ask if someone broke a plate jesus at his best , he would exclaim with satisfaction if he saw a flower he liked perhaps it is n't surprising that his son now belongs to no church or denomination , preferring , as he says , to go for a walk in the open air if i feel the need to give thanks or ask for help or communicate with god
it is impossible to say anything discouraging about eastern echo unbeaten in three starts including the futurity stakes at belmont last saturday , the colt has an impeccable pedigree \( by damascus and the northern dancer mare glowing tribute \) , a superior trainer in mackenzie miller , and a style that says he will get better with age and distance on the other hand , it is possible to say too much , as some have started doing any comparison between eastern echo and the best 2yearolds of recent years is premature at best the race that eastern echo ran last saturday would not have been good enough to win many recent futurities he ran seven furlongs in 1 2257 , but did it over an absurdly quick track surface half an hour later , dispersal ran the secondfastest nine furlongs in racing history , requiring just 1 4591 to win the woodward handicap eastern echo has yet to run as well as last year s leading 2yearolds at this stage , such as summer squall or adjudicating , much less within five lengths of a devil s bag or easy goer he is a solid colt , not a brilliant one solidity often beats brilliance in the long run , and eastern echo has every right to develop into a great colt , but he is not there yet and he could be ripe for beating later this fall remember summer squall \? summer squall , the forgotten colt of this racing season , will make the second start of his fall campaign sunday when he faces unbridled in the super derby at louisiana downs summer squall beat unbridled while winning the blue grass and the preakness , and unbridled beat him in the kentucky derby summer squall may be the slightly better colt , but the distance of a mile and a quarter in the super derby is in unbridled s favor as many as eight others may challenge them both , including restless con and cee s tizzy , but none appear in the same class as the favorites if summer squall wins , he will dispose of unbridled as a rival for the 3yearold championship , but may still have to come to new york and win again to unseat housebuster for that title housebuster has yet to run beyond a mile , but he has won nine stakes races this year to summer squall s four , and beat summer squall the only time they met , in the sevenfurlong swale stakes on march 17 unbridled and summer squall will both be racing with lasix , which they would not be permitted to use in the breeders' cup classic at belmont on oct 27 unbridled will try the race anyway , but summer squall s handlers have yet to decide prominent roles two grade i races at belmont this weekend will feature prominent candidates for other breeders' cup races the ruffian handicap tomorrow will mark the return to new york of gorgeous , who has not raced here since losing the mother goose stakes by a head to open mind last summer gorgeous , who then beat open mind while running second to bayakoa in last year s breeders' cup distaff , will carry top weight of 126 pounds and should be oddson going a mile and an eighth against bold wench \( 117 \) , mistaurian \( 115 \) , personal business \( 113 \) , she can \( 113 \) , warfie \( 112 \) , dreamy mimi \( 112 \) , quick mischief \( 111 \) , lady hoolihan \( 110 \) and roberto s hope \( 109 \) gorgeous is prepping for a rematch against bayakoa in this year s distaff , and both of them will have to contend with the 3yearold star go for wand in that race the man o' war on the grass sunday may come up a soft spot for with approval , who is coming off a secondplace finish to golden pheasant in the arlington million on sept 2 with approval , who won the canadian triple crown last year , won the tidal and the bowling green handicaps at belmont earlier this summer headaches and contests the pegasus handicap tonight for 3yearolds at the meadowlands is a grade i race with a grade ii field that should give handicappers a grade iii headache the top weight at 119 pounds is silver ending , who won the arkansas derby on april 21 but has lost his last four starts next in the weights at 116 are chief honcho , who was trounced in the molson million but gets lasix tonight for the first time , and music prospector , who has lost seven in a row pleasant tap , who carries 115 , will be making his first start since running third in the kentucky derby on may 5 the track is running a contest offering a 1 million prize to any fan who can pick all 10 winners on tonight s card , which includes six 12horse fields the advertisements do not note that the odds of doing so with the single entry ticket handed out at the gates are 28 , 665 , 446 , 4001
the publicly traded shares of three major mutual fund companies have been tumbling in recent weeks , as investors reacted to the fear that credit problems in the commercial paper market could affect the companies' immensely popular money market mutual funds t rowe price , whose shares traded around 30 each at the end of march , closed yesterday at 24375 similarly , alliance capital ended yesterday at 15625 , off from roughly 17 three weeks ago and dreyfus , which traded at 36 at the end of march , closed at 32125 yesterday behind the selloff is the bankruptcy on april 12 of mortgage and realty trust , affecting 150 million in outstanding commercial paper half of that paper was owned by a number of money market funds , including those sponsored by t rowe price and alliance in each case , the parent companies of the affected funds bought back the defaulted paper that made the funds whole and prevented any losses to money market investors while the default is not large within the vast 540 billion commercial paper market , it has hit a nerve in the mutual fund industry because it underscores what had previously been largely ignored by investors that money market funds , while considered very safe , are not totally riskfree there is an ageold view , said a michael lipper , president of lipper analytic services , that risk and reward are correlated the reason that these funds pay you a return that is higher than the bank rate is that you 're taking some risk federal regulators , too , have emphasized that investors need to be aware that money market investments are not guaranteed and riskfree in the aftermath of a default last fall by integrated resources , the securities and exchange commission began talking with mutual fund industry executives about the need to diversify their holdings and keep the average maturity of their funds short one indication of the level of the mutual fund industry s concern is that the sponsors of every fund affected by recent commercial paper defaults have stepped in to protect investors while such response cannot be guaranteed in the future , robert pozen , general counsel and managing director of fidelity investments in boston , echoed a common industry response when he said that fidelity would make every possible effort to insure that its money fund investors were protected from any default losses the industry s protective response is even more remarkable given most analysts' worstcase estimate that the losses the affected money funds were facing would have reduced yields to investors by only about 1 percentage point , shaving perhaps a penny off the traditional 1ashare asset value people have always viewed these funds as riskless , an industry analyst said , and the fund managers now are willing to take on the credit exposure that their money market funds have incurred so they can continue to keep that perception around is the perception valid \? obviously , money market funds are not insulated from any market risk , mr lipper said we spent a decade leveraging the society , and as we unleverage , there will be accidents , he said i do n't think they will be too great , and i think the industry can handle it but if people are concerned , they should diversify into a number of different money market funds , or focus on funds that invest only in us government securities so far , investors do not seem to be manifesting any serious concern , although taxpaying season typically produces a flow of cash out of money market funds a survey of big fund sponsors and various money market monitors yesterday showed little sign that investors are shifting funds out of taxable money market funds but in contrast to mutual fund investors , stock market players are reacting some analysts say overreacting to the possibility that the money management firms' willingness to bail out their money market funds may hurt shareholder profits in the future as evidence of panic , one analyst noted that dreyfus s shares have been battered even though none of its money market funds were affected by the recent default i think it s overdone , mr machmany said given the earnings power these companies have , the actual amount of defaults that could occur just wo n't be that substantial these stocks have gone down many times what the actual earnings impact could be
albany , oct 4 the section on environmental protection in gov mario m cuomo s first state of the state message , in 1983 , was barely a page long and included proposals to modernize fish hatcheries and build more boat launches this year , that section ran 12 pages and featured one of the prime initiatives of the governor s agenda , a 2 billion environmental bond act , the largest in the state s history in speech after speech since then , mr cuomo has championed the preservation of new york s open spaces for future generations , sometimes describing it as the ultimate selfless act the environment has clearly come to occupy a greater share of both mr cuomo s oratory and his legislative program even his critics , while questioning whether this emphasis is derived from political astuteness , commitment to environmental principles or a combination of both , credit the governor with several important environmental accomplishments among these are tougher limits on auto emissions and stricter enforcement of waterquality standards and acidrain controls that have reduced new york s sulfur dioxide emissions by almost half nevertheless , many of the state s environmental problems remain formidable , if not intractable , despite major steps mr cuomo announced to deal with them as the governor campaigns for a third term , the record on major parts of his environmental policy appears to best be judged as incomplete cuomo administration officials say that many of the initiatives begun by the governor will require years of lead time to work , and that other problems are due to factors including the behavior of a society that wastes too much and drives too much beyond his control some environmental leaders , however , question whether the governor has backed up his initiatives with adequate resources or with sufficient urgency in 1987 , for instance , mr cuomo announced with great fanfare that the state would set the ambitious goal of cutting its solidwaste stream in half by 1997 , largely through recycling and wastereduction efforts in subsequent years , his proposals to finance recycling through special collections like unclaimed nickels from returnable bottles died in the legislature , and general spending on local recycling programs averaged about 20 million annually , onetenth of the figure obligated to incinerator projects 21 million tons of trash the bond act on the ballot this fall includes 300 million for recycling over the next several years but today , three years after the original goal was set , the state s waste generation continues to increase new yorkers generated 21 million tons of trash last year compared to 18 million tons in 1987 in 1986 , mr cuomo pushed through a 12 billion bond issue for a state superfund to clean up toxicwaste sites of the 700 designated sites , about 100 have been fully cleaned up state officials contend they are on track to have the bulk of sites finished by the year 2000 while this record outstrips that of similar funds run by other states and by the federal government , some environmental advocates say new york has simply tackled the least contaminated sites first none of the five major landfill sites in new york city have been cleaned up and that the program is plagued by unnecessary delays on many other issues like aids , health care and housing , critics of mr cuomo s record often seem chiefly concerned with getting him to devote more resources to a problem many environmentalists , however , seem at least as concerned with what they see as the governor s inability to establish a vision of the environment that could motivate ordinary new yorkers to act one problem that calls for such moral suasion , they say , is air pollution mr cuomo and the department of environmental conservation have drawn praise for setting tougher standards on car emissions and mileage , but to a large degree these gains have been offset by increased use of the automobile in the new york metropolitan region , the total number of miles traveled by automobile in the region has risen by almost 20 percent over the last decade , while ridership on subways , buses and commuter railroads is up about 5 percent some trash recycling on recycling , three years after announcing his program , new york still recycles about 10 percent of its trash , slightly above the national average but barely half the figure achieved in neighboring new jersey some environmentalists , even those who generally support mr cuomo , say he may be reluctant to press the issue because the message may not be popular one of the things that appeals to him is finding the moral high ground , and on many environmental issues there s a bad guy , a company or some toxic polluter , said francis beinecke , a director of the natural resources defense council who serves on a panel of environmental advisers to mr cuomo but with solid waste , the bad guys are every single one of us , she said you have to say to people , 'change your life style' i'm not sure the governor is prepared to do that encouraging behavior change
cigarette smoking has emerged as a powerful influence in the development of cervical cancer as well as distorted cells that are precursors of malignancy , researchers say these distorted cells , which can be detected in pap tests , frequently evolve into a serious cancer if left untreated in a new study at the montefiore medical center in the bronx , of 60 women who had advanced cervical cancer , 85 percent were smokers there also was evidence to suggest that the remainder had significant exposure to passive smoking , generally through spouses who smoked studies in the last five years had pointed to a connection , but none had shown such a strong effect cervical cancer and abnormal pap tests are clearly related to smoking and that deserves major headlines , dr carolyn d runowicz , who wrote the study , said yesterday in a telephone interview dr runowicz , director of the division of gynecologic oncology at montefiore , presented the study at a meeting last month of the european society of therapeutic and radiation oncology fighting a certain image risks that have been previously identified include having intercourse at an early age , multiple sexual partners and infection with the human papilloma virus , a sexually transmitted disease that usually produces no symptoms the only group of women who do not seem to get cervical cancer is nuns in old movies you see lauren bacall drawing on a cigarette in bed after sex , looking glamorous and sophisticated , dr runowicz said that s the image i'm fighting if you 're going to have sexual intercourse , not only should you use condoms but also you should n't light up there are 13 , 500 cases of cervical cancer and 6 , 000 deaths from the disease every year , according to the american cancer society each year 12 million women have abnormal pap tests , which show the distorted cells , or dysplasia they might not if they did n't smoke , dr runowicz said she counsels women with abnormal pap tests to stop smoking in the hopes of slowing the progression of dysplasia before it becomes cancer scientists are not sure how smoking increases a woman s risk some experts theorize that nicotine may have a predilection for the type of cells , squamous , that cover both the lungs and the cervix others feel that smoking may be a mild suppressant of immune function , allowing human papilloma virus infections to fester such infections are known to promote abnormal pap tests the cancer is preventable experts emphasize that cervical cancer is theoretically preventable , since it usually develops slowly over years from areas of dysplasia the presence of dysplasia is identified through a routine pap test and the precancerous regions can be destroyed in a doctor s office by laser surgery or by freezing the area occasionally , more extensive surgery is advised marilyn quayle , for instance , had a hysterectomy in july for severe precancerous abnormalities of the cervix although abnormal pap smears and cervical cancer affect all age groups , it is far more common among poor women , who often cannot afford screening and who are more likely to smoke dr runowicz said that while the smoking rate among men had declined significantly in the last decane , the percentage of women who smoke has declined only slightly cigarettes have already been implicated in lung cancer as well as head , neck and bladder cancer

the walls in jay kriegel s office are busy with artwork none of it is expensive instead , there are childhood drawings by his son , conor , 10 his daughter , isabel , 12 , and by the younger jay himself the drawings , which many would consider more appropriate on a kitchen refrigerator than in a highpowered corporate office , are representative of the hyperaggressively informal style that mr kriegel has fostered at cbs with the running shoes and cbs caps he persistently wears , and his penchant for bluntness , the senior vice president is helping to eradicate whatever remained of the polished , gray , buttoneddown image of the cbs executive there s a different tone to this place , mr kriegel says proudly much looser , much more informal this place had a lot of duchies and fiefdoms it was terribly hierarchical , and also terribly compartmentalized the new senior cbs executives have set out to break down all the old compartments , deliberately conveying the less formal image to business colleagues meetings with top executives of affiliate stations now often include elaborate putdowns of each other by mr kriegel and howard stringer , president of the cbs broadcast group mr kriegel underscored the new tone by showing up at a recent meeting in matador s regalia and at another in a grass skirt mr kriegel s work habits are variously described as either nonstop or simply bizarre he is commonly in his office when the only other people around are the cleaning crews i'm not sure the guy sleeps , one colleague says he also goes to enormous lengths to stay in touch with other cbs executives after missing the last shuttle flight out of washington one day last year , mr kriegel took an allnight bus back to new york , arriving at 5 am so that he could accompany mr stringer on a morning flight destination washington
i have been to the top of the empire state building at night and watched a thunderstorm rage i have stood in the roman colosseum and watched cats eat spaghetti from paper plates i have dined on the rooftop of an athenian hotel and seen the profile of aristotle onassis silhouetted against the floodlit parthenon i have gone all the way to agra at full moon to have my snapshot taken by moonlight before the taj mahal all this will i someday relate to my posterity , those sweet creatures as yet unborn , when they wake me from my noddings by the fire with pleas to hear of the wonders on which these ancient eyes have gazed tell us again , dear progenitor , about the fullness of the moon behind aristotle onassis when they took the terribly outoffocus snapshot no , no , children , it was not the moon that onassis was silhouetted against it was the floodlit parthenon the moon was at the taj mahal where the cats ate spaghetti from paper plates , one of my more aggressive posterity will interrupt , having been made obnoxious by pressure to get into all the best colleges then will i sit up in my rocker , flick my shawl at them and cry fie ! as codgers and crones used to in the children s literature of my earliest days fie ! i will cry at the whippersnapper if you were n't always so anxious to speak up despite not knowing what you 're talking about , you 'd know that the cats ate spaghetti at the colosseum , while the famous outoffocus snapshot was made at the moonlit taj mahal as i imagine this scene in the distant future , a fear always comes over me sooner or later , i fear , one of these lovable dears will ask why i never tell them about seeing the sphinx shall i be honest , saying , darling , i just never got around to the sphinx \? or would lofty mendacity be better \? i was all packed to go see the sphinx once when somebody told me you can get there by streetcar 'well , ' i said to myself , 'i do n't want my posterity saying their progenitor was the sort of sightseer who wasted himself on sights that were available to everybody in cairo with the price of a trolley fare in his jeans i have worried so much about how to deal with the sphinx problem that i was on the verge of going to see the thing , much as i hate sand then last week , a break ! i saw michael milken people who love money probably know michael milken as the father of the junk bond to me , however , he is something grander the man who once made 550 million for a year s work , or whatever it is they do in the financing trades i am not one who swoons and froths at the mouth every time another baseball player is paid 5 million for a year s work , but 550 million is something else a 5millionayear player would have to play 110 years to earn what mr milken pulled down in one a payday on this scale establishes mr milken in my book as an authentic , genuine , 550millionkarat monument well worth a detour , so when word raced through the times building last week that he was on the premises i sneaked in to gape while he talked with astonishing assurance to people at ease in money talk , i sat there thinking god bless you , michael milken now i wo n't have to trudge around in that sand seeing the sphinx tell us about seeing the sphinx , shawlwrapped old progenitor well , children , anybody can see the sphinx for the price of a streetcar ride i anticipate restlessness here these will be good american children , which means limousineminded or , better yet , 550millionminded children one will surely cry , no sphinx , progenitor ! tell us about seeing the 550 million man oh yes , do ! did he eat spaghetti off paper plates \? most certainly not he only talked , but with such fluency and persuasive art that you had to run out of the room before he finished for fear he would sell you a car , one of the tots will shout to show how well she remembers the story from my many tellings i knew , of course , that mr milken would n't actually sell me a car , i shall say once again i speak metaphorically , children , meaning only to suggest that this great monument to money could have sold me anything that day because the children will be young and innocent , none will think to ask , could he have sold you a used sphinx easily accessible to the streetcar crowd \? my answer would be , he could have , but it would have been for my own good and the good of my posterity
two steamer trunks containing automatic weapons and explosives were discovered last night in the hallway of an apartment building on the upper east side , and the police said that officers later found more explosives inside an apartment there just before midnight , a police department bombdisposal unit was standing by to remove the trunks from the hallway , on the second floor of a small apartment building at 425 east 75th street six to ten pipe bombs , silencers and automatic weapons were recovered , mostly from the two steamer trunks , said a highranking officer at the scene , capt terry tunnock officer mark warren , a police spokesman , said the trunks also contained blasting caps , which are small charges that can detonate larger explosives officers at the scene said plastic explosives were also found in an apartment on the same floor street closed the street was closed for about three to three and a half hours , and tenants were kept from their buildings until the devices were removed they were allowed to return about 1 am two trucks from the bomb squad stood ready in the street as two bomb squad members , clad in protective gear , gingerly removed the explosives in several trips they were loaded and very powerful , said a bomb squad member who refused to give his name the explosives , which the police estimated had been stored in the two trunks for at least two weeks , were then taken to a police detonation range at rodman s neck in the east bronx notes in a hallway david smith , who lives on the building s second floor , said the trunks had been in the hallway , locked , for two weeks he said he had put a note on the trunks saying , if you need help moving these trunks , let me know a note in response was left saying they will be moved in two days be patient they are heavy the police said they were told of the devices and weapons by one of three women who occupied the apartment other residents of the building said they had seen a man who had either lived in the apartment or visited it the police took the three women to the 19th precinct station house about 1 30 am for further questioning , although they said none were suspects at the time the police said detectives had followed at least two suspects to the building last evening but it was not clear what had happened to the suspects officer warren said no arrests had been made there were more than a dozen police and fire department vehicles on the scene into the morning the investigation will be continued by the police , the federal bureau of investigation and the federal bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms , the authorities said
players snickered at larry himes when , as the rookie general manager of the chicago white sox , he checked their feet to see if they were wearing socks with their loafers if they were n't , he fined them no one should laugh at larry himes now instead , they should applaud him even before he became general manager of the white sox , he had a plan and in the last three years , he has used that plan so well that the white sox are the biggest surprise of the season and a team many other teams should envy the yankees are one of those teams they should envy himes because none of their general managers have accomplished what he has in such a brief time but then , in the time himes has been chicago s general manager , the yankees have had six general managers woody woodward , lou piniella , bob quinn , syd thrift , george bradley and pete peterson does that mean that the yankees' general managers should have accomplished six times more than himes has \? on the contrary , it ca n't even be said that they should have accomplished onesixth of what he has the yankees , in fact , are an example in living color of how a lack of continuity can destroy a team one of the keys to any business it does n't have to be professional sports is you have to have continuity of management , himes said there has to be continuity in philosophy if you keep changing , the philosophy keeps changing or it gets watered down you have to put a plan in place and have a lot of patience with it furthermore , himes said , the general manager , the manager and the director of scouting and player development have to be in sync philosophywise i interviewed seven guys before i hired jeff torborg , himes said jeff s philosophy is in step with mine and al goldis s we support one another goldis had been a scout with the california angels when himes was their scouting and player development director , and he moved to chicago with himes the yankees change general managers and managers so often that they seldom work together for more than a few months , not much time for a plan or a philosophy to take effect the yankees' biggest problem , himes said , is a lack of continuity in management also , the general manager has to select the manager the owner ca n't select the manager three men run the baseball operation as soon as you have the owner selecting the manager and the scouting director for you , you 're in trouble it just does n't work nor does the yankees' newest setup they have not been content with frequently changing the key operational personnel now they have a twoheaded monster as general manager bradley operating out of their minor league complex in tampa , fla , and peterson working at yankee stadium bradley is in charge of scouting and player development , but he is also involved in trades on the major league level , either in charge or in consultation with peterson , depending on his standing with george steinbrenner , the principal owner , on that particular day one problem with having player development men making major league personnel decisions is that they tend to fall in love with their minor league players mike blowers is an example of that bradley , eschewing a search for an established third baseman , pronounced blowers the yankees' third baseman last winter the rookie failed badly once the season began and has been sent back to the minor leagues so much for that phase of the current general managers' philosophy the yankees do not have a philosophy , or a plan , for that matter in acquiring claudell washington , matt nokes and mike witt in the past six weeks , they have operated on a patchwork philosophy , sort of like a public works crew repairing city streets after a weatherwhipped winter in baseball , though , the ruts are supposed to be repaired during the winter hitting comes later what was himes s plan when he became general manager of the white sox \? i wanted to develop through the draft , he said i wanted to concentrate on speed , defense and pitching i wanted young arms we traded for young pitchers right away hitting i felt was no 4 on the priority list hitting is the hardest skill in professional sports to develop the white sox are second in the league in stolen bases and have the secondbest earned run average oakland is the team ahead of them in both the sox are also among the teams that have made the fewest errors minor leagues revisited not many players play a season and a half in the major leagues , then tumble all the way back to the class a level of the minor leagues ron gant of the atlanta braves is one , and he suffered the fall last season it was pretty depressing , to tell you the truth , gant said it gets to you mentally it makes you wonder if you 're ever going to play in the majors and stay there , if you 're made for baseball it was kind of tough on me , tough on my pride the braves sent gant to sumter of the south atlantic league last june 21 because they wanted him to learn how to play the outfield they had seen enough of him in the infield he led national league second baseman with 26 errors in 1988 , then committed 16 errors in 60 games as a third baseman last season he spent two weeks at sumter , then jumped to class aaa with richmond i worked hard , and the coaches worked with me , gant said of his minor league experience it was n't as bad as i thought it would be
differences between the soviet union and the united states on when to use force to uphold economic sanctions against iraq are troublesome but they scarcely threaten the remarkable international consensus that increasingly isolates saddam hussein on all the big questions , moscow has joined with washington to counter iraq s aggression this counts more than moscow s hesitations about using naval force to assure compliance with sanctions working to overcome soviet doubts makes more sense than letting a difference on timing turn into a serious rift over larger goals moscow has joined in condemning iraq s grab of kuwait it has also joined in imposing an arms embargo on the baghdad regime and in voting mandatory economic sanctions but so far , the soviet union has held back from fully approving a security council resolution authorizing a minimum use of force to prevent evasion of the sanctions that could delay naval challenges to ships bound to and from iraqi ports meanwhile , the collective effort to contain saddam hussein grows stronger by the hour japan offers what could amount to billions in compensation to countries hurt by sanctions saudi arabia is providing oil to reimburse costs of us military aid western europe is moving ships and troops to the gulf france is joining as a full partner and global resolve can only be stiffened by iraq s latest affront the grotesque television charade in which saddam hussein appears as kindly godfather to the children of british hostages soviet anxieties about moving too fast on the military track seem neither alarming nor unreasonable mikhail gorbachev is not alone in his aversion to using force others also worry that a massive us buildup in the gulf could result in war by miscalculation or overreaction and moscow is understandably reluctant to turn forcibly against a radical arab state with which it has had close ties for two decades that may be why mr gorbachev prefers deferring naval action until sanctionbusting has been clearly demonstrated the debate has already whetted coldwar suspicions some fear that the soviet union is playing for time to protect its client and reap the benefits of higher prices for its own substantial oil and gas exports and soviet specialists remain in iraq moscow says the advisers are only fulfilling contracts to train iraqis in using soviet military equipment none of this diminishes the crucial importance of soviet support in helping to unite the united nations sanctions are already reckoned as 90 percent effective their bite has provoked iraq into denouncing the un as an american tool , thus slandering all its members given the tumult in the gulf , mr gorbachev s hesitation about going further matters less than the unity of purpose already achieved the first postcoldwar crisis has carried nations everywhere into new terrain it is premature to read sinister motives into uncertain and even contradictory soviet signals
san diego , oct 21 bo jackson s 1990 debut for the los angeles raiders today proved that less than three weeks after the end of his baseball season with the kansas city royals , jackson is ready to play football he carried the ball 12 times for 53 yards against the chargers , averaging 44 yards a carry , and scored two touchdowns as the raiders won , 249 the outfielderturnedrunning back did notice he was playing a different game i got my first hit and it felt like they cut me in half at the waist , jackson said after the victory , which improved the raiders' record to 61 last season , in his debut game for the raiders against the kansas city chiefs , he had 11 carries for 85 yards and one touchdown his best performance last year was 13 carries for 159 yards and two touchdowns against the cincinnati bengals in the ninth week of the national football league season the raiders were 23 before jackson arrived last season and 65 after today , san diego jack murphy stadium was sold out , with many of the 60 , 000 fans anticipating jackson s arrival there had been rumors that the enormous amount of news media attention to jackson had unsettled his raider teammates but after the game they were glowing in their tributes to a sports figure whose first name has become a household word an individual of his stature causes more of a stir than the president , said the defensive end howie long there are people out there who want to touch , grab and steal bo marcus allen , who shares the raider backfield with jackson , denied the notion that he and jackson are not friends if you noticed , said allen , who carried the ball 8 times for 45 yards , after he scored the touchdown , i was the first one to congratulate him on the field a lot of people are trying to create or manufacture a controversy there is none at all i'm glad he s here it s exciting any time you have all these weapons , it s a bonus after the game , jackson dressed quietly in the trainer s room , brought a little boy in for an autograph , then announced he would give interviews in an adjacent room i felt great , jackson said i got some bruises but that will only last a day or so i expect that the first couple of games it s nice to be here you ca n't hit anybody in baseball without getting thrown out of the game
cambridge , mass soon , as a result of the iraqi occupation of kuwait , we may know the truth about israel s chemical , biological and the ultimate taboo nuclear weapons capability israeli leaders on the right and left have for some time shared the belief that the iraqi president , saddam hussein , hides a personal agenda of historical dimensions as iraq s troops consolidate their control in kuwait , israeli strategists are more convinced than ever that president hussein s ultimate goal is not just the rich oil fields of the persian gulf but israel itself fears of such ambitions were first aroused in 1988 , after the end of iraq s war with iran according to israeli intelligence reports , the iraqi dictator , flush with victory , began depicting himself as the modern savior of the arab world \( from the iranians and , above all , from the israelis \) he liked to think of himself , intelligence reports indicated , as a latter day saladin , who defeated the christian crusaders 800 years ago more recently , president hussein issued a bald threat to destroy with our chemical weapons half of the jewish state thus , months before iraq s naked aggression against kuwait , israel began conveying a message that , unfortunately , most of the world chose to ignore president hussein is a dangerous man whose ambitions ought to be taken seriously to give credibility to its warnings , israel even broke one of its most sacred taboos in a local radio interview , the science minister , yuval neeman , said that israel had the chemical weapons capability to respond to iraqi threats of a chemical attack it was a very rare mention of israeli weapons capabilities , normally shrouded in official secrecy and military censorship for many years , successive israeli governments tried to prevent local and foreign journalists from publishing stories about the development of weapon systems by israeli scientists and defense contractors several journalists who dared to write about it were punished and others were warned the prevailing mood in jerusalem was that such stories would only damage the state security posture nevertheless , when it served their interests israeli politicians have n't hesitated in the past to divulge other top secret information word of the clandestine exodus of ethiopian jews in 1985 , to cite just one example but none has ever spoken about nuclear weapons now , to deter president hussein and other arab radicals , israeli officials may feel pressured to break this last taboo the very unusual admission of mr neeman about israel s chemical arsenal could signal such a policy change in recent weeks , israeli officials , using strong language , have been threatening iraq with harsh retaliation maj gen avihu binnun , commander of israel s air force , said israel would inflict severe damage on iraq if it attacked the jewish state eliyahu benelissar , head of parliament s defense and foreign affairs committee , warned iraq , after the first use of a missile , wo n't be the same iraq any more president hussein will lose control in a split second if jerusalem does choose to break its silence on nuclear weapons , what might it divulge \? the londonbased international institute for strategic studies said israel could possess as many as 100 nuclear warheads but governments in jerusalem have stated repeatedly that israel will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the middle east accordingly , there is considerable evidence that , in the face of a seemingly unstoppable buildup in the arms of mass destruction by many arab states , and above all iraq , israel is changing its clandestine nuclear deterrent strategy according to western intelligence officials and civilian analysts in america and europe , israel is no more than a few years away from developing submarinelaunched cruise missiles these would serve as a secondstrike arsenal that could retaliate even if arab forces managed to hit israel s nuclear reactor , groundtoground missile sites and air force bases these statements and some earlier hints fall just short of a formal confirmation that , if its existence is seriously challenged , israel is capable of defending itself with the weapon of last resort we should n't be surprised if , in the not too distant future , that confirmation is finally forthcoming

paul taylor s choreography has a distinctive solidity that recalls his own physique and the velvety prowl that characterized his dancing but it would be hard to characterize the man behind the dances by studying his themes a point in case was the program presented by the paul taylor dance company on tuesday night at city center all is lateafternoon sunshine and mellow good spirits in arden court , an evocation of the symphonic music by william boyce to which the dance is set there is an undercurrent of playful , sometimes bemused courtship to the piece early on , mr taylor works a variation on the ballet convention of the woman who just ca n't stop dancing and there are moments of teasing invention a scrunching hold by kate johnson , who curls like an opossum around elie chaib s leg , is repeated moments later by joao mauricio in a much more boisterous way one man poses upside down in a line of standing men , and the dance ends with mr mauricio rolling , alone , off the stage the equivalent of an aria ending in a hiccup but none of this detracts from the quality of arden court for all its spirit , the dance is as lush as the rose , designed by gene moore , that hovers over the proceedings arden court was performed with just the right balance of drive and play by a cast that also included cathy mccann , mary cochran , jeff wadlington , hernando cortez , thomas patrick and patrick corbin mr taylor takes on organized religion in speaking in tongues , a long and involved piece that is as withered as arden court is rosy ingmar bergman crossed with sherwood anderson , the dance offers a look at a darkly potent evangelist , superbly played by christopher gillis , and a flock that includes a woman identified as his better half , the ghost of his bitter mother , her unwanted daughter and an odd man out , danced like an angel by mr patrick , who briefly seems to be a way out for the daughter , played by ms cochran there is also the preacher s vision of himself as a young man , a vision of the daughter grownup , a sultry , cigarettesmoking woman with airs and a giddy party girl , and an assortment of other characters a prisonlike wall of wooden slats , most of which are covered with neatly printed biblical allusions , towers over the congregation matthew patton s score incorporates ghostly electronic sound , music and the muffled cries of evangelists there are echoes of agnes de mille and antony tudor here , but speaking in tongues is not really like them or anything else mr taylor has done it is a tour de force for the choreographer and his dancers , who also included mr wadlington , ms mccann , karla wolfangle , ms johnson , mr mauricio , sandra stone and francie huber it is also confusing , forbidding , sometimes muddled and overemphatic and unforgettable santo loquasto designed the set and costumes for this 1988 work jennifer tipton was the evening s lighting designer
kabul , afghanistan , may 7 when a twoman team from cocacola s asian operation arrived at the company s abandoned plant near the soviet embassy here the other day , a crowd assembled it continued to gather for days , even after word passed that it would be weeks , maybe months , before the plant could be recommissioned what the eager faces outside the bottling plant seemed to signify was something deeper than thirst in the 12th summer of their war , afghans watch for any sign , however oblique , that their plight has not been forgotten for a decade , while soviet troops were here to fight the muslim guerrillas , there were few fears that afghanistan would slide down the world s priority list but since the soviet withdrawal on feb 15 , 1989 , and the kabul forces' subsequent success in holding off the rebels , afghans have had a growing sense that concern for their war has receded in the distant capitals that are seen as having the power to end it the conflict itself has settled into a pattern of purposelessness in the last month , a longdistance rebel rocket supplied by the united states and saudi arabia slammed into a bus in kabul , killing more than 20 people another landed at dusk near a mosque , killing at least 15 nightly missile firings the sky over kabul is lighted each night with the exhaust plumes of the government s scud missiles , whose oneton explosive warheads rarely strike distant guerrilla targets reports in kabul s bazaars speak of the weapons hitting villages , markets , even schools each day , in soldiers' sandbagged redoubts and in lowly mudwalled homes , the hopeful rise before dawn to catch shortwave broadcasts in persian and pashto , the country s main languages , transmitted by the voice of america and the british broadcasting corporation clusters of people listen intently to the scratchy broadcasts , eager for nuances suggesting that the diplomatic stalemate between washington , the principal backer of the rebels , and moscow , underwriting the kabul government , might be broken last week , after bush administration officials announced that the superpowers had narrowed some of their differences over a possible peace formula , there was a new rollercoaster of hope and disillusion hope came from the disclosure that the two powers have been discussing elections as a way to end the fighting disillusion followed when president najibullah , the kabul leader , demanded that he retain power during the voting , a condition rejected by the united states and by the guerrilla leaders a year ago , many afghans believed that arms , not diplomacy , would end the war but after 15 months of impasse in the fighting , most people seem to believe that all hope for peace rests with negotiations an old man s plea please , good sir , when you come next time , bring us some good news , some sign that our troubles will soon be at an end , an elderly porter implored an american visitor preparing to leave kabul airport his eyes moist , the old man stepped back in his threadbare khaki uniform and offered a shaky salute at the height of the siege of jalalabad last year , reporters took their lives in their hands to reach the strategic city from kabul now , the same sovietbuilt military helicopter , with the same pilot , capt mohammed humayun , flies low above the road that threads between the two cities , with the 25yearold captain grinning at the scene in the rocky gorges below where rebel groups once succeeded in closing the road for weeks at a time , convoys now ply steadily eastward , carrying weapons and food to the garrison likewise , the 250mile salang highway that links kabul to the soviet border has remained open because rival guerrilla groups have failed to mount the concerted actions that would close it any hope of tightening the siege of kabul evaporated when ahmad shah massoud , the guerrillas' most charismatic field commander , decided to consolidate his hold on the northeastern third of the country , a stronghold of his tadzhik people mr massoud has been building the semblance of civil government , even posting traffic policemen at intersections in some dusty towns what future may look like slowly , a pattern is emerging that suggests something of what the country may look like when the war finally ends with many of the rebel commanders apparently convinced that the key to ending the war lies with the superpowers , many have stopped fighting , and wide areas of the country are reverting to warlord rule the situation has allowed the united nations to mount ambitious missions that cross government and rebel lines trucks loaded with supplies travel long distances out of governmentcontrolled cities like herat and mazarisharif , paying tolls to government and rebel commanders alike in kabul , the siege mentality of last year has given way to a dogged determination to resume normal lives during a firefight this week between government troops in kabul s northern suburbs and rebels in the paghman mountains , a visitor on a bicycle watched as butchers slaughtered camels , farmers tended to fields of spring wheat and schoolgirls walked arminarm to school , apparently oblivious to the shells and rockets passing overhead everywhere , there were offers of tea , and pleas for peace last year , many in kabul were ready to welcome the guerrillas but now they are mentioned only to condemn them for the rocketing , and for the rebel leaders' refusal , until now , to negotiate for peace on the bicycle ride , as on other forays , the greatest enthusiasm seemed to run for mohammed zahir shah , the 75yearold exiled king tell the americans the afghan people want the king back , said an old trader named abdullah , seated in a stall fashioned from flattened oil cans when he was here , there was none of this killing a crowd applauded zahir shah ! they shouted zahir shah ! photo after 15 months of impasse in the fighting

atlanta , april 5 four animal handlers have become infected with a virus carried by laboratory monkeys but none have become sick , federal health officials said today the workers were infected with a virus that is related to , but not the same as , the deadly ebola virus of africa , the federal centers for disease control here said since last fall the virus has turned up in monkeys from three philippines importers the licenses of three of the nation s largest monkey importers have been revoked amid concerns over the spread of the virus the handlers who were infected were working at hazleton research products of reston , va , the first laboratory where the virus appeared but unlike african ebola virus , which attacks suddenly and produces serious and often fatal illness , the virus from the philippines is not making humans sick in nobody s book can this virus be considered the same , said dr susan fisherhoch , a cdc specialist on the ebola virus it s not as pathogenic , that s for sure you would expect them to be ill within a few days of exposure researchers have no idea why this latest virus is not causing disease in humans , she said it has killed numbers of laboratory monkeys since last fall high rate of transmission dr fisherhoch said that while the virus was not causing illness , it did have a high rate of transmission four of the five animal handlers at hazleton who had what the disease centers termed a high level of daily exposure became infected in a 1976 epidemic of ebola virus in zaire , it is believed that 98 percent of the people infected became ill and the fatality rate among patients was 88 percent cdc researchers suspect that the virus from the philippines does not reproduce itself well once it infects a person one animal handler who became infected showed high levels of antibodies to the virus , but tests to detect the virus in his blood were unsuccessful , dr fisherhoch said he had cut himself , so we knew he was most definitely inoculated with the virus , she said but he never developed a high load of virus in the blood that s an indication , in one case , that the virus does not replicate very well inspectors from the centers for disease control are continuing to check the three large primate importers that were shut down last month , as well as other importers no decision has been made on when the three might resume business , dr fisherhoch said
joy segal s desk on the second floor of zabar s was a fortress of envelopes full of chocolateflavored formula diet powder the aroma of bread and pastries rose from the store below , but mrs segal was immune to its temptation she smiled triumphantly i 've lost 135 pounds , said mrs segal , 39 years old , the assistant controller of the manhattan food store i have n't weighed this little since fourth grade mrs segal is poised like a victorious warrior on the edge of a new life she has been on a liquid formula diet since may 11 , 1989 , and now , 20 pounds past her goal , she can chase her two children and she can fasten an airliner s seat belt but she is terrified to eat solid food again i could be like a junkie and not stop , she said of life after the fast mrs segal is not alone it has been 16 months since oprah winfrey rapidly dropped 67 pounds on a liquid formula diet and contributed to a nationwide renaissance of the weightloss method now nearly a million americans are trying to establish normal eating habits after the fast , health professionals estimate \( ms winfrey has regained 17 pounds , but refuses to comment on the aftereffects of the diet \) some people , like mrs segal , develop a fear of food and become dependent on formula diets others binge and suffer humiliating weight gains few maintain their lower weights a fiveyear study by dr thomas wadden at the university of pennsylvania showed that 98 percent of all dieters regain their weight within five years in the world of liquid diets , the medical profession , entrepreneurs , major pharmaceutical companies and individual dieters are all hungry for a sliver of success but recent medical studies as well as interviews over two months with 31 patients suggest that the nature of the formula diets could lead to psychological and physiological burdens that limit the diets' longterm effectiveness lose 100 pounds , regain 120 last year , everybody knew somebody who 'd lost 100 pounds on a fast , says barry adler , president of diet fast , a formula diet program now everybody knows somebody who lost 100 pounds and gained back 120 across the country , dozens of obesity specialists have noticed an increase in patients on the fastandbinge roller coaster over the past three years tomorrow , at a conference in washington of the american federation of the american societies for experimental biology , dr adam drenowski , director of human nutrition at the university of michigan , is to present findings that yoyo dieting , cycles of rapid weight loss and gain frequently associated with liquid formula diets , creates a craving for caloriedense mixtures of sugar and fat dr theodore vanitallie , a consultant to the united weight control corporation , a formula weight loss program based in englewood cliffs , nj , has concluded that rapid weight loss can be sustained only by longterm psychological support and nutritional education he has been in the vanguard of obesity study for 27 years losing it and keeping it off in the past 10 years , the medical profession lent credence to the liquid diets by developing safe liquid formulas and more effective monitoring of their physiological consequences but science has succeeded primarily in teaching people how to live without food in order to maintain their weight loss while living with food , dieters need a new psychology toward eating acknowledging the potent psychological area between feast and famine , the premier liquid formula diets , like optifast and united weight control corporation , are using behavior modification training we have shifted from acute intervention to the longterm reality of keeping the weight off , said jim parsons , a vice president of optifast programs , but if there are 100 chapters in the maintenance program to be written , we 're only on chapter one the promise from hospitals to the mass market in an effort to treat the morbidly obese , those with at least 100 pounds or even half their body weight to lose , dr saul genuth and dr victor vertes developed the 320calorie milkshakelike formula derived from milk and egg protein that eventually became optifast a spate of copycat formulas followed , some made from inferior protein with limited nutritional value bill gregg , a spokesman for the food and drug administration , noted that in 1978 , the public health service attributed 17 deaths to an overthecounter liquid protein powder and the fda issued a warning about such products it still recommends a doctor s supervision for any severely restricted weightloss diet , he said but for patients with weightrelated , lifethreatening medical conditions the lowcalorie formulas provided the quickest way to lose weight today s formula diets are derived from highly nutritional protein from milk , eggs or soy they contain more protein , fiber and calories than earlier formulas and more trace elements than had been contained in earlier formulas still , the formulas , which range from 400 to 800 calories a day , severely restrict caloric intake and cause rapid slimming that can lead to physiological changes like loss of body protein and fluids , losses that can affect the liver and heart
jersey city coinciding with the invention of type , woodcuts began as crude , simple images but those produced for the cognoscenti by durer and cranach can scarcely be told from engravings , so fine are their lines and so sparkling their tones the medium is no less elegant in the hands of the 18th and 19thcentury japanese masters , although with the introduction of large color masses , its character is entirely different taken up by the early 20thcentury expressionists , the woodcut reverted to its popular character , becoming a vehicle for primitivism and , later on , for political protest and , in its present revival , it continues to favor this side of its lineage in esthetics , if not in content or , for that matter , size all of which can be inferred from the jersey city museum s contemporary woodblock prints , a show surveying the work of artists who mostly came to the fore in the 1970 s and 80 s of the 40 or so pictures on view , joel shapiro s black figure made by impressing the paper on scraps of wood is the smallest , at 12 1 4 by 8 1 4 inches most , however , are in the neighborhood of 3 feet by 2 feet , and some , like roberto juarez s pine palm , are twice that size as a result , not all the works get the space they need and , large as the gallery is , the effect is a bit crowded all the same , the show has been well chosen by its curators , gweneth stokes and charles thomas strider , and with its catalogue by susan tallman makes its point effectively a writer on prints for arts magazine , ms tallman opens by stating , of all the criteria used to discuss art , none is as tedious as technique , a point that should endear her to all but print freaks she herself crisply outlines the medium s historical ups and downs and ascribes the current rebirth of interest to the woodcut s crudeness and immediacy , as well as its associations with past revolutions though ms tallman contends that good woodcuts today still look distinct from pictures produced by other means , there are prints in the show that contradict her one example , martin puryear s dark loop , a linear image in white on black that suggests huts in a snowstorm , could surely have been done on scratchboard richard mock s manically busy high altitude kite flyer would not look too different as a lithograph likewise , bryan hunt s window , which might as well be a watercolor as for gregory amenoff , a painter as concerned with the sheer weight of pigment as with landscapelike imagery , his mnemosyneis no more than an offset version of one of his canvases still , there are images that do lend themselves to the medium , notably richard bosman s faux naive view of a shipwrecked sailor standing , paddle in hand , in the open maw of a polar bear an artist who points up neoexpressionism s debt to pop , mr bosman specializes in mocking disaster , and it is worth noting that in the current issue of the sciences , some early 1980 s scenes by him of murders are used to illustrate an article on the fallibility of dna fingerprinting a german painter born to the woodcut , a r penck is best represented by a roughly hewn nude capering black against white sean scully s weighty slabs of color seem made for the technique , but in fact they acquire an illusionistic quality in translation then again , it could be the indeterminate tinted grays and their mottled textures that make the horizontals and verticals in standing no 1 look like the weathered planks of a fence in the shapiro print already mentioned , the subject is as much the texture of the wood pieces as the shape they assume it is the same , only more so , with the sculptor s other prints , especially the one where wandering white lines and dots serve only to heighten the satiny texture of the plank they are carved in by the way , these are engraved interlopers , as are the prints from francesco clemente s febbre alta portfolio there are three alluding to the figure and one that is a serpentine incision in the end grain , and all are printed black on frothy white paper a dramatic example of the real subtractive thing is richard diebenkorn s double x a mass of black diagonals and horizontals , it looks like a positive gesture until the beholder realizes that it is actually the shape left after everything else has been cut away most of the 23 artists were assisted by professional printers , and none were better served than alex katz by tadashi toda in his head of a female swimmer wearing a green cap and posed against a background of solid cerulean this is vintage katz , endowed with something that can only be called japanese exquisiteness except for that print , the most outstanding efforts are those in black and white yvonne jacquette looks especially good with her aerial view of downtown new york at night , where the buildings are the sum of their lighted windows and the streets are defined by the headlights of cars woodcuts are not as vigorous as they were 75 years ago what is \?

on the heels of a warning by a federal administrator that racketeers still control the fulton fish market , new york city officials said yesterday that they have a plan for comprehensive reform but they said they would withhold details of the plan for about 30 days in a report released wednesday , the administrator , frank h wohl , said extortion and violence at the market in lower manhattan had led to higher retail prices for fish in the city he accused the city government of having abdicated its responsibility to enforce the law at the market mr wohl , who was appointed to monitor conditions in the market in april 1988 , said yesterday that he had delayed issuing the report in the hope the city would intervene sooner 'major steps' responding to mr wohl s report , the city agency mainly responsible for supervising the fish market , the department of ports and trade , said yesterday that major steps have been taken to eliminate blatant disregard for city rules and regulations in a statement , the department said the administration of mayor david n dinkins has now approved a plan through which the department will implement a comprehensive reform of the operations at the market a spokeswoman for the department , frances a resheske , said the plan would be disclosed in about 30 days after budget details are worked out the department s statement said that the commissioner of ports and trade , wallace l ford 2d , met with mr wohl on monday and that mr wohl indicated he would help obtain funds and employees for the city s proposed enforcement campaign but mr wohl , in an interview , said , i made no commitment to funding or personnel beyond saying the personnel in my office would be available to assist the city in any way that we could in the last 18 months , as part of a heightened effort to deter violence and improve overall conditions , the department said , three employees with peaceofficer status had been assigned full time to the market 'extortionate' fees the statement did not address a prime concern raised by mr wohl that an unauthorized group of crews or companies dictated how fish could be unloaded at the market and charged extortionate fees for transporting supplies a few feet from a truck to a wholesaler s stall we ca n't respond to that now , ms resheske , the ports agency spokeswoman , said in an interview when asked about the unloading issue we believe the city has done a lot more than was expressed in that report under provisions of the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act , known as rico , mr wohl a former federal prosecutor , was appointed by judge thomas p griesa of federal district court in manhattan to monitor and supervise the market his appointment followed a civil suit by the united states attorney s office in manhattan that characterized the market as having been dominated by mafia groups for more than 60 years 'complex operations' explaining why he had waited more than two years to issue a report on conditions at the market , mr wohl said in an interview that he had to familiarize himself first with the complex operations at the market he said there was little public information about how wholesalers , truckers , loaders and unloaders of supplies conduct their businesses at the market in the rico civil suit , 28 defendants who had business dealings at the market were accused of being linked to organizedcrime activities eleven agreed to be barred from the market while the other 17 were allowed to continue there under mr wohl s supervision but mr wohl said his investigation was slowed by the refusal of most of the 17 to answer questions about their dealings in his report , mr wohl said city officials in the administration of mayor edward i koch agreed in july 1989 to begin regulating the unloading of fish but , no such enforcement , he said , was undertaken by the koch or dinkins administrations unless the city quickly begins to impose rules and enforce them , mr wohl said , he plans to issue his own regulations short but costly trip fish and shellfish are brought to the market on south street between john and dover streets by refrigerated trucks groups known as unloaders designate parking spaces for the trucks and deliver the fish to wholesalers mr wohl said the unloaders charge about as much per pound to deliver fish 50 feet across south street as the cost of transporting the fish thousands of miles from new england or the gulf coast retailers and restaurateurs normally have no choice about how their fish is delivered to them after they make purchases from wholesalers a group , known as loaders , determines where the retail purchasers can park , who delivers their fish and the fees retailers , in recent interviews , said they were charged 50 or more per visit by loaders city regulations require that the loaders and unloaders be licensed , but mr wohl said almost none apparently are they have developed their own rules for how business should be conducted at the market , he added
moscow the search for summer shoes began in february , when the city was cloaked in gray and the streets were slick with ice a former nanny invited liza to join her at camp in june a gift of birch trees and crisp air for a child who lives hard by moscow s polluted main road and she would need shoes to play in the grass and hike in the woods olga dreaded the idea of the camp she was reluctant to let her daughter spend a month singing the triumphs of communism with hundreds of redscarved pioneers , the gradeschool wing of the communist party but such influences were pressed on the child daily at school and liza showed great resistance to the indoctrination no , olga admitted , what concerned her most about summer and camp was that liza would need a new pair of shoes at the family s summer dacha , she could get by in her mother s castoffs or cheap plastic sandals but at camp , she would be running around more and she needed shoes , or sandals or sneakers that could take a beating of the many shortages that haunt desperate consumers here , footwear is among the worst it is not a question of a finicky child s taste or of only certain colors being available , or even of the hours that need to be spent standing in lines just to find out whether a store has shoes in a given size often , the problem is that there are no children s shoes available at all in any style , color or size handmedowns are a common answer to this perpetual deficit but nobody olga knew had a pair in good enough condition in liza s size and so the search began first , mother and daughter went to a large footwear shop on kutuzovsky prospekt , a 30minute walk from their apartment on a day of cold winds and light snowfall by the time the misty june sun came around four months later , they would have visited this one store at least a dozen times that first day , after waiting about an hour , they discovered only one thing for children orange and brown plaid houseslippers , none in liza s size on the way home , they stopped at a shop in their neighborhood and it took one look at the lack of a line and the idle store clerks to know that this was a shoe store in name only two weeks later , olga went into the neighborhood store again this time they had rubberbottom slippers with a thin plastic strap in liza s size she bought them for four rubles for liza to wear around the house , but they would clearly be useless for camp at the artificially high official soviet exchange rate , a ruble is the equivalent of 160 the search continued in early march , olga and liza went to a store on kalinin prospekt , a busy moscow thoroughfare lined with halfempty stores the children s shoe department had cheap plastic slippers and rubber boots that were separating at the soles even as they lay in their boxes sergei , olga s mother , her two brothers and their wives , a 16yearold niece and several friends and aunts were also on the alert for summer shoes for liza throughout march and april and may they reported discouraging news about lunch breaks and afterwork hours spent waiting to no avail we would settle for anything that came close to what liza needs sneakers , sandals , loafers , laceups , olga said we would take boy s shoes or small women s shoes i 'd be happy even to pay up to 100 rubles at a cooperative , but there is nothing out there and what they sell on the black market is pure junk salvation' in detsky mir by midmay , liza was feeling dejected and olga was at a loss as to how she would find the summer shoes they decided to make a trip to detsky mir , children s world , in central moscow olga and liza went to two departments and saw nothing finally , in a glass showcase in the last possible place they could look , was a pair of blue and white sandals they waited 40 minutes in a tight , tense line before they got a close look at the shoes liza proclaimed them to be old ladyish for even in a society of want children reserve the right to be fussy olga thought they were shoddy , but she begged her daughter to try them on liza obliged , buckling the vinyl strap and bouncing up and down on the thin , poorly glued soles she complained that they pinched , but all olga could see was that at least they fit and that they were summer shoes as she went to the next line , to pay six rubles for shoes that would never last through camp , liza tried to dissuade her mother olga finally prevailed by promising that the sandals were merely in case nothing else could be found nothing was photo liza avilova trying on sandals that her mother , olga , bought for her at detsky mir , a moscow department store \( esther b fein the new york times \)
it is a serious mistake ever to hear a great performance thereafter , the listener s life can become difficult during intermissions , old friends begin to look the other way , fearful that they will be harangued about some legendary violinist s patrician way with the bach chaconne or some halfforgotten soprano s peerless come scoglio it is true that once exposed to the best , ear and mind are spoiled i thought of this problem , which tends to worsen with age , when word came of leonard bernstein s death two weeks ago it has been more than 30 years since i first marveled at his whitehot performances of mahler and their uncanny psychic mating of composer and interpreter since then , many excellent conductors have addressed themselves to the same works , some more persuasively than others , but always with the bernstein performances looming behind them , forcing invidious comparisons do n't talk to me about anyone s resurrection symphony but the first one i heard from bernstein nor has there ever been , for me , a mahler third to match in emotional impact the one bernstein led in his 1969 finale as the new york philharmonic s music director always , since then , i listen for the ineffable mingling of sweet innocence and sadness that he found in the final movement and am invariably let down no doubt the farewell mood of the occasion contributed to the elegiac effect that , you may object , is the listener s problem , not the performer s it is naive and critically irresponsible to impose prejudices of debatable validity on interpreters who may have wholly different ideas about the work i could not agree more but there it is out in the open , the simple , shameful prejudice bernstein s mahler is my mahler conductors x , y and z can sue me the more one has heard , the greater the problem a new boris godunov whom i encountered the other evening at the metropolitan opera , paata burchuladze , was competing unfairly with a ghost the boris for me always will be boris christoff mr christoff identified with mussorgsky s haunted czar in much the same way that bernstein identified with mahler mr christoff , in fact , seemed to believe himself the reincarnation of half the monarchs in opera history though he never appeared at the met , a misfortune traceable to visa problems in 1950 with american immigration authorities , the great bulgarian bass was the dominant boris \( and king philip and prince igor \) elsewhere in the world granted , there must be many veteran operagoers in new york for whom no currently active boris meets the standards of ezio pinza , george london , cesare siepi , jerome hines or the late martti talvela except for pinza , i heard all of them all i can say is that when i think of boris i think first of boris christoff and that distinctively nasal but overwhelmingly expressive voice when any boris godunov performance arrives at the clock scene , i wait for the hair to rise on the back of my hands , as it did when his maddened boris , seized by terror , rushed across the room at the czarevitch s ghost , trailing a shroudlike white tablecloth unfortunately , i find it necessary to seize people by the arm at intermission like the ancient mariner and lecture them about how boris christoff created that indelible image if encouraged , i am willing to speculate about how much his interpretation must have owed to chaliapin s great performances do that to people i also am doomed to listen , not too hopefully , for a chopin pianist to rival arthur rubinstein , for a beethoven recitalist of rudolf serkin s caliber , for a tenor with a sound anything like jussi bjoerling s , for a verdi soprano like renata tebaldi , for a guitarist like andres segovia , a riveting stage personality in the class of maria callas in opera , any azucena or amneris must measure up to giulietta simionato , anybody s falstaff to tito gobbi s there never was or will be a simon boccanegra to match what gobbi made of the council chamber scene in which the doge tries to reconcile the warring patricians and plebians i know there is a leonard warren faction out there , but i somehow missed his boccanegra you will realize by now that my greatperformance problem is acute and possibly terminal do not speak to me of zarathustra unless you mention fritz reiner in the same breath at the time i first heard him conduct the tone poem i was antistrauss , like most of my generation , because of the composer s wartime opportunism such intolerable bombast but it took only one reiner performance to prejudice me forever against all lesser straussians similarly , any conductor of schubert s unfinished goes up against memory of a pierre monteux performance , any winterreise interpreter against dietrich fischerdieskau or , if ties are permitted , hans hotter any soprano who sings hugo wolf had better be as good as elisabeth schwarzkopf or else and lest you think all my prejudices are rooted in the dim past , be advised that i am ready to find a niche in the performance pantheon for carlos kleiber s rosenkavalier , heard just the other evening at the metropolitan opera sometimes the problem can be caused by records , though we are all aware of how deceptive those dizzily spinning things can be coming across a decca recording of goyescas in the 1950 s put me forever in the camp of a pianist of whom i had never heard until that moment , alicia de larrocha since then there have been more technologically polished recordings of the granados and of albeniz s iberia , several of them by miss de larrocha , but none that have made or ever will make the same impact just as when i first heard glenn gould play a bach partita in person , the idea that such pianists still roamed the world came as a shock do i become tedious \? are my bony fingers gripping your arm too tightly \? try to understand nobody has conducted delius like sir thomas beecham , on that most listeners could agree his debussy is also indelible still , my most vivid pelleas et melisande was not necessarily the best \( that rating is reserved for a frederica von stade performance at the met \) it was an opera comique premiere , the last production designed by jean cocteau , with gerard souzay and denis duval in the cast and an audience of bemedalled old guard parisians if i were to try hard enough i could almost persuade myself that mary garden was the melisande that night in the same gallic vein , there is only one authentic performance of poulenc s voix humaine , the one with duval as the deserted lover , accompanied at the piano by the composer sorry , but that is how it goes there is only one great performance the first one for you i am being a little facetious , of course every music listener has his or her own memory bank , which gradually fills with old performances that defy deletion by newer ones if it is true that one can never step in the same river twice , we can never again experience the chill of our first superb don giovanni or beethoven fifth by taking thought , the cultivated listener can sometimes almost relive the initial flush of delight or awe it is not easy , but not impossible , either otherwise , who would bother to listen to any work or any performer twice still , with that first fine frenzy comes the end of innocence after a dozen or a thousand hearings , a mahler symphony or a chopin ballade can continue to please or instruct , but virginity is not replicable never again will anything make quite the same impression as that first bernstein or rubinstein the damage of a great performance has been done and we must live with it photo the boris of borisesthe bass boris christoff \( the new york times \)

the answer embodies an irony mr moore s success is almost certainly due to his style of deadpan facetiousness , a style of black humor that has been likened by some admirers to voltaire s candide or jonathan swift s modest proposal roger and me , as the critics have pointed out , is plainly entertaining , and moreover , it is a kind of david and goliath revenge story , in which a modest , plainspeaking nobody triumphs morally over an evil corporate giant but lately some dissenting voices have arisen amid the general chorus of praise for roger and me , and that is where the irony lies these critics notably harlan jacobson , writing in film comment magazine , and pauline kael , in the new yorker have complained that mr moore s film , although funny , is factually inaccurate the film maker , they say , is guilty of manipulating the sequences of events and compressing them for the sake of emotional and political impact roger and me , in their view , is thus biased and misleading satire is exaggeration what mr moore s detractors are saying , in a sense , is that the very qualities that made the film successful the elements of irreverence , satire , ridicule are the very ones that make it misleading , since satire inevitably depends on a certain partiality and exaggeration , the creation of a villain , an artistic deformation of the real world and that in turn leads to a deeper issue regarding the genre of documentary film that mr moore , an experienced advocacy journalist but a man with no film experience , seems to have defined anew the complaints of unfairness are based on the assumption that a documentary is a piece of filmed journalism , and that it should obey the same rules of balance and objectivity that newspapers and television news are supposed to obey this does not mean that a good documentary can have no strongly held point of view , no quality of idiosyncracy some of the most celebrated examples of the genre , like marcel ophul s sorrow and the pity , claude lanzmann s shoah , and frederick wiseman s 'near death , clearly embody the film makers' personal views of their subjects , just as mr moore s film does a question of standards mr wiseman whose 1967 documentary titicut follies , about conditions at a massachusetts state prison for the criminally insane , still remains under a modified ban imposed by that state says the question is really one of standards i readily acknowledge that my films are biased , subjective , prejudiced , condensed , compressed , the experienced and wellregarded documentary film maker said in a telephone interview indeed , he said , all documentaries are necessarily distortions of reality , since , obviously , they are filmed through a lens and edited events that might have taken place over weeks , months or years are reduced to a presentation of , at most , a few hours but i think that my films are fair , mr wiseman continued , and by fair i mean that they are an accurate account of the experience i had when making the film rather than an imposition of a preconceived point of view but does this apply to roger and me \? is it really a documentary like any other , or is it more like a swiftian satire with the audience knowing it is satire and therefore dependent on intentional exaggeration in order to call attention to what might be seen as the higher truth \? moreover , if roger and me had hewed to standard , impartial journalistic practices , could it have been as entertaining , as personal , as sharply targeted and therefore as successful as it has become \? finding a target mr moore s film focuses on his hometown , flint , mich , once known as pontiac city , where , according to roger and me , the closing of 11 factories and the layoff of 30 , 000 workers by a callous general motors management created unspeakable hardship and decline mr moore , who is the film s narrator , interviewer and chief screen presence , not only traces the deterioration of flint , but also finds a target for his satire this is roger smith , the general motors chairman , who , protected by a blindly obedient bureaucracy of guards and public relations agents , rejects all of mr moore s efforts to interview him or to bring him to flint to see for himself the suffering that his policies portrayed as greedy and unnecessary by mr moore have allegedly brought about the criticisms of mr moore , which were first outlined by mr jacobson and then were picked up by ms kael in a sharply critical review , are based on several points first , as mr jacobson wrote , the film compressed events that actually took place over a long period of time and altered the sequence of some of them the 11 plant closings affected 4 states , not just flint the 30 , 000 jobs lost in flint were lost over 12 years , not the far shorter span suggested though never explicitly stated by mr moore in roger and me assumptions are inevitable
the canticum novum s wellconceived and wideranging concert of english music on saturday evening at st peter s church in manhattan seemed to take into account even the british fondness for mysteries after the opening work , benjamin britten s wonderfully understated festival te deum , the chorus relocated from its perch near the organ to the altar to begin william byrd s glorious a cappella mass for five voices but when the conductor , harold rosenbaum , arrived at his music stand , the score was missing a hasty search proved fruitless , and mr rosenbaum had to settle for another score , lamenting the loss of his breath marks none of the singers fainted , however , and if anyone sneaked an extra breath , it did not detract from a superbly controlled yet expansive performance producing a chaste sonority with minimal vibrato , the 25 choristers maintained pitch triumphantly , with even a hint of swagger from the tenors to end the credo the amen at the conclusion of the gloria was a model of balance and tuning wisely , the five sections of the mass were spaced throughout the program , as they would be in an actual church service in between came two lovely verse anthems by orlando gibbons , britten s imposing voices for today , and a rousing organ voluntary by henry purcell , deftly spun out by the evening s accompanist , walter hilse britten s voices , written in 1965 for the 20th anniversary of the united nations , is aptly described in alan marsh s program notes as a collection of aphorisms , from the hindu 'upanishads' to george santayana , that he pieced together in a pacifist stream of consciousness it calls for mixed choir and boys' voices , the latter parts capably rendered here by 16 women from the northport \( li \) high school choir , one of whom , deborah ann shannon , fetchingly sang the brief solos in the te deum as well both britten works received strong performances , and their angular melodies set off byrd s sinuous lines beautifully the charming numbers by gibbons featured soloists from the chorus , margo fein and maura may , altos , in lord , we beseech thee and sharmon propp , soprano , in so god loved the world jim john sang the celebrant s brief introductions in the byrd all were adequate , and the altos , well matched and robust in tone , afforded particular pleasure mr rosenbaum may not be much of a sleuth , but he can put together an interesting and demanding program , and on this occasion his forces met the challenge admirably
the inquisitive visitor to quedlinburg in soontovanish east germany will be puzzled by what he does n't find here occurred one of the century s great art thefts , yet quedlinburgers profess disinterest their main concern is how unification will change a cobbled city abutting the frontier that has divided the harz mountains when american forces liberated the town in 1945 , a deftfingered officer apparently made off with cathedral treasures , including an invaluable 10thcentury manuscript as the times s william honan has reported , the trove resurfaced in whitewright , tex west germany now has recovered the manuscript \( it is in munich \) with the lubricant of a 3 million finder s fee one might expect east german communists to call righteous attention to the original theft yet three guidebooks to quedlinburg published under communist auspices are strangely silent about the lost treasures a likely explanation was provided by the landlady of a timbered tourist home below the ancient cathedral everybody knew the americans took the treasure , but they also know the russians were bigger robbers , which for communists was not a good thing to talk about now that the party is out of power , its official paper is speaking more freely on july 22 , neues deutschland recounted the known facts about quedlinburg but acknowledged that soviet soldiers joined in the general plunder even so , the extent of the pillage by all victorious armies is among the betterkept secrets of world war ii here is an inventory of treasures , lost and found the gold of troy a small berlin museum contained the socalled treasure of priam , a shimmering hoard unearthed in the 1870 s by troy s rediscoverer , heinrich schliemann when russians entered berlin , the golden jewelry was stowed in a shellproof tower its whereabouts are still a mystery hanseatic documents in a littlepublicized 1989 swap , west germany and the soviet union exchanged precious parchments taken by their respective nationals from hanseatic city archives , including bremen , lubeck and tallinn , the capital of estonia the pergamon altar this imposing temple was dug up in turkey , installed in its own berlin museum , taken to leningrad by the red army , and returned , against expectations , by nikita khrushchev in 1959 the dresden treasures soviet forces removed 1 , 240 paintings from dresden , plus the bejeweled contents of the famous green vault khrushchev returned them , but 700 paintings are still missing , along with an invaluable print collection taken from amsterdam by the nazis the bremen drawings a soviet soldier came upon hundreds of drawings by old and modern masters in the cellar of a castle near berlin they belonged to a bremen museum , but their soviet rescuer was refused permission to return them until this year negotiations on a finder s fee are in progress the berlin artifacts delighted curators of west berlin s ethnology museum have just received 1 , 500 packages containing 45 , 000 items they had been taken by the red army to russia , where they were carefully catalogued and then sent to leipzig in the 1970 s none of this is surprising , given the passions excited by hitler s wars , cold war enmities and human covetousness the third reich was a repository for art treasures worth billions the immense collections of german museums were scattered in a thousand hiding places added to these were innumerable works stolen , bought , or confiscated by hitler and goering a good reckoning is that 10 percent is still missing some works in secret collections , some held for political reasons quedlinburg was only one episode in a still unfolding story

newark if there is any reward in architecture to staying the course , it is to be seen right here on washington street , where the newark museum has recently completed a 21 million reconstruction and expansion the architect the museum hired was michael graves not the internationally famous michael graves of today , architect of whitney museum additions and walt disney world hotels , but the young and struggling michael graves of 1967 , a faculty member at the princeton university school of architecture that was the year mr graves was recommended to the newark museum s director , samuel c miller , as a talented comer in those days mr graves was supplementing his teaching salary by designing a few modest house additions , and the invitation to design the museum represented his bid for the big time he ended up with a long wait , and the museum with an even longer one right after hiring him mr miller asked mr graves to plan a major expansion to the museum , but money problems in the wake of newark s riots made it impossible to build anything architect and client kept in touch , however , with mr graves doing a few small jobs for the museum as his career began , slowly , to take off by 1982 , when the city of newark gave the museum an abandoned ywca next door to its original building , at last making possible the expansion that had first been envisioned in the 1960 s , mr graves had grown so successful that the newark museum was no longer the big opportunity it had been in the 60 s , but a small job he set to work anyway mr graves was nothing if not loyal to his first bigtime client , a client that has remained steadfastly loyal to him as well virtually nothing of the design he and mr miller had created in the 1960 s could be of use in the 1980 s , however , since both the nature of the expansion that the museum wanted and mr graves s own architectural style had changed radically in the 15 years since the first contacts had taken place the museum , which once thought it would be building a completely new addition , now wanted to renovate and join together its two old buildings and the newly acquired ywca mr graves , an ardent modernist in the 1960 s , by the 1980 s had become an outspoken advocate of postmodern classicism , evolving a highly personal vocabulary of color and decoration but the reconstructed newark museum , which opened to the public in november , turns out to be one of mr graves s most successful efforts it is relatively restrained as mr graves s work goes surely not as flamboyant as the portland building , the brightly colored municipal building mr graves designed in oregon that , along with philip johnson and john burgee s att building in new york , forced postmodern architecture into the public eye neither is it as lavish as mr graves s skyscraper headquarters for humana inc in louisville , or as whimsical as his hotels at walt disney world in orlando , or as problematic as his still unbuilt design for an addition to the whitney museum of american art in new york a project that has been the focus of sharp public debate since it was first unveiled in 1985 and which has been radically redesigned twice \( with the forced resignation earlier this month of its major booster , the whitney s director , tom armstrong , the graves addition for the whitney now seems less likely than ever to see the light of day \) the michael graves we see in newark is calmer , less fussy , more boiled down to the essentials than the graves we see elsewhere there is none of the sense of simply too much architecture for the problem at hand , as there sometimes is in mr graves s work instead , there is a splendid rigor and clarity the redesigned newark museum is mostly a matter of interiors it has only two gravesian elements on the outside , a new entrance for school groups set into the red brick side of the former ywca building , and a new public entrance in the rear of the main museum building , facing the garden and parking area the new entrances , both of stucco , are monumental but blunt , austere pieces of strippeddown classicism that have been set in deliberate contrast to the red brick , industriallooking walls of the back and sides of the older buildings there was no attempt to make this falsely pretty , or to deny the fact that the red brick walls of these older buildings are the reality of this place from anywhere other than the original , triplearched limestone facade on washington street which remains the museum s official front , and is untouched the newark museum looks like a renovated factory although something more elaborate would have given the project more impact on the cityscape , and newark a more conspicuous symbol of renewal , the rationale for leaving the outside plain is understandable enough it was the only way to stretch a tight budget to permit 66 , 000 square feet of new and renovated gallery space \( the museum s exhibit area has nearly doubled in the expansion \) the most important gravesdesigned galleries are in a section of the original building that was formerly the museum s education wing it is long and narrow , but mr graves has deftly turned this odd shape into a series of rooms that are both graceful and coherent
washington , jan 28 when word spread recently that the administration s budget would be presented this year in one large book instead of the usual collection of smaller volumes , the response around town , from congress and the bureaucracy , from lobbyists and reporters , was the same what is darman up to now \? the suspicion that he has something up his sleeve , in this case probably unjustified , illustrates how richard g darman , a pivotal figure in the bush administration and perhaps the most influential budget director ever , is regarded by many people he deals with as a man who approaches every task with a scheme , an angle politicians and scholars disagree over whether that reputation , based on mr darman s volatile personality as much as specific incidents , makes him less effective as one of the administration s chief political negotiators and tacticians but they agree that his personality often overshadows the fact that he is admired throughout washington by his political enemies as well as his friends for his intelligence , his capacity for work , his analytical ability and his mastery of government policy evidence of foresight mr darman is also much more farseeing than most people in politics and government that is apparent from an introduction he wrote to the budget that will be submitted to congress on monday the didactic tone may irk some lawmakers , but his warning that congress must be prepared for enormous future expenses like medical care for an aging population reminds the lawmakers of future obligations they are inclined to neglect in the face of the political constraints imposed by president bush s notax policy , mr darman , in his first year as director of the office of management and budget , dominated the policies of the government s hundreds of departments and agencies to an ex tent none of his predecessors did , took broad steps to weed out mismanagement throughout the government and saw a budget enacted that fell within the broad range of president bush s proposals he also assumed the role , normally outside the domain of the budget director , of political strategist and principal lobbyist for president bush s domestic and economic policies rift with congress but he failed to achieve a lasting solution to what many economists and politicians see as the nation s most serious problem , the federal budget deficit and he managed to damage the bush administration s relationship with congress , especially with important democratic senators , to such a degree that some lawmakers doubt it can be repaired when i talk to him , said senator lloyd bentsen of texas , chairman of the finance committee , i am reminded of the story about the two psychiatrists one says , 'good morning' the other says , 'what did you mean by that \? ' mr darman declined to be interviewed on the record for this article , saying , i do not want to respond to those kinds of questions he is irate at journalists and lawmakers who , he thinks , focus on his personality rather than the product of his work resented for being smart one of mr darman s strongest supporters in congress , senator pete v domenici of new mexico , the top republican on the budget committee , said he suspected the budget director was sometimes resented because he is so smart there s a fine line , mr domenici said , between having an angle , having a strategy , and being improperly devious some of those who think there s deviousness here do n't like him because it s so hard to secondguess him , to outwit him , to outplan him , and maybe it s very hard for some to risk sitting down with him to negotiate but mr darman s critics maintain that the budget director has often broken his word , a cardinal sin among politicians the critics include , in addition to senator bentsen , senators george j mitchell of maine , the majority leader jim sasser of tennessee , chairman of the budget committee , and senator robert c byrd of west virginia , chairman of the appropriations committee their main complaint is that last april mr darman negotiated a budget deal with congress , a deal that everyone conceded was modest to buy time so that good will could be developed between president bush and congress and so that a comprehensive deficitreduction package could be worked out late in the year by all accounts , the initial deal did not include a reduction in the capital gains tax rate push to cut capital gains tax but after the house of representatives surprisingly approved a capital gains measure , mr darman pulled out all political stops , personally challenging democratic senators' motives and intelligence , in an unsuccessful effort to move the tax cut through the senate mr darman said at meetings with reporters last fall that he had no choice but to pursue the capital gains issue once it was passed by the house senator sasser , for one , does not accept that explanation i think his credibility has been diminished by his failure to deliver on a bipartisan agreement , he said mr sasser continued congress gave the administration a slipby year , a free pass , to let the president get his feet on the ground in exchange for that , it was strongly implied that we would get together later to make the tough decisions to put our fiscal house in order once and for all as soon as the ceremonies were over , that evaporated in thin air , and then with the fierce fight over capital gains , a breech of the agreement , his credibility suffered another severe blow many top republican senators , including bob dole of kansas , the minority leader , also criticized mr darman for fighting the capital gains battle long after it was lost praise at highest levels
titmuss regained by john mortimer 281 pages viking 1995 in john mortimer s entertaining new novel , titmuss regained , england s green and pleasant land is threatened not by the building of industrialism s dark satanic mills but by the erection of 1980 s style suburban housing projects and shopping malls developers , it seems , have discovered the lovely rapstone valley , and their plans to create a cute new community named fallowfield country town \( complete with mockgeorgian shopping centers , huge parking lots and condominiums for yuppie commuters from london \) immediately sets off a confrontation between liberals and conservatives , environmentalists and entrepreneurs it s a confrontation that quickly obsesses all the rapstone valley residents , a confrontation that provides mr mortimer with lots of opportunities to look at england s uneasy accommodation with recent social changes the emergence of a new statushungry middle class the growing acceptance of american ideas and values the spread of suburban development to oncebucolic areas as his earlier novel paradise postponed \( which first introduced readers to rapstone valley and its residents \) demonstrated , mr mortimer is n't interested in studying these matters in a ponderous , academic way rather he is content to dispense his sociological observations in passing while giving the reader a charming comedy of manners , full of eccentric characters , absurd liaisons and wacky subplots the same sort of thing that made his rumpole of the bailey novels so deliciously entertaining though the results are frequently as funny as those produced by evelyn waugh , there s none of waugh s viciousness or malice it s obvious that mr mortimer sides with the lovers of a pastoral past , but he remains remarkably evenhanded in his satire , sending up the sentimental excesses of the green welly brigade even as he reserves a modicum of sympathy for his awful hero , the right honourable leslie titmuss , secretary of state for housing , ecological affairs and planning \( heap \) titmuss , as readers of paradise postponed will doubtless remember , is a scheming , socialclimbing member of parliament who has risen to his current position of prominence from an impoverished childhood in the rapstone valley his politics are impeccably rightwing , his wealth vast , his power seemingly secure when we first meet him in titmuss regained , he has achieved all but two of his ambitions he had reached high office in a government which had ruled the country for so long that most young people could not remember another and he had survived some temporary embarrassments , such as the death of his wife in the antinuclear protest at worsfield heath , to become a national figure he was respected , enjoyed , if not liked , as a sardonic wit , a card , a man who gave honest utterance to the feelings of all ordinary citizens and who did n't give a damn for what the liberal intellectuals thought of him titmuss s two remaining ambitions are to become prime minister and to make a brilliant second marriage he wanted a wife who would make him the envy of his few friends and , more satisfactorily , his many enemies the first , even the arrogant titmuss concedes , is probably beyond him the second he sets about accomplishing with somber dispatch the object of titmuss s marital campaign is one jenny sidonia , the beautiful widow of a highly respected oxford don central to titmuss s efforts to woo jenny is rapstone manor , an impressive country house that looks out upon acres of gardens and woodlands titmuss has already gone to rather extraordinary lengths to acquire this mansion , and it now appears that he will have to go even further to hang on to it if the fallowfield developers have their way , the mansion will soon be surrounded by expressways and malls titmuss has the power to block the developers , but it s not so easy for him simply to veto their proposal after all , as a gungho conservative who has made his reputation praising the virtues of the freemarket economy and denouncing rich socialists with converted farmhouses , he ca n't just reverse himself and take the side of the conservationists to do so would be to open himself to charges of hypocrisy and conflict of interest to prevent the fallowfield development and hold on to his reputation for fairness , titmuss comes up with a complicated plan involving blackmail , political gamesmanship and dealings with some unlikely allies those allies include fred simcox , a leftwing doctor who has developed a crush of his own on jenny dot curdle , a loudmouthed rabbit farmer whose livelihood is threatened by the development plan , and hector bolitho jones , the warden of the rapstone nature area and an ardent environmentalist pledged to fighting anything that might endanger rain forests , the black rhino , badgers , otters many of the subsequent developments in titmuss regained seem contrived , silly , even downright preposterous subplots bloom and wither digressions proliferate to no apparent purpose loose ends go untied oddly enough , none of these problems really seem to matter in the course of relating his meandering story , mr mortimer creates so many amusing characters , dispenses so many funny apercus that the reader quickly forgets the novel s slapdash plot and remembers only its charms photo john mortimer \( rosemary herbert \)
nearly 10 years after its debut , the electric opening number of william finn s breakthrough musical , march of the falsettos , remains emblazoned in memory a handful of leapfrogging young performers , backed by a jazzy band , charged forward on a red stage at playwrights horizons to sing merrily about the neurotic plight of four jews in a room bitching what followed was just as unorthodox march of the falsettos told of marvin \( michael rupert \) , who left his wife and son for a man named whizzer \( stephen bogardus \) only to lose whizzer and to watch his psychiatrist , mendel \( chip zien \) , move in on his abandoned family mr finn and his collaborator , the director james lapine , told this story in 70 minutes of songs that were far more melodious and touching than titles like my father s a homo and marvin at the psychiatrist \( a threepart miniopera \) might immediately suggest you ca n't go home again , of course , yet right at the beginning of falsettoland , mr finn s bracing new installment of the marvin trilogy that began in 1978 with in trousers , that surge of excitement is uncannily recreated and on the surface , little has changed falsettoland is set in 198182 , right after its predecessor the theater is again playwrights horizons , the director is again mr lapine , the running time is again 70 minutes , the stage remains red , the three terrific lead actors are back in place \( looking no worse for wear \) and , best of all , the music and lyrics still ignite as a mobile red door twirls about another emblem of falsettos the company exuberantly welcomes us to falsettoland , a figurative precinct whose landmarks include homosexuals , women with children , a teeny tiny band and one bar mitzvah for marvin s son , jason \( danny gerard \) that is scrupulously planned but just as it would be tedious for falsettoland to keep mimicking march of the falsettos , so it soon proves impossible an intervening decade cannot be stuffed into a closet while mr finn is blissfully back in full voice after several projects of esthetic drift , that voice has inevitably been tempered by time some of his ethnic humor seems a bit strained even as his sentiments about romance in hard times are more deeply felt mr lapine , perhaps reflecting his postfalsettos broadway success with stephen sondheim \( sunday in the park with george , into the woods \) , seems to be directing with more dazzling assurance than ever , creating a kaleidoscopic world of comedy and heartbreak with only seven performers , that red door and , as before , a few rolling chairs the biggest changes , however , are those that befall marvin and whizzer falsettoland is only a few numbers old when the happy reconciliation of these two lovers is clouded by the hospital observations of their friend dr charlotte \( heather macrae \) , an internist who lives nearby with her lover , a kosher caterer \( janet metz \) something very bad is happening spreading round sings ms macrae s doctor in a voice of unsettling , ethereal sweetness bachelors arrive sick and frightened they leave , weeks later , unenlightened what is happening is so bad that words have lost their meaning , she adds in 1981 , the word to describe what is spreading round had , in fact , yet to spread but mr finn finds his own words without losing the sense of humor that made march of the falsettos levitate , he has written an achingly articulate musical that copes with aids much as its characters do with denial , rage , empathy and even some small hope that what marvin s son , jason , calls a miracle of judaism will come to the rescue never maudlin , clinical or didactic but always , in some hardwon way or another , highspirited falsettoland is a musical of jubilance and courage , not defeat it must have taken exceptional fortitude to write , and it is by turns entertaining and devastating to witness this story needs an ending , sings the chipper company in the opening number there are hilarious passages on the way to an ending none could have foretold jason s extended family , who can turn even a catering debate into a conga line , visits a little league game and sings of watching jewish boys who cannot play baseball play baseball jason and mendel perform a highstepping vaudeville number titled everybody hates his parents in which mr zien s delightfully circumspect psychiatrist reassures his stepson that you grow up , you get old , you hate less even after the curtain dominating douglas stein s sleek set has become a hospital curtain , falsettoland does not surrender its right to a joke the evening builds to a bar mitzvah in the philip roth mode , though in jason s case the ceremony also proves to be the stirring spiritual initiation into manhood that satirical bar mitzvahs seldom are mr finn s more sober songs reflect a cultural sea change from falsettos , in which pretty boys were instructed to check for acne and the death of passion was the only one its young lovers feared there are several fullthroated ballads here , led by unlikely lovers , a soaring quartet of devotion in which the musical s paired homosexual couples vow to be scared together in you gotta die sometime , mr bogardus caps an altogether superlative performance with the ferocious , unsentimental blues of a man in his prime facing mortality when the moment comes for marvin to give in to tears and schmaltz and to take the audience with him mr rupert does so with his characteristic , eternally boyish tenderness in what would i do \? , a song that both mourns and resurrects the adored lover for whom he left his wife and child the soulsearching interludes for the heterosexual characters in falsettoland sometimes seem forced by comparison , especially the schematic anthem , heartily delivered by faith prince , in which marvin s former wife rises too easily to saintliness nor is the relationship between marvin and his son so intimately dramatized here as it was in falsettos this time , mr finn seems to broaden his characters a bit to keep them on their best behavior as if aids really did bring out the nobility in everyone and the consequences spill into his score , which , for all the shimmer of michael starobin s arrangements , could at times use more variety and vinegar such flaws do not seriously diminish the overall achievement , which culminates in a chilling finale that inverts the charged opening number so completely that everything from the performers' emotional and physical gravity to the set s red door to the meaning of playful lyrics \( we 're a teeny tiny band \) is transformed by the disease that has in the interim transformed a society this is where we take a stand , sings mr zien as he welcomes the audience to a new falsettoland where lovers no longer just come and go but live and die fortissimo that stand is a defiant one for music , love , laughter and miracles , jewish or otherwise , in a world where something very bad has been happening for so very long falsettoland conceived by william finn and james lapine music and lyrics by mr finn directed by mr lapine set design

as a result of a state regulation aimed at limiting prescriptions for such tranquilizers as valium , the use of such drugs has been cut in half , to 250 , 000 prescriptions a year in nassau and 150 , 000 in suffolk , according to state department of health officials the sharp drop since the law went into effect 15 months ago , health officials say , reflects increased caution on the part of doctors , whom the state had accused of writing too many prescriptions doctors attribute the decline to intimidation the regulations were promulgated when the state department of health in albany determined that patients were using too many benzodiazepines , a class of drugs that includes valium and librium some patients , they felt , were becoming dependent on the drugs and some were deliberately taking too much medication for euphoric effect certainly , fewer prescriptions have been written , and i will say i'm prescribing them less , said dr ralph bohm , president of the suffolk county psychiatric association but i'm not happy with that he said he felt he should be able to write prescriptions when indicated in setting up the regulations , he suggested , the state has issued an implied threat to physicians side effects of older drugs dr fritz henn , director of the department of psychiatry at the state university of new york at stony brook , believes the regulation encourage some doctors to prescribe older drugs that carry more possible side effects , it s a horrible , horrible direction to go , he said it means that people are so afraid of the regulation that they 're prescribing what are really relatively dangerous and very addictive drugs for the same thing they would have applied somewhat addictive , rather safe drugs for it s really sad but john l eadie , director of the state department of health division of public health protection , called the issue of substitution of less preferable drugs a red herring for every 100 fewer benzodiazepine prescriptions written , he said , 20 prescriptions were written for different drugs , of which only three were inappropriate the substitution problem , he said , is relatively minor , but the state will keep monitoring substitution drugs such as barbiturates or meprobromates , as it does benzodiazepines we would expect to investigate cases in which there have been allocations of illegal action on the part of physicians or where they 're prescribing is so completely beyond any of their peers that it would require on the face of it that it be investigated among other things , the state regulation virtually bans refills , restricts supplies to one month and requires prescriptions to be written in triplicate , with one copy each for the doctor , the pharmacist and health department files in albany the prescription forms must be used for all 12 benzodiazepines , from librium , the antianxiety drug now in its 30th year on the market , to the most recent addition to the group , the antiinsomnia medication halcion , first sold in 1983 state health officials , noting that at least 85 percent of the state s 60 , 000 doctors have used the triplicate forms for benzodiazepines despite the overall drop in prescribing , are hailing the program s success in deterring abuse of the drugs but doctors say the problems of abuse are overstated and that the regulation has served more to discourage legitimate use by creating a climate of fear patients' privacy is threatened and their medical condition put at greater risk with the use of lesssafe alternative medications , the doctors say some patient advocacy groups , meanwhile , say the regulation has some value , especially for the chronically ill elderly , of whom there are many on long island increased cost seen at the same time , however , the regulation has meant increased cost and stigmatization that has , in some cases , prevented patients from getting medication they need , according to reina berner , executive director of the manhattanbased alliance for patient welfare , a coalition of 50 health organizations it s costly and it s stigmatizing , she said the state began its push to include benzodiazepines in its 11yearold triplicate program in late 1986 at the time , the use of this group of drugs appeared to be hovering at dangerous levels or even rising after more than a decade of slow overall decline in use of some of the original types of drugs in the group , such as valium , according to mr eadie of the state health department we had been concerned , he said , that as many as 300 , 000 new yorkers had been getting benzodiazepines for a year or more when the drugs have only proven valuable in treating anxiety for up to four months and insomnia for up to a month our concerns were heightened by the fact that as many as half of the group were elderly citizens who could least afford the sedative and cognitive impairment and dependenceproducing effects of these drugs acting out of imtimidation but more than caution , doctors are acting out of intimidation , said dr richard s blum , administrator of the state medical society s impaired physician program and a nassau county internist for 27 years
washington , oct 24 the democrats won the political battle over the budget , almost all the washington scorekeepers were saying tonight , and gave president bush some nasty bruises in the process , but in the deepest sense , there were no victors the shaky compromise that apparently ended five months of confusion and conflict between the white house and capitol hill , between democrats and republicans , came far too late to avoid severe damage to the reputations of president bush , the congress and the government itself to a degree unparalleled since the late 1960 s , the ability of washington to discern and promote the common weal in effect , to govern is being widely questioned the doubt is demonstrated in the proliferation of proposals to limit the terms of legislators , but also in the electionseason comments of voters a democrat in pensacola , fla , challenged a visitor from washington this month to name a single person up there who really cares about helping the average guy , and a republican in cleveland argued that if every public official in the city lost his job , and every job was filled by someone just out of college , the government could n't be any worse than it is right now antigovernment bandwagon even mr bush , whose flipflops on tax policy over the past few weeks helped to deepen the evolving crisis of confidence in government , has been trying to identify himself with the heartland and not the capital a man who has spent most of his adult life on a governmental payroll , the president exclaimed the other day that it was wonderful to be out campaigning among real people who had nothing to do with politics the constant denunciation of politicians and process by journalists , scholars , the public and even by politicians themselves can only weaken the already feeble public inclination to participate in politics by voting but in the short term , the president and his party were clearly more heavily damaged than the democrats with the midterm elections less than two weeks away , republican candidates are reeling republican senators jesse helms of north carolina , rudy boschwitz of minnesota and mark o hatfield of oregon , all of whom had seemed headed for easy reelection a couple of months ago , are all in peril now , at least partly because of the events in washington representative tom tauke of iowa , who had been given a good chance of ousting senator tom harkin , a democrat , appears to have fallen back in the latest polls an image that hurts david keene , a republican political consultant , said the bottom has dropped out for gop candidates as bob dole , the canny kansan who leads the republicans in the senate , foresaw weeks ago , the democrats have succeeded in reviving the imagery of the 1930 s , when herbert hoover and the republicans were stigmatized as the party of the rich sensing a populist rebellion against the easy money and ostentation of the 1980 s , the democrats have seized upon the code word fairness and painted themselves as the champions of the middle class president ronald reagan s political alchemy persuading almost everyone that lower taxes meant more money for almost everyone appears to have lost its magic with mr reagan s retirement inevitably , opposition control of both houses of congress , by a larger margin than faced by any other incoming president , meant that mr bush would have to yield some ground if he wanted to push through a deficitreduction package although many republicans still dispute the point , others believe he had no choice but to abandon his cherished nonewtaxes pledge bush s unruly troops but tactical ineptitude has meant he had to abandon more than that he fell back from his insistence that there could be no tax increases unless there was a cut in capital gains taxes , then from his insistence upon some other sort of growth initiatives , then from his bottom line that while he could accept other tax rises , there could be no increase in basic income tax rates by this morning , his negotiators were reduced to negotiating not about the substance but about the form of a soaktherich element in the package a white house aide commented sourly , the democrats have redrawn the battlefield so thoroughly that we could n't fight for the millionaires any more mr bush s job was made much harder by his inability to control the republicans in the house , who voted against the first package he helped to negotiate and showed little sign today of backing the latest one their willingness to defy the president in an election year was greatly increased by the defection of representative newt gingrich of georgia , a crucial figure in the republican leadership in the house , who made it all too clear early on that he , leadership or no leadership , would support no tax increases at all mr bush let him get away with it , in a way lyndon b johnson or richard m nixon would never have dreamed of doing they would have been on the phone themselves , threatening unspeakable sanctions this time , the white house has said little beyond the mild comment today by his press secretary , marlin fitzwater , that there would be penalties for the rebels what kind of penalties \? ca n't tell you , he said if we told you , it would n't be a surprise democrats elated , for now the president s strength on other issues will undoubtedly be affected by his leadership failures on the budget today , for instance , he barely mustered a third of the senate , losing a halfdozen republicans as he averted an override of his civilrights veto the budget compromise finally became possible because the democrats , none too early , realized that they had won and had better declare victory their mood was nicely caught by representative thomas j downey , democrat of suffolk county , who commented , it s one thing to tax people s pocketbooks , another to tax their patience it is a heady moment for the democratic leadership on capitol hill , which has been ridiculed in the last few years for inept tactics of its own in particular , house speaker thomas s foley of washington and representative richard a gephardt of missouri , the majority leader , have enhanced their reputations but the partisan tides will ebb and flow often between now and mr bush s reelection campaign in 1992 what happens in the persian gulf and what happens to the economy as a whole will probably have more to do with his prospects than what has happened in washington this summer and early fall indeed , some republican members of congress suspect that he purposely has invited opprobrium now to get the budget fracas behind him and give the economy every possible chance to rebound by 1992 , putting his own reelection interests ahead of theirs still , it seems unlikely that mr bush will ever recover the aura of omnicompetence that he had for his first 18 months in office one of the longest presidential honeymoons on record and it seems equally unlikely that the american public will quickly regain faith in the competence of their government and its leaders
indiantown , fla , may 28 an amtrak passenger train struck a tanker truck loaded with sewage sludge today and 9 people were injured none of the injuries were serious , the authorities said the accident occurred about noon at a rural crossing between indiantown and okeechobee in southeast florida lieut jim howell of the florida highway patrol said the truck driver was ticketed for failure to stop at a railroad crossing
i'm sure i must have heard his name a few times as i was growing up , but i do n't think i ever actually read anything by voltaire until the early 1960 s when , as a halfhearted graduate student of english literature , carefully husbanding a student deferment during the vietnam war days , i was assigned an essay comparing candide and samuel johnson s rasselas both books had first appeared in 1759 i went on to learn a good deal more about dr johnson , but voltaire had served his purpose , and was forgotten by 1965 the army was , for various reasons , no longer a threat to me , and i abandoned a halffinished dissertation and came to new york to earn my living as a dealer in rare books about two years ago voltaire resurfaced there was no special reason for his reappearance beyond a chance accumulation on my shelves of about a dozen 18thcentury english printings , not from any plan , but simply because no one seemed to want them very much it must have been a slow day at the shop , and i remember thinking that it might be rather amusing to build a small collection of voltaire as he was published in england during the course of his lifetime his continental editions i rejected as being too numerous and outside my usual area of interest the first step , then , was to learn the limits of my chosen universe this would have been a slightly cumbersome task 25 years ago , but technology has gradually made its way into the antiquarian book world , and i now had access to some rather powerful tools , such as the eighteenthcentury short title catalogue \( estc \) , a data base available in most large libraries , whose purpose is to record every book , pamphlet and broadside printed in english or , for foreignlanguage texts , in the englishspeaking world , between the years 1701 and 1800 , and to provide the locations of actual copies where possible and across my desk was a metal cabinet containing more than 9 , 000 microfiches this is the national union catalogue , compiled over the years at the library of congress this catalogue tries to list every book printed up to 1955 of which copies may be found in the institutional libraries of north america it is not complete , or wholly accurate , but it is impressive nonetheless there are almost 4 , 200 entries for voltaire alone , each representing a different printing with these , and a few lesser sources , i was able to compile a list of about 450 printings of voltaire up to the end of the 18th century now all i had to do was find them i was a bit surprised by the size of my project , but in a way this was encouraging , because it meant , if nothing else , that voltaire had been of substantial interest to his english contemporaries a similar list , say , for henry fielding , whose dates \( 170754 \) fall entirely within those of voltaire \( 16941778 \) , would be no longer , and fielding was by any standard one of the great literary successes of the period and british as well the profusion of voltaire also meant that his books were not too hard to find , and by the end of a year i had accumulated some 40 titles in about 75 different printings it was now time to look more closely at what i had , and i entered into a world of often bewildering complexity take candide , for a start during 1759 no fewer than three different english translations had appeared , two in london and one in edinburgh before the year was out one of these had gone into a second edition and another had been pirated in dublin , where cheap reprints were often manufactured for export to the colonies there were even two london printings in french , both apparently produced by a bookseller named john nourse , with whom voltaire seems to have maintained some contact through his geneva printers , the cramers this international connection has one surprising consequence we know from surviving documents that the text of candide was first set in type in geneva in january 1759 a copy was then dispatched to nourse in london for reprinting and distribution to the frenchreading english market the original was followed closely , and the two editions indeed look much the same each has 299 pages , and each has a leafy ornament on the title page with a little post horn sticking out at the top if one puts the two side by side it is not hard to see differences in typeface and layout , but superficially the resemblance is close but there is a catch voltaire , like many an author before and since , made some lastminute changes after his text had already been sent off to england as a result the two editions are not , after all , quite the same the most notable difference occurs on page 242 , where the london printings have a paragraph beginning , candide etait afflige this passage goes on to speak in a rather critical way of contemporary german poets and has been interpreted as an oblique attack on frederick the great , the homosexual autocrat of prussia with whom voltaire had a long and involved intellectual relationship voltaire apparently had second thoughts about this paragraph , and it does not appear in any surviving copy of the geneva edition only the london printings remain as testimony to his first intentions the 1759 english translations are from the london text , and somewhere in england there may survive a copy of the frenchlanguage geneva edition in its unrevised state this would be a very valuable little object indeed exactly what it would be worth is anyone s guess 50 , 000 \?
manama , bahrain , feb 21 nineteen months after the iraniraq war ended , the teheran government is still viewed as a clear danger by several conservative arab oilproducing countries in this region the strong hostility felt by arab governments toward the revolutionary islamic government of teheran has been a stumbling block in the way of improving diplomatic relations saudi arabia has none with iran , while kuwait and bahrain are moving slowly to upgrade their diplomatic ties to ambassadorial level iraq is still technically at war with iran more important for teheran , the poor state of relations with its persian gulf neighbors is blocking economic cooperation iran has not succeeded in obtaining much help from western europe or from the soviet union enmity toward iran is strongest in saudi arabia , where the semiofficial press described the teheran government on sunday as a major sponsor of terrorism officials from saudi arabia and other gulf nations said in interviews that they were now certain that iran was behind the continuing series of killings of saudi diplomats , including the most recent killing of three saudi consular officials in bangkok this month several saudi diplomats have been killed over the last three years in a number of countries by shadowy organizations believed to have direct ties to iran , western and arab intelligence officials say here in bahrain , foreign and arab diplomats say the government is wary about a quick improvement of relations with iran , especially as teheran continues to provide sanctuary to an underground group known as the islamic front for the liberation of bahrain the front s existence became known in november 1987 , when it set up its headquarters in teheran bahrain has accused iran of being responsible for at least one attempt to organize a coup against the island iran , which is predominantly shiite , is also said to have tried to recruit bahraini shiites who make up about 60 percent of the island s population of 400 , 000 , as agents kuwait , which is warily seeking to improve ties with iran , continues to hold at least 15 prisoners convicted of several acts of sabotage , including an attempt to kill the country s emir , sheik jaber alahmed alsabah several kuwait businessmen said last week in kuwait that their government had not encouraged any followup on an invitation by iran to increase trade between the two countries several senior arab officials in the region say they have yet to see convincing evidence that iran has abandoned the notion of using shiite muslims to subvert the governments of kuwait , saudi arabia and bahrain arab officials in the region say iran continues to use the united arab emirates , with which it retains friendly ties , as a major base for intelligence gathering and recruiting agents american diplomats in the region confirm this , saying that dozens of iranian intelligence officers operate in the emirates of abu dhabi and dubai while the united arab emirates , kuwait and bahrain continue to show restraint in their statements about iran , saudi arabia is engaged in a furious propaganda war against teheran in an officially inspired campaign against the iranian government , several saudi newspapers on sunday accused iranian rulers , among other things , of being mentally retarded and bent on sponsoring terrorism and subversion throughout the gulf arab diplomats here said the saudi attack on sunday was a result of riyadh s anger over the killing of its diplomats in bangkok the continuing dispute between the two countries over saudi restrictions on the pilgrimage of iranian muslims to mecca remains a major factor arab officials here said they did not expect any iranian pilgrims to be allowed into mecca by saudi arabia this summer , for the third straight year the issue arose in 1987 , when about 400 iranian pilgrims were killed in rioting in mecca , many of them shot by the saudi security police shortly after this incident , saudi arabia said it could no no longer accept the number of iranian pilgrims proposed by teheran more than 150 , 000
fort lauderdale , fla , oct 16 the obscenity trial of the rap music group 2 live crew began here today , with the volatile ingredient of race added to already complex arguments about artistic freedom and a community s right to restrict sexual material the evidence is irrefutable , an assistant state attorney , leslie robson , told the sixmember jury she was referring to a primary exhibit for the prosecution , a 45minute audio tape of a performance by the 2 live crew at a local nightclub on june 10 the tape was made by an undercover squad from the broward county sheriff s department the prosecutor added , you 're going to hear graphic descriptions of sexual intercourse , anal intercourse , oral intercourse she said the jury would hear references to women being abused and urinated upon , and to the group s simulation of deviant sexual acts but the jury may not hear as much as the prosecution had hoped the recording , which was played in the courtroom today while the jury was absent , was of such poor quality that many lyrics are unintelligible and the prosecution suffered a setback when judge june l johnson of broward county court agreed with the defense that a transcript of the tape contained comments that might distract the jurors and said that it could not be admitted as evidence in his opening statement , bruce rogow , the lead lawyer for the 2 live crew , said the group s performance had to be understood in the context of hip hop , a form of black popular music that arose in the last few years some of the fourletter words , he said , reflect exaggeration , parody , humor , even about delicate subjects , like sexual practices these words , as crude as some people find them , he said , can have artistic value when you have an understanding , when you have them , in effect , decoded music critic is witness to decode the group s performance , the defense expects to call among its witnesses john leland , a music critic for newsday , who is considered an expert on hip hop music and henry louis gates jr , a professor of american literature at duke university who has written about rap as a part of black culture mr gates will portray the 2 live crew as literary geniuses , said allen jacobi , a lawyer for the group the prosecution has said they will call only two witnesses , the lead detective in the case , eugene mccloud , and another detective , debbie werder the case is the latest chapter in a national debate over local obscenity statutes and freedom of expression in cincinnati on oct 5 a jury acquitted a museum and its director of obscenity charges stemming from an exhibition of photographs by robert mapplethorpe that included several sexually explicit images but this case is different from the mapplethorpe matter , which involved the work of an established artist who was praised by the arts establishment the music of the 2 live crew , released on a small , independent label , advertises itself as an expression of the black ghetto , not necessarily accessible to critics or other outsiders lyrics are at issue lyrics to many songs on the group s album as nasty as they wanna be consist almost solely of relentlessly coarse accounts of the singer s lusts and sexual adventures typically , the singer brags about the physical power of his penis , refers to a woman in terms of her genitalia and commands the woman usually addressed as bitch to gratify his desires for genital , oral and anal sex the leader of the 2 live crew , luther campbell , and two band members , christopher wongwon and mark ross , both face misdemeanor obscenity charges if convicted , each faces up to a year in prison and fines of up to 1 , 000 another member of the group , who did not rap that night , was not charged george freeman , the owner of a florida record store , was convicted two weeks ago in broward county of obscenity charges for selling the 2 live crew album , which had been declared obscene by a federal judge in that case , the album was on trial this time the band s performance , which included four songs from that album , is on trial the members of the audience at that performance had to be 21 and older , and spectators at the trial today had to be 18 supreme court standard according to the standard set by the united states supreme court , an artistic effort can be judged obscene if it appeals primarily to prurient interest , if it is patently obscene by community standards and if it lacks serious artistic , literary , political or scientific merit the broward county detectives taped the performance on microcassette recorders , which are better suited for recording conversations than for music the transcript , which was made by the lead detective in the case , included many of the lyrics but mr rogow pointed out that many of the lyrics were missing and that the transcript included editorial comments like graphic lyrics and girls onstage the transcript also includes snippets of the detectives' conversation detective werder 'it s on' detective hassett 'how do you turn it off \?

boston , sept 17 with a provocative remark about blacks and then angry attacks on the news media , john r silber , a candidate in the democratic primary for governor , has thrown tuesday s race into turmoil , apparently leaving francis x bellotti in the lead a poll published over the weekend in the boston globe showed mr bellotti , a former massachusetts attorney general , leading dr silber , president of boston university , 48 percent to 37 percent the poll , of 457 likely voters , has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points but with massachusetts voters angry at conventional politicians for a prolonged budget crisis , it was unclear whether mr bellotti , who is 67 years old and first ran for governor in 1964 , could hold his lead over the acerbic dr silber , who has depicted himself as the candidate of change both candidates seemed to have damaged themselves in the past week mr bellotti with a rambling debate appearance and dr silber by saying in a televised meeting that he had not campaigned in predominantly black sections of boston because there is no point in my making a speech on crime control to a group of drug addicts but some polls suggest dr silber s remark has generated more support among white voters a bluecollar appeal indeed , although dr silber s comments have outraged many massachusetts voters , they seem to have appealed to many disaffected bluecollar voters who believe the democratic party has become too liberal by the very extremes of his remarks , he is perceived by some voters as an honest candidate willing to say what others are afraid to say the third democratic contender , lieut gov evelyn murphy , withdrew last monday from the race after a comicopera attempt to seize power while gov michael s dukakis was on a trade mission in europe mr dukakis , the 1988 democratic nominee for president , is not running for reelection the democrats' mistakes , along with massachusetts' continuing budget problems , have helped the state s small republican party , which will choose between two candidates for governor steven pierce , the minority leader in the state house of representatives , who is a strong opponent of abortion and william f weld , a former united states attorney who supports a woman s right to abortion mr pierce had been ahead in polls , but mr weld has surged in the last few weeks with a blitz of television advertisements that poke fun at mr pierce for repeatedly filing his tax returns late the republicans , who make up only 134 percent of the registered voters in massachusetts , have not won the governor s race since 1970 a taxcutting proposition but whoever wins the democratic and republican primaries might have to cope with a proposition on the november ballot that would roll back taxes to 1988 levels , forcing the next governor to cut an estimated 2 billion a year from the 13 billion state budget the proposal is sponsored by the citizens for limited taxation , a conservative group led by barbara anderson , who helped win an antitax proposition in 1980 that has limited the ability of local communities to raise property taxes while ms anderson has acknowledged that there will be big cuts in human services , welfare and health care if the proposition is approved , she has said she is confident a new governor and a new legislature can restructure government from the bottom up despite the likelihood that approval of the taxcutting proposition will have drastic consequences , the plan is popular , having picked up further support since july when governor dukakis enacted the largest tax increase in the state s history while imposing spending cuts totaling 8 percent both republican candidates for governor back the proposal , while the two democratic candidates oppose it 'a public nervous breakdown' so far none of the four contenders have inspired voters with a new vision of how to cope with the state s declining economy after an extraordinary decade of growth in the 1980 s , massachusetts has tipped into recession , with unemployment rising to 67 percent in august , double its rate a year earlier the economic downturn has meant a sharp drop in state revenue , intensifying the budget problem despite this sense of crisis , the globe said in an editorial last week that it would not endorse a candidate for governor , contending that all the candidates had done was raise a babel of politicsasusual bombast without facing up to the unpleasant political and economic truths the boston herald has endorsed dr silber , although he has repeatedly denounced the newspaper s coverage of him as being distorted the globe said dr silber , an articulate , forceful man who has helped build boston university into an important institution of higher learning , flunked selfcontrol and selfdiscipline 'a threat to democracy' dr silber s propensity for making provocative remarks was evident again last week with his comment about not campaigning before drug addicts , which a number of blacks denounced as racist although he has a record of support for civil rights , dating to the 1960 s when he was dean of the university of texas , dr silber soon found himself in a shouting match with television reporters pressing him over his comment at one point , he said , this is why television is a threat to democracy to try to undo the damage , dr silber invited television reporters to cover him at what he said would be a speech on crime the next day at a street corner in roxbury , a black section of boston but his appearance rapidly degenerated into street theater , with one black woman , priscilla flint russell , yelling that she was not a drug addict and then shouting , hey , man , get out of here ! i 've got no time for that fanaticism , dr silber retorted , abruptly ending his television appearance the next day ms russell was arrested on charges of passing a bad check , and it turned out that she had pleaded guilty last year to defrauding a bank of 67 , 800 , according to court records silber s appeal and liabilities the incidents underscored both dr silber s appeal and his liabilities in speaking so bluntly the incidents also recalled the divided reaction in an earlier debate when dr silber suggested that the state should consider rationing medical care when you 've had a long life and you 're ripe , then it s time to go , he said mr bellotti pounced on the remark , contending that it showed dr silber s insensitivity to the elderly but dr silber replied that he only wanted to point out the need to contain rapidly rising medical costs on the republican side , mr weld is widely considered a more formidable candidate in the general election he is on the popular side of the abortion question in massachusetts and has raised more money than mr pierce , a 12year veteran of the legislature a republican can win this year , said tom kiley , another democratic consultant who is not connected to any of the candidates these voters really want to vote for change , and sooner or later they are going to find a way to do it , regardless of how badly the candidates perform photo francis x bellotti , right , seems to be leading the democratic race for governor of massachusetts , according to a recent boston globe poll \( associated press for the new york times \) john r silber , president of boston university and a democratic candidate for governor , has made some politically damaging remarks in recent weeks \( associated press \)
bice if mikhail s gorbachev had wanted a good lesson on the triumph of capitalism , he might have truncated his sightseeing in minnesota and worked into his schedule a lunch at bice in manhattan never have i seen an enterprise take off the way this milan restaurant spinoff did three years ago and today , right in the middle of a downturn in the food industry , it is cruising along as if no one had bothered to tell it that times are tough what is bice s recipe for success \? in the early days , when i found the food to be satisfying but nothing exceptional , i chalked it up to the chic , cosmopolitan scene there unknowns , even with reservations , were greeted with the warmth usually accorded to census takers but nobody seemed to mind waiting in the bar , further enriching coffers by downing a bellini or two today , though , the more mature bice is more accommodating , better about honoring reservations and , best of all , turning out some splendid dishes bice is one of the handsomest italian restaurants in town at this time of year , the glasspaned wooden doors that form the streetside wall of the restaurant are swung open , creating a semioutdoor cafe in the bar the main dining room , done in beige and wood with brass sconces and recessed , indirect lighting , has a multipeaked ceiling crisscrossed by wood beams the room can become loud when the convivial

oil , garlic and sundried tomatoes another , filled with ricotta and a puree of asparagus , has a sublime sauce of fresh crayfish and a fresh crayfish stock tortelloni , a plump raviolilike pasta , have a lusty filling of pureed potatoes and pancetta seasoned with fresh rosemary the chef has extremist views on the issue of al dente pasta , which once led to the return of a dish and at other times left us chewing more than we should have after the rigatoni with eggplant and mozzarella came back from the kitchen further cooked , it was delightfully subtle if you yearn for a fine linguine with clams , bice s version , an occasional special , is superb sweet baby clams are tossed in a sauce of strong olive oil , parsley and clam broth two risottos sampled had a perfect resilient texture and creamy consistency one with fresh spinach and parmesan cheese , the other generously seasoned with saffron and holding bits of italian sausage the pastas \( but not risotto \) may be ordered in halfportions as an appetizer other worthwhile starters include the crostino of mozzarella and tomato seasoned with oregano and basil marinated goat cheese with fresh asparagus and mushrooms , and warm carpaccio of beef with marinated vegetables the most unusual starter was a special one evening called gelato di parmigiano , which is aged parmesan cheese mixed with whipped chilled cream and egg yolks , served with sliced pear rich , but a startling and delicious contrast of flavors and textures the brisk waiters here are not big on chatter , thank heaven , but they go about their work with dispatch the wine list , mostly italian , is well chosen no bargain by any standard , but not extortionate main courses are essentially uncomplicated trattoria fare grilled butterflied baby chicken with rosemary is reliably pleasing \( but the potatoes with it are bland \) , as is paillard of chicken with herb butter roasted guinea hen , a special , was particularly well executed , the sliced leg and breast meat moistened with a lively sauce of balsamic vinegar and honey just enough honey to blunt the sharp vinegar the black angus sirloin served with mixed roasted peppers had exceptional flavor , even though overcooked swordfish was dry on two occasions , although an herbcrusted salmon was moist and vibrantly seasoned , served with asparagus my seafood odds were 5050 on another evening , when grilled red snapper covered with wilted vidalia onions was pleasantly sweet , and unseasoned tuna steak garnished with sauteed bean sprouts was a bore if you try just one dessert here , it has to be the remarkably moist and citric orange cake with chocolate frosting chocolate polenta is a good idea , light and minimally sweet , with white chocolate sauce and espresso granita can both cool and recharge your batteries on a sultry summer day bice s tiramisu is too sweet for my taste , so i would opt instead for any of the homemade gelati , or maybe a pear sorbet spiked with pear

washington , jan 21 the 101st congress returns to work on tuesday in a world made new in the two months since the end of its lackluster first session , events in eastern europe and in panama have created a set of new and thorny issues in addition to taking up the old wars over capital gains , child care , clean air and drugs , the lawmakers now confront how to reshape the pentagon budget and where to apply the proceeds if any of the peace dividend social security and retirement a proposal by senator daniel patrick moynihan , democrat of new york , to cut the social security tax and reorganize the bookkeeping for the retirement system promises to become a fierce battle and cause turmoil for both parties and shift the battle lines on cutting capital gains taxes the investigation of seven influential senators on charges of improper conduct and influence peddling has underscored longfestering problems with the campaign finance system leaders in both parties are now talking seriously about taking action this year to overhaul the system it seems to me we have to find some way to get a handle on how much we spend to get elected , said senator bob dole of kansas , the senate republican leader the house speaker , thomas s foley of washington , noting republican willingness to consider limits on campaign spending , said on the nbc news program meet the press today that major campaign reforms would be passed the political climate has changed as well the george bush who last year offered congress his hand in partnership , is now enjoying the highest public approval rating for this point in a term of any president since john f kennedy he is stepping up attacks on congress as the 1990 midterm elections approach and the positioning for the 1992 presidential contest begins 'it s putuporshutup time' lawmakers of both parties expect a more combative relationship with the white house and a more partisan edge to their own proceedings right now the president is doing well with the american people , said representative william h gray 3d of pennsylvania , the house democratic whip but as we get into the substance of the second year , some tough decisions and leadership are going to be needed it s putuporshutup time the same might be said for congress its leaders insisted at the close of the 1989 session that judging the legislative record at that point would be as unfair as calling a football game at halftime over the weekend , a small group of activist house democrats huddled with the majority leader , richard a gephardt of missouri , and with poll takers and media consultants , for discussion and advice the major legislative issues in a 1990 session that will be shortened by the demands of campaigning , several major issues loom clean air on tuesday the senate will begin debating the first major overhaul of the nation s pollution laws in 13 years the house will take up its version in the spring acid rain controls , alternative fuels and cost relief for the midwest remain issues of contention , but congressional leaders are comitted to passing a bill this year child care in the house , the leadership must reconcile competing measures the issue is whether to set up a new program of grants to the states that would require annual spending approval or to expand an existing program of automatic aid a senate bill combines the new grant program with expansion of existing tax credits for lowincome parents mr bush favors the tax credit approach , but may balk at the congressional price tag drugs and crime a handful of bills introduced last year in response to mr bush s drug and crime proposals may be amended to incorporate new ones he will make this year congress is likely to approve additional money for drug control , but differences remain over how it should be allocated housing democrats in both chambers want to provide money for construction of lowrent housing while the president has proposed emphasizing home ownership for the poor house and senate bills are still awaiting committee action two disputed laws running out meanwhile , at least two perenially contentious laws are due to expire this year one regulates the sale of advanced and military related technology to foreign countries and the other governs agriculture programs , including price supports for farmers congress must decide on the export law how to treat the new governments in eastern europe the farm bill will be affected by electionyear pressures and environmental and budget concerns the budget , of course , will dominate the session , and debate will be framed by decisions on pentagon spending how much can be cut to reflect a reduced soviet threat and should the savings , when they eventually appear , be applied to domestic programs or reducing the deficit \? my strong inclination is to have the lion s share of savings go to deficit reduction , said senator jim sasser , the tennessee democrat who heads the senate budget committee he sees 12 billion to 15 billion in military savings this year is it a peace dividend \? other lawmakers , especially republicans , see a much smaller amount and possibly none at all this soon anyway , it s not a peace dividend , said representative newt gingrich of georgia , the house republican whip it s a peace nonexpense the list of programs competing for a share grows daily , and for the first time in many years it includes foreign aid we 've bumped into the fact that in six different places in the world , our clout as a country depends on our ability to deliver some dollars , said representative charles e schumer , democrat of brooklyn we ca n't keep saing that we 're the leading power in the world but that japan is going to pay for it dole s suggested aid trims senator dole got the foreign aid debate off to an explosive start before congress s return when he suggested that money for some of america s largest recipients of aid , including israel and egypt , be cut by 5 percent to make room for new aid to eastern europe as for capital gains , democrats succeeded in blocking a rate cut last year , but had been resigned to the inevitability of its passage this year , assuming that their main battle with the president would be how to shape it as the senate majority leader , george j mitchell of maine , noted with evident relish , all of that has changed in the wake of mr moynihan s proposal and the president s attack on it most democrats have been cautious in responding to the moynihan plan , fearing it would raise the specter of cuts in benefits mr moynihan has exposed , for all to see , the inconsistencies of the bush administration s tax policy , mr mitchell said we ca n't cut taxes for the middle class and working class according to the president , but we should for the very wealthiest of americans but mr gingrich said a president with an approval rating as high as mr bush s could afford to do whatever he wants to about moynihan mr mitchell said there is a curious premise that suggests if a president is doing well , congress must be doing poorly but the premise never seems to operate in reverse , so i 've never accepted it photo it seems to me we have to find some way to get a handle on how much we spend to get elected , said bob dole , the senate republican leader \( agence francepresse \)
if you fed the speech patterns and the thought patterns and the moral patterns into a computer , without any identifying details , the computer would maybe hiccup a bit at the sleaze being forced into its microchips and would then flash back the message subject george m steinbrenner 3d the computer could tell by the slippings and the slidings , the insinuations of deep friendship , the vows of total honesty , the abject admissions of teenyweeny mistakes of judgments way back when , the claims of fear for loved ones , the quick leaps of thought , the dragging in of extraneous people , that this could be only one person this could be only the man convicted of illegal campaign contributions , suspended from baseball , reinstated to baseball , admitted by naive officials into the top echelon of the united states olympic committee , and then pardoned on jan 18 , 1989 , by president reagan that george steinbrenner sounds just like him steinbrenner comes through in all his glory from a transcript of hearings with commissioner fay vincent on july 56 , as revealed yesterday in the pages of the national the commissioner s office says the case will not be affected by the publication of the transcripts , which is good , because it sounds as if fay vincent has a good grip on what george knew , and when he knew it up to now , there has been some question as to whether paying 40 , 000 to a creepy gambler was enough of an offense to remove steinbrenner from baseball for a while or forever it is no secret that many people , including some fans , some players , some writers , and some baseball officials , would like to see a world in which yogi berra would want to return to yankee stadium for oldtimers' day but vincent has wisely assured steinbrenner that he will not be judging the owner on any subjective basis however , there is the matter of 40 , 000 that steinbrenner admitted paying to howard spira , a known gambler steinbrenner has told many different versions of why he gave the money to spira the most obvious one seems to be that spira had inside information on dave winfield , a former yankee player against whom steinbrenner had a morbid and destructive vendetta did anybody say to you , 'george , suppose this guy takes the money and pays off gambling debts you are now an owner in baseball financing a gambler \? ' vincent asks steinbrenner not only that , but vincent seems to bore in on the fact that the payments were , as vincent delicately says , not intended to be easily observed this seems to be where we came into this movie steinbrenner s campaign violations in 1972 were accomplished through his putting the muscle on employees back in cleveland history repeats itself leopards do not change their spots what goes around comes around given the chance to explain himself to vincent , steinbrenner does what steinbrenner does he wiggles and he squirms and he changes the subject and he drags in his loved ones so many of us who have met the man over the past two decades have been asked , early on , geez , take it easy on me in this story , huh \? my \( wife \) \( son \) \( daughter \) \( best 2yearold \) are not feeling too good right now some bad publicity could really hurt it is not surprising to old georgewatchers that he says one of the reasons he paid off spira is you do n't know what i went through i just wanted to get him the hell out of my life and my family s life you do n't know what it s like when you 've got a guy out there calling and threatening to kill people in your family or other people s family vincent , in the transcripts , has some serious questions about why steinbrenner , with all his resources , did not report spira to the authorities george , however , does not stop there he is willing to besmirch the names of two former yankee executives who , he says , were taking goods and selling them it gets worse steinbrenner even says he was worried that spira would spill information on lou piniella s sports betting habits this is a low attack on a man who once was such a favorite of steinbrenner that the players called him george s boy piniella does indeed spend a lot of his time and money on the horses did steinbrenner know something worse about piniella \? if so , why did n't he do something about it while the man was playing and managing with the yankees \? no , steinbrenner saved this morsel , this truth or this lie or this rumor , until steinbrenner was in trouble steinbrenner used lou piniella to buy a few minutes of digression with the commish , who issued a statement yesterday absolving piniella none of this may matter in this transcript , fay vincent seems to have a fine mixture of legal clarity and moral awareness is it just possible that george may now be given more time to work with his new pals on the olympic committee \?
philadelphia , feb 23 and then there were none with a violent churn of andre agassi s stomach just after midnight thursday , the ebel pro indoor tennis tournament lost the last of its top three seeded players the event , which has become infamous for a schedule crammed with matches that extend well into the witching hour , put itself further into the dark when agassi s withdrawal because of food poisoning left it virtually starless first , boris becker , the defending champion , was otherwise engaged , at a tournament in stuttgart , west germany , and unavailable to defend his title here at the spectrum not to worry , said the tournament director , marilyn fernberger , who stocked the roster with three other players from the world s top six cast seemed durable we have john mcenroe , and he s the best drawing card in 29 years , fernberger had said of the fourtime champion the ebel figured it had explosion value in mcenroe , grit appeal in brad gilbert , and the requisite window dressing in agassi but on wednesday , the upsets began gilbert , seeded no 2 , was felled by paul haarhuis of the netherlands , who last september knocked mcenroe out of the united states open haarhuis , ranked 69th , has credentials so obscure that , at the open , he described himself as coming from mars he was less selfdeprecating thursday night upset removes mcenroe gee , i could win the whole tournament , haarhuis said before losing this afternoon to seventhseeded andres gomez , 76 , 67 , 64 in the very next match on the program wednesday , the topseeded mcenroe was tumbled by the unheralded richey reneberg not in 15 years had the ebel had to absorb such a blow anyone could win now , said mark kratzmann , a 23yearold australian who reached the quarterfinals by downing reneberg in the third round and tonight became only the second qualifier in nine years to advance to the semifinals , when he defeated eighthseeded jim courier , 46 , 63 , 76 it s a very frustrating game , mcenroe said , especially when you know you 're not as good as you were that s the ultimate punch in the stomach but the ultimate punch in the stomach was suffered by the thirdseeded agassi , on thursday night something in the sauce even before eating the fateful dinner of pasta before his match against pete sampras , a lanky 18yearold californian who has registered grand slam knockouts against veterans like mats wilander and tim mayotte , agassi was queasy at the time , however , he was fighting superstition rather than the nausea purportedly caused by contaminated spaghetti sauce since the superstitious believe that trouble often comes in threes , agassi worried that he might be next in the line of overthrown favorites but what finally undid him was his inability to shake off the nausea , which descended three games into the match , sent him to the restroom at 23 of the second set after he had won the first , 75 , and forced him to retire after sampras evened the match by taking the second set , 75 agassi s demise left the ebel with just two players from the top 10 the fourthseeded jay berger and the fifthseeded mayotte completing the trend , mayotte lost , 64 , 46 , 63 , tonight to sampras , who had eliminated him from the australian open in january , and in the evening s last quarterfinal , berger fell to petr korda , a 22yearold czechoslovak , 76 , 61 photo andre agassi showing his discomfort , apparently from food poisoning , before he forfeited his match thursday in philadelphia \( associated press \)

if you have any doubts that new yorkers are in a thrifty mood these days , just drop into the teeming dining room of rose cafe , an upbeat american restaurant on lower fifth avenue that serves singledigit appetizers and main courses that peak at 19 the success of this sixmonthold effort is even more impressive considering it occupies a space that has seen two higherpriced flops in the past three years , mosaico and 24 fifth avenue rose cafe is owned by richard krause , the former chef and coowner of the defunct melrose in greenwich village , and two partners , stewart rosen and philip scotti the three dining areas can be somewhat close and at times loud , but not excessively so the flamboyant tiles and bold colors of the late mosaico have been replaced by soft eggshelltoned walls and simple cylindershaped sconces a glassenclosed sidewalk terrace affords an animated urban panorama judging from the dress code at rose cafe , patrons ca n't decide whether this is a stylish new dining spot that happens to have low prices , or merely a glorified neighborhood canteen you find everything from dark suits and smart dresses to new york university sweatshirts and halter tops mr krause s menu carries at least one hit reminiscent of melrose irresistible little potato pancakes with a dollop of creme fraiche and three kinds of caviar one gutsy starter is the beanless duck and venison chili , which has a nice delayed kick of cayenne clam chowder is emboldened with lightly smoked bacon , leeks and corn , and two bright , fresh salads can be recommended the enormous mound of chicory with smoked bacon and crumbled goat cheese , and the warm new potato salad with string beans , strips of lightly smoked sturgeon , and bacon in a mustardy vinaigrette considerable attention is paid to choreographing the pretty lobster salad , but the truffle dressing with it was pale crisp , cornmealcoated crab cakes , sweetened with roasted red pepper and corn , pack a nice peppery aftertaste they come with a creme fraiche sauce flavored with red peppers one alluringsounding starter is a salad of lentils and tempura of red onions the lentils are delicious , aromatic of rosemary and enlivened with redpepper oil , but the onion tempura \( essentially onion rings \) is on the greasy side we never got too far with the steamed mussels in a saffron and shallot cream sauce the first mussel inspected was long deceased , and the second was in critical condition the genial staff here has to hustle to keep up with the crowds , and only occasionally do they or the kitchen fall behind rose cafe has assembled a wideranging wine list mostly french and american at sensible prices among whites , there is an entredeuxmers from chateau bonnet \( 18 \) and , if you want something with more character , the 1988 la crema chardonnay \( 22 \) in reds , two good choices are the merlot from the 1987 hogue cellars in washington state \( 22 \) and the 1985 fetzer barrel select cabernet sauvignon \( 21 \) as a graduate of the california school of grilling , mr krause has a deft touch over the coals this can be seen in the grilled chicken with a subtle mustard cream sauce flanked by wellseasoned spring vegetables light , cleanly fried shoestring potatoes on the side did n't last long at our table two other grilled items excel salmon steak that is nicely blackened outside and deep pink in the center , along with a similar vegetable medley and charred tuna with a zesty vinaigrette combining sweet mango , tomato and green onions a flavorful shell steak came off the fires a bit more cooked than requested , and with a pallid green peppercorn sauce watery and bland mashed potatoes provided little compensation a better bet would be the terrific brittleskinned peking duck with plum sauce and thin sheets of scallion pancakes , or tender roasted saddle of rabbit paired with linguine in a basil and tomato cream sauce spaghetti with a leek and cream sauce was memorable mostly for the portion size the morelflavored sauce had a pleasing subtle flavor , but the veal meatballs standing guard around the plate were exceedingly dry for dessert , three superlative choices are the raspberry tart , light but intense chocolate souffle cake , and plumraspberry crisp with creme fraiche two allamerican options are the crusty apple crisp sweetened with raisins and currants , and the runofthemill strawberry shortcake there were few takers at my table for the strawberry lemon pudding cake , which was more of a pudding than a cake and was drowned in strawberry sauce and we could n't resist the banana split , a glass canoe listing under the weight of ice cream \( excellent dryedged coffee , wonderful tahitian vanilla \) , a banana , whipped cream and , of

of the dozens of orchestras that regularly visit new york , none generate quite the air of expectancy that accompanies the arrival of the vienna philharmonic a skeptic might attribute that in part to the cumulative effect of publicity that over the years has established it in the minds of concertgoers as the most glamorous of all international ensembles but the doubts of even the stubbornest skeptic might have been swept away by the mahler third symphony that the viennese performed under james levine s baton on tuesday evening at carnegie hall the musical responsiveness of this orchestra may be a legend , but it is no myth certainly not , at any rate , when it is playing mahler , whose music is in its bones , under a conductor who enjoys its confidence mr levine , who is sharing leadership of the vienna with leonard bernstein during this fiveconcert visit , asked the musicians for technical precision , but never at the expense of ardor they delivered both under other hands , this orchestra has sounded more concerned with beauty of tone than literal accuracy for mr levine its attacks and releases were honed sharp , no doubt in response to the conductor s temperament and artistic preferences and yet mahler s peculiar air of wild abandon and his splashy tone palette were always glowingly apparent great orchestras adjust to different leaders with a communal sixth or seventh sense , almost involuntarily giving to maestro x a plush sonority , to maestro y a lean one , or to maestro z a barely controlled cataclysm of emotion real or mock mr levine , whose connection with the orchestra extends over 15 years , made quick connection with it on this occasion the opening movement , taken at an unusually swift tempo and an overpowering sense of urgency , vacillated grippingly between funereal moods and brighttoned , crunching march tunes the horns , warmer and woodsier in tone than those in most american orchestras , played magnificently in these contradictory pages the brass did falter momentarily in the final pages of this 105minute performance , its endurance tested beyond limits by extraordinarily expansive pacing , but a couple of bent or cracked notes here did little to diminish admiration for what had gone before \( mr levine outdid even mr bernstein in stretching the heartbreaking finale out to 27 minutes , which if not a record must be close to one at the other extreme , sir georg solti has zipped through the movement in a bit over 19 minutes \) like some other conductors , mr levine took a full intermission after the long and strenuous opening movement , for which he finds precedence in one of mahler s own performances however , other than the opportunity such a break affords for bringing the mezzosoprano on the stage , the practice is hard to justify it does nothing to help sustain mood or to concentrate attention marilyn horne gravely intoned nietzsche s doomhaunted poetry in the fourth movement and , with understandably more vitality , the wunderhorn excepts in the fifth in the latter brief episode , the westminster symphonic choir and the american boychoir joined her in one of mahler s endearing excursions into folksy pseudonaivete the nostalgic posthorn solo that comes as the trio of the third movement s scherzando another memorable interlude in mahler s third was played offstage with utmost poignancy by someone the program did not identify the anonymous he or she , however , contributed mightily to the night s triumphant success the program the vienna philharmonic , james levine , conductor marilyn horne , mezzosoprano westminster symphonic choir , joseph flummerfelt , director american boychoir , james litton , director at carnegie hall mahlersymphony no 3 in d minor photo james levine , who led the vienna philharmonic on tuesday evening \( jorg reichart \)
washington , may 8 president saddam hussein asserted today that iraq had acquired a secret american electronic device that could be used to detonate a nuclear bomb and that it was now able to make the detonators itself if true , the iraqi president s assertion means that an operation failed in march , when the british authorities , working with the united states , seized a consignment of americanmade capacitors , or triggering devices , bound for iraq referring to the seizure of the capacitors at heathrow airport in london , president hussein was quoted by reuters as telling political leaders in baghdad , only five days after the united states announcement about the socalled nuclear triggers , our fighters at the ministry of industry and military industrialization succeeded in producing similar capacitors to those socalled triggers the president displayed two of the new iraqimade devices , which are designed to produce intense bursts of electrical energy , as well as an object that he claimed was an americanmade capacitor a smuggling success \? can this detonate a nuclear bomb \? he asked rhetorically i have n't seen a nuclear bomb , but this is one of the capacitors they talked about , of which they did not capture all , he said he was apparently implying that iraq has suceeded in smuggling some of the devices out of the united states and copying them president hussein s boast that he has acquired more of the knowledge needed for developing nuclear weapons is the latest in a series of provocative acts by him in recent months that have aroused widespread fears that he is bent on establishing iraq as the dominant military power in the arab world in april , he threatened to use poison gas against israel if it attacked iraqi territory , as it did in 1981 when its warplanes knocked out a nuclear reactor israel contended was being used to develop an atomic bomb last month britain also accused president hussein of trying to build a gigantic supergun capable of lobbing shells hundreds of miles , after blocking the sale of high quality steel piping that it said was intended to become the barrel questions are raised there s no way of knowing if president hussein s claim is true or not all one can say is that it raises questions about his real intentions , said leonard spector , an expert on nuclear proliferation at the carnegie endowment for peace in washington in vienna , however , the international atomic energy agency said tuesday that it carried out a routine inspection of iraq s nuclear facilities in april under the terms of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , which iraq has signed , and found no evidence that sensitive material was being diverted for military ends the bush administration said it was looking into mr hussein s claims but did not know if they were true an administration expert said it seemed suprising that iraq had tried to smuggle high quality capacitors out of the united states if it was close to discovering how to make them but he added that the united states did not know very much about many aspects of iraq s military plans iraq has said it needed the american capacitors for research on lasers sales from california but the head of a californiabased electronics company that makes capacitors said iraq might have suceeded in upgrading to military quality some lower grade instruments that his company sold the country last year monson hayes , president of maxwell laboratories inc of san diego , said iraq tried to buy a consignment of fast capacitors suitable for military use from him last year but the sale was blocked by the administration but mr hayes said his company received permission to sell iraq about 150 lower quality capacitors and speculated that iraqi scientists might have suceeded in copying and upgrading them mr hayes speculated that iraq had also tried to buy a second consignment of military quality capacitors from another california company , csi technologies inc , earlier this year because it wanted to copy elements of them into its own emerging design jerry kowalski , president of csi , which was involved in the march operation against iraq , said he was certain that none of his company s capacitors had reached iraq mr kowalski s company reported the iraqi order and then pretended to cooperate with the purchasers who were intercepted in london as they prepared to load the capacitors onto an iraqi airliner bound for baghdad
auburn hills , mich after spending years climbing the ladder toward basketball s pinnacle , the detroit pistons finally reached it last season they won the national basketball association championship , they exorcised years of frustration , and they dominated the league with a tough , unapologetic style that was loved by their fans and loathed by their critics but on the eve of this year s playoffs , the defending champions are showing signs of vulnerability since march 22 , the pistons have a mediocre 78 record the los angeles lakers , who had the league s best regularseason record , are favored by many to replace the pistons as champions and the philadelphia 76ers , led by charles barkley and the former piston rick mahorn , have replaced detroit as the team with the most defiant disposition are the defending champion pistons soon to become the former champions \? that question will be answered during the playoffs , which begin thursday night but the pistons , who open at home against the indiana pacers , have issued fair warning to those who have predicted their demise challenge noted and accepted we know everybody wants to knock us off , but we 're ready , said vinnie johnson , detroit s veteran guard we 've never gone into the playoffs as the champs , and that will mean more pressure but we feed off that we 've always been like the bad guys anyway other teams do n't like us fans do n't like us but we look at it as a challenge if we win backtoback championships , people still may not like us but they 'll have to respect us ever since their allstar guard , joe dumars , broke his hand in march , the pistons have been inconsistent dumars returned april 10 , but neither his level of play , nor the team s , has returned to midseason form lesson from injury during one midseason stretch , detroit looked almost unbeatable , winning 25 of 26 games and holding seven consecutive opponents to fewer than 100 points the big question for the pistons is can they recapture their highest level of play during the playoffs \? i do n't know , said chuck daly , the pistons' coach i think that injury to joe made us a little more aware of our vulnerability but maybe it was a blessing in disguise when you win 25 out of 26 , it gets a little unreal , and you start to believe that maybe you 're not able to lose it seemed as if every time we were in trouble , we were able to pull games out but i think maybe the last month has put a little shock into us , a little reality and hopefully , that sense of urgency will carry over into the playoffs thursday s 10797 loss to philadelphia was particularly troubling to the pistons there was an ugly benchclearing brawl between the two teams that resulted in numerous fines and brought onegame suspensions for barkley , bill laimbeer , and scott hastings aside from the fracas , the pistons were upset because they lost three of their four games against philadelphia this season they 've pretty much got our number , daly said i 'd say they 're the team to beat in the eastern conference but deep down , daly and the pistons believe they are still the team to beat hardly anyone in the nba disputes that the pistons are the best defensive team in the league and that suffocating defense has become their identity , the life preserver they cling to when they are in danger we 're a great defensive team because we have several guys who love playing defense and who do n't consider playing defense a chore , said brendan malone , one of the pistons' assistant coaches versatile contributor dennis rodman gives us the luxury of having a defensive player who can guard every position , malone said he can defend robert parish , charles barkley , michael jordan and because rodman is so good , we do n't have to doubleteam as much , which makes it more difficult for our opponents to create open shots then , besides rodman , we have joe dumars , who has many of the same qualities strength , quick feet , and he takes pride in playing defense isiah thomas can put as much pressure on the ball as anyone , and john salley is an underrated defensive player , a shotblocker who can change shots with his long arms then the rest of our team helps each other defensively as well as anyone in the league there s no secret formula to playing defense our system is good , but if you do n't have players who want to play defense , no system will work the no 1 reason we expect to go far in the playoffs is because we know we can stop people despite their lateseason slump , the pistons remain a closeknit group they have avoided the fingerpointing and internal problems that can lead to the downfall of successful teams the players say daly s leadership is a major reason why from the day he got here , chuck has always treated all of us like men , johnson said he realizes we all have egos , and we all have strong ideas about the way things should be done but some coaches hold a grudge , and in trying to prove that they 're the boss , they mess up a player s confidence , which in turn messes up the team
omaha , june 4 about a month ago , after a particularly dismal performance at the plate , domingo mota , the starting center fielder for cal statefullerton , received a latenight call it was from home his father had watched the game and noticed that the 20yearold domingo seemed completely out of sync at the plate his stance was closed and he seemed to be seeing the ball too late they talked briefly , and the next day his father drove from los angeles to fullerton and spent 40 minutes in a batting cage with his son a week later , the problems were gone under normal circumstances , a coach might have complained about outside interference in this case , the help was welcomed domingo s father is manny mota , the former los angeles dodger outfielder who once was one of the national league s most feared pinchhitters 'always an inspiration' my dad was always an inspiration to me , said domingo , a 263 hitter with the titans , who were eliminated from the college world series today by the citadelhe was always talking hitting i used to go to dodger stadium and hit with him all the time we 'd go early , and i 'd take batting practice with him , then we would shag balls in the field i really have a lot of good memories of those days mota played high school baseball in santo domingo but came to los angeles in the summer to play baseball and pick the minds of his father s teammates or friends if i needed advice , i could ask juan samuel , how do you turn a double play , or when i used to catch , my father would introduce me to tony pena and mike scioscia domingo , the fourth oldest of manny and margarita mota s eight children , is the third mota to play at cal statefullerton jose , 25 , played on the school s 1984 national collegiate athletic association championship team and is currently in the san diego padres' organization at the class aaa level andy mota is with the houston astros' class aa team a younger brother , gary , is at a junior college in fullerton and is expected to be chosen this week in the pro baseball draft never pushed by father my father never pushed us into the game , said domingo i always liked to play i 've been playing since i was a little kid following my dad to stadiums going to dodger stadium was always a big deal , especially sitting up in the stands when they announced his name whenever he was going to pinchhit , i remember how i 'd get nervous and i 'd start praying despite his father s success as a pro , domingo said it was his older brothers who sparked his interest in playing college baseball domingo played high school baseball in santo domingo , even coached his team as a senior and won a high school tournament he went to canada college in redwood city , calif , as a result of his father s involvement in an association that recruits players from puerto rico , venezuela and the dominican republic and helps get them into two and fouryear colleges in the united states before his brothers' success in college , domingo had entertained the notion of going from high school directly into pro ball his father would hear none of it i came up in an era when most of the players did n't go to college , the elder mota said from los angeles , where he works in several capacities for the dodger organization i wanted my kids to have education i do n't want them to be frustrated if things do n't work out domingo is glad that he took his father s advice a physical education major , he expects to graduate next year and may not turn pro even if he is drafted this year if i get drafted , i 'll see what the offer is , but most likely i wo n't sign , he said i 'll finish school and play second base here next year there s no rush the citadel survived seven errors as it eliminated california statefullerton from the college world series monday with an 87 victory in 12 innings the citadel , making its first appearance in series , will play louisiana state or oklahoma state tuesday

something is wrong with me i ca n't rejoice at the great news heaven knows , all kinds of important people are telling us to sing and dance the president of the united states , columnists and editorial writers , professors , and also prince louis ferdinand of prussia , head of the house of hohenzollern they are ringing bells and sending congratulations to chancellor helmut kohl and president mikhail gorbachev for getting together and working out the big deal mr gorbachev drops his opposition to german membership in nato , which he could not stop anyway , and gets promises of heavy german money and trade chancellor kohl rids himself and his country of the shortterm annoyance of soviet kvetching about german membership in nato but more important he earns a deserved reputation as the smartest , most successful and most powerful leader in europe , west or east , and quite probably the world the competition is not all that tough , but you have to hand it to mr kohl for beating out the prime minister of japan mr gorbachev may have been the man of the 1980 s but the way things look mr kohl will grace the cover of the history of the 1990 s now why am i not singing like a lark \? after all , i know that german unification , which never thrilled me , is an accomplished fact , and that the best we can do now is pray for the best , with minimum snarling realpolitik , mr gorbachev calls it with a huge smile a good word for it because it has plain connotations of cynicism and expediency for soviet acquiescence the germans are willing to pay billions of marks mr gorbachev needs the money and they can spare it , in wise expectation that it will be seed money for the growth of german economic and political power in the east but it is not the details of the germansoviet deal that are so troublesome it is the realization that it is the official opening of a new era of world politics and that we do not know where it will lead us headlines in the times explain the queasiness bowing to the inexorable soviets make the best of new german might germany makes the most of its newfound power and this poignant one bush declares he does not feel left out by gorbachev and kohl \( no , of course not mr kohl just went to see mr gorbachev , worked out an economic , political and military understanding of world importance and filled mr bush in the next day mr bush sent congratulations who said anything about left out \? \) it s worth facing realities , though we cannot change them 1 the west was caught dead in the water by the collapse of communism , never believing those soviet rebels who kept saying it was inevitable 2 the death of communism sent masses of east germans into west germany instead of saying hold on , as victors in world war ii we want a controlling voice in the unification process , the west and the soviet union watched slackmouthed as mr kohl waved at them from his speeding unification steam engine 3 unification creates a different german nation , not only stronger economically but moving on its own political track it is already the first alleurope power , strong in east and west mr kohl has worked out moscow s expensespaid troop withdrawal fine now get ready for demands that american troops , like soviet , withdraw from germany 4 the west hopes the advantages of belonging to the european economic union will chain germany down maybe , but european union will also make germany even stronger the chain will hold fast as long as germany wishes 5 none of the above need be a world disaster just as long as the current support for democratic ways never fades among germans , just as long as there will never ever be a german leadership that uses a crisis as the excuse for getting economically or politically nasty with the rest of europe 6 if you believe such guarantees exist , ring bells and cry joy if not , wait awhile wait , but do n't go away i know people who were reluctant to visit germany or get involved with it because of memories and fears that need no explaining i was one of them not anymore the memories will never fade germany is so much a part of our past today we cannot do much more than visit , watch and talk with germans but we cannot do less , because now germany is so much a part of our future
almost a year ago , charles e williams traded a twostar army general s hat for a gray hard hat , and now he spends much of his days at school construction sites , surrounded not only by dust and rubble but also by an air of hope the general , as his associates call him , has been assigned the imposing job of building 50 new schools and 30 annexes and remodeling 70 other schools for a new york city system that is badly overcrowded and decaying he has been given 43 billion , but only five years to do this school construction has historically suffered huge delays and cost overruns , and the workmanship has generally been shoddy but the general has quickly established a reputation for a kind of spitandpolish discipline and for wresting command of construction from the bureaucrats and private contractors not a single job is behind schedule , he says , and several are ahead of schedule 'how to work , how fast' we just do n't have behind schedule in our vocabulary , the alabamaborn mr williams says , with characteristic selfconfidence i'm going to tell you when to work , how to work , how fast to go if you want my contract , this is the way you have to go officials at the board of education , from joseph a fernandez , the chancellor , to robert f wagner jr , the president , said they have been impressed in his nine months as head of the new york city school construction authority , mr williams has started construction or renovation of more than 20 schools in the last decade , the board of education , striving to recover from the city s fiscal crisis , opened only 14 new schools and 15 minischools or annexes mr williams s crisp approach was evident on a recent tour of three sites in manhattan and the bronx at each , he cajoled or charmed his project managers , pushing them to shave weeks off the deadline i want the pupils to have the school as a christmas present , he told al sergany , who was supervising an addition to public school 152 at 93 nagle avenue in washington heights the annex , which will allow the overcrowded school to take 300 extra students , is scheduled to open in january felicita villodas , the principal of ps 152 , thanked mr williams for canceling work on a day students needed quiet to take their citywide reading tests later , at a renovation at dewitt clinton high school , william dougherty , the assistant principal , complimented mr williams s managers for consistently giving the school enough notice to juggle classroom schedules 'complete turnaround' i have been through a modernization before and all the horror stories you 've heard about are true , mr dougherty told mr williams , referring to clinton s renovation 22 years ago so i appreciate the complete turnaround that has taken place if the general has been criticized , it was for the salaries he has been paying the general is paid 145 , 000 and three vice presidents are paid 110 , 000 but mr williams said he must pay salaries comparable to private industry to get people who understand design , construction , who are credible if i want a chevrolet , i'm going to get it , he said in a recent interview if i want a cadillac , i 've got to pay the price and i feel the kids in this town deserve the best i'm determined to have people on board as talented as those who work for trump or tishman or any of the other longball hitters in town the authority was created by the state legislature in december 1988 as an independent agency that would take over from the board of education the job of designing and building public schools its financing was patched together from new york city general obligation bonds and from municipal assistance corporation funds exempted from wicks law it typically takes 8 to 10 years to select and to obtain approval for a site and , then , to design and to build a school to cut that time in half , the legislature permitted the authority to forgo landuse reviews and a host of other preconstruction steps , and it let the authority eliminate undesirable contractors from the bidding pool most significantly , it exempted the authority for five years from the wicks law , which requires municipal agencies to hire separate contractors for plumbing , electricity and heating instead of having a general contractor in charge of the work the wicks law has been criticized for crippling construction by failing to place anyone in charge there are stories of painters and plasterers completing their work , and electricians then coming in to make holes for the wiring in a report last month , the city bar association in new york suggested that the legislature did not go far enough , and that loopholes still limited the authority of the prime contractor nevertheless , mr williams believes he has been given enough power to do the job on time he feels he will be able to get around cumbersome union work rules you have to demand performance , he said he has been firm with contractors , who he says , have occasionally tested his spine

jerusalem , june 16 the flags still flutter , the posters still scream and the blank petition forms still lie on a folding table , waiting for more signatures from angry citzens but the electoralreform protest center just across the street from the president s residence has been abandoned for a week , ever since prime minister yitzhak shamir formed a new rightwing government for more than two months , eliad shraga , a young lawyer , lived there in a tent on the street , the symbol of a campaign to change the way that israelis choose their government he and several hundred thousand other angry israelis had come together in an effort to eliminate the haggling over coalitions that is a result of the splintering that characterizes israeli politics but all the speeches , letters , petitions , posters , marches and demonstrations seem to have gone for naught as for mr shraga , he s gone to eilat , the israeli resort on the red sea , explained a friend who wandered by the organizers of the largest political protest in the nation s history insist that more protests are planned but even with more than half a million signatures on petitions for electoral change , the movement appears to have accomplished almost nothing within hours of taking office on tuesday , mr shamir made it clear that he intended to make no particular effort to address the citizens' demands half a million people or more are convinced that something has to be changed , mr shamir told the jerusalem post but it s not clear to these people what has to be changed in the system of government , or how the matter should be left to parliament , the prime minister said , knowing that in its present formulation , parliament is most unlikely to fundamentally change itself bills have been submitted calling for direct popular election of the prime minister as it stands now , the party leader who is able to form a governing coalition becomes prime minsiter automatically if one of the direct election bills is passed , the prime minister will be elected much as the american president is and would be able to appoint a cabinet of professionals but because the prime minister would still need parliamentary support for his or her initiatives , and because parliament could still throw him or her out of office with a majority vote , many advocates of change say the proposal is inadequate no one is pressing for the change that most grassroots organizers agree is needed , direct election of legislators israelis vote for national parties , and any party getting even 1 percent of the vote wins a seat in parliament there are now 17 parties in parliament , and none can gain a majority without several others direct election of legislators would diminish the power of tiny parties because the small parties oppose this , the large parties are afraid to propose it uriel reichman , dean of the law school at tel aviv university and the bestknown public advocate of electoral change , supports direct election of the prime minister , saying , we 're going to have do this in stages , and this is just the first stage eighteen months ago , after a coalition government of the two largest parties , likud and labor , was formed following two months of haggling , both parties vowed to enact electoral change within a year nothing occurred when the year passed another coalition crisis developed in march , and the popular anger rose again but now , even after a new government imbroglio and unparalleled show of public support for a change in the system , my estimate is that another crisis is needed to complete the process , dr reichman said this week
washington , march 20 debris from a secret american spy satellite has begun falling from space and burning up from the heat of reentering the atmosphere , the pentagon said today the defense department would not identify the nature of the pieces that were falling from space or their number , but said they were associated with the secret mission of the space shuttle atlantis launched last month two of the items have already entered the earth s atmosphere , said pete williams , the chief spokesman for the defense department the remaining pieces are expected to decay within two to four weeks the united states space command in colorado springs is tracking the objects , and mr williams said none were expected to reach the ground to threaten life or property secret shuttle cargo the pentagon has never identified the cargo that the atlantis carried into orbit on feb 28 but people with the aerospace industry and the national aeronautics and space administration said it was a 500 million satellite designed to fly over the northernmost areas of the soviet union , taking detailed pictures and intercepting communications last friday , the soviet news agency novosti said soviet space specialists were tracking four large pieces of an american spy satellite that broke up on march 7 the disabled satellite mentioned by agency is believed to be the one launched by the atlantis the defense department then said in a short , vague statement that hardware elements carried into orbit by the atlantis last month were expected to fall from orbit soon experts familiar with the american military spy satellite program said over the weekend that they understood the newest surveillance spacecraft had malfunctioned after its release from the shuttle it is unclear how serious the malfunction is , but some experts said the loss of the reconnaissance satellite could be a serious setback to american intelligence gathering from space other experts said the objects reentering the atmosphere might be shrouds or covers that were intentionally separated from the satellite in deployment , and might not represent a breakup of the spacecraft mixup tied to errant craft denver , march 20 \( ap \) a wiring mixup was responsible for sending a 150 million communications satellite into a useless orbit , says the maker of the rocket that carried the craft into space officials of the company , the martin marietta corporation , said mondday that engineers had mistakenly wired the titan 3 rocket to carry two satellites into space when only one was aboard the rocket s only payload was a fiveton intelsat 6 communications satellite , which failed to separate from the titan s upper stage after its launching last wednesday
washington at a meeting with some war hawks several weeks ago , one of them told me that we owe saddam hussein a favor he saved us from the peace dividend that was no favor unless there is a war , the major cost of the risky new venture in the middle east is the failure to reduce our defense budget in response to the dramatic developments of the past year the soviet empire has collapsed soviet troops are scheduled to leave czechoslovakia and hungary in a few months and east germany in a few years germany is unified and will substantially reduce its military forces the outcome of this process is uncertain and may still be dangerous in different ways , but the cold war is over and we won ! yet the defense budget included in the revised budget resolution approved last week would spend nearly 300 billion dollars in response to the threats of a world that no longer exist indeed , real defense spending for fiscal year 1991 which specifically excludes all present and future expenditures for the persian gulf operation will be about 10 percent higher than total defense spending at the peak of the vietnam war all of the major weapons programs are continued , and only small reductions are scheduled for the us forces now stationed in europe and asia a failure to make major phased reduction in the defense budget is the primary reason why our political leaders , for the first time in us history , have agreed to a large tax increase after a major war a more responsible post cold war defense budget would reduce real annual defense spending by 50 percent by the end of the decade at least three of the four new strategic systems in the current budget should be scrapped the b2 bomber , the mx and midgetman missile system and the new d5 missile for the triton submarines president bush has proposed to maintain 195 , 000 troops in europe and more than 100 , 00 in the far east against a threat that is rapidly disappearing we should remove and demobilize all of our forces in europe , japan , korea and the philippines sometime before our good friends ask us to go home there is no longer any reason to race to develop an advanced tactical fighter or a spacebased missile defense system on the other hand , we need a good closesupport aircraft and some limited defense against strategic missiles none of these opportunities and problems have been addressed there is broad bipartisan support to cut the defense budget while people may differ on how the peace dividend should be spent , that issue requires both peace and a peace dividend , the prospects for both of which have been threatened in the past several months yet even some of those who most ardently support our new persian gulf venture recognize that the current defense budget is not responsive to the new political and military realities deep defense cuts can be made , and my own preference is to commit all defense savings to some combination of deficit reduction and , not only no new taxes , but a reduction of those taxes that most limit economic growth the reason for my preference in a new reality of our own making the federal deficit was about four percent of gnp in the eighth year of economic recovery the growth of productivity has been slow for 17 years and the economy is now in a period of negative to slow growth , increasing inflation and falling dollar at a time when our financial institutions are unusually vulnerable and our ability to borrow abroad has been seriously reduced our defense budget should be based on the new economic realities at home there is still time for leadership in a world that has turned upside down in the pursuit of individual freedom and a market economy , an expansive and expensive vision of the american role abroad and of federal government at home is neither good economics , good politics nor good sense
getting fired is an awful experience , way up there with other big losses even in this era of massive layoffs , being shown the door is humiliating when it happened to me in 1987 , i took it very personally over and over , i asked myself what could i have done differently \? but to my surprise , getting the ax changed my life and about 75 percent of the changes seem to be good ones first for that 75 percent for one thing , i finally found confidence i had to throughout my life , family , friends , bosses and boyfriends told me that i had no confidence to get some , i piled up academic degrees , good jobs in prestigious corporations and years of long conversations with supportive friends none of it worked , at least not for long what forced me to believe in myself , particularly my judgment , was pure economic terror the job situation in my field , public relations , was terrible and getting worse i went on enough job interviews to figure out that no matter who hired me , i would be highly vulnerable to another layoff , especially since i would be the last one in so i did something that was very atypical for me i took the risk of starting my own consulting business for once in my life , i used my own head and did n't seek out or follow any expert advice i did n't attend one seminar or read one book on starting your own business what came out of my own head proved to be sound maybe that s because i was forced to exploit my strengths rather than fret about my real or imaginary weaknesses the business grew i got better clients i raised my fees i was even able to stick to my guns and ignore all the advice folks threw my way get a fancy office \( i continued working from home \) get a partner \( i work better alone \) get a staff \( i'm no good at delegating \) network more \( direct mail as a marketing technique works well \) the second change was in my social life it got better the startup demanded that i put myself and the business before everything else despite my having been a feminist in the 1960 s and early 70 s , i still went around doing what women are conditioned to do helping others when i started putting an appropriate value on my time , i began to attract betterquality people , both women and men third , i lost my chicken little perception of life that might be because the sky had already fallen , and i lived to tell the tale i quit worrying about the future and money i even committed myself to a mortgage and the payments on a new car fourth , i learned to fill out my own report card in the old days , i looked to bosses , the big guns in my profession and even therapists to tell me that i was doing ok i hope that will never happen again now , i am not only my own grader , i also hand out the rewards after landing a particularly big contract , i fulfilled a childhood fantasy by getting a dog but survival has its price and some of the changes in my life were n't so good since i was able to survive the upheaval in my career , i seem to have less compassion for those who , for whatever reason , do n't have a second act in them when they ca n't snap back from the loss of a marriage or that good job , i cannot seem to give them the kind of support i used to perhaps their fragility frightens me i 've also taken to bragging that may simply be one stage in the process of getting selfconfidence or it may come from having to learn to compete for business in a tough market most likely , it s a combination of both whatever the cause , i feel foolish afterwards and resolve to be more modest next time next time , though , i'm out there again , waiting for an opportunity to call attention to my accomplishments at least i'm getting a little more subtle about it the third trait i 've acquired is the most disconcerting , i 've become one of those people who want more even if i have n't figured out what i want more of gone is that part of me that was content and even grateful to have a little of this and a little of that i even get impatient with other people who are satisfied with their lives many who think that way often wind up in trouble but it s a struggle to find that fine line between maximizing one s talents and going into selfdestructive overdrive since i lost that job , i 've become a very different person with a very different life some people have said that i'm blossoming some have said , with their eyes , that i 've lost something as a human being and as i read about all the corporate downsizings and layoffs , i wonder what kind of people will emerge from those traumas i can only hope for them and for myself that we wo n't become a generation of walking wounded , much like our parents who lived through the great depression my dream is that in time i will forget why getting fired was once so important to me drawing
shun lee over the years i have found shun lee to be a culinary conundrum , harder to get hold of than mercury balls from a broken thermometer i have had some unforgettable meals here , and others that i would like to forget the variation from one visit to the next , or even one dish to the next , has baffled me of course restaurant reviews are based on the law of averages after three or more visits and a sampling of some 40 dishes , i look at the kitchen s overall performance , then assign a star rating in 1981 , shortly after it opened , shun lee was flying at twostar altitude by 1987 , it had dropped to one star recent visits indicate that the kitchen has refined its act markedly better yet , there seems to be a newfound consistency in the menu shun lee is certainly among the more elegant and comfortable uptown chinese restaurants patrons enter through the bar , where playful papiermache monkeys frolic overhead the amphitheaterlike dining room is done in black , creating a dramatic background for the tonguethrashing , redeyed dragons overhead appetizers , which used to be as precarious as some stretches of eighth avenue , have improved dramatically you can start with light steamed scallop or pork dumplings \( the scallop dumplings are heady with fresh coriander \) crispy pekingstyle panfried pork dumplings , or sweet prawns in a lovely blackbean sauce even the pork ribs , which can be so humdrum in many places , are meaty and have a light honey glaze other good starters are the cool hacked chicken in a vibrant sesame sauce with a peppery afterburn the exceptionally delicate , thinly sliced kidneys in a snappy sauce combining ginger , hot peppers and soy , and cold slices of duck breast in a hunanstyle hotpepper sauce fragrant with fresh coriander the only two dishes that did not excite were the doughy spring rolls and underseasoned , slightly greasy , deepfried softshell crabs the kinetic waiters could not be more vigilant or eager they hustle out with dishes in the order you request them and happily prepare plates , unless you prefer to dine family style and talk about steaming hand towels i have n't seen so many towels passed out since the last swim meet at my health club a modest wine list is available , as well as domestic and imported beers the cooks here are seasoning dishes with more zest than before , so if you are pepper shy make it known two sizzlers to watch for are the dry shredded crispy beef , which comes on sweet and crunchy and builds to a fiery crescendo , and sichuan scallops , mired in a sauce of garlic , ginger , scallions and hot pepper among the tamer selections is a satisfying combination of sliced chicken breast with black mushrooms , water chestnuts and snow peas orange beef , one of those touchstone dishes , had a nice bittersweet flavor from preserved orange rinds , but unfortunately the meat was chewy smoked duck tasted like ham \( which is all right , i guess , if you are in the mood for ham \) and came with a gummy hockey puck called a scallion pancake if you want duck here , get either the sliced duckling with a gingerrootandhotpepper sauce , or the wellexecuted peking duck side dishes sampled excelled bean curd with scallions and garlic , peppery chinese broccoli with garlic and lemon , and soothing cold sesame noodles somewhere along the line shun lee decided to serve fancy french desserts , which is about as befitting as amtrak trying to dish out shabu shabu forget the sodden , sweet profiteroles and the cloying ganache go instead for the fruit sorbets , fresh pineapple or what else \?

a manhattan jury yesterday began hearing john gotti s secretly recorded conversations words that prosecutors contend prove he is the nation s top organizedcrime leader the conversations , prosecutors assert , flowed from meetings mr gotti had in 1985 and 1986 with close associates about running the gambino mafia family in new york city and reaping millions of dollars in illicit profits often drenched with obscenities , the tapes also included mundane details about the high cost of dining out in manhattan , like three restaurant meals with champagne that cost the mobsters more than 3 , 000 the 14 tapes were obtained through courtauthorized electronic eavesdropping they were played as evidence at a state trial in which mr gotti is accused of ordering the shooting of a carpenters' union official in 1986 tapes are background evidence none of the conversations heard yesterday directly implicated the 49yearold mr gotti in the wounding of the union official , john f o'connor but justice edward j mclaughlin of state supreme court ruled the tapes were admissible as background evidence to support the prosecution theory that mr gotti , as a mafia boss , had the authority to order the shooting of mr o'connor in retaliation for the wrecking of a restaurant in a unionhiring dispute the restaurant was owned by an associate of the gambino family defense lawyers , in opening statements and through crossexamainations of technicians and investigators , have tried to show that the tapes are of poor audio quality and unclear and that they might have been altered by investigators to implicate mr gotti falsely as jurors and lawyers , aided by transcripts , listened to the tapes on earphones , mr gotti passed up the opportunity to listen in or to read the transcripts spectators in the courtroom could not hear the tapes mr gotti , as is his custom , was regally dressed in a dark gray doublebreasted silk suit and flaming red floralpatterned tie , with a matching lapel scarf 'cryptic references' explained during the three hours in which the tapes were played , edward wright , an investigator with the state organized crime task force , testified about what he described as cryptic references in the conversations to underworld activities mr wright also identified men nicknamed tony ducks , joe piney , frankie biz , ralphie bones , mikey gal and joe butch testifying about what he said were references in the tapes to the mafia chain of command , mr wright said cosa nostra meant this thing of ours , another name for the american mafia the boss , the insulated head of a family , or bougata underboss , the second in command or street boss consiglieri , a counselor to resolve disputes skipper , caporegime or captain , the leader of a regime or unit , and soldier and good fellow , an inducted member of the mafia questioned by a strike force lawyer , barbara a ditata , mr wright testified that mr gotti was a capo in the gambino family until december 1985 , when paul castellano , the previous family boss , died in his testimony , mr wright was forbidden by justice mclaughlin to say that mr castellano was shot to death in manhattan because that might be prejudicial mr wright said mr gotti took control of the family in january 1986 gotti portrayed as boss the central points that the prosecution tried to make with the tapes were that mr gotti and others referred to him as the boss and that he purportedly described how he would reorganize the gambino family the prosecution emphasized through the tapes that mr gotti spoke about his and the gambino family s relationship with the westies , a violent hell s kitchen gang the indictment says that members of the westies shot mr o'connor on may 7 , 1986 , as a favor to mr gotti according to a transcript , in a conversation on jan 18 , 1986 , shortly after authorities assert that mr gotti became the gambino boss , he said , get a year , gonna put this thing together where they could never break it , never destroy it later he said , maybe after 30 years it would deteriorate , but it would take that long to \( expletive \) succumb according to the transcript , mr gotti told an unidentified man on jan 11 , 1986 , me and you may socialize , but i ca n't socialize with these guys i ca n't bring myself down i'm a boss , you know what i mean 'yous still part of us' on feb 26 , 1986 , according to another transcript , mr gotti said he had told the head of the westies what do yous think , you 're a separate society , like i treated yous as a separate society , you own gang \? yous still part of us , an integral part of us' the tapes stemmed from bugs installed in a private room next to the bergen hunt and fish club , a social club in ozone park , queens , that authorities say was mr gotti s headquarters until early 1986 mr gotti and a codefendant , anthony \( tony lee \) guerrieri , 61 , who authorities say is a soldier in the gambino family , were indicted on state charges of assault and conspiracy the trial was recessed until tomorrow photo edward wright , an investigator with the state of organized crime task force , testifying yesterday at the trial of john gotti mr wright held a photograph of mr gotti and anthony \( tony lee \) guerrieri , a reported member of the gambino crime family , which the prosecution contends mr gotti runs \( pool photo sara krulwich \)
rrin the first game of a doubleheader between the boston red sox and the chicago white sox , someone , or some thing , pinchhit for the red sox pitcher , dick newsome , in the seventh inning this figure drew a base on balls , stole second , and then possibly disappeared forever it s all a mystery , said edward walton , a baseball historian , parttime employee of the red sox , and head of business administration for the university of bridgeport i 've tried to track it down but i 've hit a stone wall in all but one of the box scores of that sunday game , the batter listed was an olsen in one box , however , the name culbson appears in the baseball encyclopedia , the official major league player register , the olsen citation was picked up , and the single line for albert william \( ole \) olsen reads one game , one walk and one stolen base , in the season of 1943 nothing else it was n't me , al olsen , retired baseball coach of san diego state and a onetime red sox farmhand , said recently from his home in san diego i was a lefthanded pitcher i could n't hit my hat besides , i never played a game in the major leagues and , according to walton , it was n't the outfielder leon culberson \( not culbson , as it was written in the one box score \) a lot of baseball historians insist that it was culberson , said walton but they never bothered to talk to him i spoke to leon at a red sox oldtimers' game a couple of years ago , and he told me that he had just been brought up to the red sox from louisville that day , and played in the second game of the doubleheader he said that the manager , joe cronin , wanted him to sit beside him through the first game just to get a feel for the big leagues leon told me , 'i 'd certainly remember my first bigleague game' of all the wire services and newspapers that carried the box score , all but one had olsen the boston post listed culbson but , said walton , huck finnegan in the boston daily american mentioned that the second game , in which culberson started in center field , was his first game in the major leagues thoughts of this enigma resurfaced recently at the annual dinner of the new york chapter of the baseball writers association of america the names were read of all those baseball people who had died in 1989 one was leon culberson , who played six years in the big leagues , and who died last september the culberson puzzle was discovered in 1986 by robert lindsay , a professor of metallurgy at penn state , and an inveterate red sox fan he had seen olsen s name listed in the red sox media guide as an alumnus then one day while browsing through his scrapbooks , he discovered that olsen , in training camp with the red sox , had been farmed out the day before the 1943 season began lindsay called his friend walton , who helps put together the red sox media guide walton began researching the question he found that al olsen had pitched the day before , on may 15 , for san diego in the pacific coast league and given wartime travel restrictions , said walton , it would have been impossible for him to hop on a train from the west coast and get to chicago in time for the game walton learned that olsen had worn number 14 in camp , and the training roster had been sent to chicago early in order for game programs to be printed so , surely , whoever wore number 14 for the red sox is the man john lazor , an outfielder and pinchhitter , wore 14 for the red sox throughout that season lazor does not appear in the box score for that first game i do n't recall if i pinchhit in that game , it s been so many darn years ago , lazor , now 77 , said by telephone from his home in seattle but i 'll check my scrapbooks he did that game is missing , he said i ca n't figure it out two other major participants were unavailable for comment , joe cronin and heber hampton \( dick \) newsome , both of whom had died meanwhile , bill haber , a prominent baseball historian , got on the case he wrote to every living player on both teams none of the oldtimers could recall for certain but tony lupien , the first baseman for the red sox in 1943 , was pretty sure it was culberson , said haber and tony had the strongest handwriting of any who wrote me back if it s not olsen , as he admits , and it s not culberson , as he said , and it s not lazor , as he ca n't establish , then who was it \? a ghost \? i do n't know , said rick wolff , the editorial director for the baseball encyclopedia , published by macmillan but al olsen will be expunged from the eighth edition , which comes out next may but who then gets credit for that game , that walk , and that stolen base \? we 're working on it , said wolff right now , it s a little nebulous
tokyo , april 21 while japan s emergence as an economic power has been driven by exported electronics and industrial products , it has been paralleled by a growing obsession at home with fashionable goods that have foreign cachet clothing and accessories in a sense , japanese retail executives say , there is no place else for the money to go with land selling for as much as 1 million a square yard in downtown tokyo , real estate is not an investment within the reach of most japanese though a fleet of highpowered porsches clog tokyo s streets , the infamous traffic here makes them a frustrating luxury instead , affluent young people buy clothes and as they do , they create a surging market for the fashion capitals of the world , which have seen demand elsewhere slacken as economies slowed at a dinner party last week at a restaurant in the roppongi district , the women , all in their 20 s , wore clothes by romeo gigli , christian dior and chanel the men wore giorgio armani over california wines and frenchamerican food , they shared knowing conversation about labels , licenses and the joys of dressmakers in seoul who are now producing the best lineforline copies of highfashion clothing in the far east to europe , japan is the new america it is a market for luxury goods that expanded throughout the 1980 s and still has vast potential , fashion executives say , as demand shifts from clothing produced under license with foreign design houses to the real article japan is now the no 1 market for french luxury goods in the world , said christian blanckaert , the president of the comite colbert in paris , a trade association of 70 french companies , including christian dior , givenchy , hermes , nina ricci , louis vuitton and chanel outfitters to the salary men' japan accounts for about 27 percent of his organization s sales , mr blanckaert said , compared with about 18 percent to the united states and the pattern of increase is higher than anywhere else in the world , he said while there is no comparable american organization keeping track , american brands are also well established in japan , despite some trade barriers salary men wear brooks brothers , paul stuart , polo and wilkes bashford suits , purchased at branches of those stores here office ladies turn out in donna karan and anne klein ii outfits last week , the windows of the takashimaya department store in the nihombashi section were dressed with clothing made under a new licensing agreement with geoffrey beene , perhaps america s leading designer american techniques of specialty retailing and merchandise display are also being imported , as highfashion stores like new york s barneys and charivari open here there is a certain sector of our customers who are very brandname oriented , said naoki ueno , the merchandise manager of designer dresses , suits and coats at isetan , another department store they are crazy about chanel , dkny and armani some of isetan s customers are so wild about giorgio armani , mr ueno said , that they may dress themselves almost entirely in his clothes , from shoes to scarves from a commercial point of view , this type of customer is good for sales , mr ueno said amid riot of labels , a few buds of style the mere purchase of expensive goods , of course , does not in itself constitute style , an elusive quality achieved by a process that might be described as editing indeed , tokyo itself , one of the most fashionconscious cities in the world , sometimes seems in desperate need of editing so many labels , signs , shops , sounds and smells assault the senses but fashion executives in both tokyo and foreign capitals say japanese consumers , though still profoundly nameconscious , are becoming more sensible and sophisticated in their fashion choices the day after the dinner , two of the guests , yasuko and yoko amau , daughters of a retired japanese diplomat , went shopping in the fashionable aoyama area , where many european and japanese designers have boutiques at the boutique of issey miyake , japan s worldclass avantgarde designer , yasuko amau held up a fanshaped pleated circle of fabric resembling an origami paper sculpture someone tell me what to do with this , she demanded with a salesman s help , she looked through a catalogue to see how it was meant to be worn you see , even japanese women have trouble trying to figure miyake out , her sister said in the catalogue , yasuko amau saw a version of a dress as it was shown in paris it was sexier than the one in the store the salesman said it was not in production in japan because most japanese women would not wear something so revealing this traditional reluctance presents an obstacle to western designers , who shift the revealing emphasis of their clothes up and down the torso almost as often as the seasons change at the calvin klein boutique in the isetan department store in the shinjuku district , the problem was obvious career look seems to cover it all a sony monitor at the entrance to the klein boutique played a wellworn and blurry copy of a videotape of mr klein s spring fashion show in new york models floated down the runway in styles that included twopiece strap less dresses baring lots of shoulder and slivers of skin below the bodice and in back none of those dresses is carried in the boutique , which is almost exclusively devoted to career clothing too sexy , said mr ueno of isetan japanese women are rather reluctant to expose their skin
maglod , hungary , march 21 when it was his turn to speak before a small but patient gathering of voters here in a rural area west of budapest , mihaly izso , a candidate for the independent smallholders party , offered up a few simple ideas the land , he said , should be returned to those who owned it in 1947 , before it was taken by the communists and forced into collective farms this , mr izso continued , would not only revive agriculture , but would also restore life to hungary s dying villages , thereby solving the urban housing crisis to restore people s faith , you have to give them back pride in their property , he said , to a general murmur from the audience on this basic notion , hungary s independent smallholders party has built a campaign now widely expected to put them in third place in sunday s elections , when hungary freely elects a new parliament for the first time since world war ii likely member of coalition since no party is likely to emerge the victor in the first round of the elections , the expectation is that the smallholders will be part of a ruling coalition , although it is not clear who its partner will be of the three parties that have been leading in the public opinion polls here in recent weeks , only the smallholders date back to the precommunist era its high point came in 1945 , when it won 58 percent of the vote , only to be later obliterated by the communists that historic legacy , steeped in anticommunism , has helped the smallholders win recognition among voters who have been confused by the proliferation of new parties since democratic politics began here in earnest last fall but in places like maglod and the villages around this regional center , it is the smallholders' land proposal the most radical , some say simplistic , platform of the hungarian elections that has caught the most attention at his preelection rally , mr izso fielded questions from farmers anxious about their future and then promised , we are not going to sell out on the land issue questions of ownership after 40 years of communism , however , land ownership is not a simple matter whose rights should be protected first those people who lost their land , or those who have been working on it since \? and in a country where land reform predated communist rule , how to decide who was the original owner \? the smallholders' solution to the last problem was to settle on 1947 , a year when the most land a hungarian could own was 148 acres but other parties still dismiss a blanket promise to return land as unrealistic and divisive in this region , farms were forcibly collectivized in 1960 that was the year that the 17 , 300acre tapiovolgye cooperative farm was formed , and the year that ferenc inglis s father lost 22 acres , for which he received total compensation of 4 , 000 forints , now worth about 80 not long ago , mr inglis , who is now president of the smallholders party in the village of mende , went to a meeting and confronted the president of the cooperative farm , istvan varga i told him that as inheritor of this land , i will file a claim for it , mr inglis said i told him that this money was no more than cigarette money , that my father had been forced to join the cooperative losses under communism in his village , the smallholders estimate that one of out of every three families is entitled to reclaim land , a ratio which they say is even higher in the southern half of hungary many of these are descendants of the 620 , 000 peasants who in 1945 received parcels of land in the first wave of land reform altogether , the smallholders estimate that during communism , 191 , 000 families lost their land mr inglis is certain that he and his family would farm their land as well as he has cultivated the small plot of land behind his house but others whose family have rights to land in the area , and even have the documentation to prove it , are not so sure they would know what to do if they got it back older people say they no longer have the energy , and complain that their children have already drifted off to other jobs all that was taken away from the previous generation , the generation after us does n't want to work , said jozsef holbis , a 59yearold factory worker whose grandparents owned land outside maglod workers on the tapiovolgye farm are aslo ambivalent about land reform in 1960 , when they were forced into the collective farm , many families brought their land with them today , 3 , 700 acres are considered to be privately owned , although in the last 30 years , this ownership has been a paper fiction pondering the choices now , with change in the air , people are beginning to ponder their choices at a meeting last week , the farm s president , mr varga , said he took a poll and found that none of those who still own land want to lay claim to it but on the collective farms , people s views are clouded by the opinion of the farm directors , known in the countryside as green barons , who still wield considerable power and influence members of the smallholders party describe being harassed by their bosses , many of whom support the agrarian federation an agrarian wing of the once ruling communist party in this region , the split between the former owners , and the workers on the collective farm is clear mr inglis speaks contemptuously of workers who do n't want to give up the corn they get in compensation for the land they do n't know how to farm meanwhile , several agricultural workers said they think it would be a gross injustice to now give back the land to former owners who have since moved to budapest since no party has put forward a comprehensive plan for agriculture , the elections here are viewed as an event with unknown consequences , for themselves and the land we 'll see afterward , said one worker , about the promise of the elections
washington , april 4 a government panel investigating the bombing of pan am flight 103 today disclosed new evidence of serious flaws in the airline s security measures that existed before and lingered long after the fatal attack in december 1988 at least one of the flaws , involving pan am s method of searching unaccompanied baggage in frankfurt , where the flight originated , was described by ann mclaughlin , chairwoman of the presidential commission of inquiry , as rather significant to the bombing itself witnesses from the federal aviation administration told the commission that the agency s inspectors found repeated violations of security rules in several inspections beginning shortly after the bombing and continuing through august 1989 the flaws were not corrected until the agency imposed a 630 , 000 fine on the airline in september for the first time , the commission took public testimony about one security lapse that appears crucial to the inquiry into the bombing pan am officials and faa officials confirmed that the airline had not been searching by hand unaccompanied baggage that was put aboard its flights from frankfurt instead , the company examined such baggage using xray equipment pan am officials , including the board chairman and chief executive , thomas g plaskett , who testified today , have told the commission that the company had been given special permission by the agency s security officials to examine unaccompanied baggage by xrays but the faa s director of security , raymond a salazar , denied that any exemption was granted to rules requiring hand searches the leading theory about the bombing holds that an explosive device inside a radiocassette player was smuggled onto the flight inside an unaccompanied suitcase put aboard in frankfurt the device , resembling one that was described in security bulletins issued to airlines several weeks before the pan am bombing , is believed to have been designed to evade detection by xrays the company s security flaws have been the subject of intense examination ever since the bombing and are at the heart of a civil lawsuit being pressed by relatives of the 270 people who died when the jetliner exploded over lockerbie , scotland the commission of investigation was created at the urging of the relatives , many of whom attended the hearing today they heard james weidner , the commission s counsel , read from a series of reports citing continuing violations of security rules at frankfurt in the eight months after the bombing one document , mr weidner said , included the words totally unsatisfactory major violations in all areas posture considered unsafe all passengers flying out of frankfurt on pan am are at great risk that description was written in june 1989 today , said monte belger , a senior faa official who appeared at the hearing , frankfurt is considered a model of adherence to faa rules pan am has described the faa s assertions that it had not taken adequate security measures as technicalities and has appealed the fine when the faa imposed the fine , it said that none of the violations had been linked directly to the bombing of flight 103 but its listing of the violations at that time did not include the fact that pan am had been inspecting with xrays some bags that under regulations should have been searched by hand agency officials today said that that violation was not witnessed by inspectors from the agency , and that the agency s lawyers therefore recommended that it not be included in the accusations against the company but they insisted that they had never given the company permission , in writing or in conversations , to alter the requirement for hand searches of unaccompanied bags insuring that all baggage is accompanied by passengers is considered a crucial security measure because of lost or misrouted baggage and missed connections , some bags are put aboard flights without an accompanying passenger but in those cases , especially stringent inspections are required
in the magazine industry these days , is the glass half empty or half full \? clearly half empty , if you listen to what the publications that follow the industry have to say magazine advertising pages took their steepest plunge of the year in may , advertising age reported ad pages were 65 percent lower than in may 1989 and showed an overall decline of 32 percent for the first five months of the year and media industry newsletter noted that the drop in ad pages was worse for weekly magazines than at any point during the 1980 s although we have heard much talk from hopeful publishers and ad sales executives about a turnaround , there are no signs of one , it said blunter yet was the analysis in the press section of time magazine now the shakeout is at hand , it said magazines are going under or changing hands at a dizzying rate but wait there is an opposite assessment from samir husni , associate professor of journalism at the university of mississippi who keeps as close tabs on the magazine industry as anyone it s unbelievable , he said so far this year , i am seeing more new magazines coming out in the market than ever before what it means is that the industry is going to grow and grow and grow maybe not in a traditional way , but in new ways the difference between the trade publications' view and mr husni s is this the trades are basing their assessments on statistics supplied by the publishers information bureau about its 174 members , which include all the leading publications mr husni , on the other hand , is constantly compiling statistics about new publications for his annual report , samir husni s guide to new magazines last year , he reports , 584 new publications were started , compared with 234 in 1985 but even the established publishers are ignoring these little magazines , he said mr husni is predicting a substantial shift from a magazine industry dependent on advertising to one that derives most of its revenues from circulation new magazines now know that there is no hope in advertising , he said the advent of desktop publishing and new printing technologies have made it possible to start relatively modest magazines aimed at small , specific audiences like barbie doll collectors or people who collect dog postcards some of these have circulations as small as 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 the new magazines are introduced with little overhead and none of the usual startup costs like buying subscription lists and putting out expensive mailings in the more established segments of the industry , the bleak portrayal of magazine advertising greatly upsets some executives media brokers who buy and sell magazines are particularly sensitive about negative reports nonetheless , they concede that magazines that sold for 12 times earnings in 1988 are now fetching only 7 to 9 times earnings one thing is clear , donald d kummerfeld , president of the magazine publishers of america , wrote in a newsletter to members excessive talk of gloom and doom in magazine advertising tends to become a selffulfilling prophecy brave talk aside , the advertising picture is indeed pretty dismal advertising is down across the board , with revenues from the industry s biggest category , automotive , falling 14 percent for the first five months of 1990 from a year earlier another stalwart , tobacco , is down 28 percent industry officials worry that congress will ban print advertising for cigarettes many of the bestknown magazines have been affected for the year to date , according to media industry newsletter , tv guide is down 12 percent in ad pages newsweek , 11 percent , and people , 10 percent some magazines have already fallen victim to the times woman s day has been put up for sale by diamandis communications manhattan , inc and m magazine announced last week that they would merge into a new publication titled m inc owen j lipson , publisher of psychology today and mother earth news , is discussing a possible partnership with a japanese media company and playboy enterprises has confirmed it was in discussions to buy smart industry executives are closely watching developments at ms magazine the lang communications publication will go back on sale july 31 with no advertising it hopes to attract enough subscribers willing to pay 40 for six , 100page issues to survive although ms officials decline to say how many subscriptions the magazine has attracted , they say they have been heartened by the response to subscription cards they sent out , which also asked for donations to help battered women and children so far , the magazine has received 48 , 000 in donations even though many of the established magazines are feeling down these days and viewing the glass as half empty , mr husni still does not see it that way there are 3 , 100 consumer magazines , he said i have always been skeptical of statistics based on 100 to 150 magazines in the country i do n't think it is a real reflection of what is going on drawing

almost everybody already knows who did the whodunit , so who 'll buy a ticket to the movie \? for presumed innocent , such is the cinematic paradox of literary success when first published three years ago , scott turow s suspense novel was a fiction phenomenon reviewers hailed it as a tightly told tale of prosecutorturnedprosecuted in the urban midwest the story of the straightarrow rusty sabich , who is accused of murdering the beautiful colleague he s had an adulterous affair with the public agreed the courtroom drama was the watercooler talk of summer and went on to sell more than five million copies , spending 44 weeks on the new york times bestseller list and another five months atop paperback charts it is precisely this good fortune that presents a problem for presumed innocent , the 20 million film that opens friday if there s no mystery left about who killed the seductress carolyn polhemus was it in fact rusty , or was it someone else \? why bother to make the movie \? that s an unfair question , according to the main engines behind presumed innocent what about 'all the president s men' \? asks alan j pakula , the director i think people who went to that movie of mine knew beforehand how watergate turned out harrison ford , who plays rusty , teases , you mean like the screen version of 'the bible' \? such bravado notwithstanding , almost everyone associated with the film seems petrified that the denouement of presumed innocent will leak out please do n't reveal the ending , pleads the warner brothers press release we thank you for helping us keep this exciting suspense thriller a real mystery and even mr pakula admits that knowledge of the ending surely wo n't enhance the moviegoer s pleasure by way of illustration , he recounts a dinnerparty disaster several years ago in east hampton on long island when one of his guests , the playwright peter stone , mentioned that he had to leave early to finish reading presumed innocent , another guest turned to him and blurted , did it they almost had a fight both mr pakula and mr ford suggest that their whodunit is really a whydunit framed in the context of a character study whether or not rusty did the murder , says mr pakula , relaxing in his midtown manhattan office , this is a larger story of a good man leading a very controlled life as a lawyer who suddenly behaves irrationally in a way he ca n't begin to understand why does this man , the embodiment of morality , become involved in such an obsessive , selfdestructive affair \? that thematic fascination with even empathy for the dark side of humanity is nothing new for mr pakula , a producer , director and screenwriter who delights in analyzing his prior 19 films with the scrutiny of , well , a lawyer the earliest one he produced , fear strikes out \( 1957 \) , explored the baseball star jimmy piersall s struggle with mental illness to kill a mockingbird \( 1962 \) , mr pakula s first adaptation of a blockbuster , examined how a white lawyer confronted southern bigotry the sterile cuckoo \( 1969 \) and klute \( 1971 \) , mr pakula s initial directorial efforts , looked , respectively , at an eccentric college freshman facing loneliness and a manhattan call girl facing a killer all the president s men \( 1976 \) was about two young reporters who took on a corrupt white house to embody the ambivalence of presumed innocent , the 62yearold mr pakula says his most important task was casting the lead though he considered a few other wellknown actors , the director offered the role first and only to mr ford indiana jones may be his primary image , mr pakula says , but harrison comes across as an everyman to play rusty convincingly , you ca n't be exotic , and you have to be bright as well mr pakula flew out to mr ford s wyoming ranch they talked about the part , and mr ford was interested enough to await a script friends warned me this was a tough role because rusty is such a passive , interior character , mr ford recalled last fall , while much of presumed innocent was being filmed at the kaufmanastoria studios in queens though rusty s in every scene , all the action takes place around him things happen to him there is his boss \( played by brian dennehy \) , his defense attorney \( raul julia \) , his wife \( bonnie bedelia \) , the trial judge \( paul winfield \) , the coroner \( sab shimono \) and , of course , the murdered mistress \( greta scacchi \) each is doing something while rusty watches nowhere is this more dramatic than at rusty s trial , which is the focus of virtually the last half of the film harrison must sit silently during the courtroom scenes , as other more colorful characters like the judge occupy the stage , says mr pakula he ca n't ask , 'when s my aria \?

pierre a rinfret , the republican candidate for governor , released some grim figures yesterday about his first outing as a political candidate in what amounts to the first test of his appeal , the virtually unknown and politically inexperienced mr rinfret reported that he has had to invest 540 , 250 of his own money to get his campaign off the ground in addition , twothirds of the 329 , 383 he has otherwise collected was from five associates and the republican national committee each donated 25 , 000 to 42 , 906 , the state maximum the campaign finance chairman , former treasury secretary william e simon , and his wife , carol , contributed 42 , 906 each , for a total of 85 , 812 , making up onequarter of the nonrinfret receipts four years ago at this time the republican gubernatorial candidate , andrew p o'rourke , the westchester county executive , had raised 414 , 916 from others , 84 , 000 more than mr rinfret but he had been a candidate two months longer than mr rinfret and was politically well known with gov mario m cuomo s reporting a treasury of 77 million , the disparity in figures pointed up again the fundraising advantage of incumbents , a head start that was evident in almost all the statewide candidates' reports filed yesterday with the state board of elections mr cuomo raised 15 million , none of it his , in the last six months the contributions ran as high as 25 , 000 but many of them were 1 , 000 to 5 , 000 the largest receipt was 360 , 182 in bank interest for campaign funds the sole exception to the favorable trend for incumbents was carol bellamy , the former new york city council president , who is a candidate for state comptroller she raised more money in the last six months than the threeterm republican incumbent , edward v regan he put a 4 , 000 limit on individual contributions after the state commission on government integrity had criticized his fundraising tactics neither ms bellamy nor two democrats who were also criticized , mr cuomo and attorney general robert abrams , invoked restraints other than the state limits ms bellamy also ran well ahead of her opponent in the primary , westchester county clerk andrew j spano , in raising money the struggling mr spano loaned 42 , 500 to his campaign mr abrams , with 201 , 712 in his treasury , has raised 20 times as much as his republican opponent , bernard c smith mr abrams s chief political adviser , ethan geto , said he was confident that mr abrams would raise and spend 2 million the lone republican success was the state senate republican campaign committee , representing the party s majority in the upper house in albany the committee , which was 300 , 000 in debt two years ago , has 12 million to fend off democratic attempts to garner a majority the democrats have 285 , 648 the chairman of the campaign committee , state senator anthony m masiello of buffalo , predicted that the senate democrats would raise an additional 15 million the republican counterparts have also not stopped raising money president bush will be the main attraction at a 1 , 000aperson event for the state senate campaign committee and the republican state committee next tuesday at the waldorfastoria mr rinfret will not benefit from either drive , although he said yesterday that he would sit next to the president gingrich at dinner the state committee needs the money it is 900 , 000 in debt , its chairman , j patrick barrett , said , while the democratic state committee , aided by a democratic administration , has a treasury of 91 , 000 the annual dinner of the republican committee last night at the sheraton centre is not likely to reduce the debt the dinner featured the house republican whip , newt gingrich of georgia , as the speaker tickets were 300 a person , compared with 1 , 000 a person for a recent democratic state committee dinner mr gingrich challenged mr cuomo to run for president , to put to rest the claim that liberalism could win in america if only it was n't represented by such incompetent campaigners as mondale and dukakis setting out a major theme of his campaign , which was obscured by his financial report , mr rinfret described a spending splurge under mr cuomo in which new york spent 5 , 025 a person , 50 percent higher than the national average , and took 16 percent of the total personal income mr rinfret , in his first news conference at his new headquarters at 575 lexington avenue , pledged that if elected he would freeze spending at the current level

hong kong one day before long , when dame lydia dunn joins the house of lords , a legislative institution that has symbolized british male gentry for centuries , she will stand out not only because she is a woman but also because she is chinese it s rather intimidating , dame lydia said in an interview in her spacious woodpaneled office , accented with two reproductions of large antique chinese screens whenever i think about being introduced into that august body , i often think , 'i wonder what they think to have someone like me in their midst \? ' a 50yearold executive director at swire pacific ltd , a britishrun hong kong conglomerate , and the leading member in hong kong s executive council , dame lydia was honored on the queen s birthday list in june with a life peerage only two other hong kong residents , both men , currently hold the honor here , and the flurry over it is a reminder of how this territory blends chinese and british styles and traditions hong kong is run by a briton who serves as governor and periodically dons formal uniforms that seem to have emerged straight from history books of imperial britain and while more than 97 percent of hong kong s population is chinese , the judges and lawyers here still wear whitepowdered wigs in the courtroom , and prominent executives and public servants are knighted and called sir the result is some chinese names , like sir yuekong pao and sir runrun shaw , that raise a few eyebrows among the british aristocracy in the british tradition if there is any symbol of that mix of styles in hong kong , it is dame lydia her cautious , conservative diplomacy during the territory s transition to chinese rule , while it has won her prominence here and in london , reflects the delicacy with which britain has approached china dame lydia is one of the few chinese women to have risen so quickly in hong kong s britishstyled society , winning appointments in the parliament for more than a decade and senior positions in several business organizations her immaculate attire , sometimes a bold yellow dress or a vnecked red frock , has been a mark of her elegance , as is her knack for tact and diplomacy in the debating halls and corporate boardrooms while her roots are as chinese as those of china s senior leader , deng xiaoping both have the same family name , but use different romanizations dame lydia is very much a product of british tradition she is married to a british man , she travels often to britain , she works at a british company and has a second home in london now , with her seat in the house of lords an honor often given to reward the prime minister s political allies the hong kong people may gain a voice in the british parliament but if this greater access to the british government gives hong kong a bit more influence in britain , it comes just as the territory is moving inexorably toward becoming a part of china on july 1 , 1997 , hong kong will become a part of china , by agreement between london and beijing i do n't think she 'll have a political future in hong kong , said frank ching , a local columnist currently writing a book about hong kong lydia dunn has a reputation for sitting on the fence 'i am not a politician' dame lydia would not rule out the possibility of seeking the post of chief executive , the top job in hong kong after 1997 but mr ching and others say that her seat in the house of lords may preclude her from gaining the requisite blessing from the chinese , who may view her as an emissary of britain for all dame lydia s prominence in hong kong , her views on some key matters remain a secret , because she rarely expresses them she has never held an elected office , and says she will not run next year for one of the new 18 directly elected seats in the hong kong parliament i am not a politician , dame lydia said if her career has stressed cooperation with the colonial rulers , it is far from the only path taken by hong kong s britisheducated chinese professionals dame lydia is probably one of two most prominent chinese in the territory , and the other is a perfect contrast martin c m lee , a leading lawyer and queen s counsel who dresses in sober suits and speaks in a posh accent but regularly infuriates the british government by demanding more democracy for the territory currently , none of hong kong s members of parliament are directly elected , and although freedom of speech and of the press is generally allowed , no one asserts that the territory is a democracy expelled from committee mr lee was expelled by the chinese authorities from the drafting committee of the basic law , the constitution for the territory after it becomes part of china the british have not welcomed him much more warmly , and he seems unlikely to become a lord any time soon mr average would like somebody like me to speak up on occasion , mr lee said in an interview even dame lydia has indirectly expressed criticism of his outspokenness , saying that political leaders have responsibility to take the consequences of their words but mr lee says he believes such criticism is motivated by a fear of china s reaction , and he brushes it aside they are beginning to think like a slave already , mr lee said i do n't want to antagonize my master and i do n't want another guy to antagonize him either for fear that they will get less bread from the master but dame lydia s refusal to take a stand on an issue has sometimes frustrated even a few british officials in april , when the british foreign affairs committee visited hong kong to hold a hearing on the pace of democracy in hong kong , dame lydia summarized the two diverging views one faster , one slower among the delegates i can personally see the case for both , she said , diplomatically when a british official then pressed her to state her personal view , she replied , that is difficult to comment , and i would say that i have an open mind on the pace photo dame lydia dunn , a chinese resident of hong kong who has been honored with life peerage in the house of lords
east berlin , july 8 although the teutonic triple that many germans had been dreaming of fell through , they won the big one the world championship of soccer and east and west germans alike poured into the streets today to celebrate west germany s 10 triumph over argentina over the past week , the west german news media had trumpeted the possibility that this would be a weekend of unprecedented accomplishment for german sports if all had gone according to plan , the west german tennis stars steffi graf and boris becker would have triumphed at wimbledon and the cake would have been iced by the west german national soccer team s capturing the championship at the 1990 world cup in rome during the seemingly endless final minutes of tonight s soccer game , none of the 15 young people crowded around a flickering blackandwhite television set perched high on a corner shelf in zum tresen , a cozy tavern in the leipziger strasse in east berlin , was grieving over becker s loss to stefan edberg earlier in the day or graf s loss in the wimbledon semifinals thursday die jungs the boys were fighting off a lastditch assault by the argentines tension and celebration jaws were locked , fists were clenched , feet were dancing convulsively under tables and breathing was labored then it was over people screamed and jumped into each other s arms as an air horn blotted out rational thought the crowd poured into the street , lighting firecrackers and rockets , singing , deutschland , deutschland , deutschland after a bit of street dancing , ingo schmidt , 21 , returned to the table with his girlfriend , simone ewald , 20 , and pronounced the victory an entirely good thing ewald hastened to add they 're not , generally speaking , football fans but it is the world championship and after the watching the team for the past four weeks , we wanted to see the final game , she said no identity problem as citizens of what is still officially east germany , did they have any problem identifying with the west german national team \? not at all , schmidt said with reunification and everything that has happened since the turnabout , this just adds to it and the east german team did n't earn the right to be in these championships they just did n't play very well we have never been very good in football in a number of other sports , however , east germany has been outstanding for the past 20 years it has been a world power in track and field , swimming , cycling and winter sports like bobsledding , skating and biathlon those achievements were the result of a conscious effort by the former communist government to use sports as a means of establishing a national identity separate from west germany s , an effort that has cost billions of dollars since the nation was founded in 1949 simply being able to celebrate a west german soccer victory openly is something new for east germans , schmidt said if we had gone out in the street and celebrated like this before the changes , the police would have come and there would have been serious consequences , he explained the new openness is great the celebrations were not marked by the violent behavior sometimes exhibited by soccer fans , but in cologne , the associated press reported , one man died when he jumped through a streetcar window and was run over by a car looking for a fuhrer in west berlin , where openness sometimes is carried to extremes , some 20 , 000 people crowded the city center , celebrating the victory in a steady rain but the celebration was not without some ugly nationalist tones at one point , parts of the crowd began chanting who will be our fuhrer \? andy brehme , andy brehme brehme scored the sole goal in tonight s victory germany s last fuhrer was named adolf hitler our football rowdies , and it seems also the east german fans , unfortunately have a radicalright political slant , said a middleage man watching from the edge of the throng jamming the square by the kaiser wilhelm memorial church on the kurfurstendamm , west berlin s main shopping street i tell myself they 're just kids being provocative , but it is still scary celebrating is fine , we won after all but i do n't care for this after asking not to be named , he walked off into the rain

bal harbour , fla , feb 20 to the cheers of fellow trade unionists and labor secretary elizabeth h dole , the coal miners union announced today that its members had ratified an agreement to end the bitter 10month strike against the pittston coal group by a nearly twotoone margin but the harmony promptly went sour when mrs dole , visiting the convention of aflcio leaders here , attended a closeddoor meeting of union leaders there , she heard complaints that the federal government had just awarded a 120 million contract to eastern air lines , which has been strike bound since march , and that the labor department had helped bring it about there were strong indications later that misunderstandings about the type of contract in question had contributed not only to mrs dole s difficulties at the labor convention but also to responses from eastern to queries about the contract confusion over contracts the labor secretary , clearly caught off guard initially , said she knew nothing about the contract with eastern karen ceremsak , a spokeswoman for eastern , at first said she knew of no such contract , but it later developed that she had been asked questions about contracts to provide militarycourier services , as distinct from other transportation inquiries in washington confirmed that eastern was expected to provide about 120 million in transportation to military and civilian government employees over the next 12 months the general services administration routinely buys airline tickets in advance from several carriers along frequently used routes to obtain the lowest possible fares julian epstein , a staff member of the house government operations committee , said the committee plans to examine labor complaints surrounding the government s agreement to buy services from eastern he said it was not clear whether there was anything improper in the award of the contract , one of several signed with airlines in december he noted that there was no legal basis for the government to deny a contract to a bidder purely because of a labor dispute does n't play in florida in any event , labor leaders in florida were furious , and their anger was cooled only by the resolution of the pittston strike the union officials were encouraged that the united mine workers prevailed on some crucial issues , such as its insistence that the company continue to pay for all health benefits after eight years of the reagan administration , widely regarded as hostile toward unions , the mere fact that labor was able to hold its own in a long strike was a boost for the morale of the aflcio leaders here no one seems to be more admired than the president of the mine workers , richard l trumka , who last year brought his people into the labor federation the mine workers' office in washington said its 1 , 981 members in virginia , west virginia and kentucky had voted monday , and that 1 , 247 voted for and 734 voted against a 63 percent margin , the same as the margin in the last vote two years ago miners in kentucky , however , voted 97 to 95 against the agreement the miners are to return to work next monday , after the mines undergo safety checks mr trumka had called for the vote monday with a major issue still unresolved 64 million in fines assessed against the union for strikelaw violations that judge donald mcglothlin of the russell county circuit court in virginia has refused to drop the union is appealing the fines company wins some points pittston won some concessions that it deemed crucial the most important concern changes in shifts and work weeks one labor leader after another here said they saw the accord as halting a long decline of trade union membership , now accounting for just over 16 percent of the labor force , and the defeat of a company that was seen as trying to break the union to announce the accord , mr trumka and lane kirkland , the president of the federation , invited mrs dole and w j usery jr , the mediator she named to settle the strike , to join them this morning at a press briefing to take a call from a union local in virginia all were given telephones to listen to cecil roberts , the union s top negotiator , calling from a district local in virginia mrs dole said the contract was an example of the success of the collective bargaining process that s so very important after the call , she and mr trumka gripped one another s forearms but then mrs dole walked into a private meeting with the federation s top officers several of those present said she had an encounter with george j kourpias , president of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers , 8 , 400 of whose members have been on strike against eastern since march 4 mr kourpias asked about a 120 million contract that he said the gsa had awarded eastern her response was that she had been unaware of that , mr kirkland said later he said she volunteered to find out what the information was 'a smaller airline' ms ceremsak , the spokeswoman for the airline , said it had won government travel contracts in past years , but that this year it had received a smaller proportion of the total business she said this reflected the fact that the company is now a smaller airline at a briefing immediately after her meeting with aflcio officials , mrs dole denied the allegation by the machinists' union that her department had certified the contract the labor leaders in florida said they were angry because eastern s contract was signed after a certification by the labor department that the company was not in violation of fair employment standards the machinists' and other unions have repeatedly accused the airline of unfair labor practices casebycase decisions but mrs dole appeared to be unaware of any such certification by her department , and it was impossible to confirm details of it last night turning testy in the face of questions about refusing to intervene in the eastern strike , mrs dole said the administration considers such conflicts case by case ever since the strike against eastern began in march , the bush administration , has refused to intervene in it , saying that market forces should be allowed to determine its outcome but no one in america is more hated at this convention than frank lorenzo , the chairman of texas air corporation , eastern s parent company in seeking protection of the bankruptcy laws , mr lorenzo has persuaded some unionists that he means to liquidate the business and eliminate jobs so mrs dole s responses about eastern pleased none of the labor leaders photo the united mine workers announced yesterday that its members had ratified an agreement to end the 10month pittston strike the announcement was made at the aflcio meeting in bal harbour , fla , where labor secretary elizabeth h dole , lane kirkland , president of the aflcio , and richard l trumka , the mine workers' president , got the news by telephone from a mine workers' local \( associated press \)

london america attracts such bile partly because it is more selfcritical than other nations hypocrisy is often in the eye of the beholder how dare a european look down his nose at a country to whose universities his brightest fellowcitizens flock \? foreign criticism often attacks american habits that the critics happily adopt a few years later from refrigerators and elvis presley to negative campaigning and aerobics to criticize america is to criticize what the future holds in store misgivings about the direction in which some of america s culture is heading arise precisely because the american way today tends to be the way of the world tomorrow by culture , we mean not painting and music , but way of living the worry is about what might be called a decadent puritanism within america an odd combination of ducking responsibility and telling everyone else what to do the decadence lies in too readily blaming others for problems , rather than accepting responsibility oneself america s litigiousness is virtually banishing the concept of bad luck a hotel refuses to allow an ablebodied guest to swim in its shallow rooftop pool because there is no lifeguard on duty a drunken driver can sue his host for allowing him to get drunk if a prominent citizen becomes an alcoholic or is caught indulging some illegal appetite , he all too often claims he is a victim , not a fool the habit of pleading insanity as an excuse for a crime is spreading increasingly , too , people are blaming their genes and finding sympathetic \( and often foolish \) scientific support the exaggerated claims by a few scientists that they have found genes for alcoholism , or aggression , are well couched to prevent people taking the rap for their own actions to allow legal redress for negligence , or to seek to rehabilitate rather than punish victims these are worthy aims but fair redress is not always appropriate sometimes the buck must simply stop just as an overpadded welfare state breeds a habit of blaming and expecting help from government , so america s legalism breeds the shifting of burdens onto someone else it saps initiative from the economy quite as effectively as the statesponsored variety another facet of this phenomenon is the warped idea that the problem with america s underclass is a lack of selfesteem , and that the answer to poor educational performance is to teach more selfesteem bunk the characteristic that in the past drove generations of immigrants from the underclass to prosperity was not selfesteem , it was selfdiscipline the reason that japanese schoolchildren and the children of asian immigrants in america learn so much more than their american counterparts is discipline , not selfesteem to see how far such evasiveness has caught on , look at the new abundance of euphemism prisons have become rehabilitative correctional facilities , housewives are homemakers , deaf people are hearing impaired , a cerebral palsy society tells journalists never to use the word suffer about those with that disease \( forbidden \) , affliction \( forbidden \) , condition \( allowed \) jargon cannot alter reality how refreshing to hear a politician who favors both abortion and the death penalty described bluntly as prodeath take race there are few countries anywhere on earth in which people are generally less prejudiced about color than americans , stereotypes of the old south and bensonhurst notwithstanding yet there are few countries where the issue looms so large where pressure groups are so quick to take offense at a careless remark or where words are made to carry such a weight of meaning black is fast following negro into the lexicon of the forbidden , to be replaced by africanamerican in the neverending search for a label without overtones some universities , egged on by their students , have recently imposed disgraceful restrictions on free speech rather than let bigots speak out on campus and be judged for what they are as for puritanism , america s search for fairness has begun to conflict with its famous tolerance for new peoples , new ideas and new technologies a conformist tyranny of the majority , an intolerance of any eccentricity , is creeping into america , the west coast in particular an increasingly puritanical approach to art , married to a paranoid suspicion of child abuse , has made a photographer who takes pictures of parents with their children naked on the beach into a target for the fbi add to that sort of thing the ruthless prudishness of the television networks about anything except gratuitous violence , and the gradual assertion of correct ways of thinking about such things as smoking and affirmative action it all adds up to a culture of conformity that would rather bore than shock a television scriptwriter recently admitted that he put cigarettes into the hands only of baddies a whole industry of pressure groups has arisen to persuade tv producers to push correct ideas on their \( fictional \) programs smoking is bad for you concern for the homeless is right plastic bags are bad for the environment all true , and all admirable but fiction is fiction , not cautionary tales as americans get ever richer , they seem to grow more riskaverse , so that they become paranoid about hazardous waste in their district , obsessed with their cholesterol levels , and ready to spend large premiums for organic vegetables it being a free world , they are welcome to do so , even if the risks from hazardous waste are exaggerated or the risks from natural carcinogens in organic vegetables greater than from pesticides but must they become killjoys in the process \? none of these things is confined to america , but like everything else they breed faster and more lushly in america and now the infection has spread to politicians , who have discovered that a quick way to television prominence is to take outraged offense at every imagined slight careers can collapse because of a single gaffe that does not pass some ideological litmus test television seems to have done its best to drive humor out of politics can you imagine lyndon johnson getting away with half of his witticisms today \? if we are all to enjoy the 21st century , america must lighten up a bit drawing
paris , july 17 east and west germany agreed today to resolve polish anxieties by promising to guarantee the postwar germanpolish frontier , and in doing so , the germans all but guaranteed international endorsement of their own reunification by the end of the year the german assurances to poland that the current border will not be changed after german unification were worked out during a oneday meeting of the two plus four group , which was organized by the foreign ministers of the two germanys and the four world war ii allies the united states , the soviet union , britain and france to deal with the international aspects of german unification the accord on the germanpolish border was widely anticipated after yesterday s landmark agreement between the soviet president , mikhail s gorbachev , and the west german chancellor , helmut kohl , in which mr gorbachev dropped his opposition to the membership of a united germany in nato polish peace of mind and indeed , the sovietgerman breakthrough seemed to propel all the parties gathered in paris today into a quickly reached compromise on how to assure the poles that the present east germanpolish border along the oder and neisse rivers will not be altered before the meeting , at which the poles accepted the pledges on the border , foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany privately assured poland s foreign minister , krzysztof skubiszewski , that a united germany would sign a new economic treaty guaranteeing fulfillment of all business contracts between poland and east german companies that might soon be out of business mr skubiszewski \( whose name is pronounced kshishtof skoobehshefskee \) told reporters that there was indeed a problem prior to this meeting but we have received the reassurance that the border treaty would be concluded as soon as possible after unification language has been decided that is entirely satisfactory , he added next step in september the six foreign ministers gathered in paris said they will now be able to meet in moscow on sept 12 to draft a final settlement that would terminate all the fourpower rights and responsibilities over germany and berlin that grew out of the allies' occupation of germany at the end of world war ii that proposed settlement will be submitted for endorsement to a summit meeting of the 35nation conference on security and cooperation in europe the meeting is scheduled for paris on nov 19 , provided a treaty reducing conventional arms in europe is completed by then once the allied rights and responsibilities have been dissolved , fully sovereign east and west germanys will go ahead with plans to conduct allgerman elections on dec 2 and proceed with unification today , the soviet foreign minister , eduard a shevardnadze , commented we can trust the german people in both parts of germany they have proven their commitment to peace and to create a state that will not threaten others about six months ago in ottawa we initiated this twoplusfour process , secretary of state james a baker 3d said at a news conference at the close of today s meeting our aim was to facilitate the peaceful and democratic unification of germany and the reconciliation of europe today , we draw much nearer to that target the outcome that has so long eluded us is now within our reach by the anniversary of our ottawa meeting , i expect the united states and the other fourpowers will welcome the advent of a united , democratic and sovereign germany france s foreign minister , roland dumas , was more categoric , saying there are no more obstacles preventing a united germany from being reestablished in its sovereignty by the end of the year speed of the essence today s polishgerman accord was worked out after the two germanys agreed to a set of five principles confirming the border and after they promised to conclude a formal border treaty with poland within the shortest possible time after unification after mr skubiszewski expressed his satisfaction , a british television reporter asked mr genscher whether west germany was in effect buying off polish and soviet opposition to unification , given that the kohlgorbachev accord also included a provision for largescale german economic aid to the soviet union the reporter also asked mr genscher , a fluent english speaker , to answer the question in english mr genscher , bristling with anger and pointedly replying in german , said that it was not appropriate to talk about a price paid to buy soviet agreement one cannot buy agreement , he added virtually all the questions were directed at mr genscher and only a smattering at mr shevardnadze or mr baker none at all were asked of mr dumas or the british foreign secretary , douglas hurd set of principles american officials said the five principles regarding the polish border accepted by the east and west german foreign ministers were these after a final settlement is signed , a united germany will remove from its laws any language suggesting that the polishgerman border is provisional the area of a united germany will consist only of berlin and what is now the territory of east and west germany the parliament of a united germany will confirm the oderneisse line in a treaty with poland in the shortest possible time after unification a united germany will forswear any territorial claims the four allied powers agree to serve in effect as witnesses that these commitments will be fulfilled intricate if grim history the question of a germanpolish border treaty has been left in abeyance since the close of world war ii at the start of the war , nazi germany occupied western poland and the soviet union occupied the eastern part in 1945 , after the war ended , the soviet union , by then ally and mentor of poland , kept parts of eastern poland , and in compensation gave poland part of eastern germany the postwar germanpolish border was drawn along the oder and neisse rivers and became known as the oderneisse line poland s annexation of the former german lands east of the oderneisse line led to the forced migration of several million ethnic germans on june 21 , the parliaments of the two germanys adopted matching resolutions guaranteeing that the oderneisse line would remain the border , and called on the parliament of a united germany to confirm this in a treaty this was deemed insufficient by warsaw an evaporated threat on monday , mr baker hinted that the wartime allies might not dissolve all their rights and responsibilities over germany if the two german nations did not provide satisfactory assurances to warsaw that threat seems to have evaporated in view of today s understandings mr baker was repeatedly asked why the bush administration was taken by surprise by the deal struck in moscow monday between mr kohl and mr gorbachev , and whether washington was becoming concerned about unilateral german actions to one such question , he responded with a circumlocution that left even diplomats scratching their heads said mr baker of the kohlgorbachev accord this is a delightful surprise to the extent that it is a surprise , and it is only a surprise to the extent that we anticipated photo foreign ministers who met yesterday in paris on german unification posing for a group portrait from left were hansdietrich genscher of west germany , james a baker 3d of the united states , krzysztof skubiszewski of poland , roland dumas of france , eduard a shevardnadze of the soviet union ,

chicago , april 10 job stress among men can cause potentially dangerous physical changes in the heart as well as high blood pressure , a new study has found the findings are based on a study of 215 men 30 to 60 years old at seven work sites in new york city , including a stockbrokerage , a private hospital and a garbagecollection site , researchers wrote in an article being published wednesday in the journal of the american medical association job strain resulted when workers felt they faced high psychological demands without having much control over daytoday decisions , said dr peter schnall , the lead researcher at cornell university medical college in new york twentyone percent of the subjects suffered job strain , and they faced about a three times greater risk of having high blood pressure than those who did not experience job strain , said dr carl pieper , a cornell statistician thickening of chamber all men 30 to 40 years old with highstress jobs had a clinically significant thickening of the heart s left ventricle , or chamber , a condition that often precedes coronary disease and heart attacks , dr pieper said today in a telephone interview their heart muscles were an average of 20 grams bigger than those without job stress , a substantial difference but still within normal range , dr schnall said we 're not showing that job strain is causing heart disease , dr schnall said what we 're showing is that job strain is causing a change in muscle mass that could lead to disease to the best of our knowledge , the researchers wrote , this is the first time a psychosocial variable based on job characteristics has been found to be related to both hypertension and anatomic increases in heart mass while the notion that psychological factors can physically affect the body is not new , it is viewed with skepticism by some medical authorities , dr redford b williams of duke university medical center said in an accompanying editorial things in common if these results are considered along with the growing contributions of neuroscience to our understanding of how the brain speaks to the body s organs , perhaps the idea that the brain plays a role in physical disease will soon seem less 'revolutionary' and more like 'normal science , ' dr williams said the men studied had all worked in the same job for at least three years , none was more than 20 percent overweight and none had suffered heart disease before the study began in 1986 eightyone percent were white , most of the rest were mostly black , and 87 had high blood pressure at the start of the study the authors concluded that job strain was significantly related to high blood pressure and increased heart mass after adjusting for factors like age , alcohol intake and smoking
a half a dozen or so rookies are expected to appear in opening day lineups tomorrow and tuesday , but none will command more attention than sandy alomar jr , who , according to some baseball people , was the best catcher in the major leagues the last two years , and he was n't even in the majors rookies such as alomar face a trying task when they arrive in the majors highly heralded only last year , for example , gregg jefferies of the mets and gary sheffield of milwaukee were considered locks for the rookieoftheyear awards , but they stumbled badly early in the season and struggled to attain the level of play expected of them alomar comes more celebrated than most because he has been talked about for two years while the san diego padres , well armed with benito santiago , kept him in the minor leagues after he was named minor league player of the year both years , he was traded to the cleveland indians this winter for joe carter finally , at the age of 23 , after six seasons in the minors , he has his chance i 've been waiting for this , alomar said , discussing his status it s up to me now in san diego i never had a chance to make the team , so i'm glad to be traded last year , he said , was the worst year , having to return to las vegas of the pacific coast league after he was named minor leaguer of the year for 1988 everybody has to play in the minor leagues , he said i 've always felt that but last year was a tough year for me hopefully , this year i can stay here the son of the former major leaguer sandy alomar , the catcher was not expressing false modesty given his experience and his upbringing , he assumes nothing everybody can lose a job , he said it s still up to me i have to go out and do my job nobody has it made you can have a bad year it s up to you it depends on how hard you work and how you produce we 'll see what happens one day in arizona , gary carter sat in the san francisco giants' dugout and watched alomar work out before an exhibition game carter knows something about catching he has caught in 1 , 823 major league games , fifth on the career list god bless him , carter said he s starting a career that provided he s able to stay healthy he should have a very good one as big as he is , as much as i 've heard about his arm and his bat and the success he s had in the minor leagues , he s one of those ca n'tmiss guys alomar , of course , cannot live this year on his reputation it is that reputation , in fact , that could make life as a rookie more difficult he s got a little extra pressure on him , carter said they 're probably going to count on him bigtime there s a lot on him as to what he s going to be able to do it 'll be interesting to see when you 're touted as being one of the next superstars , it puts the extra pressure on you playing in cleveland , carter went on , very likely will be to alomar s advantage as he works his way into the majors it s probably best that he does n't have the highprofile media coverage in cleveland and maybe he can be himself , the giants' catcher said just by what i can see , he s got the tools i 've watched him hit and watched him throw as long as he takes it slow , he should be ok one thing that he has to his advantage is that he has a father that played in the game and probably made him realize what he has to do not to overdo it , give himself a chance to come through and not put that added pressure on himself it is perhaps to alomar s advantage , too , that one of his new teammates is keith hernandez , a veteran player the indians signed in part for the positive influence he can exert on younger players there s a certain amount of pressure that goes along with it , hernandez said of alomar s status but it s what he wanted this is his opportunity so there it is go for it and if alomar should appear to be affected by the pressure , hernandez said he would try and help him i 'll keep an eye on him , he said a pitcher s personal view much has been made of the departure of three pitchers from the montreal expos' fiveman starting rotation and how that effectively has made a noncontender of the expos but kevin gross , one of the two remaining starters , offered a different view of how his teammates' departure could affect him personally he thinks it could make him a better pitcher last year , he explained , i was pitching with so many good guys they were all better than i am deep down inside , i was n't competing against them , but i was competing with them to be as good as them instead of just pitching this year i'm more relaxed room for improvement from 1988 \( 54107 \) to 1989 \( 8775 \) , the baltimore orioles improved by 32 1 2 games , matching the thirdbest improvement in major league history viewed with pity at this time a year ago , the orioles now are viewed by some with skepticism they came close to winning the american league east title last year , the thinking goes , but they enjoyed a special season and this year could return to some level of reality their manager disagrees we had a couple of guys who had years we did n't expect them to have , frank robinson said he referred to mickey tettleton , who hit 26 home runs , and jeff ballard , who had an 188 record
the littleknown new york city construction unit that built an expensive bed headboard for mayor david n dinkins did more than 700 , 000 worth of other work on favored projects for city hall officials since 1979 , city records show the work included construction of a 45 , 000 attic apartment in gracie mansion for one of former mayor edward i koch s cooks and an indoor barbecue pit in mr koch s gracie mansion kitchen that cost more than 31 , 000 the unit also installed security devices at the mansion mr koch yesterday defended the work as proper the construction unit , the human resources administration s office of facilities operations , had been set up to do work on social welfare buildings and facilities but agency officials including karl f trachte , deputy administrator of general administrative services , who also served in the koch years acknowledged that city hall political aides routinely put in orders for work unrelated to the agency and bypassed bidding guidelines , and that some of the work may have delayed needed repairs and rebuilding at the agency s 34 homeless shelters , 52 boarding homes or 350 other buildings that serve the city s needy the officials , who released the list of the projects at the request of news organizations , said that none of the projects were done illegally or for private gain the city s department of investigation , at the mayor s request , is auditing the records of work performed by the office to see whether all the projects were properly done for public purposes and whether any records were altered albert scardino , mayor dinkins s chief spokesman , described the operations of the construction office as casual and an outgrowth of the political patronage system rather than a professional management system he said the costs of some of the work might have been excessive but that there was no way of knowing there were too many people able to order up too much work with too unpredictable an expense , he said but he added , there was nothing dishonest about it the willingness of dinkins administration officials to provide information suggested that they were not unhappy to show that the construction unit s outside projects did not begin with the controversial mayoral headboard newsweek magazine reported earlier this month that the headboard , which it described as a handmade , cherrywood , federalstyle piece crafted by a human resources unit carpenter , anthony russo , could end up costing 11 , 500 , based on up to 500 hours of labor after the report was published , newsweek reported , a damagecontrol operation at the agency modified the carpenter s time sheets to show that the hours had been devoted to several jobs mr scardino said yesterday that the actual cost of the headboard was 429250 and that no time sheets were altered he said the initial request for the headboard came from mr dinkins s wife , joyce , to david l reese , the head of the gracie mansion conservancy , which raises private funds to maintain the landmark 1799 mansion on the upper east side , and that mr reese s office then transmitted the request to the construction unit she had no inkling what was involved , mr scardino said in an interview , the head of the construction office , joseph l black jr , an assistant deputy administrator who started there in 1975 , said that the unit was established about half a century ago many other city agencies have similar construction arms , he said as far as he could recall , mr black said , the unit received its first order to work on a nonagency project in 1979 , when a special adviser to mayor koch , joseph divincenzo , asked the office to build an apartment in the gracie mansion attic for mr koch s chef , who was then living in the basement where the cook s quarters traditionally were the project cost 45 , 000 , according to a digest prepared last week by mr black 75 other requests seventyfive other such requests by mr divincenzo and other city hall officials followed over the next 11 years , culminating in the headboard , the list showed the total cost of all the projects was put at 739 , 092 the largest single items were jobs valued at 213 , 232 and 80 , 228 for refurbishing employee areas at department of sanitation offices the list also included the construction in january 1986 of a barbecue pit in the gracie mansion kitchen after a chimney was found hidden in the wall that work cost 10 , 716 , but in 1988 five additional work orders boosted the total cost to 31 , 589 in addition , even after a privately financed 5 million refurbishment of the mansion , including the kitchen , the human resources unit put in more than 100 , 000 in work on kitchen air conditioning and other systems security measures there were also thousands of dollars in work for bulletproof glass and locks for the mayor s bathroom and bedroom at gracie mansion , and bulletproof windows in mr koch s apartment in greenwich village i did n't take it with me , mr koch said yesterday of the improvements he said refurbishing the kitchen had actually saved the city money by making it possible to cook for large groups of guests rather than having parties catered as for the barbecue , the foodloving former mayor said , i thought it was terrific he said the police had dictated the security measures arranged by advisers mr koch said also that he had had no part in ordering the work , but that it had been arranged by city hall advisers , including mr divincenzo mr divincenzo , who ran an office called the talent bank that state investigators called a patronage mill , is awaiting trial on 11 counts of perjury arising from a corruption investigation mr divincenzo could not be reached for comment last night his number is unlisted , and a phone number carried at city hall is no longer connected mr scardino said that the system of using the human resources building unit reflected sloppy management because it enabled officials to bypass the city s bidding guidelines and removed controls for evaluating the actual costs of projects he said that from now on , all requests for work by the human resources construction force would have to be channeled through deputy mayor barbara fife linda fisher , executive deputy administrator for external affairs of the human resources administration , and octavia adamson , acting executive deputy administrator for administrative and support service , said that the construction unit saved money by avoiding cumbersome contracting procedures and private vendors photo the

when peace comes it will be ushered in on my bird feeder certain political pundits , pondering peace , suggest that recent events in eastern europe presage an era of peace soon the messiah will ride through the brandenburg gate on a white donkey i know differently the age of peace will not arrive until the occupants of my bird feeder get their act together i reached this conclusion last year when i moved into our 1861 farmhouse while my wife pondered the proper location for the sheridan dresser and hitchcock rocker , i stalked the grounds for a proper birdfeeding site outside the kitchen window hemlock branches waved in the morning breeze on the top branches , robins arranged twigs for a nest purple grackles occupied the middle range of branches obviously the tree was a favorite haunt for birds by midday , one bird feeder and two suet cakes dangled from the hemlock and i waited for the birds to dine at their flyin restaurant a word about my bird feeder been with me for more than a halfdozen years for all those years , the feeder , a cylindrical container crowned by a plastic hood , successfully fended off squirrels after years of catering to the dietary needs of birds , i know the danger of squirrels invading a bird feeder once a squirrel cracks the sunflower seed code , and devises a method for access to the feeder , birds face a winter of despair or soup kitchens fortunately my feeder is squirrel proof or was in the good old days a squirrel jumped onto the plastic hood , slid off and after rearranging his \( or her \) ruffled tail went next door , where a former neighbor feeds all god s children that is why , after filling the feeder , i sat back with confidence and waited for the birds in the meantime the local squirrel population , unaware that i possessed a squirrelproof bird feeder , huddled below and planned strategy i studied my adversaries there was old scarface according to the neighbors , scarface received his wound from fat charley , who , tradition held , could finish off a fivepound bag of sunflower seed in a single day i was skeptical no squirrel can consume five pounds a day further research revealed that fat charley has a seed concession at the bronx zoo then there was skinny skinny was n't always skinny but ever since he ate my neighbor s plastic bird feeder in a frenzied quest for the elusive thistle , skinny has been troubled with gastroenterological problems poor squirrel a lesson to all those too deeply into plastics ! calling the signals was roberto the red , a red squirrel onefourth the size of fat charley but mean real mean none of the gray squirrels fooled around with roberto the red as chickadees flew tentatively onto the perches and began to peck away at the sunflower seed , the squirrel huddle broke fat charley scrambled up the hemlock gleefully i waited for him to pounce on the plastic hood covering the feeder and plummet earthward but fat charley did n't tip the scales at 5 pounds 6 ounces because of thyroid or metabolism problems no sir ! fat charley was fat because he ravaged every bird feeder in the neighborhood squirrelproof or not ! and fat charley knew if you ca n't beat them over the table , deal under the table before i could say bird seed fat charley had leaped from the tree , flew under the hood and dangled on a bird perch he teetered for a moment then gained control but instead of eating , fat charley leaped back onto the trunk of the hemlock and repeated his performance this was too much ! after five or six times charley could jump backward , frontward , holding on with one paw , eyes closed having perfected the techhnique charley settled in to a sunflowerseed meal on the limbs above , the chickadees raised a chorus of protests , but what could i do \? while fat charley shook seed onto the ground for scarface and skinny i rolled out the antisquirrel artillery anyone plagued by squirrels on the bird feeder knows the standard defensive tactics first , i greased the feeder then i tacked posted signs on the hemlock and installed an audio cassette instructions for squirrel stew blared across the countryside first catch a squirrel nothing worked fat charley sat on the feeder , facing the kitchen window , extended his tongue in my direction and spit shells \( my wife cautioned me not to take charley s antics personally , but i have recently raised the bounty for charley s head to 100 from 25 \) worse , charley taught skinny and scarface his undercover tricks the entire pack of squirrels leaped under the hood quarreling over the choicest seeds evenually the squirrels left and the birds enjoyed their moment in the sunflower but even birds ca n't seem to feed together a screeching blue jay terrorized the chickadee a crow , on a flight pattern out of the northwest , crashlanded on a woodpecker buried in a peanut butterlaced suet cake a nuthatch descending the tree upside down collided with a tufted titmouse climbing right side up i mused how could i inform the birds friends , there s enough food for everyone have n't i overinvested in seed futures at winkler s nursery \?

civil liberties lawyers charged yesterday that the new york city police department was violating a 13yearold federal court order that generally bars police officers from arresting bystanders who criticize them the issue of arresting onlookers , which lawyers say is decades old , has come up again in recent weeks after two highly publicized arrests of bystanders in manhattan in each case , bystanders were arrested and roughed up after they said they had peacefully protested officers' treatment of people that the police had stopped the police department s civilian complaint review board , which examines cases brought against the police by aggrieved citizens , says it does not keep records of the arrests of bystanders but norman siegel , executive director of the new york civil liberties union , and other lawyers argue that despite the court order issued on june 1 , 1977 , by judge john m cannella of federal district court in manhattan such arrests have not only continued but also appear to be on the increase it s a syndrome that occurs over and over again , especially in times of high crime and low morale among officers , when some cops seem to take out their frustration on innocent people , said richard d emery , a lawyer who is representing three clients in bystander arrest cases one of mr emery s clients , ron naar , is a 49yearold artist who says he was beaten by the police and jailed for 31 hours last oct 23 he said he asked eight tactical narcotics team plainclothes officers what the hell s going on \? as they pummeled a drug suspect on 10th street in the east village mr naar said he had initially mistaken the police officers for racist street toughs mr siegel called such arrests illegal and unconstitutional and warned police commissioner lee p brown yesterday that unless the department began enforcing the court order by oct 12 , his group would be forced to seek judicial relief to assure compliance with the letter and spirit of that decree in a letter delivered yesterday to police headquarters , mr siegel referred to judge cannella s stipulation and order in it , the department acknowledged that officers had no probable cause to arrest bystanders simply for speech alone , even though crude or vulgar , or for requesting and making notes of officers' badge numbers , taking photographs or remaining in the vicinity of a stop or arrest judge cannella s order which grew out of a class action suit filed two years earlier by the new york civil liberties union directed the police department to inform all its employees of the new guidelines within 60 days on aug 5 , 1977 , the department issued an interim order to all commands that said the guidelines were to be followed subject to safety considerations and provided there was no substantive violation of law but police spokesmen many of whom said they were unaware of the court order said yesterday that the interim order was revoked in 1980 at the direction of police commissioner robert j mcguire , and that none of the guidelines had ever been incorporated into the patrol guide , the official police manual instruction of recruits the commander of the police academy , deputy chief robert burke , said through a spokesman that recruits were routinely instructed that officers may not arrest people simply for what an officer regards as oral abuse another victim represented by mr emery , keith a pavlik of glen rock , nj , a 33yearold du pont technician , was hospitalized with a broken left hand , two broken ribs , a head laceration and a large contusion on his back after he said he told an officer that the police had no right to beat and use racist and antigay insults against a young man whom the officer had stopped on christopher street last oct 14 a third client , judith regan , is a senior book editor at simon schuster who was arrested 11 days ago , roughed up , jailed and , she says , taunted with lewd insults and asked mockingly whether her first name was jew bitch after she angrily told several police officers to stop berating her taxi driver pleading with officers another case this month , being handled by the legal aid society , involves john andrews , a 23yearold college student who was handcuffed , punched and kicked , then jailed for nearly two days while he awaited arraignment for assault , riot , disorderly conduct and obstruction of government administration scores of witnesses to the sept 13 incident , near times square , said the young man had simply joined other bystanders , most of them white , in pleading with the officers to go easy on an outoftown woman whose illegally parked car was about to be towed mr andrews is black after the defense lawyers' comments , judge cannella could not be reached for comment but mr emery said he hoped that he or another federal judge could be persuaded to reopen the case on the ground that the police had chosen either through ignorance or design to disregard the ruling if that happens , the lawyer said , he will urge the court to issue more precise requirements for police training and street procedures the simplest thing would be to establish a spatial relationship , mr emery said say a cop is entitled to three feet of space around which nobody is allowed to enter and outside of which anybody can say anything they want if the police know that and the public knows that , then we should all be safe but they ca n't arrest somebody and put them through the system for what they feel is defiance of their authority if there is no physical interference photo ron naar , who says he was beaten by the police and jailed for 31 hours last october after intervening in what he thought was a racial attack by saying , what the hell s going on \?

washington , july 23 the bush administration s ban on military assaultstyle weapons , criticized as a tepid response to drugrelated violence when it took effect last year , has been weakened by a provision that allows redesigned versions of the weapons to be imported several companies have recently received permission from the government to import six foreignmade semi automatic weapons , which have been altered to eliminate military features like largecapacity ammunition holders , pistol grips , bayonet fittings and grenade launchers these were among the features that resulted in their banning last july because they were deemed unsuitable for sporting purposes ban a response to violence none of the modified weapons have been imported yet , but the decision to allow them into the country was regarded by some bush supporters as an effort to satisfy the ban s critics , like the national rifle association representatives of gun control groups said today that the approval of the weapons , reported today in the washington post , effectively nullified the ban by allowing the import of assaultstyle weapons that have undergone only cosmetic changes the weapons retain their ability to fire bullets rapidly and can easily be modified to accept the militarystyle hardware , readily available in the united states the ban was imposed last july at the urging of president bush in response to rising drugrelated violence and to the 1988 slaying of five schoolchildren in stockton , calif , by a man using an ak47 assault rifle gun control groups said the ban did not go nearly far enough to limit the availability of such weapons because it prohibited only 43 types of foreignmade weapons and did not affect the sale of domestically manufactured assaultstyle weapons the government says americans own about three million semiautomatic weapons , about 25 percent of which are foreign models , including the assault style weapons administration officials have said that without the ban , 700 , 000 to one million militarystyle weapons would have been imported to the united states in a year officials of the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms , the agency that enforces the regulation , said they had approved the altered weapons on a casebycase basis in recent months as gun makers and distributors sought approval for new designs the officials said the law allows them to decide subjectively which weapons may be imported no modified guns imported yet so far , the agency has reviewed prototypes of the weapons , and none of the actual rifles have been imported , officials said these redesigned weapons would be allowed under the provisions of the crime bill that was passed by the senate two weeks ago , which would ban the import or domestic manufacture of nine types of semiautomatic weapons , marlin fitzwater , the white house spokesman , said today the senate weapons ban goes further than the administration had wished , but white house officials said they expected the president to sign the ban if a similar crime bill is approved by the house federal gun control laws allow the firearms bureau , a branch of the treasury department , to determine if a specific gun is suitable for a sporting purpose in the administration s ban last year , the agency specified what features made an assault rifle not a sporting weapon , and by removing those features , the manufacturers would conform to the law apparently the way the existing rules are written , batf is not authorized to prevent these weapons from coming in , mr fitzwater said guns called new models bureau officials said today that the redesigned models of wellknown military weapons like the uzi and ak47 are so different from the originals that they are , in effect , entirely new models that qualify for importation as sporting weapons the prototypes that we 're looking at are weapons that do n't even have a pistol grip , said mr killorin a pistol grip enables a weapon to be fired from the hip the firearms policy project , a gun control group , said that the makers or distributors of six weapons had received approval for redesigns , including the uzi carbine , ak47 , galil , hk91 , sar8 , and sar4800 the group based its assertion on documents it obtained from the firearms agency under the freedom of information act it s more than weakening , said josh sugarmann , director of the firearms project , it essentially renders the july ban null and void these guns look less threatening , but they are not less deadly some of the prototypes approved by the bureau were made by foreign companies like hekler koch , a west german firm , which makes the hk91 included in the bush administration s ban hekler s modified version of the hk91 , the orion sr9 , is equipped with a 5round ammunition holder that can accept a 30round magazine like the hk91 without further modification other prototypes approved by the bureau were made by american firms , like mitchell arms of santa ana , calif , which has a modified version of the ak47 import license needed one letter obtained by the firearms policy group was written in may from a bureau official to action arms ltd of philadelphia , which was seeking to import modified uzis the company was told that a redesigned uzi would likely be suitable for importation under the provisions of the gun control act of 1968 we are not allowing people to subvert the semiautomatic rifles ban , said jack killorin , a spokesman for the firearms agency he said that the manufacturers or distributors of these weapons have submitted prototypes of the modified weapons in the past year to determine whether the modified designs would qualify for importation under the ban but he said that it was unclear whether any of the redesigned weapons may be marketable in the united states , although some manufacturers have already started listing the altered versions in advertisements in gun publications mr killoran said that so far none of the manufacturers or distributors have applied for an import license , which would trigger another review by the bureau to determine whether the weapons qualify for sale under the ban a semiautomatic rifle requires no manual action except a single trigger pull to fire every bullet gun control advocates say that these weapons are extremely dangerous when the firing capability is combined with features like largecapacity magazines that hold dozens of bullets and pistol grips some members of congress criticized the administration for taking steps to permit the weapons to be sold in the united states we are either going to keep these weapons off our streets or we are not , said senator howard m metzenbaum , an ohio democrat the bush adminstration would do well to rethink its policy altogether and ban all assault weapons , foreign or domestic drawing
the leaders of the seven major industrialized nations may arrive at decisions in houston this week that can make or break the present uruguay round of multinational trade talks if they listen to food exporting countries , especially in the third world , they will hear this open up markets , or forget about new trade rules on services and intellectual property that message , so critical to trade and growth , needs to be heard if the houston summit participants follow the european community , which offers a vague and not very stringent approach to subsidies , the uruguay round will fail but if they take heed of the us position , that developed countries should end their protectionist farm policies , there s a good chance of a new trade pact , with benefits for almost all disagreements over farm subsidies wo n't be resolved in houston but the leaders can make a crucial start with a ringing declaration to their trade negotiators to phase down farm subsidies none of the participants arrived in houston with clean hands japan bars rice imports the us blocks sugar imports from desperately poor latin american neighbors western europe , however , is the worst sinner it protects inefficient farmers by blocking imports and keeping internal prices high it then dumps the enormous surpluses on foreign markets by subsidizing exports this bailout costs european taxpayers and consumers a whopping 100 billion a year and lowcost third world farmers are wiped out by the influx of artificially cheap european exports and blocked access to europe s markets the monumentally wasteful system is testimony to the political power of europe s 10 million farmers the bush administration is fighting to turn all this around mr bush is pressuring japan and the ec to phase out protectionist farm policies this would hurt protected growers , but help overall us exports countries still could provide farmers with income supplements unrelated to production welfare but subsidies or any other interference with market prices would end the administration s specific recommendation is to convert protectionist policies into tariffs , which would be phased down the advantage of tariffs is that they are visible and easily monitored tariffication is how industrialized countries eliminated barriers to trading manufactured goods it s also the best way to handle farm goods the europeans prefer to work with an aggregate measure of protectionism , as yet undefined , which they would lower that would allow them , for example , to reduce some tariffs and raise others the problem is that an aggregate measure would be hard to interpret and could easily disguise the impact of specific protectionist policies the uruguay round is beginning to take on the flavor of trade union bargaining everyone waits until the midnight deadline to compromise but delay here could be fatal the issues are too complicated for a lastminute compromise and there are scores of countries , each with its own internal constituency , to placate the leaders meeting in houston do n't need to resolve all the details but they do have to stand up to farm blocs and give the orders to make the uruguay round succeed
to the editor susan amper maintains \( letter , sept 26 \) that james fenimore cooper s leatherstocking tales were the first to portray native americans positively , thus preempting the 19thcentury german writer karl may but ms amper does not speak of native americans at all , only of natty bumppo , the frontiersman who is the true hero in cooper s stories indeed , cooper presented american indians in anything but a flattering light though frequently noble , they are still savages , who possess a sort of native guile , but are clearly inferior to the white settlers in intellectual and moral qualities the most devastating \( and hilarious \) critique of cooper s condescension was offered by none other than mark twain in fenimore cooper s literary offenses karl may s american west was largely the product of a fertile imagination , and his idealized image of winnetou and other native americans was permeated by the conviction that western european civilization had become exhausted and corrupt but his attempt to show that winnetou had something valuable to teach his white companion , old shatterhand , was an honest , if somewhat naive , expression of hope that humanity as a whole would not be lost if only we could recover some of our original virtues robert e norton asst prof , german , vassar college poughkeepsie , ny , sept 26 , 1990 drawing

it took 10 years to produce disasters of war and another 43 to publish the series of etchings their visit to the benton museum at the university of connecticut , however , is brief on loan from the sarah campbell blaffer foundation in houston , these 80 images leave storrs on march 11 goya , who made the etchings , had his reasons for delaying their publication as first painter to the king of spain , he was much in demand as a portraitist and retained his popularity even when the crown fell to napoleon s brother , joseph , during the french occupation of spain , 1808 to 1814 yet the appalling effects of the occupation and the accompanying civil strife became his subject with scenes like that of a firing squad , third of may , it was his finest hour as a painter but politically , he seems to have been forever bobbing and weaving and eventually had to exile himself to france , of all places still , none of this really explains the decision to withhold the disasters , for they seem now to be as much an indictment of human bestiality as they are of the french they appeared in 1863 , 35 years after the artist died the series begins with gloomy presentiments of things to come , in which a ragged man with arms outstretched kneels in a dark rocky setting as if he were john the baptist , prophesying in the wilderness then comes mayhem with the french , looking rather like cossacks , bayoneting civilians and civilians poleaxing the french women pitch in , too note the one in the illustration who impales a soldier without losing her grip on her baby two prints later , she who takes a light to the cannon must stand on bodies to do so the only woman not depicted heroically is the one who is passing derelicts on the street in the worst is begging a lone sign of prosperity , she is evidently a collaborator in most cases , women are put to the sword as speedily as men , but the victims of torture , garroting and dismemberment are invariably male a particularly grisly scene involves two bewhiskered soldiers working on a naked man while a third soldier looks on approvingly seemingly , the purpose is to bisect the victim lengthwise , but he is being castrated , hence the caption what more can be done \? captions or titles , the words to these ghastly scenarios are goya s , and they give a weird journalistic immediacy to the proceedings photography may be more realistic than art , but it would be interesting to know if those able to take or leave eyegouging scenes in movies could contemplate these reports , made almost 200 years ago , without feeling ill there is no greater indictment of war or , for that matter , humanity yet these synonyms for each other persist unchanged , and artists against war still believe they can make a difference but they are human , too , and so was goya it is rare to see the disasters all together hung as they are here , framed in gilt , two to a canvas panel , these ominous rectangles of black , gray and white can never have looked more impressive all the same , to study the awful accuracy , the sheer engineering knowhow that goya brings to bear , is to realize how well he proves the adage it takes one to know one , or , as the philosopher giambattista vico put it , the proper study of man is man initially , the enemy is the french , but pretty soon it is whoever has the advantage at any given moment , as in the people and he deserved it each features a mob having its way with a single , bound victim halfway through the series , the tension subsides , and the story becomes one of famine and despair , plunder and burials toward the end , goya reverts to the mysteries of his earlier series , capriccios , depicting , for example , a priest with a parrot s head performing for donkeys and monkeys and a horse kicking out at dogs in spiked collars , who have only to bide their time apparently , there are three more plates , but for some reason they escaped the series in its first printing and have not since been restored here , the history ends as it began , focusing on a single figure this time it is a woman , presumably the personification of spain , and she lies on the ground , her head haloed in light , while figures , some with animals' heads , gather in the darkness will she rise again \? is the legend when a message is as strong as this , the art with which it is conveyed can go by the board yet the message would be nothing without the art , and most of the time this is stunning patches of savage black scratching , gray and black fields of coarse aquatint and the light sometimes bleak , sometimes coruscating that is in the best of the master s paintings this is not a fun show , but it would be a pity to miss it concurrent with the disasters \( and a relief from them \) are the paintings of john gregoropoulos a former teacher of art at the university and a veteran of exibitions in connecticut and manhattan , mr gregoropoulos offers a retrospective from the late 1940 s to the present overall , the trend is from abstractions calligraphic images reminiscent of bradley walker tomlin s , geometric shapes that despite their clean edges and uninflected colors recall robert motherwell in his spanish elegy phase to figuration there are some nudes , drawn in a fine line and heightened with smudges of black or dark blue , and a notable digression into american impressionism a view of a field and hedges in summer , this is titled a painting for painting s sake and , in the present context , looks as if it had been done to settle an argument about painting mr gregoropoulos may have had a few of these with others or with himself for , in a restrained way , his work conveys much intellectual tension as a figural painter , he uses images increasingly in a nonobjective way , making them vehicles for subtle combinations of colors and moods a recurrent theme is a renaissancestyle building standing in de chiricoesque solitude sometimes it looms flat and menacing , at other times it is the sum of the shadows cast by its moldings and balconies today , it is scarcely more than a silhouette accompanied by palm trees the artist has a bit of a sweet tooth where colors are concerned the pinks and purples especially nevertheless , he uses them sparingly and applies them thinly in fluffy strokes , somewhat in the manner of theodoros stamos whether or not they were painted there , the images transport the viewer to the mediterranean , and that is not an unpleasant experience goya s disasters of war and the retrospective of the paintings of john gregoropoulos will remain at the benton museum of art at the university of connecticut in storrs through march 11 photo and they are wild beasts from goya s disasters of war series , at the benton museum
there is a surprise plot twist at the end of the first act of theme and variations , a play by the soviet writer samuil alyoshin at the chelsea stage that is built solely around a faintly amusing case of mistaken identity this error , which goes uncorrected and undetected through much of the second act because of the lust and selfinterest of the misidentified , alters the lives of all three characters in the play unfortunately , this unexpected turn of events comes only after a tedious introduction of the other two characters , told mostly in the exchange of a series of rather mundane letters the story evolves out of a chance meeting between two muscovite lawyer friends near a statue of pushkin in simferopol , the old crimean city that has built a small cottage industry out of the fact that russia s great poet once spent three weeks there on his way from st petersburg to somewhere else the two men make the acquaintance of lyuba \( kathleen mccall \) , a beautiful young tour guide who gives her entourage a 10minute break to take photographs of the pushkin statue dmitri \( william wise \) , the older lawyer , quotes pushkin with the young woman igor \( ethan phillips \) , the younger lawyer , tries to impress her in a more traditional way , and fails he does , however , manage to get her home address back in moscow , dmitri writes to the young woman , and the rest of the first act is a recitation of their correspondence the world of letters may be the grandfather of all literature , but , with a few exceptions , it is not a literary device that transfers successfully to the stage mr alyoshin uses it in theme and variations for character exposition the trouble is that the characters these epistles expose are ordinary people living commonplace lives filled with familiar problems lyuba turns out to be a complainer of the it s always something school she s bored her husband wants her to give dinner parties to help his career her motherinlaw is always criticizing her she gets so angry that she slams a door dmitri is one of those older men who are full of understanding he is supportive he has an aphorism for every occasion do n't slam doors , he advises lyuba it s not the door s fault the deeper problem with the play , however , is that none of this really leads anywhere , even after the inadvertent mistake in identity leads to a secondact spiral of deception , betrayal and accusation as an illustration of the darker side of human nature and the ironies present in the process of selfdiscovery , theme and variations has all the ingredients for a good short story despite energetic and animated performances , especially by miss mccall and mr phillips , neither the cast nor geoffrey sherman s lively direction can overcome the mediocrity and sedentary nature of so much of the material theme and variations by samuil alyoshin english translation by michael glenny directed by geoffrey sherman set and lighting design , paul wonsek costumes , marianne powell parker sound design , richard rose production stage manager , randy lawson presented by chelsea stage , 441 west 26th street mr sherman , artistic director dara hershman , managing director igor mikhailovichethan phillips lyubov \( lyuba \) sergeyevnakathleen mccall dmitri nikolayevichwilliam wise photo ethan phillips and kathleen mccall in a scene from theme and variations \( gerry goodstein theme and variations \)
warren h phillips , the longtime chairman , chief executive officer and guiding spirit of dow jones company , announced yesterday that he would step down as chief executive of the publishing and information company on jan 1 and retire on july 1 , soon after he turns 65 peter r kann , the company s president and chief operating officer and publisher of the wall street journal , will become chief executive officer it is widely assumed that mr kann , who is 47 years old , will also be named chairman when mr phillips retires kenneth l burenga , the company s general manager , will replace mr kann as chief operating officer by choosing mr kann as his successor , mr phillips has insured that dow jones will have at its head a person who rose from the news operation of the wall street journal , the company s crown jewel mr phillips was the managing editor of the journal for several years and mr kann won a pulitzer prize in 1972 for his coverage of the indiapakistan war as the journal s asia correspondent striking growth for much of the 15 years since mr phillips became the company s chief executive officer , dow jones experienced enormous prosperity and was a darling of wall street , principally because of the striking growth of advertising and circulation of the journal during the boom years of the 1980 s as the journal succeeded financially , mr phillips greatly expanded its size while adding to its existing reputation as one of the nation s premier news organizations he added a third section and pushed aggressively to cover asia and europe with separate editions but in recent years , and especially in recent months , the company s performance has been damaged by declining advertising sales at the journal and reduced profits from the company s information services group , which includes telerate inc , a financial data company indeed , mr phillips will be stepping down at a time when the wisdom of his decision to acquire telerate for 16 billion is being questioned by industry analysts because of telerate s failure to justify the investment thus far the last halfdecade has been much less joyous than the first 10 years , said john s reidy , an analyst for smith barney , harris upham company in new york he added that whether the telerate investment proves a success will not be known for a couple of years last week , mr phillips and mr kann announced a costcutting plan that included a freeze on capital spending and all departmental budgets , including total salary costs , at the budgeted 1990 level because of negotiated salary increases with unions , the freeze likely means that vacancies will not be filled the plan also callled for holding down news space in our publications , a reduction in the number of special reports , postponing the creation of a magazine , cutting the use of freelancers and correspondents , eliminating almost all relocations of people , and other moves to save money while the journal has been subject to economy efforts during mr phillips s tenure , there has been a great reluctance to do anything that might be perceived as diminishing the quality or breadth of the paper s coverage no more immunity analysts interpreted the plan as a signal that the journal would no longer be immune to severe constraints if they were necessary , and they hailed mr phillips for his willingness to make the cutbacks he stepped up and made the decision he had to , said james d dougherty , an analyst at county natwest securities inc but mr dougherty and others expressed concern that the cuts the journal had made , similar to those at many other papers , would eventually hurt i suspect the average reader may not notice next year or the year after that , but eventually they have to , mr dougherty said a spokesman for dow jones said none of the executives involved in yesterday s announcement would be available for an interview as head of the company , mr kann will be faced with the task of restoring the journal s level of profitability and making telerate a financial success that will justify the company s enormous investment in 1985 , the company s business publications group , which includes the journal and barron s , accounted for about 75 percent of dow jones s operating income in 1989 , that contribution had declined to 30 percent , reflecting both the difficult times for advertising and the absence of big cuts in overhead the information services group provided 64 percent of dow jones s operating income 1989 , which showed an overall decline of 46 percent , to 335

florence at first , it seemed almost incomprehensible that the united states had qualified for the world cup finals for the first time in 40 years within a country so poor in worldclass soccer tradition , a skepticism set in almost immediately , foretelling a future in italy that the team would be remembered more like the jamaican olympic bobsledders of 1988 who won an a for effort , nothing more than the united states hockey players of 1980 even now , as the youngest of 24 teams in the world cup field with an average player age of 23 , the americans are regarded as little more than light threats to advance beyond the first round , in which they play czechoslovakia on sunday in florence , italy on june 14 in rome and austria on june 19 in florence but stranger things have happened in a game neither so measured nor measurable as baseball , basketball or even bobsledding , for that matter the proper mix of enthusiasm , guts and luck by one team can shatter the best intentions of another besides , none of the czechoslovak or austrian players have ever participated in a world cup , and the pressure on the italians , as the home team , to win will be enormous we 've got three games to play , bob gansler , the united states coach , said last week will we be nervous \? anxious \? will we have trepidations \? of course but perhaps there will be a few butterflies around the other locker rooms , as well for the americans , their style of play evolving under gansler might not matter so much as their level of energy in fact , their style is a little difficult to define throughout the training period since regional qualifying , six months in which they went 871 in 16 exhibition games , they showed a little of this , a little of that , depending upon whom they played and when we do n't really have a style it s something we have to develop , said tab ramos , a united states midfielder who was born in uruguay you ca n't watch us and say , 'this is the american style of play' i think it s going to take 5 or 10 years to develop , and it will probably reflect the different ethnic backgrounds of the team style aside , the americans have improved greatly in the months since qualifying , particularly in scoring goals , a common problem among all soccer teams they have become more creative and patient and determined and , in their most recent games , have learned to control the ball longer in the goal area attacking , the united states relies mostly on setups by ramos , its best ballhandler , and the indefatigable john harkes , who is learning to modulate the speed with which he plays the best finishers have been bruce murray , a forward whose uncanny ability to be around the ball belies his gawky style , and peter vermes , the other forward , who has more european club experience than any other player on the team eric wynalda had been one of the other leading scorers , but from a forward position he no longer plays gansler has moved him to the wing , which requires him to expend more energy on defense than he is accustomed to as a forward paul caligiuri , whose goal against trinidad and tobago in the last game of qualifying clinched a spot in the final round for the united states , compensates as much as possible from the other wing position when he needs another finisher in the game , gansler uses chris sullivan , a forward who played this year for a first division club team in hungary , in the midfield the defense has been sound since the start of training , though in recent games , several exchanges with the goalkeeper , tony meola or kasey keller , to clear the ball were harrowing for their lack of concentration one led to an easy goal that kind of stuff has got to stop , vermes said after one recent game through most of the training period , it has barely mattered whether meola or keller was the goalkeeper talk about youth each is 20 , not even half as old as england s goalkeeper , peter shilton , whose 41st birthday is three months away both of the americans are athletic and quick , with meola the more aggressive of the two , playing much farther out from the goal mouth than keller in general , the players on defense tend to crowd the opposing dribbler , trying to force an errant pass , rather than rely upon a single player , who by the cleverness of his feet can extricate the ball from his man the best of them is michael windischmann , the 24yearold team captain , who plays the sweeper position behind a line generally composed of desmond armstrong , the strongest of the group steve trittschuh , the weakest , and john stollmeyer , the most pugnacious the absence of more players with outstanding technical skills has also hurt the team in the midfield , where the players sometimes struggle , trying to move the ball into the attack zone ramos may be the only ballhandler who can dribble oneonone or onethroughmany with any consistency for all the improvements in the last few months , several questions remain , the most critical being how the team will react to competition far more intense than what it has experienced in the 16 exhibitions only vermes and sullivan have played meaningful games recently , those with their european clubs , since the qualifying round ended in november photo john harkes of the united states team \( allsport \)
washington , sept 13 following are excerpts from today s opening session of senate judiciary committee hearings on the nomination of david h souter to the supreme court , as recorded by the federal news service , a transcription company opening statements senator joseph r biden jr you come before us without an extensive record that details your views on important constitutional questions of our time and i say that not critically i say that as an observation you are an extremely bright man with an extremely admirable record but the past responsibilities you 've had have not required you to enunciate your views in any detail on major constitutional issues and questions and as a result , we need your help for us to be able to understand your constitutional philosophy , the philosophy that you would bring to the nation s highest court we need you to join us in a meaningful and important dialogue about the constitution and let me be clear on one point , judge i , as chairman of this committee , am not asking you for any commitments as to how you would vote on any specific case , nor am i trying to pry , nor am i attempting to pry into your personal views on publicly debated issues rather , we want to know what principles you would apply , what philosophies you would employ as you exercise the awesome , and i emphasize awesome , power you will hold if you are confirmed as a justice , an associate justice , to the supreme court of the united states today our nation , our constitution , as interpreted by the court , is at a crossroads there are some very fundamental choices to be made will the fourth , fifth and sixth amendments protecting our civil liberties of a fair trial , of freedom from unreasonable searches , remain intact as it is today \? will the power of the 14th amendment s equal protection clause , used to root out discrimination against racial minorities and women in our society , be diminished \? judge souter , because of the close division on the court on the meaning of these constitutional guarantees , many of which are divided 5 to 4 , or in essence now will be 4 to 4 , you , judge souter , the single man in this room who can affect in the near term the outcome of all these issues at this fateful moment in our history , judge , we have a right to know , a duty to discover , precisely what you , judge david hackett souter , think about the great constitutional issues of our time i believe we can engage in a real discussion on these issues while respecting your judicial independence judge , put bluntly , the burden of proof is on you , judge souter , the nominee , as it is on us when we stand for election the power is awesome , the duty is profound , the obligation is yours and the responsiblity is ours no one knows , judge souter , what questions the supreme court will have to resolve in the year 2024 , the year until which you will serve on the court , god willing , should you be confirmed and serve as long as your predecessor of one thing though , we can be sure if the history of this great nation is any guide , tomorrow s issues , whatever form they take , will pit government power against individual liberty majority tyranny against personal rights the danger of discrimination against the dream of equality for all americans to consent to your nomination we must have considerable guidance as to what kind of supreme court , what vision of the constitution you will provide for our grandchildren for the next few days , judge souter , open for us a window into your mind and give us a little bit of a glimpse into your heart senator edward m kennedy judge souter has distinguished intellectual background , and he has spent the great majority of his legal career in public service but the aspects of his record on the bench and while serving in the new hampshire attorney general s office raise troubling questions about the depth of his commitment to the indispensable role of the supreme court in protecting individual rights and liberties in this day and age , our constitutional freedoms are too important to entrust to justices who would turn back the clock on these basic issues while judge souter was serving in the new hampshire attorney general s office , he took a number of very troubling positions he argued the congress does not have the constitutional authority to ban state literacy tests for voting , even though such tests place needless barriers on the exercise of the most important right in a democracy , the right to vote he referred to abortion as the killing of unborn children , and opposed the repeal of an unconstitutional state abortion statute he defended the constitutionality of an order by the governor of new hampshire that flags on state buildings must be lowered to halfmast on good friday , an order enjoined by the courts because it clearly violated the constitutional requirement of separation of church and state there is little in his record that demonstrates real solicitude for the rights of those who are weakest and most powerless in our society , and who have historically had the most difficulty in obtaining these rights from the majorities that rule the legislatures in our democracy senator orrin g hatch
on stage in his oneman show , dylan thomas return journey , bob kingdom has the look of his subject short , portly , with a curled lower lip and the general appearance of a fallen cherub as he begins his performance at the hudson guild theater , the actor also reveals a measure of the disarming thomas manner he makes fun of himself while never forgetting that he is , first of all , an artist in love with words mr kingdom , who is welsh , is clearspoken , but , as the audience soon realizes , he lacks that resonant voice that made dylan thomas such a wonderful reader of his own work it is an attribute that any actor needs in performing thomas , especially when reciting his poetry this is , as mr kingdom explains , a thomas deep in his anecdotage the attempt is not a dramatic biography but a simulation of the poet in performance during his famous tours of the united states in the early 1950 s those were the tours that confirmed his celebrity and certified his dissolution , as lionization proved to be a crucial step in his selfvictimization included in the evening are thomas s bestknown poems , plus a few others not quite so familiar a full share of the show is devoted to the poetry , and , as it turns out , that is the least persuasive part of the evening as mr kingdom delivers the verse , one thinks of other actors who have specialized in reading or acting thomas richard burton , alec guinness and emlyn williams all brought more poetry to their performances anthony hopkins directed this oneman show , and one is forced to the conclusion that it might have have been more rewarding if it were the director rather than mr kingdom on stage mr kingdom is , however , effective with the informal thomas , chatting with deliberate casualness while commenting on his career even as he mocks european authors on the american lecture circuit , he accepts lecturing as one of his own methods of employment , performing on and off the podium and serving up bottomless glasses of instant dylan for an insatiable audience in passing , he makes fun of the bbc , professional irishmen , t s eliot and , perhaps most of all , fat poets with slim volumes surrounded , one might add , by attractive , admiring young women on college campuses it is clear from the selections from stories and letters as well as poetry that thomas not only had a gift for rhapsodic imagery but was an artful craftsman and stylist as well the most touching moment in the show is the reading of return journey itself , describing his homecoming to swansea walking the streets , he stops a series of citizens , asking them if they remember thomas none of them recognize him , but each recalls all the badness of his boyhood and never once credits him for his imagination finally he meets a man who echoes all the previous disparagement we have heard and then , responding to a question , declares that the exile is dead , dead , dead mr kingdom s wince is palpable death was , of course , a hovering presence in thomas s art , a fatalism allied with the poet s pantheistic attitude toward life mr kingdom ends his performance on that doubleedged note , with do not go gentle into that good night and fern hill the actor is not , as one would have hoped , dylan thomas restored to life the portrait is one of sincere homage and moderate verisimilitude anecdotage dylan thomas return journey , based on the works of dylan thomas directed by anthony hopkins presented by arthur cantor and bonnie nelson schwartz at the hudson guild , 441 west 26th street with bob kingdom photo bob kingdom
cairo , aug 11 the political map of the arab world has been remade , or perhaps erased , overnight the vote of the arab summit meeting on friday night to send a symbolic force to join american troops deployed in saudi arabia after iraq s takeover of kuwait shattered the myth of arab unity that has cloaked differences for decades it is as if someone threw all the pieces of a game up in the air this is the end of the arab world as we and they have known it , said judith kipper , a middle east analyst at the brookings institution arab world in turmoil the arabs basically are confronted with themselves , she said two myths went out the window their capacity to protect themselves and panarabism it s a tremendous identity crisis the swift unfolding of previously unthinkable events in the nine days since president saddam hussein of iraq gobbled up his wealthy but weak neighbor and former ally have left the arab world in turmoil egypt , only recently emerging from a decade of isolation brought on by its peace treaty with israel , has again become a center of the arab world with president hosni mubarak s handling of the crisis iraq , the most powerful single player , supported for years by other arabs as their protector from iran , is suddenly a pariah , an isolated renegade troops leave for saudi arabia the first several hundred egyptian paratroopers and deserttrained commandos left here today for saudi arabia in a cosmetic , but politically important , deployment to put an arab face on the american 82d airborne division s presence there arrangements were being made today for moroccan and syrian troops to join them but as a military and economic noose tightens around him , mr hussein has launched an emotional appeal to frustrated , impoverished and discontented arabs , invoking resentment not only of foreigners but of oilrich hereditary rulers and the alleged defiling of muslim shrines that could well threaten shaky arab governments elsewhere in the arab world , mr hussein found support in the streets in sana , the capital of yemen , 10 , 000 demonstrators screaming , fahd , atheist priest , saddam lives and you must die ! marched today on the saudi and american embassies the crowd , which was protesting the saudi king s invitation to american forces , threw rocks and wornout shoes , an arab insult thousands rallied in support of mr hussein in the biggest demonstration in mauritania in years , and palestinians demonstrated in the occupied west bank and gaza strip in algeria , tunisia and jordan , support groups were raising volunteers to aid iraq but in the first , morningafter sorting out , mr mubarak appeared to be emerging as an immediate winner historic turning point this will be one of those great markers in history , one of those events that indicates how disputes here will be resolved for the next 50 years , a senior western diplomat said today it puts the united states and this region in a new relationship that will be very important for its economic wellbeing for a long way down the road this sequence of events has reminded the united states of the importance of the relationship with egypt that it has nurtured now for 11 years , he added it has really paid off in terms of american interest in the past few days the senior diplomat went on to praise mr mubarak s handling of the immediate situation and egypt s return to influence in the arab world , saying this is longterm , a careful tending of garden the egyptians show a tremendous consistency they move in a straight line mobilizing arab countries he has moved with great , great care to mobilize the arab countries , first with the arab league resolution , then with the arab summit the arab leaders are now traveling to cairo , not to baghdad if all this plays out right , if gradually the noose tightens around iraq and the goal of its withdrawal from kuwait is achieved , if all that happens , egypt is going to come out in a strong position , he continued it will not be the strong postion of egypt of 20 years ago based on military power , but based on conviction and persuasion if mr mubarak seemed an immediate winner , yasir arafat , the palestine liberation organization leader , appeared to be a firstround loser frustrated with the lack of progress toward peace talks with israel despite the pressure of more than two years of violent protests in the israelioccupied territories , mr arafat had moved closer to iraq in recent months believing the center of gravity in the arab world was drifting toward baghdad but by casting his lot with iraq , mr arafat has strained relations with egypt , his main gobetween with the united states in attempting to reach some kind of settlement with israel perhaps even more important , he has alienated saudi arabia , his major bankroller mr arafat s own palestinian constituency is split , mirroring the dvisions between haves and havenots in the arab world while frustrated palestinians in the west bank , the gaza strip and jordan have been demonstrating in praise of mr hussein , seeing him as a tough leader who threatens israel , wealthy palestinian expatriates in the gulf region , who regularly pay a six percent income tax to the plo , have accused mr hussein of destroyed their livelihoods jordan s difficult position king hussein of jordan is also in a difficult position a longtime backer of saddam hussein , he wound up in an equivocal category at the summit , voting approval of the resolution with reservations the king is caught among a number of pressures , not the least of which is a strong current of public opinion in jordan supporting iraq , much of it from jordanians and palestinians who worked in kuwait and resent the way they were treated there president saddam hussein s portrayal of wealthy rulers as corrupt and subservient to the west could strike a responsive chord in jordan , some analysts believe to me , the gut issue is the regimes versus the people , because none of the arab regimes represent their people , and this is why there is such cheering in the streets for president hussein , ms kipper , the brookings expert , said in a telephone interview mr hussein has the wherewithal to foment protests through outposts of his own baath party and through payments to other political organizations that are emerging as the arab world edges toward a more open politics , particularly in the north african countries , diplomats and other experts said but in view of iraq s own human rights record , regarded by amnesty international and other watchdog organizations as one of the world s worst , a number found mr hussein s appeal ironic it is saddam as the avenger of past slights , appealing to everyone who was mistreated in kuwait , everybody in the refugee camps , said fouad ajami , a lebaneseborn middle east expert at the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies they will be disabused of this he is a man without scruples , a killer and a murderer on a vast scale this is panarabism with a bayonet , chemical weapons and a whip for all those who will not submit photo a day after the arab summit meeting , four participants met in cairo from left were president chadli bendjedid of algeria , col muammar elqaddafi of libya , president hosni mubarak of egypt , and president hafez alassad of syria frankly i tell you there is no hope for a peaceful solution to the crisis , said mr mubarak , who orchestrated the arab states' move to oppose iraq \( associated press \) \( pg 12 \)
michael r milken , the financier who agreed friday to plead guilty to six felony charges and pay 600 million in penalties , is not required to provide evidence of further wrongdoing to the government as part of the settlement , people who have been briefed on the deal said yesterday as a result , the government investigation of wrongdoing on wall street that bloomed in 1986 might well have reached its apex the possibility of such a cooperation agreement had created concern among lawyers and securities industry executives , who feared what mr milken might say mr milken was closely involved in takeovers with many of the leading financiers of the 1980 s , and there had been widespread speculation that he might be in a position to disclose details of illicit activities surrounding those transactions 'no agreement to make cases' there is no agreement for him to make cases , said one person who was briefed on the settlement while the absence of such a cooperation agreement is viewed by some securities lawyers as removing the possibility that mr milken might provide evidence against others , he could still be compelled to provide testimony to a grand jury under a grant of immunity unlike a cooperation agreement , which would require mr milken to provide details concerning every criminal activity about which he might have knowledge , compelled testimony would likely have less wideranging impact because it would deal with specific inquiries securities lawyers with an interest in the case had also said that they believed mr milken would provide evidence about the unfolding scandal at the nation s savings and loans , expected to cost taxpayers as much as 500 billion over 30 years savings and loans were among mr milken s crisscrossing network of customers at center of investigation mr milken , the influential financier who created the high yield junk bond market that fueled the big corporate takeovers in the 1980 s , has been at the center of the investigation that has rocked wall street since ivan f boesky , the former stock speculator , agreed to settle civil charges of insider trading and pay 100 million as part of his agreement with the government , mr boesky was required to provide evidence against other wall street figures , principally mr milken in addition to the possibility that mr milken might be forced to testify under immunity , if his preliminary agreement with the government becomes final and is approved by a federal district court , he will be interviewed by the government for information , which is standard procedure but people who have been briefed on the details of the government deal said that mr milken will not be interviewed until after he is sentenced by federal district judge kimba m wood , who is hearing the case the preliminary plea agreement would also settle all the outstanding charges that were filed in september 1988 by the sec against the financier people who have been briefed on the deal said that the 600 million figure includes penalties for both the criminal and civil charges against mr milken people involved in the case said they expected the six charges against mr milken to center on mail fraud , wire fraud and other illegal activities involving improper securities transactions these people said that they expected mr milken to plead guilty to at least one charge that has not been publicly disclosed the financier has been under continuing investigation by prosecutors since he was indicted last march no insider trading charge mr milken will not plead guilty to any charges of racketeering or insider trading , charges that were included in his original indictment , these people said mr milken cast a long shadow over one of the most remarkable eras in wall street s history , adding to the myth and lore of that time even through his own compensation he was the most highly paid financier in history , collecting more than 11 billion between 1983 and 1987 from drexel and additional income from personal investments but the agreement would represent the final unraveling in the career of mr milken , who built the reputation of a financial wizard over two decades , only to see it all slip away after mr boesky agreed to testify against him since then , drexel has pleaded guilty to six criminal charges that described mr milken as being at the crux of schemes that allowed the company to cheat a client , manipulate the marketplace and trick a corporation into being taken over mr milken will now face the fallout from civil lawsuits by investors and shareholders who assert that he defrauded them through his securities transactions mr milken may well be required to pay a large amount of additional money as a result of those suits none of the original charges against mr milken involved direct abuses of junk bonds rather , they related to what the government described as the use of his position to commit crimes in an effort to gain money and control the markets mr milken s decision to plead guilty was an abrupt turnabout for the financier , who had assiduously maintained his innocence throughout more than three years of investigations the turnabout came on the eve of a deadline established by prosecutors for mr milken to settle the charges or be faced with a second , more wideranging indictment
manhattan beach , calif , april 30 angry parents have been digging at the mcmartin preschool , which will be demolished soon , in a search for hidden rooms and tunnels where they believe their children were molested the mcmartin school is now owned by a hermosa beach real estate broker , arnold goldstein , who plans to raze it and erect an office buiding he has given the parents until may 10 to do their digging i'm permitting these people to go on the property to find whatever they want and get it out of their system , mr goldstein said in january a superior court jury acquitted peggy mcmartin buckey , 63 years old , of 12 charges and her son , raymond , 31 , of 40 counts in connection with the case mr buckey is being retried on eight counts on which jurors deadlocked more than a dozen former students talked to prosecutors about a trap door , tunnel or secret underground room at the manhattan beach school but none was ever found , deputy district attorney roger gunson said only one student testified at the trial about a secret molestation room , and he did not indicate that it was underground a search of the school years ago turned up no passageways or trap doors and no signs that floor tiles had been replaced or concrete had been patched , mr gunson said
rye brook , ny three years ago , the six kayulu children henry , elode , patrick , nadine , sondra and natasha lived in a hovel in kinshasa , zaire it had no kitchen or bathroom they cooked on an open fire next to the outhouse today , the children , ages 6 to 16 , live in the rye town hilton hotel , where instead of flies , stretch limousines swarm outside they can swim , watch the cosby show and take long hot baths but cinderella s ball ends where their limbo begins homeless illegal aliens , they are the focus of two legal maneuverings how they got from zaire , with severe poverty and a record of humanrights abuses , to here is a twisted tale involving a diplomat s disappearance , a mother s desertion , a lawyer s resolve and a county s quirkiness how their story will end fills henry s eyes with fear i'm so scared we 'll have to go back , he said in october 1987 , jeanette kayulu brought her six children and her mother from zaire to the united states they all moved in with ms kayulu s sister , the wife of a canadian diplomat in new york city the couple , with three children of their own in a rented home in rye , had financed the trip whether the nine children and inlaws finally proved too much for the diplomat , rene thibault , only he knows for sure but in may 1989 , he disappeared , county officials and family members said a month later , the diplomat s wife and children returned to canada \( the diplomat himself eventually turned up there and rejoined his family \) ms kayulu followed , apparently in search of work but not being an immediate family member of mr thibault , she was deported to zaire the six children were stranded in the house in rye , along with their grandmother , a former herbalist in zaire who speaks only lingala they were left with not a mattress to sleep on , not a toothbrush , not a pot , said judith wiener of helping hands for the homeless and hungry , a westchester group that has aided the family by august they were on the street as state law requires , westchester county provided temporary emergency housing , putting them in a motel in stamford , conn the county also offered the family members seven oneway tickets to zaire , but they politely declined over the next few months the county reached all the parties involved , but none were interested in taking responsibility immigration and naturalization tried neither to deport the family nor to change their status the mother , back in zaire , relayed a plea to keep and educate her children because she did n't have the means to do so canadian and zairian officials were of little help , the county said that s when the tale turned litigious with the state s permission , westchester cut off the family s housing and benefits , because illegal aliens are ineligible for public assistance jerrold m levy , a lawyer with westchester legal services , filed suit against the county and state in state supreme court and won restoration of the benefits pending the outcome these are unique circumstances , mr levy said these are innocent children who were abandoned he argues that immigration and naturalization , by doing nothing , has acquiesced to the family s residency and that full benefits should therefore follow a victory in court would not change the family s illegal alien status , however , leaving them vulnerable to deportation another lawyer , allen e kaye of manhattan , is working that angle so far , they fall through the cracks , he said , referring to the family and adding that he is hoping for adoption and political asylum westchester county is now considering its own lawsuit legislators will soon vote to authorize a suit against immigration and naturalization for failing to take action , demanding reimbursement for the hotel costs immigration and naturalization says simply that the family is not an enforcement priority after being evicted from the stamford motel in march , the family was placed in two rooms in the hilton at a cost of 9 , 000 a month westchester points to a state guideline that homeless children be housed as close to their school district as possible , in this case rye , and insists it is looking for cheaper quarters even the family s champions find the choice absurd it has restricted the generosity of the community because people say , 'hey , they 're in the rye town hilton , ' mrs wiener said for now , the children are immersing themselves in american culture and thriving in school elode runs track and listens to new kids on the block henry is in rye high school s reserve officer training corps patrick was third baseman in summer little league they all love pizza and vanilla ice cream when we did n't have anything to eat in zaire , we did n't eat , henry said there was no helping hands
the best of wall street s merger experts in the 1980 s specialized in determining how much debt their target companies could take on in a leveraged buyout to do so , they made assumptions about the future , including the direction of interest rates , economic growth , inflation , even oil prices but none of them figured on saddam hussein the iraqi invasion of kuwait has sent wall street and corporate america back to the calculators , and a number of the assumptions that determined the prices of takeover deals have been discarded since the invasion , oil prices have soared more than 70 percent , increasing inflationary pressure and the economy , already slowing , appears to many economists to have been pushed to the edge of recession among the deals that investment bankers say are most likely to be affected by the iraqi invasion are the airline buyouts or merger agreements made in the last year , including the proposed employeeled buyout of the ual corporation , the parent of united airlines , and the leveraged buyout of nwa inc , the parent of northwest airlines the reasons for the potential troubles in those deals are simple barring a turnaround , airlines will pay much more for fuel at a time when potential passengers have less money to spend on air travel the impact on the ual deal , which has yet to obtain financing , has been the most striking since the iraqi invasion ual s stock price has tumbled from 140 a share on the last day of trading in july to 9350 a share on friday and the deadline to arrange financing for the 438 billion bid had to be extended for two months the situation is not so difficult at nwa , which was purchased in 1989 by a consortium of buyers led by alfred checchi , a former marriott corporation executive from beverly hills , calif although that deal has been completed , with the most of the 335 billion in debt financing coming from the bankers trust company , some fear that the rise in jet fuel costs could cause problems that were not anticipated during the buyout northwest could fall into trouble , said one investment banker who has examined the deal the only question is what are they going to do about it \? a number of analysts said that while they had expected the company to try to go public again by next year , the situation in iraq had changed their assumptions they are likely to try and refinance , said helane becker , an airline analyst with lehman brothers john dasburg , the executive vice president of finance and administation for nwa , said through a spokesman that the company had no plans to refinance the acquisition debt but wall street executives involved in the talks said that a number of commercial banks had begun to scrutinize nwa s financial position , apparently with an interest in putting capital into the company unlike ual , which is trying to raise its debt now , nwa has been paying off its obligations the company has paid down its debt faster than had been required under its agreement with bankers trust , with the result , one banker said , that the company will not be required to make any additional payments until 1992 nwa reduced its 335 billion in debt to 21 billion as of the end of march , and it projects a debt level of 175 billion by the end of the year , said bob gibons , a spokesman for the company they are way ahead of schedule with the banks , said paul p karos , an airline analyst with the first boston corporation so maybe there is some breathing room here for them in this situation that debt reduction would put the company in a better debt position than a number of other airlines , analysts said kevin murphy , an industry analyst with morgan stanley company , said there were several airlines whose debt levels , combined with their business prospects , put them in worse shape than northwest if they have to walk the gangplank , he said , referring to nwa , they have a lot of people in front of them moreover , nwa has assets that it has turned to its advantage for example , the company got 384 million earlier this year by mortgaging property it owns in japan through the tobishima corporation , a construction company based in tokyo but nwa faces some financial hurdles that have been raised a little higher by the crisis in the persian gulf by sept 29 , klm royal dutch airlines , one of the equity investors in the consortium of buyers , must significantly reduce its 400 million equity stake in nwa as part of an agreement between the company and the transportation department klm has announced that it will cut back its equity holdings by 250 million wall street had expected the checci group to try to repurchase the stake , although now some say it is unclear whether another equity partner will have to be brought in nevertheless , bankers and analysts said , northwest s management , which had been exploring plans to buy a large part of eastern airlines and had been expected to issue shares by 1991 , will most likely have to scale back its plans i do n't think they 'll be bidding on eastern anymore , mr murphy said and this may thwart checci s ability to go public anytime in the near term
in recent months , four oil companies have followed arco s lead in introducing cleanerburning gasolines in a limited number of markets , and more are likely to follow but for all the marketing fanfare accompanying the new products , most americans should not expect to see such lowerpollution gasolines at local pumps for at least three years the reason is that the oil industry has not spent the billions of dollars necessary to produce enough of a crucial additive that is used in greater quantities in the new gasolines the additive , methyl tertiary butyl ether , includes an oxygen molecule that promotes more thorough combustion in the engine most oil companies say they do not want to add refinery capacity to produce more of the additive until the government and the states settle on pollution standards but some oilcompany critics accuse the industry of dragging its feet under growing pressure from congress and the states to do more about air pollution , some oil companies have moved ahead with cleanerburning gasolines on a small scale in doing so they are departing from other oil companies that have decided to wait for the results early next year of an important industry study on which gasoline formula burns the cleanest signals from the marketplace early signs that drivers want cleaner gasolines could force more refiners to make the leap arco said that since it began selling its new gasoline , ec1 , for older cars in southern california last september , its share of the fuel market for pre1975 cars those without pollutionlowering catalytic converters , for which the gasoline was designed had increased to 35 percent , from 33 percent local authorities say arco s new gasoline reduces air pollution by 20 percent in cars using it the companies that have joined arco in selling cleanerburning gasoline in the last month include the nation s largest gasoline marketer , the shell oil company last week shell introduced the widest program thus far when it began selling a reformulated gasoline in 10 cities that can be used in most cars while it is comparable in price with the premium unleaded gasoline it replaced , the new gasoline costs 15 to 20 cents more than regular unleaded , the most popular blend since late last month , the marathon oil company has sold clean blends of regular , midgrade and premium unleaded gasoline in eight counties in southeast michigan , including detroit in much of colorado , conoco inc and diamond shamrock r m inc are each selling reformulated gasolines for older cars the sun company said it will introduce its reformulated gasoline later this year some oil companies , including texaco inc and the amoco oil company , said they would probably not introduce any reformulated gasolines until the completion early next year of at least the first part of a study financed by the big three auto makers and 14 oil companies tests on 16 fuels and gasoline blends began earlier this month at a ford motor company research laboratory in dearborn , mich the exxon corporation would not discuss whether it was planning any reformulated gasoline many pollutants reduced most of the new gasoline blends share formulas that not only replace polluting olefins with cleanerburning mtbe but also reduce hydrocarbon evaporation before burning and cut emissions of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide from the combustion itself they also diminish levels of a toxic aromatic called benzene these fuels more than meet many standards for cleaner gasoline that california s airquality regulators are expected to require by 1992 the standards expected to be the toughest in the nation for a minimum oxygen level of 1 percent , for example , is met by all the blends but none of the blends meet the oxygen minimum for 1992 of 2 percent , and 27 percent for 1994 , which would be required in the clean air act approved by the united states senate on april 4 that was the major obstacle in the bill for gasoline refiners oil refiners said they could meet the higher oxygen levels approved by the senate by adding more mtbe to their blends but they caution that the shortage of mtbe refining capacity will make it difficult to produce enough for all of the nation s gasoline before the mid1990 s blending in ethanol , an alcohol extracted from corn , is another way of adding more oxygen to gasoline the commodity is plentiful in the farm belt , which has promoted ethanol as a cleaner fuel for years senator thomas a daschle , democrat of south dakota , sponsored the higheroxygen standard adopted in the senate bill , but the industry is opposed , saying the action would mandate the use of ethanol for several years strong arco position while most oil companies have limited capacity to make mtbe , arco is better off its sister company , the arco chemical company , makes 40 percent of the world s mtbe the additive has been used for more than two decades as a replacement for lead in gasoline , but more is required in the new formulas so huge additional amounts would have to be produced to supply all cars the new gasolines average about 15 percent mtbe , compared with levels as low as 5 percent and even less in some unleaded gasolines
durham , nc the threat of a bush disaster comes not from his character or style but from his beliefs that could change let s hope it does president bush is a healthy character who acts more like a fox than a lamb the prediction that he would be an activepositive president has been confirmed he has spent a year energetically engaged in politics and enjoying it day by day he is not like former presidents taft , harding and reagan , who , despite their images , are now known to have been white house wimps , smiling all the while they did what their wives and coaches told them to do clearly george bush is no mindtwisted richard nixon he is not , and was not , a person using politics to cure his tragic tension he has the health and he has the style and the skills he needs he digs out information he deals effectively as a managerial negotiator he manages his rhetoric to fit the cycle of the public mood , in 1988 as mr conscience and now as mr conciliation but what beliefs really guide his actions \? he believes in aristocracy he acts to advance the rich and the powerful historically , aristocrats like george bush have managed to ward off the challenge of real democracy , not by damning the people \( at least in public \) but by confusing them mr bush used that distractive power in his 1988 campaign , by flashing the flag and damning prison furloughs he came across as a strong advocate for uplifting education and the environment and the homeless as it turned out , george bush did none of the above what he had said as if he believed in democracy turned out not to be a promise of action but a substitute for it he misled the inattentive public by projecting a plausible image that is a classic method aristocrats use for diverting government from consent of the governed mr bush s motto should have been read my lips , but do n't count on me in fact , he has been working for the welfare of the rich he damns taxation and shunts off responsibility for the sick , poor , abused , illiterate , aged and jobless onto private charity , echoing the appeals of herbert hoover during the great depression like other aristocrats , mr bush says he cares , but postpones the project he simplifies his emotions , but complexifies his behavior he sweeps aside history and planning in favor of immediate wheeling and dealing he surrounds himself , not with a rooseveltian brain trust to gain perspective , but with assistant managers to grab the present he claims credit for any good that happens , such as the rise of democracy in the world , as if his applauding was an exercise of power he advocates values that his actions undercut , such as a kinder and gentler america an aristocrat much prefers a secret star chamber to a public parliament mr bush s vision makes democracy domestic only , while international relations are to be secret and thus not subject to democratic revelation secrecy serves the insiders it also obscures acts that the public would find shockingly wrong , such as their tax money being funneled overseas to vicious mass murderers and torturers and thieves in power in central america , turkey and china that mr bush hustles for the rich and the powerful should have been no surprise not only is he related to queen elizabeth i , but he has spent his life cooperating with such people his grandfather was a big businessman , his father a big businessman and he himself became one in texas a millionaire his uncle supplied the investment that produced his fortune he belonged to three exclusive country clubs in houston in the house , his father got him assigned to the ways and means committee he ran for the senate with big money supplied by richard nixon , whose leadership he later devotedhimself to as head of the cia and the republican party as vice president , mr bush focused on enhancing the power of the president he had opposed to get his own presidential power , he did whatever his media advisors thought advantageous in other words , the world view of this president can be taken not as some ideology or religion , or as a political mission like jimmy carter s fight for human rights rather , it is simply the readily predictable aristocratic orientation of a man trained throughout his life by experiences that run counter to democracy but he need not follow that line , and one day he may not an activepositive person is not obsessed aristocrats in the presidency have included the roosevelts , for example , and many a political leader has departed from his rich friends and devoted himself to the people given the major crises and opportunities now confronting the us , we need a president who will advance real democracy not class greed and the lust for power at home and abroad three times in his past , mr bush has left behind the aristocrats and gone into what he saw as a new world into the navy at age 18 against his father s guidance , away from connecticut and off to texas to start a business and on to china despite president gerald ford s offer of the ambassador s post in britain or france despite his aristocratic leanings , then , president bush could become the modern mr democracy for those of us who would like to see a president who works for genuine democracy , that is the best hope we have until 1993 , at least drawing
'electronic textbooks' individual schools and school districts have been experimenting with videodisks to create what some teachers call electronic textbooks both florida and california , which is the nation s largest textbook market , are considering greater use of videodisks florida s department of education has undertaken a statewide videodisk program to teach students about aids videodisks are shiny platters about the size of a 12inch phonograph record upon which as many as 54 , 000 pieces of information sound and pictures are digitally stored the sound and images are retrieved when the disk is inserted in a disk player , which uses a beam of laser light to read the disk much the way a phonograph uses a stylus to play a record the teacher , or a student , wields a remotecontrol device to summon information to the classroom television screen disk players can be electronically linked to computers with specialized programs to search and play back information in response to students' questions the technology gives a teacher more flexibility than a conventional videotape or film strip the teacher can interact with students more readily while playing the disk and pinpoint specific elements of instruction quickly the disks are also not limited to narrative as a videotape is , and they can hold far more information , with more vivid imagery the hopes and doubts for a generation of young people who have tuned into video images for entertainment and recreation , videodisk players and largescreen televisions in school seem as natural as sunlight and windowpanes but with national reading scores continuing to slide and few scientific studies on the effectiveness of videoassisted teaching , educators are divided on whether wiring teachers to higher technologies will help students learn late last month , college board officials announced that the verbal skills of collegebound high school seniors who recently took the scholastic aptitude test had dropped to their lowest level in a decade robert g cameron , executive director of research and development for the board , a nonprofit education services company , said the decline was further evidence of an erosion of reading skills in an age in which electronics deliver much of the country s information jeanne chall , a harvard university professor of education and the director of the harvard reading laboratory , said careful use of sound and images in teaching could enliven a subject , but none of it should come at the expense of reading if the time comes when we find ourselves spending a great deal of time listening and looking at images , we will become a very weak nation in language and literacy , dr chall said the only way to read is to read a great deal delight with new tool in round rock , tex , about 20 miles north of austin , the videodisk system the state is considering has been extensively used in a pilot program to the delight of teachers there teachers enjoyed using it and students responded well to it , said virginia woods , science coordinator for the 20 , 000student school system she said the program actually stimulated students' desire to read students get excited after having seen the disks and then many want to research what they have seen , mrs woods said but she emphasized that videodisks were like any other teaching tool it s something else to use , she said some students do better than some others with it virtually everyone interviewed underscored this point in the total curriculum , videodisks should complement , not displace , textbooks there is no one source of information that you give the children , said lyn chan , a sixthgrade teacher at skyline elementary school in san francisco , who uses both standard and electronic textbooks videodisk technology is not a panacea , mrs chan said advantages for teaching for the last several years she has been using videodisks as part of a pilot program and has been impressed by the way they capture and hold students' attention she said videodisks had several advantages for teachers first , they are simple to operate mrs chan said she has taught teachers how to use them in less than five minutes using remote control , a teacher can order a disk player to find and display still or moving images of a particular subject this search and display process takes a few seconds , whereas finding a specific image on videotape can take several minutes of winding and rewinding , she said also , with conventional films , and sometimes with videotapes , teachers are usually forced into more passive roles , unable to interact much with students until the movie is finished mrs chan also said certain students were able to understand a subject better when it is presented in a fresh , visual way visual learners , she said , are especially drawn to videodisk instruction but she cautioned that reading must remain part of the classwork 'windows on science' the videodisk system that texas is considering , called windows on science , has better sound and picture quality than videotape , with images ranging from swirling galaxies to microscopic cell division the system uses a onesided disk , a disk player , a television monitor and remote control there is also a brief printed guide , to help teachers find particular images and sections of instruction the videodisk system also provides simultaneous narration in english and spanish the technology is already being used in about 400 schools in texas , and about 5 , 000 around the country , said pamela l herber , a spokeswoman for optical data inc , the warren , njbased publisher and producer of the educational videodisk system being considered by texas educators the optical data system is intended for elementary schools and is set up to meet the state s fundamental curriculum requirements in earth , life and physical sciences for those grade levels , ms herber said the system also meets the state s requirement that all textbooks , printed or electronic , cost 15 to 25 per student texas spends 120 million to 135 million a year on textbooks , second only to california , said don eklund , senior vice president of the association of american publishers significant change seen some educators believe that the use of videodisks heralds a significant change in teaching techniques i believe we are going to see more and more incorporation of video components throughout instruction , said geoffrey fletcher , the assistant commissioner for technology for the texas education agency bill martinez , director of instructional technology for the dallas independent school district , said we are watching the revolution of the textbook you can put a lot more on disks than you can put in a textbook we can put sound , video and written words on screen , mr martinez said with a textbook there is only reading material and a flat picture paul connolly , the director of the institute for writing and thinking at bard college in annandaleonhudson , ny , disagrees he said videodisks did little more than repackage and transmit information to students he said videodisks did not promote imaginative thinking and problem solving as conventional books did videodisks are glamorous alternatives to textbooks , dr connolly said margaret waters , coordinator for elementary education at brooklyn college in new york , said videodisks and other applications of high technology in the classroom were incidental to training teachers to teach well textbooks are only as good as the teachers who use them , she said it s the same with this photo individual schools have been experimenting with laser videodisks to create socalled electronic textbooks lyn chan used a disk to teach her sixthgrade class at skyline

if one were to study uptodate restaurantindustry consumer research , read all the media soothsaying about dining in the 1990 s and then go out and build a new restaurant , it would probably resemble

them homey food they 're tired of threedigit dining \? most of his entrees are under 25 they want lowkey , commodious settings \? no problem , this place could pass for a bankers' clubhouse even the name , or i should say lack of one , bespeaks gentility and intimacy you enter a long , narrow , softly lighted room with a handsome mahogany bar , and your elevated pulse rate from the kamikaze taxi ride immediately subsides to reach the dining room , guests ascend a tight spiral staircase to a space of similar proportions it s a cozy if somewhat tight space with darkwood wainscoting , pale gray fabriccovered walls , a pressedtin ceiling and wooden venetian blinds everything on the menu sounds appealing several appetizers can get you off to a rousing start big , buttery sea scallops are perfectly grilled and set over cool green beans in a mild gingerspiked vinaigrette soups are standouts , especially the earthy black bean with corn sticks , and the thick hambolstered pea soup with a rich hambone base kumamoto oysters from the pacific northwest were plump and reminiscent of sea foam , but i could have done without the oversalted lamb patties served with them this is said to be a combination favored in bordeaux , but i do n't get the logic pepperseared tuna with tuna tartar and ginger vinaigrette sounded appealing , but the tuna was overpeppered , the tartar had so much ginger you could n't taste anything else , and the vinaigrette was acidic on another occasion , a variation on this dish also flopped peppered grilled scallops were fine , but they came with a marinated black bass that was utterly tasteless with mr idone s experience as a caterer to new york s elite , it was surprising to find such scattered service at his restaurant the dining room was sometimes understaffed , resulting in lots of hand waving on the part of customers the restaurant has a small french and american wine list well matched to the food ample good selections are available for less than 25 it s unfortunate that there are so many nearmisses among entrees some of the food is so inexplicably bland that one gets the impression the chef has an inside tip about an impending earthquake and has hoarded spices in the cellar best choices among main courses are the most homespun juicy roasted chicken in pan juices comes with buttery mashed potatoes strewn with threads of fried leeks and i sampled one of the best chicken pot pies in new york here at lunch , moist white meat and barely al dente vegetables with a hint of tarragon under a mushroom cloud of cheddar cheese puff pastry raregrilled lamb chops were fine , although a potato pancake with them was oily and devoid of even salt and pepper one would expect to get a good steak at a place like this , but the entrecote with herb butter , while well cooked , was remarkably anemic , surely unidentifiable with a blindfold i gobbled up the mashed potatoes with gratineed bechamel marinated grilled tuna was nicely turned out , paired with a corn , pepper and tomato salsa a long island version of bouillabaisse with assorted local fish , white beans and spicy rouille was a commendable effort that my table shared greedily a mixed grill of snapper , black bass and freshwater prawns , however , needed more help than was provided by deepfried celery root chips and deepfried parsley we were n't so high over the pale

pick up a newspaper anywhere in the united states and you will be addressed by insistent strangers known generically as columnists because each occupies , more or less , a column of newsprint the term also has an apt association with the ishaped pillar from which the columnist can harangue the populace like st simeon stylites of syria , who spent 30 years preaching from the top of a column in the fifth century he has come to be the patron of an unruly calling some columnists are local institutions , a few so popular that they are said to own their cities many more are syndicated , so that if you travel around the country their eyes seem to follow you from passportstyle photographs used to relieve the grayness of oped pages though the form is common , its pedigree is awesome mark twain and ambrose bierce ascended from the column , as did h l mencken and ring lardner mr dooley s dialogues , the uncle remus tales and george ade s fables in slang were cradled in newsprint , as was the verse laboriously typed by the cockroach archy in don marquis s cubicle at the old new york sun but in our more prosaic age , the most influential practitioners deal with what e b white , an occasional columnist , called the political pickle judgments differ on how much influence senior columnists wield in 1975 , when he himself was still a washington columnist , marquis childs guessed that james reston of the new york times had roughly the power of three united states senators three seems a lot still , a columnist of rank like mr reston enjoys an obvious advantage over a senator members of congress are elected columnists are more like life peers in britain s house of lords this helps explain the resentment on the part of successive presidents over the need to placate these potentates there is no twoterm limit for a scotty reston of modern presidents , none was more transfixed by columnists than lyndon baines johnson he courted them incorrigibly with lavish flattery and shouldersqueezing bonhomie once , during a white house news session , he saw walter lippmann in the throng rushing over and grasping him , the president all but shouted this man here is the greatest journalist in the world , and he s a friend of mine ! that was in early 1964 , when a good many people would have agreed with johnson lippmann had been sought out by nearly every president since theodore roosevelt he was but 26 years old when he drafted woodrow wilson s famous fourteen points in 1958 , nikita khrushchev invited the columnist and his wife , helen , to a hunting lodge in the soviet urals to discuss ways of thawing the cold war \( the phrase was introduced by lippmann \) today and tomorrow , lippmann s column , appeared three times a week in more than 200 newspapers , and by common consent his lucid treatises were read and pondered by an influential elite no president could ignore in his years at the pinnacle , he was interviewed annually by cbs television , an eminence accorded to no other journalist , before or since in his reckoning of columnists , marquis childs described lippmann as supreme pontiff alas , the honeymoon ended badly that any journalist might differ purely on the merits with his policies was a notion johnson never seriously entertained he had courted lippmann s support ardently , attending the columnist s 75thbirthday party and instructing his aides to show him drafts of forthcoming presidential speeches but lippmann was a sphereofinfluence conservative who at first doubted , then dissented from , the administration belief that vital united states interests were at risk in vietnam as today and tomorrow became increasingly critical , the president became testier , to the point of having his staff comb through old columns in quest of blunders by the supreme pontiff these were then maliciously read aloud at white house dinner parties by this time , the white house was scoffing that lippmann had reverted to isolationism , prompting an impassioned reply , ex cathedra , that conveys something of lippmann s grand manner a mature great power will make measured and limited use of its power it will eschew the theory of a global and universal duty which not only commits it to unending wars of intervention but intoxicates its thinking with the illusion that it is a crusader for righteousness , that each war is a war to end all war since in this generation we have become a great power , i am in favor of learning to behave like a great power , of getting rid of the globalism which would not only entangle us everywhere but is based on the totally vain notion that if we do not set the world in order , no matter what the price , we cannot live in the world safely if we examine this idea thoroughly , we shall see that it is nothing but the old isolationism of our innocence in a new form then we thought we had to preserve our purity by withdrawal from the ugliness of great power politics now we sometimes talk as if we could preserve our purity only by policing the globe
ruweishid , jordan , sept 18 jordan appears to have stopped its shipments of food and other goods to iraq , after more than a month of argument and delay jordan , iraq s closest ally , came under strong criticism from the united states and other countries last month for not strictly adhering to the united nations sanctions against iraq last month 200 trucks a day were rolling across the border toward baghdad , carrying tomatoes , oranges , rice , cotton , sheet metal and a wide range of other items ten days ago visitors to ruweishid reported that shipments were still proceeding across , though in smaller numbers but here at the border today , nothing was being allowed to pass into iraq , though several truckers were trying no trucks in or out they 're not giving permits , complained one jordanian trucker , standing beside a flatbed loaded with cotton customs wo n't allow it past no , no , no , said another trucker standing nearby nobody s being allowed to go in his office a few yards away , nabil hindawi , acting director of the jordanian customs office here , shook his head as he said trucks are not coming in or going out that is the policy there is no chance that trucks are sneaking in through some other route , either the landscape here is inhospitable , rockstrewn desert there is no other road , and offroad travel is impossible neither of jordan s arab neighbors , syria and saudia arabia , would allow passage through their territory , since those countries are arrayed against iraq today the ruweishid customs yard was filled with dozens of empty , flatbed trucks many suddenly unemployed jordanian truck drivers were trying to earn a few dinars by carrying furniture and household goods for the steady stream of kuwaiti refugees from iraq , heading toward amman i used to make 1 , 000 dinars for a run to baghdad , said farid ali , a trucker who was standing , arms crossed , next to his empty flatbed a dinar is worth about 150 now i stand here all day and just hope for a run with furniture for 200 dinars oil tankers still roll while jordanian shipments to baghdad appear to have stopped , the long , desolate desert highway was crowded today with tankers carrying crude oil from iraq to refineries in jordan , although the united nations embargo precludes all trade with baghdad the only thing between us and iraq now is the oil , a senior government official said we do n't have any trucks going to iraq , none at all another senior official added we get 80 percent of our oil from iraq we ca n't cut that off until someone is willing to replace the supply so far no one has offered almost as soon as the united nations imposed the trade sanctions on iraq last month , jordan said it would comply but added it needed time to study the language to see what kind of trade with iraq , if any , would be allowed in the meantime , trucks continued rolling many carried goods arriving at the jordanian port of aqaba , and others ferried jordanian produce and other locally produced goods to baghdad the united states openly complained , and president bush specifically criticized jordan for continuing to import iraqi goods through aqaba now , thanks in part to the united states naval blockade in the red sea , the port at aqaba is virtually closed as far as can be told , local goods are not being driven to iraq either as a result , 80 percent of the nation s 11 , 000vehicle truck fleet is now idle , sad bassam e kakish , chairman of the aqaba regional authority 'this is a genuine crisis' as jordanian officials say they have cut off their exports to iraq , they are also making fresh pleas for international aid to compensate them for losses iraq was by far jordan s largest trading partner you are talking about an integrated economy between iraq , kuwait and jordan , and 800 , 000 of our people also worked in iraq and kuwait , said a senior aide in the royal palace this is a genuine crisis the apparent end of the jordanian shipments to iraq has been gradual three weeks ago , we could n't cross the road , there were so many trucks , said atef atta , a mechanic , as he and his brother sat behind a greasy desk in their tiny garage in azraq , looking out at the highway to baghdad just 10 yards away now maybe we see three or four , he said and judging from what truckers said at the border , even those are not being allowed to pass we used to close at 8 or 9 at night , mr atta added now , with the business falling off , sometimes we close at 1 pm iraqis trying to ferry goods into jordan do not appear to be having any better luck the united nations sanctions forbid both imports to iraq and exports from the country as well an iraqi trucker who would give his name only as mahmoud sat in the incoming truck yard today and complained that he had been trapped , sleeping in his truck , for almost 10 days the flatbed was loaded with fertilizer from iraq i ca n't go in , the iraqi said , throwing up his hands they wo n't give me permits they wo n't even start the procedures and i ca n't get permits to go back either they say the load has already been imported , so it ca n't go back asked what he would do , the man shook his head and said , i'm just waiting for god to show his mercy photo an empty supply truck crossing the border into iraq yesterday as cars heading for jordan waited at the ruweishid border crossing \(

ask bud harrelson the question would n't the mets have turned things around even if davey johnson had stayed as manager \? and hear him answer , shrugging and smiling we 'll never know he s right but we will know what the mets have done with harrelson as manager they have blitzed the national league , and that s the story of the first half of their season actually , the first half of the season for the mets had a first half of its own , and it was a disaster fourth place , 20 victories and 22 defeats , a losing record and a losing spirit that s where they stood on may 29 , the day davey johnson was sacked and bud harrelson was signed since then , after dropping four of their first five under harrelson , they went on one unholy rampage they won 26 of their next 31 games , including 11 straight in june they won 10 straight series they zoomed from fourth place to a halfgame out of first in the east they passed the 100 mark in home runs in atlanta last thursday , when they hit five they scored more runs than any other team in the league and shot from a paltry average of three runs a game to five and they raised their collective batting average by 20 points the pitching rotation , even with six men trying to do the job of five , switched from a losing record to a winning record frank viola became the first pitcher in the league to win a dozen games david cone , who won 34 games and lost 11 the last two years , lost four of his first five this year but then won three straight dwight gooden , who lost five of his first eight decisions , closed the first half by winning \( and generally dominating \) five in a row the entire staff struck out more batters than anybody else it s a collective thing , harrelson said with appreciation a rumble the collective thing will run up the curtain on the second half tonight in cincinnati , the home of the strongest team in the west the teams will play five games in four days , so the mets will open with a true test of their rumble but they are remarkably fit and healthy , and they are absolutely confident that their failure in april and may was fully redeemed by their success in june and july strawberry leads the revival prime symbol of both is darryl strawberry for the first two months , he was slumbering around 225 with only eight home runs , and he seemed disenchanted by the whole thing then he staged a sustained and sizzling streak , hit in 18 straight games , hit 13 home runs in 23 games and revived a comatose offense basically , strawberry said , we do n't accept the possibility that we can lose right now before they turned things around , the mets seemed destined to betray the rosy preseason predictions and to selfdestruct in outrageous ways they opened the season with three big experiments on the field at catcher , first base and center field they had vacancies at all three positions because gary carter was dropped as the catcher keith hernandez was dropped as the first baseman , and three center fielders were traded in six months' time and none of the three experiments went as planned barry lyons , the heir to the catching job , went on the disabled list with a strained lower back and was optioned to the minor leagues on monday mike marshall , installed at first base , went to the bench with a strained lower back keith miller , an infielder anointed as the center fielder , did not thrive in his onthejob training problems solved but as they mounted their june revival , the mets solved all three problems and calmed the calls for major excursions into the trading market lyons was replaced by mackey sasser , who added some sparks to the lineup and even threw out vince coleman \( after he had stolen 57 straight bases against the mets \) marshall was replaced and probably even dislodged by dave magadan , who hit 402 for two months and miller was replaced in center by the platoon of mark carreon and daryl boston to keep streaking in the second half , the mets will have to avoid overconfidence , avoid injuries and avoid any lapse in their new momentum specifically , they will have to find some work for marshall to keep him from withering while magadan keeps hitting they will have to find some work for teufel , another victim of neglect they will have to find work for miller they seem to be coping with the problem of how to keep six pitchers productive in five jobs but they still have n't faced the big test will ron darling still be sharp in the role of parttime pitcher if a pennant race develops in august and september \? they also may be forced to finetune their middle relief pitching alejandro pena , the righthander , and jeff musselman , the lefthander , both suffered some mean treatment during the first half and both own inflated earned run averages the danger there is that harrelson may shy away from calling them when the game is on the line and may eventually tire his stopper , john franco it is an endurance contest , harrelson said they 'll count in september as much as they counted in june photo bud harrelson \( sara krulwich the new york times \)
transit officials yesterday abandoned a plan to reduce the number of token sellers at busy subway stations but agreed on several other budget cuts reducing service on the 4 , 5 , c , j and r lines , imposing a hiring freeze and scaling back painting of subway stations the metropolitan transportation authority made the decisions after critics , including several members of its board , attacked the planned reduction in tokensellers , saying it would only increase farebeating , which has left the agency with a 55 million deficit farebeating is growing because of long lines at token booths created by the 115 fare delaying changemaking , and because many turnstiles and token machines are broken the tokenselling cuts would have saved only 200 , 000 the agency also decided not to end a contract with volunteers of america , a group that helps homeless people in the subways that would have saved 400 , 000 the agency will meet the deficit with money from a discretionary fund under the cuts approved yesterday , transit officials will halt all inessential purchases and impose a hiring freeze midday service on the lexington avenue nos 4 and 5 lines will be reduced to 16 trains an hour from 18 trains service on the c line will end at 11 pm instead of midnight j trains will terminate at canal street on weekends midday and evening queensbound r trains will halt at continental avenue , and f trains will be turned into locals for the last seven stops to 179th street fewer stations repainted in addition , the transit authority will save 62 million by scaling back its stationpainting contracts only 99 stations will be painted instead of the 126 originally scheduled none of the 23 bridges in the subway system will be painted as scheduled , and graffiti will be scrubbed from 364 stations instead of from the 384 planned i think that it would have been foolhardy for them to reduce the number of token clerks when the main reason for the growth in fare evasion is the long lines at token booths , said beverly dolinsky , executive director of the permanent citizens advisory committee , a consumer transit advocacy group
buenos aires , jan 17 from its commanding location overlooking the estuary of the rio de la plata , the immense shell of argentina s unfinished national library threatens to become a relic for future archeologists to ponder over a friend of mine calls it a ruin of the modern movement , said martha levisman de clusellas , an architect trying to determine what has to be done to rescue the project conceived in a time of grandiose national dreams three decades ago if it is never completed , she said as she gazed up at the 430 , 000squarefoot structure from the surrounding undergrowth , researchers may someday wonder what they have stumbled across on the site , which previously held the home of juan d peron and his second wife , eva julio barbaro , the secretary of culture , said he thought of the library building as a symbol of the great things we argentines have attempted , and of the small things that stop us from finishing them private citizens enrolled like countless governments before it , the government of president carlos saul menem wants to finish the library but having no illusions that the destitute state treasury could pay for the work , it has put the matter into the hands of private citizens soon after mr menem took office in july , one of his chief advisers raised the question of the unfinished library with paul hirsch , president of the antorchas foundation , which manages the proceeds from the sale of an international business empire that mr hirsch once headed my reaction was that i did n't know and still do n't know how expert the original plan was , mr hirsch said in an interview i suggested we should find out two things first , from an architectural state of affairs , how much is missing , and two , whether , from a librarian s point of view , it is beyond saving mr hirsch asked mrs clusellas , who has done several previous projects financed by antorchas , to look at it from the architectural view and obtained a library expert from unesco in paris to come to determine whether the layout and space allotments could be adapted to modern library needs 'the verdict is yes' although mrs clusellas is still putting the findings together , he said the verdict is yes , this library can be used changes have to be made , but they are not terribly farreaching mr hirsch , who moved to south america from germany in 1936 and has dual argentinegerman citizenship , said the government wants a private entity , like a foundation , to finance the completion of the library and then to run it although antorchas is , by his acknowledgment , tremendously well endowed it and its sister foundations in brazil and chile gave 85 million for education , culture and social work last year he said he did not want to dedicate its resources to the library , beyond the relatively modest sum invested in the diagnosis mr barbaro said the spanish government had promised 5 million in credits toward completion of the library and that several other wealthy argentines were in the process of forming a library foundation to collect additional money estimates of what it will cost to finish the library vary widely , with mr barbaro saying 10 million to 14 million and mrs clusellas 25 million argentina already has a functioning national library , a structure with classical columns in the san telmo art neighborhood not far from the headquarters of antorchas but frustrated historians and other library users as well as government officials tell horror stories of inadequate storage , books covered with mildew and a cataloguing system so antiquated that no one can guess , within the range of a million or so , how many books the library has wiping out the past aside from the obvious need , the new library originated as part of an effort to wipe out a part of the argentine past the peron era when the armed forces overthrew the rightwing populist leader in 1955 and sent him into exile , they had his mansion overlooking the river and avenida del libertador destroyed within a short time , there was talk of using the site for the library in 1963 , planning began an architectural competition was held to choose the plans construction began in 1971 no one is certain just when construction was halted , but both mr barbaro and mrs clusellas believe that money problems were not the main reason various governments did things on the library , mr barbaro said , but no one was able to finish it i think no government gave great political significance to the library mrs clusellas believes there were conflicts for control of the project between the ministry of education and the secretariat of culture , coupled with a lack of coordination and differences over objectives a contract runs out she said that when she moved into the architect s office on the site in august she found none of the original plans and that no one involved could remember anything and they were not speaking to each other although the construction company keeps seven men on the site , mainly as watchmen , she said the contract of the architects had run out although mrs clusellas is not enchanted with what she calls the monumental style of the building typical of the sixties , the vast spaces inside offer panoramic views of the surrounding neighborhood of elegant town houses and apartment buildings as well as the river s unimpeded path to the open atlantic set on four giant legs that she says make it look like a cow on the pampas , the library has six floors above ground and five below , which extend into the old riverbed the belowground area is supposed to hold all of the books and other materials , which would be raised , when people request them , to the top floor reading area with a system similar to dumbwaiters despite her reservations about the style , she said finishing it will be like waking a sleeping beauty in the forest mr barbaro expressed cautious optimism that the library could be finished before the end of mr menem s sixyear term , but said , we 're not going to celebrate until we finish photo the argentine national library , conceived in a time of grandiose national dreams three decades ago , stands uncompleted and threatens to become a relic for future archeologists to ponder \( nyt alejandero merle \)
washington solidarity wants an apple computer so it can do a better job of typesetting its newspaper the polish telecommunications authority wants to buy outdated western equipment so that local callers will be able to dial direct for now , the administration says poland ca n't have either meanwhile , china , which savagely suppresses democracy , can buy mainframe computers 10 times more powerful than the computer solidarity s newspaper ca n't have thanks to purchases of us equipment and satellites , china soon will have one of the world s most modern telecommunications systems the difference lies in liberalized export regulations agreed to in 1985 to encourage china to grow out of traditional marxismleninism despite impressive attempts by poland and hungary to win us confidence , the administration refuses to grant these struggling democracies the same access to western technology we allow china that defies common sense poland and hungary should be granted a comparable arrangement immediately contingent , of course , on president bush s having assurances that soviet intelligence operatives in those countries have been evicted or contained the same should hold for any eastern european nation that adopts a democratic system and takes concrete steps to reduce its military , intelligence and economic ties to the soviet union helping poland and hungary match their political successes with modernized , successful economies is the only way to insure the permanence of reforms modern technology is the key as peter varkonyi , hungary s ambassador to the us , put it , we cannot have a firstrate economy with thirdrate technology , and we cannot earn the currency required to transform our backward economies into modern ones if we cannot compete in the world marketplace recent reports indicate some administration members are thinking about relaxing controls affecting exports to poland and hungary in perhaps a year new technology can make a difference today a year could be too long , if democracy begins to weaken in explaining the delay , the administration cites old worries both countries belonged to the warsaw pact both were members of comecon , the sovietdominated economic alliance , and both were heavily infiltrated by the kgb today comecon is dead in all but name its 10 member nations recently voted to move toward a marketbased system of trade hungary and czechoslovakia proposed to gut the system and get on with integrating their economies into the west the warsaw pact , too , is all but dead poland , hungary and czechoslovakia have announced military spending cuts of up to 25 percent in the coming year moscow began withdrawing troops from czechoslovakia a few days ago , and plans to begin pulling out of poland and hungary in coming months according to impeccable sources , some eastern european nations are expelling kgb agents none of these changes guarantees that an apple computer wo n't end up in soviet hands if solidarity is allowed to buy one but poland and hungary have gone a step further volunteering to accept extremely intrusive safeguards , which include onsite inspections just a few days ago , after months of delay , the administration responded with a statement of exportcontrol principles so vague as to have no practical value for negotiating a new arrangement the us has long taken the lead on exportcontrol issues , but the administration s hesitation threatens to change that soviet and eastern europe access to advanced western technology is governing by the coordinating committee on multilateral export controls , made up of 14 western european countries , japan , australia and the us the unity of this watchdog , known as cocom , is one of the west s best sources of leverage for democratic change in eastern europe in the past two years , france , britain and italy have allowed companies to circumvent cocom s control and sell advanced technology directly to the soviet union this deterioration in unity will continue to accelerate the longer we resist adjusting to the changes in eastern europe this message was conveyed to the administration at a recent cocom meeting our partners called for a trade agreement with eastern europe that would match the china arrangement in every respect the administration agreed to liberalize controls in only 3 of 39 technology categories the costs of the administration s delay will not be limited to a loss of international influence we also will end up cutting us companies out of lucrative markets , while their japanese and european counterparts cut deals

during the march from selma to montgomery , the rev martin luther king jr quoted an old georgia preacher as saying , them that s going , git on the wagon them that ai n't , git out of the way those words from 1965 send a powerful message to president bush today the wagon is the civil rights act of 1990 attorney general dick thornburgh wants to stop it mr bush is thinking about jumping on morally and politically , mr bush s instincts are right mr bush has an opportunity that ronald reagan never allowed himself president reagan rarely stretched out a hand to minorities or civil rights leaders his successor , however , enjoys considerable approval among minorities that opens the prospect of a productive relationship between black americans and a republican president for the first time in years the president appears to sense that chance he met this week with civil rights groups already he s backing away from mr thornburgh s threat to recommend a veto political realities may have something to do with his shift the civil rights bill is barreling through congress and may soon be vetoproof but the shift is welcome anyway the bill is a sound , bipartisan measure that deserves none of the abuse mr thornburgh has heaped upon it it seeks mainly to restore rights previously won in congress but lost again through a series of supreme court misinterpretations of all the court s unfortunate decisions , last year s ward s cove ruling is most in need of redress it overruled a 1971 civil rights landmark , griggs v duke power company , which was delivered by warren burger , then chief justice , for a unanimous court that court held employers accountable for hiring and promotion practices that unnecessarily , even if not deliberately , excluded able minority members from the workplace in its reading of the 1964 civil rights act , the burger court ruled for black workers who complained that a high school diploma requirement served the same function as overt discrimination the court said the employer must show the necessity of such a requirement once the plaintiff demonstrated that it disproportionately hurt blacks that s a legally familiar idea , assigning the burden of proof to the party best equipped to bear it but in the ward s cove case a year ago , the court announced new , detailed burdens for plaintiffs the attorney general now argues that restoring the griggs standard would lead to hiring quotas he contends that employers , saddled once again with the burden of proof , would hire unqualified minority members or women just to get the courts off their backs in support of that notion mr thornburgh and his allies have offered nothing but speculation to the senate and house judiciary committees indeed , because the griggs rule had been in effect from 1971 to 1989 , it was up to mr thornburgh to show how the rule in fact had resulted in quotas he did n't mr thornburgh s advice badly serves his president large majorities in congress already see the justice in the bill mr bush is inching in their direction his next move is to jump aboard
las vegas , nev in the hallway that leads to his imposing office at the university of nevadalas vegas , there s a miniature street sign that proclaims the premises shark street usa , a domain of champions but lately the bold , bald head shark himself , jerry tarkanian , has felt more like a guppy trapped inside a very transparent , very small fishbowl that his unpedigreed runnin' rebels emerged from the final four to secure the national championship at venerable duke s expense last april has ceased to console him for a lifetime 35 years spent in coaching nor does he find inspiration in his winning percentage , 843 , unparalleled among college basketball coaches not even the thought of the impending season revives him for the first time i can remember , practice is less than a week away and i have n't even thought about basketball , said tarkanian , a mobile phone clenched in his fist like a weapon and a faraway look in his eyes , as he hunched behind a deskload of discarded paperwork last week at this time of year , it s usually all you think about or in the case of tarkanian , who at 60 years old fears his impending retirement because he has no interests except basketball , the sport is normally all he thinks about all year i 've never been this close to a start of a season feeling as miserable as i do now , said tarkanian , who knows he may be feeling even more miserable by its conclusion what has rendered tarkanian so disillusioned is the prospect that the most recent sanction imposed on his beleaguered basketball program will prohibit the topranked runnin' rebels from defending their title in 1991 in july , the national collegiate athletic association , its hands finally untied by a supreme court ruling after a legal battle with tarkanian that lasted over a decade and cost more than a 1 million , informed unlv that its basketball team was ineligible for postseason play this season this was , the ncaa decided , the only punishment appropriate to tarkanian s refusal , in 1977 , to allow the university to suspend him for two years as the ncaa had ordered that s the nature of the beast , said steve morgan , an associate executive director of the ncaa , when bombarded with complaints over the association s decision to dispense retroactive justice against tarkanian , who continues to use a 13yearold injunction to ward off a suspension ordered long ago but evidently not forgotten obviously , they want to do something to me , said tarkanian , whose adversarial relationship with the ncaa s enforcement arm dates to a pair of brash editorials he wrote in 1972 and 1973 during his tenure at long beach state that school eventually drew a twoyear probation and a ban from ncaa tournament play for recruitinvg violations , and the ncaa reopened its investigation of unlv s program six days after tarkanian accepted the coaching job there in 1973 since then , the ncaa s investigators have spent almost as much time on campus as tarkanian , who refers to the association in casual conversation as the nc2a does tarkanian feel as if the ncaa has made an internal vow that he will run a permanent gantlet \? absolutely invariably , about every third year , they put a release out that they 're investigating us , he said and invariably , it happens right around letterofintent time , and invariably it knocks the heck out of our recruiting , and invariably all the other coaches use them against us \( this year tarkanian pulled off a recruiting coup when he received oral commitments from two of the brightest prospects in the country , ed o'bannon , who last week sustained a knee injury in a pickup game and is out for the year , and shon tarver but both defected to ucla after the ncaa announced the postseason sanction against the rebels \) what some of those other coaches also believe , in private , is that the ncaa is branding tarkanian and nevadalas vegas because it does not deem the man or the institution an appropriate example of the ncaa ideal while the proliferation of the insubordinate tarkanian and his nonbluechip contingent could be tolerated were they more lowly ranked , their seizure of the spotlight as a basketball powerhouse has proven an embarrassment we 've never gotten the bluechip player , said tarkanian , pointing out that of the 15 mcdonald s high school allamericans in last season s final four , just one matriculated at las vegas nobody plays harder than us that s our trademark we can drive our kids harder than some because we 're like a family we can overcome some of those bigname guys because they 're always in second gear because tarkanian felt this year s bunch was destined to play just as hard as last year s , he said the ncaa s ruling had been like a kick in the groin i think about it all the time , he said i feel my team will go to the tournament again , but without me pursued for the past 17 years by an unshakable posse from the ncaa s enforcement committee , tarkanian has finally found himself trapped and he has received his punishment in the form of exile from tournament play , the springtime showcase that earned the university 1 million in television revenues last year when tarkanian coached his team to a record of 355 , the best in the nation
james patrick , headed to the locker room after the first period of a game in hartford on nov 18 , could not figure out why the official from the madison square garden network was standing there motioning to him after all , patrick , a talented defenseman for the rangers , had already taped an interview before the start of the game but patrick was not done , he discovered , because the initial interview , during which he openly criticized the ice conditions at the garden , was not going to be shown one person within the msg network has insisted that the first interview was not killed on orders from garden management but two others familiar with the incident said that was precisely why the segment did n't run as first taped the garden , amid increasing often scathing criticism of its ice , was apparently not going to add to the embarrassment via its own network the interview was redone , but the embarrassment of the ice at the garden could n't be subsequently solved no matter how many times it was redone or resurfaced the playing conditions remained largely abominable , and the outcry by the players only escalated earlier this month , after bill torrey , the general manager of the islanders , labeled the garden rink a joke , a piece of footage was shown by msg that captured the calamity of the conditions more eloquently and forcefully than any of patrick s comments before or after that night in hartford ever could have the puck , in the course of a game against the detroit red wings on march 5 , was tracked in isolation and slow motion as it slid across the ice it bounced , it flipped , it hit rut after rut the puck , in short , looked like a stray hubcap bounding loose along the brooklynqueens expressway brutal , john ogrodnick , the rangers' veteran left wing , said of the ice this season at the garden the worst ice in the national hockey league and , with the arrival of the stanley cup playoffs and the glare of the spotlight that attends them , the ice is bound to become the most talked about in the nhl the ice could even conceivably provoke the latest in what for the nhl has been an almost annual series of playoff misadventures torrey , for example , would not rule out the possibility that he would refuse to let the islanders take the ice should they face the rangers and the conditions be as horrendous as they have been i would have to make whatever judgment was in the best interest of my team , said torrey , who claimed three of his players were injured as a result of playing on the garden ice in a game march 2 i do n't want to foreclose any option historically , there have been public afflictions involving playing conditions during the playoffs warm weather , packed buildings and overtaxed machinery have not infrequently combined to wreak problems , and with them publicrelations disasters in 1975 , the third and fourth games of the stanley cup finals between the philadelphia flyers and the buffalo sabres were halted because of fog , with people having to skate around the memorial auditorium in buffalo with sheets trying to disperse it there was , too , the blackout in boston garden in 1988 and then last year , the second game of the patrick division final between the flyers and penguins was nearly called off when an electrical power problem threatened to melt the ice at the civic arena in pittsburgh the attention s been drawn , but obviously you ca n't prepare for what might happen with the ice at the garden , said terry murray , the coach of the washington capitals , who as a member of the california golden seals broke his leg after tripping on a rut at the garden in 1972 i do n't think there is anything strategically the rangers could do to take advantage of bad ice the garden , according to top officials in charge of the ice , has done what it can to eradicate the bad ice clearly perplexed and alarmed by the degree of the problem and the ferocity of the criticism , the garden began as early as the second month of the season to investigate and experiment , meeting with players , tinkering with temperatures and most recently bringing in an outside consultant it s not a proven science , said dave hughes , the vice president for facility operations and a garden employee for 23 years we 're searching for answers , trying to discern what the problem is we 're not

the stories of edith wharton selected and introduced by anita brookner 310 pages carroll graf 1895 what do you suppose such words as you 've been using society , ' 'tradition , ' and the rest mean to all the life out there \? a prospective suitor asks one of edith wharton s heroines she goes and stands by him at the window , and replies less than nothing , of course but you and i are not out there we 're shut up in a little tight round of habit and association , just as we 're shut up in this room remember , i thought i 'd got out of it once but what really happened was that the other people went out , and left me in the same little room the only difference was that i was there alone oh , i 've made it habitable now , i'm used to it but i 've lost any illusions i may have had as to an angel s opening the door this exchange from the devastating little tale autres temps succinctly sums up the theme that would preoccupy edith wharton throughout her life , namely , the idea of society , and its power to shape \( and destroy \) individual lives as the survivor of a stifling , upperclass childhood , and a socially correct but emotionally and sexually barren marriage , wharton was familiar firsthand with the suffocating wages of convention and in the course of an exceptionally long and productive career , she would succeed in turning this painfully acquired knowledge into enduring fiction like her two masterworks , the age of innocence and the house of mirth , the strongest stories in this new collection deal directly and often quite bluntly with societal rules and their effect on the relationships between men and women in autres temps , an aging woman named mrs lidcote , whose divorce has made her the object of scandal , returns to america after some 20 years abroad she discovers that changing times and mores have made it possible for her own daughter to survive a divorce and remarriage without the slightest social embarrassment her own case , however , does not benefit from this revision in the rules they only remembered that i 'd done something which , at the time i did it , was condemned by society , she observes my case had been passed on and classified i'm the woman who has been cut for nearly 20 years the older people have halfforgotten why , and the younger ones have never really known it s simply become a tradition to cut me and traditions that have lost their meaning are the hardest of all to destroy because she knows she is still a social pariah , mrs lidcote renounces the possibility of beginning a new life with a man she s always liked , and instead makes plans to return to europe alone domestic or romantic happiness similarly eludes the other heroines in this volume all too often , wharton s women find themselves locked in loveless marriages that deprive them of emotional sustenance , or stuck in obsessive relationships with men who scorn their affection in the reckoning , a woman named julia walks out on her suffocating first marriage , announcing that she believes in a religion of personal independence years later , she is shocked to hear her beloved second husband utter similar words , when he leaves her for a younger woman in atrophy , an unhappily married matron named nora hears that her onetime lover , christopher , is severely ill she risks her reputation by going to visit him , but is turned away by his sanctimonious sister and in the letters , a woman named lizzie learns that her husband married her for her inheritance , but decides not to leave him he was not the hero of her dreams , but he was the man she loved , and who had loved her for she saw now , in this last wide flash of pity and initiation , that , as a comely marble may be made out of worthless scraps of mortar , glass and pebbles , so out of mean mixed substances may be fashioned a love that will bear the stress of life as usual , wharton writes with knowing sympathy about women in turnofthecentury america , who , like herself , were judged by their family standing , their marriages , their ability to oversee several households of servants her stories are flecked with telling details that reveal the snobberies and tastes of her characters \( the sevres candelabra , the rose dubarry porcelain , the orchids sent from high lawn every morning \) , and bits of dialogue that instantly conjure up the vanished splendor of their lives you wo n't know leila , says one character with typical aplomb she s had her pearls reset sargent s to paint her oh , and i was to tell you that she hopes you wo n't mind being the least bit squeezed over sunday the house was built by wilbour s father , you know , and it s rather old fashioned only 10 spare bedrooms yet if wharton s stories are minutely grounded in social observation , they owe their enduring power to her ability to portray the emotional consequences of life in this rarefied world the difficulties of penetrating past the superficialities of dinnerparty chitchat , the difficulties of balancing passion and responsibility , freedom and decorum , independence and feminine solicitude when wharton turns away from these themes and tries to write highly plotted entertainments , the results are more disappointing all souls a ghost story about a woman who finds herself alone in an abandoned house with a broken ankle is a heavyhanded and pointless exercise in suspense and after holbein a ponderous portrait of two aging people whose senile fantasies coincide seems peculiarly dated , like a secondrate o henry story its ironic ending is both predictable and pat all in all , though , the british novelist anita brookner has done an admirable job of giving the contemporary reader a representative collection of wharton s best short fiction though none of the tales have the subtlety and cumulative power of her great novels , the finest ones remain a tribute to her powers of psychological observation , her authority as a social witness

ever since party leaders seeking a gubernatorial nominee plucked his name from the address book of a new york republican loyalist , pierre a rinfret has portrayed himself as a renowned economist who has advised four presidents and breezily turned down offers to join the cabinet but for two decades , mr rinfret has also fought criticism that he is equal parts showman and sage , and an examination of his record shows that some claims he has made about his political and educational experience are indeed exaggerated echo of a debate some former nixon administration officials disputed mr rinfret s suggestions that he had been a major adviser to the president , and none remembered him being offered cabinet positions and while he never earned a doctorate , the economic forecaster has long claimed the title dr rinfret , using it in resumes , legal documents and 10 times in his political biography these discrepancies echo a debate about mr rinfret s qualifications and character that began almost from the moment he joined the small fraternity of economists whose projections and opinions make news a theatrical style mr rinfret s positions on the issues facing the state are littleknown , and he says he has not yet had time to develop many but his background is sure to come under greater scrutiny now that he has taken his first shot at elected office , as standardbearer in the new york republican party s bid to unseat gov mario m cuomo the portrait of mr rinfret that emerges from interviews with his associates in business and politics is that of a toughtalking economist trusted by leading corporations , a theatrical speaker who may give the governor a run for his oratorical money and a multimillionaire businessman with a knack for marketing and a style so bruising he has taken relatives and friends to court but some of mr rinfret s fellow economists say his salesmanship and flair for selfpromotion outshine his professional skills a criticism that would most frequently be made is that he is very colorful , but he is a little more sound and fury than substance , said paul w mccracken , a chairman of the council of economic advisers in the nixon administration john p sears , a former campaign manager for president ronald reagan , described mr rinfret as a good salesman but he added , he s not looked upon in his field as someone who is an indepth , researched thinker , but rather as someone who can take a quick look at something and give you an opinion milton friedman , the economist , who , like mr rinfret , advised president richard m nixon , recalled mr rinfret as kind of a wild man he tended to go to extremes with whatever his views were mr rinfret who is generally described as a supply sider who is skeptical of regulatory agencies insists that any criticism stems from his outspokenness in a profession noted for its smugness and domination by what he has called the little gray men his ability to deal with the state s growing budget problems , he says , stems from his business background , including his success in building an international consulting and commodities firm i really believe the state is in trouble , mr rinfret said describing his race against mr cuomo , he said , cuomo is teflon , fine watch me take the teflon off him 'robert allen , a texas businessman , said he remains a fan of mr rinfret s even though the candidate once took him to court for failing to pay a bill he s aggressive and he asserts his will he s a very persuasive , expansive guy he has much more of an acting quality than most economists , said kenneth lipper , a former new york city deputy mayor who has watched mr rinfret at speaking engagments he s a witty , unholy speaker he ca n't win , but if he does n't get too weird , he can do damage to cuomo as an economist a blunt mixture of news and views during the 1950 s and early 1960 s , mr rinfret learned the trade of economic consulting with lionel d edie , a pioneer in the business mr rinfret was hired by mr edie in 1951 as a 5 , 750ayear junior economist he said mr edie , president of the company , took him on as a protege and became like a father to him in july 1963 , shortly before mr edie died , mr rinfret took over as chairman of the business mr rinfret left edie company in 1966 to form his own consulting business , rinfretboston associates mr edie had died and mr rinfret said he had a falling out with other principals in the company most of the stock in mr rinfret s new business was owned by the boston company , a holding company mr rinfret eventually bought control of the whole company and began operating it as rinfret , inc , which has grown into a group of consulting and financialfutures trading firms with offices in new york and switzerland mr rinfret is its president although mr rinfret had earned a reputation in the industry , he did not become widely known until 1964 , when president lyndon b johnson , seeking to promote the economic benefits of a tax cut , cited one of his forecasts in a televised speech like most economic forecasters , mr rinfret s success rate has been mixed in 1961 , he correctly forecast an economic downturn in the 1970 s , just before the nation s economy went into recession , he predicted that there would not be one

after more than three years of investigation , federal prosecutors uncovered enough evidence of wrongdoing to convince michael r milken to plead guilty to violating securities laws but none of that evidence from the largest investigation of crime on wall street will be turned over to the securities and exchange commission , the federal agency charged with policing the securities markets the reason \? it s against the law at the same time that the milken investigation was drawing to a close , sec officials were openly complaining that laws they consider outdated were hampering their efforts in other cases the commission has been seeking broader powers , which would give it access to evidence developed by a grand jury during criminal investigations of possible violations of securities laws in addition the commission wants the power to issue socalled ceaseanddesist orders , which would require people believed to be breaking the law to stop their actions or face other charges for ignoring the order without those powers , officials at the sec complain that they are forced into spending unnecessary time and resources duplicating criminal investigations and that they cannot act to protect investors once they have evidence of wrongdoing , without waiting for approval by a court congress is currently considering expanding the enforcement powers of the sec under a bill that was introduced by representative john d dingell , democrat of michigan but some securities lawyers , including former sec officials , worry that the new powers may be unnecessary or might give the sec an unfair advantage over defendants the difficulty in obtaining evidence for inquiries is the result of rule 6 \( e \) of the federal rules of procedure , which prevents the justice department from sharing information obtained during a grand jury investigation with other government agencies that rule applies even if agencies like the sec assist federal prosecutors in the grand jury investigation rather , the sec inquiries , which are civil matters , have to be conducted by sec staff members who have not seen any of the evidence obtained independently by the grand jury in his statements about the milken case last week , richard c breeden , the chairman of the sec , lamented the situation , saying that the two lawenforcement arms for the securities markets work side by side with a brick wall in between , creating what he called unnecessary duplication the sec hopes to be able to take the milken inquiry into new directions but has little idea about what information was developed by the united states attorney during the criminal case the problem has presented itself in other cases for example , when e f hutton company pleaded guilty in 1985 to 2 , 000 counts of mail and wire fraud resulting from an illegal checkkiting scheme , the sec had to retrace the inquiry over six months to determine whether there had been any misdeed that merited restrictions of the firm s securities activities the sec subsequently granted the firm an exemption from federal securities laws that would have prevented it from underwriting or managing mutual funds but , even when the sec finds evidence to suggest that someone is committing a crime from pennystock fraud to market manipulation they are not empowered to do anything to stop it on their own unlike other financial regulators , including the commodity futures trading commission , the regulator for the futures industry , the sec does not have the power to issue a legal order requiring that illegal activity be stopped rather , the commission has to go to a judge and seek approval for a temporary restraining order or for a preliminary injunction while they serve the same purpose , the requirements of going to court can lead to more investors being harmed , sec officials contend because the federal courts , which are required to hear criminal cases before civil cases , are swamped with drug cases , the sec has had to wait as long as three years to bring an enforcement case to trial some securities lawyers who have worked with the commission said they did not believe that the sec needed all of the powers it was seeking the number of times that the sec needs access to grand jury material is pretty small , said a securities lawyer who spoke on condition that he not be named they do a very good job in developing their own cases , and i would think it more important to respect the secrecy of the grand jury gary lynch , the former chief of enforcement at the sec who is now a partner in the new york law firm of davis , polk wardwell , said i do n't see that the commission can make a case for needing a temporary ceaseanddesist it would put the burden on the respondent , and it would give the commission leverage over people that could create an unfair advantage for the commission drawing
legislation approved last month by the new jersey senate that would allow competent adults to specify in advance their wishes about the use of extraordinary means to sustain their lives promotes passive euthanasia and assisted suicide , critics of the measure say in addition , they say the bill , which encourages health care professionals to carry out instructions left in living wills and which grants them immunity from liability when they do , may result in some physicians' acting contrary to their moral , ethical and professional judgment and might inadvertently lead to the death of patients who might otherwise recover but proponents of the legislation say that it has been carefully drafted to prevent those situations and that strict guidelines have been established to reduce the risks in ending artificial life support the goal , they say , is to provide new jersey residents with the ability to make their own decisions about future medical care , including the right to refuse the use of extraordinary means to sustain their lives in addition , they say , immunity for health care professionals is necessary so they can comply with a patient s wishes without fear of being held liable at a later date the bill , which would have to be approved by the state assembly and signed by the governor before it becomes law , comes 14 years after the new jersey supreme court became the first high court in the nation to address the right to die issue , in the landmark karen ann quinlan case and though the new jersey courts , in that and later cases , have paved the way for similar decisions throughout the country , the state now lags behind 43 other states and the district of columbia in adopting right to die legislation the new jersey advance directives for health care act is the product of almost four years of work by the state bioethics commission , a 27member panel created by the legislature to examine issues and to develop legislation relating to bioethics and health care in the state this brings full circle the legacy of karen ann quinlan , said paul w armstrong , vice chairman of the bioethics commission and the lawyer who represented the quinlan family in the 1976 case the bill , he said , embraces a profound respect for human life and is long overdue new jersey has the richest body of decisional law in the world in these matters , he said , yet we may be the last of our sister states to adopt livingwill legislation state senator gabriel m ambrosio , democrat of lyndhurst , sponsor of the bill and a member of the bioethics commission , said the legislation was necessary because medical science now has the ability to suspend people between life and death for an almost unlimited period of time people must be given the chance , he said , to decide in advancewhether they want artificial life support in case they are not capable of making that decision in the future mr ambrosio , who is also a lawyer , said that under current new jersey law living wills , or advance directives , as they are sometimes called , were not legally binding upon physicians treating incompetent or permanently unconscious patients often , he said , physicians fearing potential liability place such patients on artificial life supportdespite their previously expressed wishes to the contrary the legislation encourages doctors to comply with instructions in living wills and permits the designation of a health care representative to make medical decisions if the person who made the will becomes incapacitated or incompetent those who choose not to make a living will would not be affected by the legislation 'living wills are dangerous' opponents of the measure , including several members of the bioethics commission who voted against the final draft of the proposal , say the legislation may create more problems than it solves living wills are dangerous , said anne m perone , a lawyer who is a member of the commission , because a person is giving some unknown physician in the future the right to withdraw their life support that decision , she said , is typically based upon medical opinions that will inevitably change over the years a decision based on today s standards , she said , may not be the same decision that would be made in the future but if a person executes an advance directive and then becomes incompetent , the directive stands despite changes that have occurred in medical science living wills are also unnecessary , she said , since there are already ways for a person to designate someone else to make medical decisions on the person s behalf in the future anyone can choose a representative simply by signing an ordinary power of attorney , ms perone said opponents also criticize the legislation because it allows the removal of feeding tubes in cases of permanent unconsciousness or imminent death feeding tubes , which are used to provide such patients with fluids and nutrition , are considered medical treatment under the legislation removing the tubes requires the explicit written permission of the patient in the advance directive issue ends up in court
albany , march 29 new york s highest court today became the first in any state to rule that lawyers for criminal defendants cannot dismiss prospective jurors because of their race in issuing the unanimous decision , the court also upheld the manslaughter convictions of three young men in the howard beach racial attack case the ruling by the court of appeals represents a major curb on the ability of defendants to use peremptory challenges to exclude certain people from sitting on juries the united states supreme court , in a landmark case in 1986 , ruled that prosecutors could not use such challenges to exclude people based on race , but did not rule on whether the defense fell under the same obligation protected by the constitution in today s decision , new york s justices ruled that the exclusion of a juror by either side solely on the basis of race would represent a denial of that person s civil right to serve on a jury , and thus could not be tolerated under the state s constitution the case arose after the three whites argued that their right to a fair trial had been eclipsed when a judge in queens struck down their use of peremptory challenges that judge ruled that defense lawyers had been trying to exclude blacks from the jury the top court , in backing their convictions , rejected the defendants' reasoning we hold today that such racial discrimination has no place in our courtrooms and that such conduct by defense counsel is prohibited by both the civil rights clause and the equal protection clause of our state constitution , wrote justice fritz w alexander 2d may appeal ruling the three whites jon lester , now 20 years old scott kern , 19 , and jason ladone , 19 were convicted of manslaughter , assault and conspiracy charges arising from their 1986 attack on three black men in the mostly white queens neighborhood the incident , in which one black man was killed , became one of the most emotionally charged criminal cases in the city s history mr lester is now serving 10 to 20 years in prison , while mr kern , sentenced to 6 to 18 years , and mr ladone , sentenced to 5 to 15 years , have been free pending their appeals they are now due to surrender in late april , said one of their lawyers , john l pollok mr pollok said defense lawyers were strongly considering an appeal to the united states supreme court he said they might argue that the new york ruling violated the defendants' rights to a fair trial under the federal constitution 'equally circumscribed' the defense lawyers had argued in their appeal in new york that howard beach represented a classic case in which a defense counsel might not unreasonably conclude that blacks would be more likely to convict than whites but other lawyers noted that although peremptory challenges have long been routinely allowed to defense lawyers and prosecutors , they are not enshrined in the constitution the ruling today does not force defense lawyers or prosecutors to explain all peremptory challenges , but it does limit how they can use them while other states have issued curbs on prosecutors similar to the supreme court case , batson v kentucky , today s ruling represents the first time a state has ruled that a defendant is as equally circumscribed as a prosecutor in using the challenges , said william e hellerstein , a professor at brooklyn law school who was formerly chief of the criminal appeals bureau of the legal aid society the batson decision was most widely cited as a means of curbing prosecutors from seating allwhite juries in cases where defendants were nonwhite there have been several cases in new york in which trial judges have curbed peremptory rights after finding that defendants were systematically dismissing jurors because of their race not a state action' for instance , the judge in the attempted murder case of larry davis ordered that a new jury be selected after ruling that defense lawyers were trying to exclude whites mr davis , who faced nine counts of attempted murder after a 1986 shootout with the police in the bronx , was eventually acquitted of all but five illegal gun possession charges mr davis is black nevertheless , such decisions had not been appealed to the state s highest court until today s case , so the question of whether they violated the defendant s rights had never been determined by the court many defense lawyers said they disagreed with today s decision , maintaining that even if racial discrimination by defendants can be shown in their peremptory challenges , it is not a state action and thus should not be disallowed no duty to the public we as defense attorneys have a very different duty than prosecutors , said arnold s cohen , director of litigation for bronx legal services in order to find that a defendant injured the public with his peremptory challenges , you would have to find that the defendant had a special duty to the public , and there is none , added mr cohen and if a client directs you to reject certain jurors , you must act in what your client perceives to be his best interests but the justices appeared to repudiate that contention , arguing that if discrimination did occur , then the judge and the state would be complicitous when these jurors are so excluded solely because of their race , the state cannot ignore its role in the discrimination against them , wrote justice alexander concurring with the 70 decision were chief judge sol wachtler and justices richard d simons , judith s kaye , vito j titone , stewart f hancock jr and joseph w

twenty years after the first earth day , the cuyahoga river no longer catches fire on its way through cleveland , and bald eagles , once threatened by ddt , have increased nearly sevenfold in the continental united states , enough for government biologists to consider promoting the population to threatened from endangered around the country there are scores of examples of modest environmental progress , which elected officials and industrial companies will hold up to public view today as thousands of people celebrate earth day 1990 and call on society to nurture nature everywhere , it seems , the thinking has changed many corporations have dropped their old arguments pitting pollution against jobs and , sensing competitive advantage , are scrambling instead to demonstrate how green they are but measuring progress is as hard as adding apples and oranges , elephants and ozone from streams to stratosphere and the targets are shifting once concern was centered on narrow problems the stream in the valley , the dump nearby , tiny snail darters or giant pandas increasingly , the issues are problems of the whole earth industrial gases acting like glass in a greenhouse to trap heat around the earth , the destruction of the protective ozone layer scientists have discarded the image of mother nature with a black eye for one of mother nature stumbling toward a cliff the ozone hole is the smoking gun , said michael oppenheimer , a senior scientist at the environmental defense fund , who called the thinning of the protective ozone layer real proof that humans threaten life on earth one sign of such change is that earth day , which began in 1970 as a nationwide event , has evolved at its 20th anniversary into a celebration across 140 countries , honoring brazilian rain forests , protesting pollution in eastern europe and promoting behavior everywhere to preserve stratospheric ozone in fact , the nearglobal agreement in montreal in january 1989 to cut production of chlorofluorocarbons , which destroy ozone , is cited by many experts as the best example that as a species humans realize there is more to life than being at the top of the food chain around the nation , however , progress on the environment is mixed with frustration examples abound utilities in the united states are burning more than twice as much coal for electricity as they did in 1970 , yet they are emitting 15 percent less sulfur dioxide , the coal byproduct that causes acid rain the consensus , though , is that the reduction is not enough 4 , 000 lakes in the united states and 164 , 000 in canada are acidified or threatened , by the count of some environmental groups the tailpipes of new cars emit 96 percent less carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and 76 percent less nitrogen oxides than older models but there are so many more vehicles and so much congestion that half of americans live in counties that violated federal clean air standards in 1988 fish have returned to the cuyahoga river and to lake erie , into which it empties , and other great lakes but the flesh of many great lakes fish carries toxic chemicals that make them dangerous to eat , and casts doubt on the wisdom of restocking the lakes this is not the way to reconcile people with nature , and the public knows that , william k reilly , head of the environmental protection agency , said of the poisonous fish mr reilly , who carries a business card of brown recycled paper , is himself a symbol of the ascent of environmentalism , if not the environment a former president of the world wildlife fundunited states , he is likely soon to be elevated to the cabinet suddenly , many environmentalists seventysix percent of all americans now call themselves environmentalists , according to a gallup poll but many advocates who used to distinguish themselves by using the label say the environment is worse and some say attempts to measure real progress are only clouded by the appearance of consensus that comes when everyone from greenpeace members to chemical company executives marches under the same environmental banner the agencies and protective measures that sprang to life after the first earth day among them the environmental protection agency , the clean air act and the clean water act have pushed the country to reduce pollution but global problems that were not even recognized 20 years ago , like thinning ozone and the greenhouse effect , have clearly worsened those pose challenges to society that are different from what came before in contrast to the dwindling population of eagles , these problems may require solutions before the symptoms are plainly understood kenneth h keller , a chemical engineer who is a former president of the university of minnesota , recently wrote our ability to affect our ecological niche is accompanied by an inability to assess the effects of doing so in contrast to similar problems in the past , we are faced with the situation that the negative effects may be irreversible if we do not act to correct them , but that forces us to act before we can be sure that we understand them warring dioxides
albany , july 25 a state grand jury here is investigating whether officers in the new york national guard stole tens of thousands of dollars earmarked for tuition reimbursement of guard soldiers , lawenforcement officials said today a national guard spokesman , lieut col p c kutschera , said four middlelevel officers have been suspended with pay because of an internal inquiry but he said he was not at liberty to disclose the results of the inquiry , which he said had been forwarded to the new york state police and the state attorney general s office the lawenforcement officials , who asked not to be identified , said several people had been subpoenaed by the grand jury , which is expected to begin hearing testimony here on thursday its investigation , aided by the attorney general s office and the state police , is expected to take up to a month , the officials added the investigation focuses on whether officers who oversee education programs falsified documents to indicate that reserve officers had taken managementtraining courses , when they never enrolled in classes the state and federal governments reimbursed the guard for those classes , but the money has never been accounted for , the officials said four officers suspended the inquiry appeared to be the most serious at the national guard since a series of scandals beginning in 1985 that led to the forced resignation in 1986 of maj gen vito j castellano , who was head of the state s division of military and naval affairs mr castellano admitted loaning money to some of his subordinates at usurious rates and he pled guilty to incometax evasion the guard also came under criticism when disclosures were made of noshow jobs and misuse of military equipment , as well as training missions that included trips to maine for lobster according to colonel kutschera , the four officers suspended in the last two weeks are maj thomas labuda , the state education officer for the new york army national guard capt timothy waters , an assistant to major labuda maj richard johnson , the chief of the administrative support branch in the office of personnel affairs , and maj james j gross , supervisor of the air national guard in roslyn , li because of their suspensions , none of the four men could be reached through their offices today , and the national guard did not release their home addresses major labuda s lawyer , charles j wilcox , said he was aware of an investigation but , he said , any allegations with respect to mr labuda would pertain to his failure to be aware of things going on below him he is not , i understand , being considered in connection with any criminal charges , mr wilcox said , adding that he could not comment on the allegations the courses were supposed to be taught at a guard outpost in suburban albany , under the auspices of the state university of new york the guard filed paperwork with state and federal agencies that entitled it to receive compensation edward barbini , a spokesman for state attorney general , robert abrams , said today that his office was conducting an investigation into possible improprieties involving the reimbursement of tuition for several guardsmen lieut ronald r clark , a state police spokesman , said a similar investigation was under way but neither would comment on whether any charges were anticipated there are about 35 , 000 troops in the state s military the army national guard , air national guard , naval militia and new york guard they play a key role during state disasters and , in the event of a national emergency , can be called up by the president
it is springtime outside the brooklyn courthouse where the bensonhurst trial enters its third week tomorrow but in justice thaddeus e owens s fourthfloor courtroom , it is often just after 9 o'clock on the clear wednesday night in august when yusuf k hawkins and his three black friends were walking toward the doorway of 2007 69th street it was there that he was shot to death at 9 20 one witness after another has described what could have been an ordinary evening in the brooklyn neighborhood it was a pretty beautiful night , about 70 degrees , said russell gibbons , the lone black in the crowd of whites that gathered in the school yard of public school 205 i was having my conversation , said joseph menghi , 21 years old , who was sitting on agatha martino s stoop across 68th street from the schoolyard and then , with every witness , there is that moment when the night turns anything but ordinary in some of the descriptions , the moment comes in the bang , bang , bang sound of gunshots through the night in mr menghi s account , it occurred when when he recalled the shout of a neighborhood boy nicknamed little chris , who went running down the street , mr menghi said , shouting , someone got shot ! but however that moment comes , there is no going back after it the crowd of whites will scatter again , the police cars will arrive again , and yusuf hawkins will die again in the courtroom where it is by then 9 20 on a wednesday night in bensonhurst baseball bats and shouts the testimony is like a slide show , with one image after another flashing on a screen none of the pictures tell the whole truth , and some are distorted and blurred at the edges but in the stuffy courtroom where keith mondello and joseph fama are on trial for the murder , there have been some crisp images , too joseph serrano was swinging a bat against the schoolyard fence again and again as it grew dark and the group of young white men waited for blacks and hispanics to arrive carolina scalicia was on the stoop across the street , watching he was swinging it hard , she said from the witness stand the sound of the bat s smacking the fence echoed along 68th street , she said about that time , mr mondello was taking something out of his car parked nearby , according to an account that a police detective said mr mondello had given him the object in his car had been entrusted to him earlier by someone named frank , he told the police it was a gun , the statement said at about the same time , too , russell gibbons said , he and his best friend , charles stressler , were carrying a box of big man bats through the street toward the schoolyard after that , the images come faster mr fama , according to mr mondello s statement , is shouting they 're here ! blacks are here ! mr mondello , the police statement said , is running with his friends charlie and jimmy , and they all have bats mr fama , who is charged with firing the shots that killed yusuf hawkins , is running , too , irene desario testified she said she saw joey fama , dressed in white , running into the dark just before the sounds i heard something that sounded like firecrackers , she told the jurors sal the squid s hazy role some who had roles that night seem always out of focus in the courtroom of state supreme court sal the squid whose proper name , sal mannino , never seems to be used by his neighbors is one in almost every witness s account , his name comes up but he was not charged with any crimes or called as a witness by the prosecutors before they rested their case on friday at 32 years old , he was more than 10 years older than most of the young men who gathered that night but the candy store he ran , snacks and candy , was in the middle of things above it , on 68th street , was where gina feliciano , the 18yearold who had her birthday that day , lived with her mother , phyllis d'agata across the street was the schoolyard around the corner on 69th street , which is also called bay ridge avenue , was the doorway of no 2007 on tuesday night , by most accounts , there had been words in the street about gina feliciano and her hispanic and black friends and her plan to have them at her birthday party throughout the next day , according to testimony , sal the squid was busy ms d'agata said she saw him on the phone all afternoon and then , she said , young men would drive by his store and pull out guns and say they would be back , and he and they would exchange highfive hand slaps keith mondello spoke to sal the squid that afternoon , detective darcy callahan told the jurors the detective testified that mr mondello stated he entered the candy store , and sal had stated that he 'd had a conversation with a girl named gina who lived upstairs over the store , and she told him that that evening 20 to 25 blacks were going to come down and see what they 've got after that , detective callahan said , mr mondello said he had gathered a few friends about 8 o'clock , according to the statement , mr mondello began his evening by walking over to sal the squid s candy store a little after that , yusuf hawkins and his friends set out from the east new york section
to the editor freud s egregious mishandling of his case histories is said to have little to do with today s practice of psychoanalysis \( science times , march 6 \) modern analysts , however , still invoke freud s discoveries and concepts to justify a singularly protracted , expensive and often futile mode of treatment if , as we now know , freud chronically allowed erroneous preconceptions to warp his clinical and theoretical inferences , there is simply no empirical grounding for his system of thought consequently , we must disallow the claim of his successors , when they cling to elements of that system , to be practicing a proven medical science , instead of a cult on what basis , moreover , have analysts decided which parts of freud s pseudoscience to discard and which to retain \? the root problem with psychoanalysis has always been that the investigator works in a circular and isolated manner , using foregone conclusions to compel clinical findings , which are then reported in the form of selfserving , uncheckable anecdotes of successful diagnosis and treatment as decades pass , a doctrine resting on this cavalier notion of science will necessarily evolve in response to changing cultural and ideological fashions thus , that analysts now disagree with freud on a number of points tells us nothing about their improved empirical ethics the key question is what precautions , since freud first began distorting his case histories in the 1890 s , has psychoanalysis as an institution adopted to guard against the same kind of error \? the answer none whatever frederick crews berkeley , calif , march 6 , 1990 the writer is a professor of english
oberammergau , west germany it is midday in this bavarian village , and otto huber is speaking with an intensity that makes his eyes squint he tugs and twirls the shaggy black hair and beard surrounding his broad face a few hours earlier , he had delivered the lines opening the morning segment of the daylong oberammergau passion play now he is expounding warmly on the problems of revising this worldfamous drama , for which he is deputy director as well as a leading actor obergammergau is in fact the site of two dramas , not one there is the passion play itself , produced almost every 10 years since 1633 when village elders voted to retell the story of christ s death and resurrection if god spared the remaining population from a plague then there is the other drama , the efforts by villagers like mr huber , prodded by christian theologians , church officials and jewish critics , to revise the passion play , a presentation that many christians , in oberammergau and beyond , have regarded as semisacred as the 43yearold mr huber talks over his scarcely touched lunch , and continues his reflections over coffee after the afternoon segment of the play , that second drama becomes as compelling as anything seen on the village s sweeping openair stage the chief target for revision has been , of course , the play s antisemitic themes and stereotypes these were inherited from medieval prototypes , reinforced by 19thcentury dramatic convention and commended by none other than adolf hitler , who viewed the 300th anniversary performance with satisfaction in 1934 one would think that anything carrying hitler s endorsement would be immediately disinfected if not discarded until , that is , one recalls the pride and piety of an alpine village whose play predates the third reich by nearly three centuries oberammergau is not an isolated backwater when the town s music teacher , rochus dedler , rewrote music for the play in 1811 , he did not produce folk melodies , but an oratorio leaning heavily on haydn and mozart at the same time , oberammergau is enough of an enclosed society to bristle at the plentiful criticism , which since the holocaust has run the gamut from campaigns to boycott the pageant to patient proposals of detailed changes by christian scholars and jewish representatives even the slightest change in text or costume needs approval from an oberammergau committee that includes the entire town council plus local clergy and specially elected delegates the panel also chooses , using longstanding criteria , which oberammergau natives will play all the major roles it takes only a passing familiarity with smalltown politics to imagine the problems mr huber said he and christian stuckl , the innovating director of the play , had only a onevote majority among the town council members , and shifting support among the special representatives still , for the first time the production this year casts a married woman in the role of the blessed mother , opens major roles to protestants and enlists youths in important parts even though it meant relaxing the standard that major actors be devout churchgoing roman catholics the humanity of jesus is underlined in his genuine agony on the mount of olives each of these changes is still the subject of debate and grumbling in the village of 5 , 000 inhabitants from outside , people have warned that god would punish bavaria or unleash a third world war because of the village s unfaithfulness in fact the village seems to take faithfulness very seriously but some villagers , like mr huber , recognize that they have to be faithful to more than a text written in 1850 they also have to be faithful to the gospel , to which many of the passion play s details are imaginative additions , and to the gospels' message of love and redemption does n't it even become dangerous , mr huber wonders aloud , to present a passion play that isolates jesus s trial and execution from the deeds and teachings of his prior life \? what can be made of a medieval theory of redemption in which an angry god must be appeased by the bloody sacrifice of his son \? mr huber s eye tightened further as he mentions the modern theologians and early church fathers he has studied and the ways in which each generation inevitably reshaped the passion play not only to make it meaningful to their lives but also to reflect passing ideologies as mr huber talks , oberammergau becomes a microcosm of the christian churches as a whole the struggle to be faithful , they are always discovering , is not at all a simple one regarding the treatment of jews and judaism , that struggle is not yet resolved dozens of changes in the text , the costumes and the staging have been made to excise antisemitic stereotypes and to remove the impression that jesus s death was the responsibility of the jewish people the role of pontius pilate is underlined so is the jewishness of jesus and his disciples but the ugly bones of the old plot show through although scripture is rich in explanations , historical and theological , of why jesus was put to death , here the conniving defenders of jewish law overshadow everything else mr huber and his fellow revisers have done about all they can with the present text theologically , its melding of the four gospel accounts into a single factual narrative contradicts what is now recognized about the distinct perspectives of the gospel writers dramatically , the result is unwieldy , mixing the stylized and the naturalistic , interrupting the action to encompass a detail of scripture or sometimes of pious legend there is an historical exhibit in oberammergau this year showing the evolution of passion plays theoretically , the exhibit is for the benefit of the visitors , but mr huber hopes it will also have an impact on the town residents it may remind them that oberammergau s play has passed through at least four quite different scripts over the centuries as well as dozens of minute changes not only could the vestiges of antijewish sentiment be removed but the best religious and dramatic instincts of villagers like mr huber could also be served if oberammergau s officials authorized an entirely new script to start the new century
a jobs program that was supposed to place 10 , 000 urban high school graduates into upwardly mobile positions by 1992 is falling far short of its goal , prompting state officials to reexamine the program to see if it can be structured more effectively although the program will continue at least through the next fiscal year , plans to expand it have been shelved , and many school districts are worried that they will no longer be able to participate when 10 , 000 graduates 10 , 000 jobs was first announced in 1987 , it was seen as an innovative approach to increasing the supply of entrylevel employees while providing a strong incentive for students to complete high school but overly ambitious projections on participation , restrictive eligibility guidelines and a lackluster response from business and industry have made it all but impossible for the state to meet its goal still , state officials are hopeful that they can salvage the program one of the options would be to discontinue the program , but i do n't believe that s a viable one at this point , said dr lloyd j newbaker jr , an assistant commissioner with the state department of education , which is sponsoring the program in cooperation with the state department of labor there s a lot of promise to the project the program s lack of success is a setback to the urban education platform of thomas h kean , the former governor , who once described the initiative as the first step to a lifetime of successful employment for many students guidelines called for 1 , 000 seniors to be placed in fulltime jobs upon graduation last year , with 2 , 000 more students receiving jobs this spring , 3 , 000 next year and 4 , 000 in 1992 but of the 1 , 500 students to sign up for the program last year , only 534 completed the requirements and received jobs this year 1 , 206 seniors have enrolled in the program , with about 800 expected to get jobs although the program was originally conceived for seniors who were neither collegebound nor enrolled in a vocational or cooperative program , it was expanded this year to include students in lower grades in high school and some seniors with marginal academic records who say they intend to continue their education to qualify for a job , students must have completed all requirements for high school graduation , including passing the high school proficiency test they must also maintain a minimum 92 percent attendance record , demonstrate good citizenship and complete a 40hour training course to learn good work habits the 10 million program includes a coordinator in each of the 27 participating high schools and private sector coordinators throughout the state who find jobs for students completing the program the department of education has asked schools to come up with a minimum of 50 placements each year , resulting in a placement cost of roughly 1 , 000 a student but the restrictive eligibility requirements have left a small pool of students to draw from last year , none of the 21 participating schools except for those in elizabeth were able to recruit 50 students , and in some of the smaller districts , making 50 placements is a virtual impossibility of the 129 seniors enrolled at new brunswick high school this year , for example , all but 25 are excluded from the program because they are either collegebound or enrolled in vocational programs i made it known that there is no way i can come up with 50 students , said peggy dulin , the program coordinator for the new brunswick school system , who is worried that her school will be dropped from the program for the nearly 28 , 000 the state paid to cover ms dulin s salary and expenses last year , five new brunswick seniors completed the program requirements , of whom two decided to go to college and one moved out of state one of ms dulin s two students to be placed in a job has already been dismissed part of the poor turnout statewide is attributed to the decision by some of new jersey s largest school districts , including newark , not to participate in the program because of financial reasons state subsidies of as much as 50 , 000 a year for individual schools are to be eliminated over time , leaving the district to pick up the expense of operating the program the program s attendance requirement has been an obstacle for students and businesses alike we have a hard time selling 92 percent to business and industry , to be honest , said russell betz , who runs the program at snyder high school in jersey city , where 30 of the school s 104 seniors to enroll in the course this year have dropped out , mostly because they have missed too many days of school if you 're present only 92 percent of the time on your job , you 're not going to last long details of finding a job much of the 40hour training course is taken up with the details of finding and maintaining a job , from learning how to write a resume to coping with criticism from supervisors and coworkers for the most part , students do very well academically , but it s the social end of working being dependable , getting to work on time or calling in when they 're not going to show , or handling constructive criticism or employee conflict that they need help on , said nedra clark , coordinator of the program for montclair schools but businesses have also criticized the program s lack of technical training , and more vocational education will probably be included in the curriculum in the future we 've got to do a better job equipping these general students with a more vocationaltype program , dr newbaker said at least that is what employers have been telling us another problem has been the inherent conflict between a lengthy inschool training program and typical hiring practices
tennis has long been considered an elitist sport in the united states , but recent programs have begun to tap the rich vein of athletic talent in america s poorer bigcity neighborhoods one such effort , the reebok urban youth tennis academy , has spent the last decade giving children from poor families a chance to compete equally against their wealthier counterparts since its inception by the new york city department of parks and recreation in 1980 , the program has helped more than 100 children receive either a collegiate tennis scholarship or a united states tennis association ranking the program includes guest appearances by former worldclass pros such as ron holmberg , eric fromm and leslie allen what we 're trying to do is combine public and private resources to help city kids who would not otherwise be able to afford it , said michael silverman , the director of tennis for the parks department there are a lot of great beginner programs throughout the country , but more middlerange programs like this are needed to further develop skills so far , none of our kids have made it on the pro circuit but there are a lot of smiling faces , and this means much more to us each spring , hundreds of young aspirants audition at the usta national tennis center in flushing meadows , queens , hoping to become one of 50 chosen for the summer program those who make the grade face yet another cut in the fall , to determine the 25 participants for the winter schedule in the summer , the players meet four days a week for two and a half hours a day at the national tennis center in the winter , they meet indoors at the tennis center on saturday and sunday for two hours each day the juniors are divided into two age groups those 8 to 14 years old , and those 15 to 18 a typical session begins with half an hour of stretching and aerobics then every tennis stroke is practiced through extensive drills there is a lot of raw talent here , said anne kucienski , who directs the younger group most of them have n't had much coaching , so we help them with their technique and their game plan additionally , the young players are sponsored for as many as 10 tournaments a year one default , however , and the player loses all his tournament sponsorship you get to pick your tournaments , and they 're putting you in them , so it s your responsibility to show up , said albert ramirez , 15 , an academy member for the last four years the players come from the five boroughs by way of nearly all points on the globe we 've got people from korea , nigeria , colombia , russia , everywhere right , guys \? asked shabir mohammed , a pakistani native who directs the older children when they responded exuberantly in the affirmative , he added , you 're the chosen ones , guys photo rommel sahagun , right , an instructor for the reebok urban youth tennis academy , with jermaine allen at flushing meadows \( michael silverman \)

for the first time , researchers have been able to cure patients with chronic hepatitis b , a devastating and often progressively debilitating liver disease that afflicts more than a million americans and is the ninth leading cause of death worldwide results from a clinical trial involving 126 patients at 12 medical centers throughout the country indicate that interferon alpha2b , a synthetic version of a naturally occurring immune system hormone , cures 10 percent of patients and abates the viral infection in 30 percent more even using the most exquisitely sensitive probes for the hepatitis virus , investigators could find no signs of the deadly microbe in the cured patients' cells chronic hepatitis b is a major cause of liver cancer and cirrhosis until now there has been no way to treat this chronic condition on tuesday an advisory committee of the food and drug administration recommended that the drug be approved as a treatment for the other most common form of chronic hepatitis , nona , nonb hepatitis but the drug does not cure people with that form of chronic hepatitis , and only about half as many patients have lasting benefits from it interferon is marketed for treating hairy cell leukemia , genital warts and kaposi s sarcoma , a skin cancer , but not for hepatitis however , doctors can prescribe it for that purpose at their own discretion last year interferon was found to be an effective treatment for the type of nona , nonb hepatitis that was recently designated hepatitis c when traces of the virus that causes it were detected before that , this hepatitis was untreatable but it induced longlasting remissions in about 25 percent of those with hepatitis c , whereas it induced such remissions in 40 to 50 percent of patients with hepatitis b dr jay h hoofnagle , director of the division of digestive diseases and nutrition at the national institute of diabetes , digestive and kidney diseases in bethesda , md , said the new study results were definitive enough that i suspect this study will be the basis for licensing interferon for the treatment of hepatitis b the drug , which is made by the scheringplough corporation of madison , nj , would cost about 5 , 000 for the 16 weeks needed for treatment , said linn weiss , a spokesman for the company the new results , being published today in the new england journal of medicine , are a major step forward , said dr richard aach , a hepatitis expert who is the director of medicine at mount sinai medical center in cleveland and vice chairman of medicine at case western reserve university school of medicine they are very important findings , said dr hoofnagle , who wrote an editorial accompanying the paper he said interferon is the first agent shown to be effective in this chronic viral infection most people who are infected with the hepatitis b virus , which is spread mostly through sexual intercourse or contaminated needles , get better on their own but in about 5 percent of those infected the virus smolders in the liver , silently proliferating and often leading to cirrhosis or liver cancer chronically infected people have a 5 to 10 percent chance of improving spontaneously each year , meaning their viral infections go into remission but they are not cured the virus can still burst out of cells where it was resting and begin infecting other liver cells again once reactivated , the disease can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure or liver cancer a very low relapse rate the new study was sponsored by sheringplough and led by dr robert p perillo , the director of gastroenterology at the veterans affairs medical center in st louis and an associate professor of medicine at washington university in st louis half the patients received a therapeutic dose of interferon for 16 weeks and the rest received a much smaller dose or a dummy substance for comparison what we have is a way to effect a cure in some patients and put others into remission , dr perillo said he said the relapse rate among patients in the study was very , very low , adding that fewer than 5 percent of the patients who went into remission had a resurgence of the disease none of those who had a complete disappearance of the virus from the body regained any evidence of infection , he said all whose virus disappeared completely had been infected for three years or less the results mean that if you treat early , you can get rid of the infection , dr perillo said but the longer you wait the harder it is to reach a permanent cure treatment called 'not easy' dr harvey alter , a hepatitis expert at the clinical center of the national institutes of health , cautioned that the interferon treatment is not easy the drug was given in daily injections , and nearly everyone who took it suffered side effects , including fatigue , muscle aches and irritability dr hoofnagle said , although most patients can make it through the four months of treatment , all are quite anxious to get off and for 60 percent of the patients , the treatment had no benefits this is the first evidence we have that anything works , he said but the trouble is that for the remaining 60 percent , we do n't know what to do at least half the people with chronic hepatitis b do not know they are infected , dr hoofnagle said , because they have none of the typical symptoms of the disease , like nausea , fatigue , jaundice or pains in the joints some have no symptoms many people first learn they are infected when they volunteer to donate blood and are rejected because they have proteins from the hepatitis virus in their blood or when they have a general physical examination and their doctor finds that their liver enzyme levels are elevated but people with no symptoms are just as likely to develop cirrhosis or liver cancer symptoms do n't correlate very well with severity of disease , dr hoofnagle said he said that the new treatment was only a first step and that he was optimistic about better treatments with the onset of aids , there has been a massive interest in antiviral drugs , he said ten years ago there was nothing it was a desert but now , he said , we are looking at all the new antiviral drugs as they come along
slow , very slow that s the first quality almost everyone notices about the collaboratively choreographed works of eiko and koma audiences have found their unruffled pacing both strange and eloquent ever since the japaneseborn dancers made their new york debut 14 years ago eiko and koma are now highly regarded creative figures in the american dance scene they have given annual new york seasons , some of them under such auspices as the brooklyn academy of music s next wave festival and the japan society over the years , other productions have been commissioned by the walker art center in minneapolis and the american dance festival in durham , n c slowness is not the only distinctive feature of their creations as eiko and koma proceed to scramble , hunch , drag themselves along and even topple over , other things become apparent their productions are visually powerful , and they concern aspects of nature some have been inspired by such basics as trees , stones and grain others evoke such processes as growth and decay , creation and destruction at times it may seem to take ages to raise an arm or a head positions are held and frozen and then give way to other sculptural positions that are also frozen the program eiko and koma will present tuesday through next sunday night at the joyce theater features three new york premieres memory , rust and passage movements will undoubtedly again be slow and the stage will look mysterious the scenery for memory and rust consists of a chainlink fence passage is dominated by a bloodred backdrop , and the action will occur in a pool of water as in some , but not all , of their previous presentations , the dancers will be nude for the entire evening their choice of accompaniment is also typical of them to help focus attention on their movements , eiko and koma are sparing in their use of sound memory will be danced to a barely audible recorded score by a west german composer known as deuter rust will be performed in silence and the only accompaniment to the movements in passage will be the drip of water into the onstage pool the dancers' slowness can suggest eons of time during a recent interview in their midtown manhattan apartment , koma recalled that he and eiko once did a work about mountains in love mountains ca n't move fast , he observed and eiko pointed out that it may take a very long time indeed for stars and planets to draw near one another as they travel through space both dancers insisted that slowness can be beautiful for its own sake according to koma , when we move slowly , we are enjoying each moment as it occurs , and we hope the audience will enjoy it , too the dancers will stand in front of the fence in rust and that work s title sums up its theme lighting effects give the impression that their bodies are indeed rusting in memory , eiko will be in front of the fence , but koma will be behind it , sometimes appearing to be a person actually present , at other times only a remembered image a body looks very tender , very vulnerable , when seen against chainlink , eiko remarked if passage glares with redness , so does much of life , the dancers believe our blood is red , said eiko the earth s blood is red , as well the magma of volcanos is red so is the ocher soil of south america the use of water in passage , as in some of their earlier works , is not just a theatrical stunt real water is more beautiful than any lighting effect can ever be , eiko said water is something everyone knows so , when audiences see me covered with water , they will know how i feel performing in the nude has been part of their theatrical style ever since their night tide in 1984 eiko explained why every time we are naked , it s because we could n't find an appropriate costume for that scene it s uncomfortable to be nude on stage so , we keep trying out costumes but when none seems right , we dance nude after all , nudity is also a form of theatrical costuming concerning the nudity in passage , she said , it s hard to move in water with clothes on , and it feels colder because the wetness just gets into a costume and stays there both of these theatrical nonconformists come from middleclass families while studying law and political science in tokyo during the late 1960 s , they joined student groups protesting against america s involvement in vietnam at the same time , they developed an interest in contemporary dance neither has studied any traditional japanese form instead , their early training was in the often grotesque contemporary japanese style known as butoh in 1972 they met at a dance studio and soon decided to devote their lives to the art both were eager to learn more about western modern dance but because of their opposition to the war in vietnam , they were reluctant to visit the united states instead , they became curious about the expressionist dance form that mary wigman , one of the most influential choreographers of this century , had developed in germany during the 1920 s off to europe they went and by a route so roundabout that , eiko said , to this day my mother has n't forgiven me for it with an eye on their budget , they took a boat from japan to siberia , then the transsiberian railway to moscow and , from there , a plane to vienna at first , they naively hoped they could earn a living just by dancing extemporaneously in cathedral squares quickly cured of that illusion , they bought an old automobile and drove across the continent , trying to obtain engagements in cultural centers when luck was against them and funds were low , they would pull off the roadside and sleep in their car as they traveled , they searched for a dance teacher although wigman had died in 1973 , an acquaintance suggested that eiko and koma , who use only their first names , might find it stimulating to study with manja chmiel , a wigman pupil who taught in hanover , germany she proved an inspiration who strongly supported their collaborations gradually , the couple s reputation grew one of their performances in amsterdam was seen by lucas hoving , the dutch dancer and teacher who was for many years a principal of the jose limon dance company in new york mr hoving urged them to come to america and , because the united states had by then withdrawn from vietnam , they followed his advice , making their new york debut in 1976 the city is now their home their unhurried choreography initially astonished audiences but many dancegoers soon found it eloquent eiko says with a laugh that , today , a few of their most ardent fans accuse them not of slowness but of moving too quickly for anyone unacquainted with their style , koma has this advice going to our dances may be like going to a new restaurant the food may seem strange but do n't be hesitant just try it taste the food taste the movement photo eiko and koma rehearsing for their sixday run at the joyce that begins tuesday \( the

bill torrey , the general manager of the islanders , yesterday criticized as unjust and arbitrary the national hockey league s decision to fine the team and coach al arbour , as well as suspend a pair of its players for their role in the melee that concluded thursday night s patrick division playoff opener at madison square garden torrey said the islanders would not seek to immediately have commuted the suspensions handed out to mick vukota \( 10 games \) and ken baumgartner \( one game \) but he said they would file a formal appeal concerning the 30 , 000 worth of fines and the suspensions with the nhl at its next meeting of the board of governors that meeting , originally scheduled for april 9 , has been postponed indefinitely for reasons not connected to the incident we not only question the president s decision , but even more so his comments attacking the integrity of the team , its coach and the franchise , torrey said in a statement that referred to the harshly worded ruling handed down by nhl president john ziegler friday evening ziegler said yesterday through a spokesman that it would be inappropriate , to comment on the appeal while we do not condone the events that took place just prior to the end of the game , to place all of the guilt on just one team is clearly unjust and arbitrary , torrey s statement read the incident in dispute took place immediately after the final faceoff of the 21 triumph by the rangers in the opener of the best of seven series that resumed last night at madison square garden with two seconds on the clock and the faceoff deep in the islanders' zone , arbour , who had moments before seen pat lafontaine , his top player , carried off on a stretcher , sent out his top fighters and toughest players at the drop of the puck and with the rangers standing nearly back at the blue line , vukota skated across the zone and attacked jeff bloemberg while baumgartner skated 30 feet before flattening kris king fights broke out , with the islander players on their bench taking swings at the rangers and with debris being hurled on the ice from the stands shameful , disgraceful , degrading all are adjectives that arrive and yet fall short of the mark , ziegler , who fined the organization 25 , 000 and arbour 5 , 000 , said of the behavior by the islanders because of the fine history of the franchise and the excellent reputation of the coach , one searches hard for some plausible explanation in mitigation of what took place search as i have , none is discovered because there is none lost , too , amid the fights and the fines , the acrimony and accusations , the investigations , the rulings and the suspensions , was one formidable fact the islanders , cast as the underdogs and sporting a 3145 recent record , still probably outplayed the rangers over the course of the game give them credit , they did a good job of checking , and they certainly played all out , roger neilson , the coach of the rangers , said of the islanders i hope that was their best rangers achieve priority it is , of course , uncertain for how much of the series the islanders will be at their best because of the questionable status of lafontaine , one of the league s elite offensive forces lafontaine , knocked unconscious by a james patrick check late in the opening game , was released from lenox hill hospital friday after being diagnosed as having suffered a mild concussion the islanders refused to elaborate on his condition other than to say they would not completely rule him out for game 2 last night for the rangers , the frightening exit of lafontaine thursday night amounted to a dramatic , if clearly disturbing achievement of their top priority entering the series the rangers , starting with chris nilan s penalized punch to lafontaine s head early in the first period , shadowed , antagonized and hit lafontaine at every available turn from start to finish , it was pretty clear the rangers were concentrating pretty closely on pat and hubie mcdonough , torrey said that s the way roger plays it in the playoffs neilson would hardly be disappointed to play the rest of the playoffs against an islander team lacking lafontaine pat s a pretty tough kid , and if he comes back i'm sure the bodycheck wo n't intimidate him , said neilson but , of course , you 'd prefer to play them without him still , they 'll be pumped up to play without him and that stands to inflate the concern for the rangers , who were it not for the sensational standup goaltending of mike richter might be down a game

the pentagon s ban on gay men and lesbians in the armed forces , upheld by the courts and unchanged by congress , is facing attack on a new front the nation s college campuses in recent months , administrators , professors and students on more than a dozen campuses have been asking with increasing fervor why the reserve officers training corps , which has been discharging gay cadets and seeking to reclaim scholarship money it had given them , is allowed to operate at schools that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation the protests have taken various forms , including a rally on friday at the university of wisconsin at madison , a statement of disapproval last wednesday by the faculty council at harvard university and a stinging letter to defense secretary dick cheney last month from the provost of the massachusetts institute of technology i am as astonished as i am delighted by what appears to be happening , said representative gerry e studds , a massachusetts democrat who is a homosexual and has been pushing the military to overturn the ban a groundswell of outrage like this is not something i expected to see in my lifetime there is no question which way the tide is running we just do n't know when high tide will be 'new angle of attack' the supreme court in february refused to hear two challenges to the pentagon regulation , which states that homosexuality is incompatible with military service opponents say they hope growing attention to the issue on campuses will stir broader public opinion and perhaps embolden congress or the president to intervene a pentagon spokesman , maj doug hart , characterized the campus protests as a new angle of attack by opponents of the ban he noted that none of the universities has asked rotc to leave campus , as several did in the years of protest against the vietnam war but major hart acknowledged that the department of defense could suffer if that happened , since about 70 percent of its new officers came from the nation s 529 rotc programs the recent furor was prompted by three cases of officer cadets who told their superiors that they were gay and were dismissed and ordered to repay scholarship money they received from the rotc gay members of the armed forces are forcibly discharged at the rate of 1 , 400 a year , the pentagon says , and while gay rotc members are also routinely let go , it is rare that they are asked to return scholarship money the three who were recently dismissed are james m holobaugh , 24 , who was an army cadet at washington university in st louis david e carney , 23 , a navy cadet at harvard , and robert l bettiker , 22 , a navy cadet at mit all three have refused to return the scholarship money anger about scholarship move the longstanding military policy states that homosexuals cannot serve in the armed forces since their presence causes discomfort for heterosexuals serving in close proximity , makes recruiting more difficult and endangers national security because of the risk of blackmail asked to explain the policy , pentagon spokesmen said they distribute the 130word directive but are not permitted to discuss it two pentagon studies disclosed last year by representative studds found no evidence that homosexuals disrupted the armed forces and urged their retention the department dismissed the reports as draft recommendations that were rejected because they were not responsive to the original research request gay organizations on many campuses , including wisconsin , harvard and mit , had been protesting about rotc long before the cadets were dismissed during the winter but the military s effort to reclaim the scholarship money seems to have galvanized additional opposition that is more meanspirited than the policy itself , said william rubenstein , staff counsel at the american civil liberties union it strikes a lot of people as going too far , even people who accept the original policy representative studds sought signatures in march on a pair of protest letters to the army and navy about the rotc actions two dozen members of congress signed the first letter and three dozen the second protest by longtime adviser the provost at mit , john m deutch , was also inspired to more vocal protest by the recent dismissals , mr deutch s letter last month summarized the argument made by academic opponents nationwide by citing the contradiction between the university s principle of nondiscrimination against individuals on the basis of sexual orientation and the presence of an rotc that does discriminate mr deutch predicted in his letter that many universities will withdraw from rotc because of the discriminatory policy , although he neither made specific threats nor set deadlines for mit he warned mr cheney that failure to reverse the ban will make it easier for dedicated critics of the nation s defense establishment to advance their cause , at a time when the military faces significant cutbacks in money mr deutch s letter , which begins dear dick and ends best regards , john , has a special resonance because the provost is a longtime pentagon adviser and the university receives substantial research money from the military 479 million last year what we hope , said david m halperin , a literature professor who is a protest leader at the school , is that the closeness of the relationship between mit and the military means that mit s decisions will be heard more loudly than those of a liberal arts college that does n't have those connections the university of wisconsin at madison , in the first full faculty meeting since the vietnam war era , voted six months ago to urge the board of regents to sever contracts with the rotc by 1993 if discrimination did not end but rather than taking the issue to the board , the university s chancellor , donna e shalala , and its president , kenneth shaw , who support ending the ban , chose to lobby the state s congressional delegation to change the policy at the rally in madison on friday , a day other campuses also held protests , mr holobaugh , one of the dismissed cadets , commended the 200 wisconsin students in attendance , calling them trend setters mr holobaugh was joined at the rainswept podium by miriam benshalom , a former sergeant in the army reserve whose discharge was appealed to the supreme court but was refused review , and joseph c steffan , who is now challenging his expulsion from the united states naval academy at annapolis the campus activity comes at a time when gay rights advocates concede that the courts are unlikely to force change upon the pentagon and that lobbying congress or applying direct pressure on the military is the best route the litigation strategy has about come to a close , said mr rubenstein of the civil liberties union for a long time there was almost gridlock on this issue , and this may loosen the logjam photo furor over the reserve officers training corps s dismissal of gay men and lesbians has grown since three cadets were disenrolled and ordered to repay scholarship money all three , including james m holobaugh , speaking at a conference on rotc policy in madison , wis , have refused to return the money they had received \( tom capp for the new york times \)
washington , july 25 the senate took the rare step of punishing one of its own members today , denouncing senator dave durenberger for bringing dishonor and disrepute to the institution through improper financial dealings acting to discipline a member for the ninth time ever and the first time in more than a decade , the senators approved a resolution denouncing the minnesota republican and ordering him to pay restitution as senator durenberger sat impassively at a frontrow desk in the senate chamber , rubbing his chin with his right hand , his colleagues rose one by one to cast their votes the vote was 96 to 0 'i love this senate' mr durenberger and the other republican from minnesota , rudy boschwitz , voted present senators larry pressler of south dakota and malcolm wallop of wyoming , both republicans , were absent only after his colleagues voted did mr durenberger rise to address the chamber i love this senate and cherish the ideals it stands for , the 55yearold senator said in a soft but unwavering voice if anyone wants to judge my respect for this body and for each of you , i would suggest they look at my actions over the last 22 months to bring this matter to a conclusion violations are recounted mr durenberger , who was elected 12 years ago to fill the unexpired term of hubert h humphrey after the senator s death , assured his peers if there is a smudge on the seal of the united states senate , or on the star of the north , as we like to call our state , i will work my hardest to polish both back to brightness after the vote , mr durenberger told reporters that he had never considered resigning , but that he had not decided whether to seek reelection in 1994 the session opened late this afternoon when senator howell heflin , the ethics committee chairman , spoke somberly and in great detail about senator durenberger s violations of senate rules in supplementing his income through book promotion and real estate deals the evidence of knowing and willful misconduct , said senator heflin , an alabama democrat , is clear and convincing , and far more troubling than senator durenberger s admitted negligence , lack of wisdom or asserted misplaced reliance on others although mr durenberger had previously said the punishment was too onerous , today he did not dispute the ethics committee s recommendation that he be denounced the session offered an extraordinary window on the thoughts and pressures faced by senators for more than three hours before the vote , members of both parties talked not only about mr durenberger s transgressions , speculating that a troubled family life drove him to breaches of the senate s rules , but also about their friendships with him a drawnout procedure many members also volunteered their thoughts on the sensitive atmosphere in congress on ethics and about what some termed a cumbersome disciplinary process the durenberger case took a year and a half to wend its way to the senate floor after a long investigation , the ethics committee recommended the denunication last week in laying out the charges , mr heflin explained the two most serious allegations against mr durenberger one was that he evaded limits on the amount of speaking fees members can receive from private groups by converting 100 , 000 worth into promotional fees for two books he wrote the other was that he engaged in an elaborate financial scheme to lease a condominium he owned in minneapolis so that he could collect 40 , 055 in travel reimbursements from the senate beyond the denunciation , the resolution passed by the senate today ordered mr durenberger to pay 95 , 000 to charities for taking more in speaking fees than senate rules permitted it also directed him to repay the senate 29 , 050 plus interest for travel reimbursements he should not have accepted the resolution also asked the senate s republicans to consider their own action against mr durenberger , like stripping him of his seniority but senator john h chafee of rhode island , chairman of the chamber s republican conference , said after the vote that the senate s action was sufficient and that the senate conference plans no action on this rebukes have equal weight it was the ninth time in history that a senator had been denounced , condemned or censured , said donald a ritchie , the associate senate historian he said all three rebukes were considered of equal weight in the eyes of the senate and were the harshest sanctions short of expulsion the chamber last passed judgment on a member in 1979 , when senator herman e talmadge , a georgia democrat , was denounced for mishandling his financial affairs it was not the kind of deliberation senators enjoy , not only because mr durenberger is well liked by many of his colleagues , but also because it is an election year when the ethical standards of congress have come under keen scrutiny but several members spoke frankly and in personal terms about mr durenberger and the senate when one of us gets in trouble , we 're all in trouble , said david pryor , democrat of arkansas , who is a member of the ethics panel today i sense a feeling of closeness , a sense of brotherhood bob dole , the republican leader , reflected upon the senate , saying , it s a unique group of 100 americans , all different , all talented , all dedicated none perfect he went on to say that you ca n't fake it here , either you find out in a hurry what your colleagues are all about so i can tell you all about dave durenberger dave durenberger has earned my respect senator warren b rudman , republican of new hampshire and vice chairman of the ethics committee , said the panel s private deliberations were painstaking we shed all partisanship and , unfortunately , all

as union officials left for phoenix and a players' executive board meeting today , the chances for a settlement that would end the club owners' lockout and salvage the start of the baseball season seemed to hinge on the possibility of a lastminute proposal from the owners no proposal , however , was forthcoming it s not going to happen , fay vincent , the baseball commissioner , said last night there are n't going to be any more suggestions or proposals for a while we just do n't have any with the lockout of players from spring training camps nearly two weeks old , baseball s labor dispute faces a lengthy recess in negotiations that is virtually certain to affect the start of the season , scheduled for april 2 donald fehr , the union leader , said yesterday that after the executive board meets today , he may hold two or three meetings with groups of players in cities around the country the owners' negotiators said they had no plans to follow fehr so they could resume the talks 'really serious' acknowledging that he saw a lengthy recess coming , vincent said i think it s really serious it makes everybody become more extreme positions harden people move further apart this has all the earmarks of a very serious one not even a courtesy call fehr paid on the commissioner in manhattan before he left for phoenix had any effect it was my invitation , vincent said at least i wanted to say i did n't have any more thoughts i owed them that i asked don where he was going after phoenix and he said he did n't know i guess he 'll go on his trip and we 'll see what happens at a news briefing yesterday , charles o'connor , the owners' labor spokesman , did release a list of the owners' current proposals , and a few of the provisions were new none , however , dealt with the impasse over salary arbitration the clubs changed their position from two years to three on when either side could terminate the proposed fouryear agreement and initiate negotiations on a new one they offered collusion protection in the form of triple damages and newlook free agency remedies if the clubs again engage in collusion against free agents and they said that members of the study commission on revenue participation would be nonbaseball people negotiators for the two sides did not meet at the bargaining table yesterday instead , they spent the morning and early part of the afternoon making telephone calls and sending fax messages dealing with language on such matters as the study commission the owners want and the collusion protection the players want fehr said the communications did not touch on the key issues in the dispute eligibility for salary arbitration and the owners' contribution to the players' pension and benefit plan appearing briefly at a news briefing at the helmsley palace , he left the impression that the prospects of a settlement looked bleak we have not broken through the salary arbitration problem , he said there have been no new proposals made on the benefit plan , minimum salaries , rosters i 'll report to the players tomorrow as to what the status is and we 'll go from there 'appropriate to separate' o'connor did not present a rosier picture when he was asked about the recess in talks we have reached the point where it is appropriate to separate for a while , o'connor said about 15 minutes after fehr spoke with reporters , he was at the commissioner s office , where he was spotted by a group of reporters who themselves had hoped to see the commissioner a few minutes later , fehr emerged with two of his aides , eugene orza and mark belanger asked why they had been there , fehr said we paid a courtesy call to fay we came over to say goodbye fehr was asked whether he was accustomed to saying goodbye to the commissioner before he left on a trip steve had asked if we would stop by for two minutes before we left , he replied , referring to steve greenberg , the deputy commissioner we said sure we stopped by for two minutes and left vincent was especially downcast over his inability to generate some movement sunday on the arbitration eligibility issue the owners have been adamant about keeping the eligibility level at three years of major league service the players have just as adamantly demanded a return to two years , where the level stood before the 1985 negotiations there s got to be some compromise , the commissioner said no one here knows what the compromise might be it s hard to deal with the players' position was there should be some players treated as threeyear players who are n't i tried to come up with something , but they did n't move 'national disgrace' annapolis , md , feb 26 \( ap \) gov william donald schaefer of maryland and 13 other governors sent a letter to commissioner fay vincent and representatives of major league baseball owners and players today , calling their labor dispute a national disgrace baseball is too important to our country both

could begin and the season open on time schaefer persuaded chief executives from three other states with major league baseball teams california , massachusetts and ohio to sign his letter
q our den has a cement slab floor that is covered with squares of wood parquet flooring this floor has no insulation and is cold in the winter i would like to cover it with ceramic tiles the wood squares are still firm and sticking solidly would it be possible to leave the wood flooring in place as insulation and then lay the tiles directly over this \? a you can lay the ceramic tiles directly over the wood if the wood is solid and still sticking firmly it would be best to remove the wood flooring first for real insulating value , the cement slab should have had insulation installed under it you can still add insulation now by placing thick strips of mastic insulation around the edges of the slab you can add even more insulation by laying 2x4 s in mastic over the top of the slab , spacing them about 24 inches apart then put down sheets of insulating board between the 2x4 s cover all this with 3 4inch plywood or particle board , then lay the tiles on top q vanity counters in our bathroom are made of wood treated to make it waterproof but we have found that spills from nail polish remover and liquid soap seem to have taken off part of the finish the color looks faded in spots and has a waxy look a every wood finish is subject to wear and must be renewed periodically , and none is completely waterproof forever also , nail polish remover is a strong solvent that will remove or soften most wood finishes , so it is not surprising that it attacked the finish your best bet is to remove the old finish entirely , either by sanding or using an industrialgrade chemical remover then refinish with several coats of a clear twopart epoxy , the kind sold for resurfacing table and counter tops
death s darkest face by julian symons 272 pp new york viking 1795 just as john le carre has transformed the spy novel into literature , julian symons gives us a work of serious fiction that happens also to be a mystery we may even fear , once the leisurely , almost edwardian pace is established , that the mystery could be overwhelmed by novelistic detail , that we might as well be reading ford madox ford there are none of the grisly discoveries that set the pace for the more commercial crime tales only the empty austin parked on the beach near clempstone , its owner , the poet hugo headley , never to be seen again the narrative washes in layers like the waves here on the english channel coast , moving backward and forward in time the story reaches us secondhand , bequeathed , in the form of notes for a novel , by a dead actor , geoffrey elder , to a writer friend , julian symons himself , who handles the frame story narrative with what seems at first only a dutiful interest but our patience will be rewarded , not only with a fine novel , but with what builds into a masterly story of crime and discovery mr symons serves as his own frame narrator like conrad s marlow , he organizes the threads of the tale from a comfortable distance , intrigued but not driven marlow is a raconteur , telling his stories at clubs or on the decks of yachts moored on the thames mr symons calls himself an armchair detective , one who has tried to heed elder s last wishes and advice that he recognize their common understanding as artists , that technique is the thing in any art , it is what you must learn as an actor or you 're never any good no matter how much passion you feel , and i'm sure the same applies to writing mr symons describes briefly how he has rearranged the material \( abandoning straight chronology for moving back and forth among the decades since headley s death for maximum suspense \) , then steps aside for elder s story perhaps the best investigators are those compelled to learn the darkest secrets of their own past , but are they the best detectives \? here s a test the mystery of headley s disappearance seems at various times to have involved every member of elder s family \( headley s beach neighbors \) his father , harold his sexy mother , who insists he call her deirdre his half brother , justin his aunt aggie , a former actress \( stage name mary storm \) and others both known and unknown to him headley has also seduced elder s precocious childhood infatuation , melissa daughter of his father s partner , neil paton , and his neurasthenic wife , hilda other characters include elder s father s close friend , dodo everard , and dodo s wife , bella and a cast of other sharply drawn characters that the reader will enjoy discovering there are plenty of false suspects , and vivid scenes of london s dark side , and more motives for the gambler rogue genius hugo headley s disappearance than most readers can track headley was a blackmailer but of whom \? there s plenty of what one of d h lawrence s critics called sexual dogginess among these nouveaubourgeois brits a classic blackmail formula most of these people have been married several times headley has been aunt aggie s lover , melissa s , and perhaps deirdre s , but his vaguely threatening notes were addressed to harold , and vaguely answered as in many of ross macdonald s best , we have the sins of the fathers being visited on the children we begin uncovering layers of deception , still uncertain if there was a murder geoffrey remembers as much as he can about the 1930 s , his own childhood , and the year 1936 in which headley disappeared , but the story haunts him through the decades , and his amateur sleuthing continues into the 1960 s , when he thinks he has the answers and can accept their truth mr symons could remove all the mystery elements of this story and still have a wonderful novel , but as we near the end , we are happier for the challenge of solving the crime \( s \) and think that we , and geoffrey elder , have done well we may wonder at how much information , how many lives , how many different versions of the real story \( elder examines this theme from his hospital bed after being knocked unconscious trying to save a transvestite from his bald and jealous exlover , sharkey \) we 've experienced in only 272 pages , and at what seemed such a genteel pace then , in what we assume will be only a modest summing up by the armchair detective , a closing of the tale s frame , he delivers his best surprise , and we must agree that while technique may not be the only thing , it can be dazzling , and we realize that we 've made this journey with a master guide
the newhouse family , one of the nation s largest owners of magazines , newspapers and cable systems , won a sevenyear , multimilliondollar battle against the internal revenue service yesterday a federal tax court judge in washington agreed with the family in its 2356 million valuation of the holdings of samuel i newhouse in the family companies at the time of his death in 1979 in one of the biggest tax disputes in the nation s history , the irs was seeking 6095 million in tax payments from the estate of mr newhouse it contended that his holdings in advance publications inc and the newhouse broadcasting company were together worth about 132 billion lawyers for the estate , whose executors are mr newhouse s two sons , s i newhouse jr and donald newhouse , argued that his holdings were worth far less they said that the 225 percent stake , or 1 , 000 shares , in advance held by their father was worth 176 million when he died in 1979 the estate put the value of mr newhouse s 100 shares , or 44 percent of newhouse broadcasting , at 596 million at the time of the suit , the newhouse family , through advance , owned 50 newspapers , including the starledger in newark it also owned conde nast publications , the parent company of vogue , glamour , mademoiselle , hg , gq , and brides separately , newhouse broadcasting owned five television stations since then , advance has added the publishing giant random house inc and several magazines to its holdings and newhouse broadcasting has become the 11thlargest cable operator , with 12 million subscribers in a decision that capped seven weeks of hearings , judge john williams jr agreed with the 2356 million valuation for mr newhouse s holdings in the two companies on the basis that a buyer of that stake could not have resolved the uncertainties regarding the relative rights of the various classes of the advance stock judge williams said those uncertainities would have significantly reduced any price a buyer would have paid under the company s charter , numerous other family members were also shareholders in advance and newhouse broadcasting advance has several classes of stock including class a voting common stock , which had the right to elect the board class a and class b nonvoting common stock , which could vote on any merger and preferred stock , which had control of any liquidation all three classes of stock participated in dividends mr newhouse owned all the class a and b stock , which meant he had the right to elect the board other family members owned the preferred stock the dispute in the case of advance centered on the fair market value of mr newhouse s stake in the company the internal revenue service had argued that mr newhouse s stock should be valued as if all the individual magazines and newspapers could to be sold separately the irs put the value of advance at 12 billion and mr newhouse s holdings at about the same figure the newhouse family countered that the company was worth about 900 million and that mr newhouse s stock was worth just 176 million because the breakdown of stock ownership limited mr newhouse s ability to realize those values judge s decision in the end , the judge found that although mr newhouse controlled advance s board with his stock , there was substantial uncertainty as to whether he could keep all the proceeds from a sale of the company for himself thus , to equate the value of the company with the value of his stake was not realistic the government had argued that mrnewhouse might be able to freeze out the other shareholders in a sale on the key issue of evaluating advance s stock , judge williams accepted estimates prepared by goldman , sachs company the wall street investment house argued that the only real buyer for advance would be another media company and that none would have done so without eliminating the claims of the preferred shareholders to support that argument , the newhouse family obtained the testimony of rupert murdoch , whose news corporation owns newspapers and television stations mr murdoch said he would have found advance unattractive because of the stock structure and government restrictions on media ownership also testifying was the vice chairman of the gannett corporation , douglas mccorkindale , who said his company would have wanted to own not only the common stock but the preferred stock as well in the dispute over newhouse broadcasting , the two sides agreed on the total value of newhouse broadcasting at 206 million but the irs claimed that mr newhouse s stake was worth 91 million , while the estate claimed it was worth 596 million because mr newhouse , with 44 percent of the stock , held a minority position the judge agreed with the estate s valuation because the value of the block would be discounted for lack of control and marketability original irs demand initially , the internal revenue service had asked for 900 million in tax payments , which included a fraud penalty of about 300 million but several years ago , a court determined that there was no basis for such a claim the newhouses have already paid taxes of about 48 million on the taxable shares of the two companies and , as a result of this decision , do not have to make further payments the documents do give some insight into advance s financial situation a decade ago they state that in 1979 advance had operating income of 1599 million on retained earnings of 47596 million and they note that the company had a history of paying minimal dividends and instead reinvesting earnings to finance further acquisitions s i newhouse jr declined to comment on the decision yesterday but peter gould , a partner of sabin , berman gould , which represented the newhouses , said we are very pleased the decision sustained in all respects the position taken by the estate the irs said it was considering whether to appeal the decision photo a federal tax court judge rejected an irs claim on

magopa , south africa , aug 27 the bluegum trees are the same , and so is the wind that kneads them and some people are the same , too , seeking shade and shadow below the trees in the first stirrings of an african summer but in the six years since this place below a gentle ridge became a symbol of resistance to the policies known as forced removal , the village of magopa has come to stand for other things an accumulation of ironies , small triumphs and big setbacks that seem at odds with the national new south africa discussed by many in johannesburg and pretoria , 120 miles to the east on feb 14 , 1984 , trucks and bulldozers and the police came to magopa in the middle of the night and ordered the 280 families from the bakwena tribe , who had built schools and churches here , to go to a place of the government s ordering the reason was that while tribal ancestors had bought this spread of rocky land eight decades ago , their estate was now deemed to lie in an area set aside by law for white occupation and husbandry so the people of this black spot in white south africa were ordered to leave for a place called pachsdraai , on the boundaries of the nominally independent black homeland of bophuthatswana resolve and court orders in so doing they joined the 35 million other people ordered to move from one place to another over the last 30 years to complete the patchwork of apartheid but slowly , the people have returned here , armed with resolve and court orders , so that the grand design of racial separation has been reversed a little at a time yet , what they have returned to is loss before , the houses were of stone or brick , said joseph katitswe , 63 years old , a community leader stone was very strong and over there , we planted corn , sunflower , soya and wheat his brother , matthew , 50 , and others joined the lament we had cattle , goats , even horses , matthew said and today , we have got none , joseph katitswe said 200 crude shelters people began to return , he said , in september 1988 , empowered by a court order to tend the ancestral graves this was our plan , said joseph , who was one of the first to come back and erect a shack of zinc on the plot where his house of stone had once stood more and more people returned and did the same as he had done so that now , the land is freckled with more than 200 crude shelters amid the stone foundations and bulldozed walls of the old settlement but the people have not rebuilt stone homes or stone churches and the new school stands roofless until the status of the families here is resolved throughout last year , mr katitswe said , the authorities sought to evict those who had returned but we denied again to go out and , he said , more people came to land that had technically been expropriated by the government and was now leased out to white farmers to graze fat cattle a frustrated generation then , on aug 24 , a high court in bloemfontein came up with a new ruling that the people would be able to remain on the land until their dispute had been settled one way or the other in direct negotiations between the residents and the government between now and nov 20 the ruling has drawn a mingling of relief and doubt here this coming generation is just frustrated , said eddie motsio , 21 there is no school they do n't know what to do here but they do n't want to leave by long tradition , much of the wealth of magopa comes from those of the bakwena tribe who seek out work in the cites and return at week s end or month s end but people do not want to spend their money on building solid homes until they find out whether , this time , they will be able to stay in magopa and raise children here 'i am a transporter' the people will stay in shacks until there is a decision , joseph katitswe said some , he acknowledged , have not returned his sister , elizabeth , who used to keep the store here and owned an alfa romeo sedan and a tractor , has stayed on other tribal land in bophuthatswana , even though the authorities there will not grant her a trading licence others have more hopeful visions pule , for instance , a 24yearold man , has obtained from his father the deposit of 3 , 000 to buy on credit a 20 , 000 minibus and now rides the dirt road between here and the nearby white settlement of ventersdorp , charging the equivalent of 120 for the 20minute ride into town i am a transporter , he said when people come home at the end of the week or at the end of the month , he said , he sometimes makes the run in and out of town three or four times a day with 15 passengers cramming the minibus in both directions i want to make money and i will make money , he said come back in a year s time and you 'll see i have two buses on the line maybe more

a foam cushion believed to be responsible for 19 infant deaths in recent years is being recalled by manufacturers after pressure from the federal consumer product safety commission the pillowsize cushions , which are filled with foam pellets that allow the cushions to mold to a child s body , are believed to have caused the infants to suffocate seventeen of the deaths occurred in the last three years , government officials said yesterday the deaths all involved children 3 months old or younger who were sleeping on the cushions the cushion was specifically marketed for infants and was intended to be used by parents when feeding or holding infants this is the largest number of infant deaths in the shortest period of time from a new product , said alan schoem , the director of the division of administrative litigation at the product safety commission agreements with 9 concerns commission officials said they had reached agreements with 9 of the 10 manufacturers of the cushions to voluntarily recall the products these nine manufacturers represent about 87 percent of an estimated market of 950 , 000 cushions the lone holdout , patient comfort inc of carrollton , tex , said in a statement issued yesterday that it planned to meet with commission officials today to discuss a possible recall officials at the company , which produces a cushion called the comfort tote , did not return three telephone calls yesterday not all of the manufacturers' cushions have been associated with infant deaths doctors typically tell parents not to put newborns on or near pillows because babies are too weak to lift their heads and may smother although some of the cushions recalled yesterday carried warning labels advising parents not to leave children unattended on the pillows , none specifically warned that infants could suffocate , a commission official said industry officials have said that they believed the product labels were adequate and that the cushions were not at fault in the deaths warning issued in march in early march , the commission issued an unusual public alert warning that the cushions posed a suffocation threat to infants it was about that time that the commission also began talks with manufacturers aimed at producing a voluntary recall , said dan rumelt , a commission spokeman to force a recall , the commission must undertake timeconsuming legal procedures at the time the talks began , commission officials said they were aware of 10 deaths nine additional deaths , all of which occurred before the public alert , came to light as a result of subsequent publicity , commission officials said yesterday senator alfonse m d'amato , republican of new york , said he believed the commission s action was long overdue mr d'amato had earlier criticized the commission for not disclosing the pillow danger sooner the commission said it acted as soon as it could of the 19 known deaths , 8 occurred in texas and 2 in both oklahoma and florida the additional fatalities occurred in arkansas , california , hawaii , illinois , missouri , north carolina and virginia according to commission statistics , nine infant deaths , the largest number related to a single cushion , were associated with the mother s helper , produced by hollander home fashions of newark , nj the company also produced the greatest number of cushions , about 50 percent of the market , according to commission data as far as the deaths are concerned , we hope our product did n't contribute to it , said jeff hollander , a coowner fo the family business but we certainly do n't want it to contribute to any furture deaths in january , when hollander executives were contacted by commission officials and told about several deaths that were possibly related to their cushions , they agreed to stop producing and shipping them the company had already undertaken a recall of its products , commission officials said the cushions are often pillowsized with a slight contour most are covered with a quilted fabric that comes in different prints and filled with foam pellets that give the cushions a beanbag type feel the cushion costs 9 to 40 , depending on size and features shift of pellets blamed investigators for the safety commission believe the infant deaths were linked to the cushion s beanbag typeconstruction they theorized that an infant moving in its sleep would shift the cushion s pellets to one end , tilting the baby s torso upwards and thus placing pressure on its thoart some officials in the cushion industry have suggested that the deaths were caused by sudden infant death syndrome , a stoppage of breath for which the cause is not known along with the hollander home fashions , the other manufacturers who have agreed to recalls are gold inc of denver , which makes gold bug support sack pinky baby products of houston , which makes cozy cushion cozy baby products of mount vernon , ny , maker of cozy baby fourth little pig of san anselmo , calif , maker of baby minder , and baby sak of pembroke pines , fla , maker of baby sak at least two other manufacturers , developmental services of northwest kansas inc of hays , kan , maker of soft sak , and tailored baby inc , of san fernando , calif , maker of comfort cushion , have tentatively agreed to recalls , commission officials said commission officials said one manufacturer of the cushions is no longer in business photo cushions filled with foam pellets that allow the pillows to mold to a child s body , linked to the suffocation deaths of 19 infants , are being recalled david

to the sports editor dave anderson is greatly exercised by the alleged sexual harassment of lisa olson by five new england players \( the only issue is human decency , the times , sept 30 \) , but in his defense of his fellow sportswriter s presence in the patriots' locker room , he offers two analogies for the situation that wo n't withstand much scrutiny first , since nobody would think twice if a female doctor was in a locker room on business , people should not be bothered by the presence of a female reporter in a locker room on business but surely a physician s professional involvement with the human body can justify her presence among naked men in a way that has nothing to do with the work of journalists second , anderson finds the continued resentment by some athletes that women are allowed in their locker rooms comparable to racial slurs directed towards black baseball players years after jackie robinson s arrival in the major leagues this analogy suggests that the two initial exclusions were similar in significant ways in fact , the earlier exclusion of women from men s locker rooms was based on ideas about modesty , respect for privacy , and the dignity of the players , none of which could ever have been offered in defense of racism in baseball or any other sport mark taylor south nyack , ny drawing
jerusalem , oct 23 arabjewish violence grew today , leaving one man dead and at least eight wounded , and the government announced tonight that it was sealing off the west bank and gaza strip for several days , forbidding 18 million palestinians to enter israel the occupied territories have been closed before , on high jewish holy days and at other times when israel wanted to prevent possible trouble but never has the government forbidden palestinians to enter israel because it was unable to control spreading bloodshed by both arabs and jews as always , jewish settlers living in the occupied territories will not be affected by the enforcement measures taken against their palestinian neighbors the jews are free to come and go and they please waiting for calm as he announced the closing tonight , defense minister moshe arens said it would stay in effect until the tense situation calmed after a particularly violent day this evening , palestinians said , jewish civilians in a car opened fire on a car packed with palestinian workers returning to gaza from a day of work in israel the army confirmed that one man was killed and three were wounded and said it had turned the case over to the police palestinians said they assumed the jews had been seeking revenge for the knifing deaths of three israelis in jerusalem on sunday and the nonfatal stabbings of two other jews the next day the shootings this evening came after a west bank truck driver attacked two unarmed women who are soldiers as they tried to cross a highway near haifa this morning one of them was critically injured her lung was pierced the other , who was stabbed in the back , was slightly hurt other israelis standing nearby overwhelmed the truck driver and screamed at nearby soldiers to shoot him the soldiers refused later today , a palestinian from the gaza strip beat two jewish men in the head with a sledgehammer both were hospitalized with fractured skulls the police caught the attacker , and he said he had been seeking revenge incidents in three cities israelis stoned arab buses in at least three cities today , wounding one palestinian worker traveling home from tel aviv gun shop owners in jerusalem reported tonight that inquiries from israelis who wanted to purchase handguns had more than doubled in the last two days this steady spiral of violence began on sunday , when a palestinian from a small west bank village stabbed three jews to death in a quiet jerusalem neighborhood , apparently to avenge the shooting deaths of 21 palestinians at al aksa mosque two weeks ago those stabbings prompted the first closure order palestinians have been forbidden to enter jerusalem since then the stabbings also brought on the rash of similar attacks we are increasing security measures and security forces in all parts of the country , prime minister yitzhak shamir said this afternoon , adding that he thought the palestinian violence was a wave that has occurred as a result of hysterical , extraordinary incitement , and we have to fight against this prominent palestinians have shown little interest in discussing the violence , even when pressed but the underground leaders of the palestinian uprising have encouraged palestinians to kill more jews the secular underground leadership of the uprising , known as the intifada in arabic , encouraged palestinians to kill soldiers and police officers immediately after the al aksa killings on oct 8 leaflet supports killings then on monday , the islamic fundamentalist group hamas , which has a large following , particularly in gaza , issued a leaflet saying , we bless the hero who killed with his knife three soldiers from the enemy in jerusalem this is only the beginning actually , only one of the three was a soldier another was a policeman , and the third was a gardener carrying a box of flowers some israelis say the leaflets might be playing a role , but more of them seem to think that palestinians are just imitating what they see as a successful act , as they have in the past after a palestinian from gaza grabbed the steering wheel of a bus and steered it off a cliff last year , killing 13 jews , there was a rash of similar attempted attacks , none of them successful we are definitely prepared for more violence , mr arens said today citing another popular explanation , he added , we know saddam hussein s supporters and terrorist organizations want to prove that the intifada is alive , well and making progress photo muna abu sirhan , right , the wife of amer abu sirhan , accused of stabbing to death three jews in a jerusalem suburb last weekend , outside her home in abadiya in the occupied west bank the house has been sealed by israeli soldiers with her were her mother , left , and her motherinlaw \( rina castelnuovo for the new york times \) map of israel showing locations of west bank and gaza strip
yankee players and coaches reacted positively yesterday to the prospect of tom seaver being appointed the team s general manager there was no word , however , from management of any move to hire seaver , currently a wpix television announcer for the yankees neither seaver nor george steinbrenner , the yankees' owner , returned phone calls to their homes seeking comment , and pete peterson , the current general manager , reiterated that he knew nothing about the possible move seaver s a highly capable baseball man , said dave lapoint , a veteran yankee starting pitcher if he gets the job , that s great we 'll be looking forward to it praise from connors billy connors , the yankees' pitching coach , who was once seaver s teammate with the mets and considers himself a good friend , said he s a very qualified man i respect him very much and i know it would be a tremendous opportunity for him seaver s appointment could serve two purposes for george steinbrenner , the yankees' owner first , although hank steinbrenner is expected to win easy approval as his father s replacement as general partner at a meeting of the partners in cleveland wednesday , at least some partners have raised questions about his experience seaver s presence could bolster hank s chances with any reluctant partners , offering them assurance that a baseball man would be in the front office to help second , it would put a baseball celebrity in a position where he could deflect attention from hank while the younger steinbrenner eases into the role of general partner stump merrill , the yankees' manager , said he did not want to take part in the speculation we 'll cross the bridge when we get to it , he said i got other things to worry about than tom seaver at this point the man s a professional , but right now i'm worried about the new york yankees baseball club seaver , a 311game winner during his 20 seasons in the major leagues , has worked extensively on television but has no management experience in baseball steinbrenner has discussed the possibility of hiring seaver with the former pitcher , but seaver has declined to elaborate on what they said lapoint said seaver has helped yankee pitchers and feels his presence in upper management would be helpful in molding future yankee teams a couple of times a year i 'll come up to tommy and ask him some questions about pitching , he said i just hope if he becomes general manager , he does n't stop giving information some players and coaches were reluctant to discuss the situation it s none of my business , said steve sax , the yankees' second baseman darrell evans , the batting coach , had a waitandsee attitude there s nothing to comment on unless it happens , he said said jesse barfield i just faced seaver a couple of times late in his career i really do n't know what s going on buck showalter , the thirdbase coach , said , it would be tough for me to make any analysis on at this point
panama , feb 5 officials of the new panamanian government are resisting united states pressure to change the banking laws that historically made the country a haven for enormous illicit drug profits before gen manuel antonio noriega was removed from power the panamanians say the current laws and the new government are more than adequate to prevent such abuses american lawenforcement officials and legislators are concerned that the new government and the country s appetite for foreign investment will actually lead to even greater use of panamanian financial institutions to conceal illicit drug profits edgardo lasso valdes , the president of the panamanian banking association and one of the country s seven banking commissioners , said in an interview the only problem of money laundering in panama is the newspapers that mention that panama is a big moneylaundering center , to be honest , we do n't feel there is any problem but a senior state department official here , who asked not to be identified , said the existing laws are grossly inadequate to prevent money laundering , a process in which illegally earned profits are deposited in bank accounts or legitimate businesses , then withdrawn as clean money he said the united states was strongly urging panama to revise them a growing tension in interviews in recent days , local banking regulators , senior panamanian officials and united states officials demonstrated through their comments a growing tension between the two nations over the moneylaundering issue a fight appears likely in congress over a proposed 1 billion aid package for panama an extensive review of panamanian banking records and court documents shows that many senior leaders in the government , while never accused of money laundering , have had strong ties to corrupt banks several of the banks have been indicted for money laundering or been shut because of pressure from the united states the nation s new president , guillermo endara , has for years been a director of a panamanian bank used extensively by colombia s medellin drug traffickers guillermo \( billy \) ford , the second vice president and chairman of the banking commission , is a part owner of the dadeland bank of florida , which was named in a court case two years ago as a central financial institution for one of the biggest medellin launderers , gonzalo mora rogello cruz , the new attorney general , has been a director of the first interamericas bank , owned by gilberto rodriguez orejuela , one of the bosses of the cali drug gang in colombia there is no evidence that president endara , vice president ford , mr cruz or other current leaders were aware of or involved with the illegal operations carried out at the banks to which they have ties but officials of the drug enforcement administration and the justice department say the business connections and friendships make it difficult to believe that any real crackdown against money laundering is likely american lawenforcement officials said they had evidence that panamanian banks were used to launder money through the waning hours of the administration of general noriega , who is awaiting trial in miami on drug and moneylaundering charges and though most of general noriega s senior aides remain either fugitives or in jail , all the bankers with whom they are said to have dealt remain in key positions i'm very concerned about it , said senator john f kerry , democrat of massachusetts , who has held extensive hearings on money laundering and the use of panamanian banks this is the moment to do something but it now appears that not enough is being done long history of aiding money launderers panama s secrecy laws and tax breaks for foreign depositors , coupled with the country s proximity to cocaine production and trafficking in the andes , have long made banks here a kind of hidden tub for cleaning dirty money in a recent interview , president endara acknowledged that the success of panama s financial center in the 1970 s and 1980 s was a result of the latin american drug cartels increased pressure is now on the nation s banks , whose foreign deposits have fired rapid economic growth for two decades , to lure back more foreign investors , many of whom had left during the turmoil of recent months illegalities aid gnp the financial community represents as much as 15 percent of the panamanian economy , according to government figures last year , the gross national product was estimated at 176 billion , and virtually all economists agree that laundered drug money , arms sales and other illicit income have played a large role in the accumulation of that wealth the united states imposed economic sanctions on panama in 1988 in an attempt to halt money laundering as a result some banks were forced to freeze some deposits , and some banks failed until the sanctions , panamanian authorities would occasionally seize assets of suspected accounts but would generally not provide information to lawenforcement authorities
paris the two germanys have signed their treaty of unification , the last major act of the german democratic republic before it disappears into a single germany on oct 3 the question of its role in europe , indeed the role of nationstates in europe , becomes increasingly urgent as the countries to the east move on from the euphoria of freedom to the agony of transformation preoccupation with the persian gulf crisis has diverted attention from the critically decisive period ahead in europe it adds difficulties because it has always been harder for the common market to move in periods of economic dislocation such as the new oil shock will bring the whole timetable of europe s evolution has changed there will be a new allgerman government based on elections dec 2 , even before the european community \( absorbing east germany \) begins its major meetings on monetary and political union later that month in rome their results will determine whether there is a european germany or a german europe , as the federal republic s hansdietrich genscher puts it there are hints that bonn s pledge for a strong new push to integration is eroding with the temptation of a special role in the east there have been suspicions this would happen but so far chancellor helmut kohl , and mr genscher as well , have insisted they are resolved to anchor the new germany in a union with increasingly limited national sovereignties the issue is put in terms of priority for broadening or deepening the common market , that is , opening to a number of new members , or tightening rules to move nearer a united states of europe both cannot be done at once the more countries involved , the harder it will be to unify them eastern europe is clamoring for an early promise of inclusion because it sees it as the lifeline out of its doldrums so the debate can be veiled in the argument over sympathy for its plight versus the community s need to build its own house solidly first a meeting of aspen institute italia this week showed second thoughts about europe s direction , in favor of accommodating eastern wishes prime minister margaret thatcher , who hates the idea of integration , would have been delighted it sounded as though germany and italy were moving her way toward a loose , unconstraining community , or at least a twospeed europe allowing choice of how much national power to pool , leaving france a lonely federalizer this is a crossroads it s not just a matter of diplomatic haggling the founders' idea was to defang the nationalisms that had devastated europe by creating common institutions binding states together their success was based on mutual obligations despite concern about a fortress europe , america should continue to support that idea because it is in a confident , supranational europe that it can find its most effective partner germany will be the weightiest member whether the community is weak or strong , but the stronger the community , the less a future germany is likely to go its own way in the longer run , this is in the interest of eastern europe and the soviet union as well but they are understandably desperate about the immediate future and want close ties quickly , even if that would undermine the foundations of a sturdy europe there are better ways to meet their needs for a sense of attachment the new european bank for reconstruction and development is working on coordination of aid to the east , but it is n't doing anything so far to promote coordination among recipients none of them are asking for that , they are so eager to shed their old ties but destruction of the soviet bloc does n't mean they no longer need to trade with each other they will benefit from mutual exchanges just as western europe did their trouble is that up to now their exchanges have been distorted , aggravating inefficiencies , because of their system all recognize the advantage of achieving convertible currencies , but it is beyond their present capacity on jan 1 , the soviet union will charge eastern europe hard currency for gas and oil supplies , a devastating blow to them made all the worse by the sharp rise in prices brussels has proposed an eastern payments union , like the one sponsored by the us during western european reconstruction it is a good way to speed transition to open trading the stabilization fund the west would need to provide would cost less than convertibility support for each country separately and ease pressure on the community to sidetrack integration the us is hesitant but it should n't be it knows better than anybody about the value of union
to the editor sol steinmetz demonstrates that lexicographers can be unreliable as usage guides why it is n't ungrammatical to speak the president s english \( letter , aug 4 \) not only misleads the reader as to a disciplined use of lielay but also misrepresents what others say about it mr steinmetz writes , for example , that bergen evans and wilson follett have found no defense for the distinction between lie meaning rest and lay meaning put this suggests that they approve using lay for lie not so wilson follett what man does with his body is lie , lay , lain what he does with objects is lay , laid , laid he regrets the distinction , but is unequivocal in making it likewise bergen evans while acknowledging that mixups are so common that some grammarians believe they should be recognized as standard english , he also states that lay means cause to lie , and therefore implies both an object and an agent mr steinmetz s own dictionary , the random house , labels the definition lie for lay as nonstandard mr steinmetz is disingenuous when he adduces examples from a century or more ago to support his argument it should hardly be necessary to advise a lexicographer that usage changes and especially that care in usage has advanced in recent centuries the oxford english dictionary , most historical of dictionaries and doubtless the source of mr steinmetz s historical note , dubs the intransitive lay only dialectical or an illiterate substitute for lie we often excuse in oral expression what we condemn in written , which perhaps offers latitude for president truman s i did n't want anybody to lay down on the job , inelegant as it is but it offers none for president bush s a new world of freedom lays before us niel glixon tucson , ariz , aug 11 , 1990
prague , july 22 an american environmental cleanup company is cleaning up the ecological mess left by soviet military units after they withdrew from a base in northern czechoslvakia , and two others have concluded contracts for similar work at other installations that soviet troops are leaving referring to the soviets , bedrich moldan , environment minister of the czech republic , said in an interview they observe no rules they spill oil and chemicals everywhere , without any care they ca n't be educated they have a very big country , and the military do what they want the only way to teach them is to take a hammer and bang them on their heads , said the minister , a chemist , making clear that he was speaking metaphorically he said the hammer he and premier petr pithart of the czech region chose was to go to the united states in april and tell as many members of congress as possible that czechoslovakia needs american help for the cleanup of the approximately 150 military bases that the soviet union has occupied since 1968 full pullout by june under an agreement negotiated this year by the national government of president vaclav havel , the 73 , 500 soviet troops stationed here were to be withdrawn by next june about onethird are believed to have left already the two czech officials' trip was arranged by the masek group international of anchorage , headed by jan masek , a czechamerican , which brokered the contracts with the three american companies all are specialists in environmental cleanup they are veco international and martech , both with headquarters in anchorage , and ch2m hill of denver mr moldan said the damage caused by the soviet troops was an important , but not the most important , aspect of what he described as czechoslovakia s ecological catastrophe he said industrial pollution placed this country at the bottom or next to the bottom in europe , surpassed possibly only by east germany we have it all , said the minister , speaking in english water , air , forest , solid waste , lost butterfly species , malformations of babies the complete chamber of horrors all except pollution of the sea czechoslovakia is landlocked symbol of arrogance' despite the wider dimension of industrial pollution , mr moldan said ecological damage by soviet soldiers is a particular public issue because of the prominence of their presence in the czechoslovak mind it is a symbol of their arrogance and neglect , he said he said the worst damage , constituting a threat to drinking water in many towns , was created not at soviet camps and storage sites , which are small in area , but in the many large expanses of agricultural and forest land which the troops used for war games , artillery ranges and airfields mr moldan said waste dumps of unknown content , containing many kinds of toxic chemicals , had been found there is some suspicion of chemical weapons , even if we have always denied there ever were any here , he said at some airfields , layers of oil about a yard deep have been discovered beneath the surface , he said l tom mckee , an environmental engineer from veco , said , they seemed to have unlimited supplies of jet fuel , and mr moldan they simply do n't realize they do harm when they spill 1 , 000 liters of gas unexploded ammunition left the minister said that in some of the abandoned sites soviet soldiers had covered the dumps with a thin layer of soil , complicating the task of finding and cleaning the soil and ending seepage into ground water pollution also includes unexploded ammunition that has been left behind , he said at the frenstat base in northern moravia , martech has completed the cleanup of the surface and drainage systems and inserted bacteria to counteract pollutants into about onethird of affected soil soil washing is to begin next month the company reported to the ministry that townspeople had said their water had not been so clean since the base was constructed mr moldan said the soviet military , in response to czechoslovak complaints , had created a commission to study the issue if you 'd like to kill an idea , create a commission , he added nothing has been done physically the minister , author of several books on ecological issues , said the soldiers were not doing damage with bad intentions they are simply not able to change their habits , he said they do n't have the mental or technical capacity for that they simply do n't realize they do harm who will pay for cleanup \? he said a big problem was who would pay for the cleanup , whose cost francis j nosek of masek group estimated at 2 million a site mr moldan said some czechoslovak radicals demanded that the polluter must pay , while others felt , thank god they 're out and let s see what we can do ourselves the government will try to extract some money from the russians , he said on this point i'm very pessimistic we wo n't get a single ruble they ca n't give us cleaning equipment because they have none , and they ca n't clean up themselves mr moldan , as well as the american companies here , base greater hope on obtaining financing through american contributions to the countries of this region under the proposed support for eastern european democracy aid program now before congress map frenstat , czechoslovakia
baltimore for the first time in nearly two decades , steven muller is not the president of the johns hopkins university on july 1 william c richardson , a health policy expert who had been executive vice president and provost of pennsylvania state university , quietlytook over the job that mr muller , a political scientist , had held more than 18 years mr muller s admirers and critics alike agreed that the change came none too soon marc donohue , a chemical engineering professor , said mr muller had been wonderful for the university but would have been a better president if he had left a couple of years ago mr muller said in a recent interview that he had left hopkins generally in very good shape despite a dispute over the financing of the school of arts and sciences during his last few years in office schools of arts and sciences are chronically underfinanced , he said , adding that he had no regrets over his decision to bolster arts and sciences at hopkins by taking money from the university s wealthier divisions tranquillity sought many faculty members express hope that mr richardson , a lowkey man who seems as happy to listen as to talk , will usher in a period of tranquillity and consolidation after mr muller s era of furious building , growth and , finally , turmoil mr richardson , 49 years old , says he enjoys even the most commonplace aspects of higher education in a recent interview he described attending untold commencement ceremonies a day for penn state s various schools and colleges i leaned over to my wife at one point , he said , describing his reaction to a procession of graduates , and i told her , 'this is why i could never work for a big corporation' mr muller s presidency was the longest since that of johns hopkins s founding president , daniel coit gilman , who served for 25 years founded in 1876 as the nation s first research university on the german model , hopkins is small by american standards it enrolls fewer than 6 , 000 fulltime students , with roughly equal numbers of undergraduate and graduate students parttime students as well as students in two foreign centers in bologna , italy , and nanjing bring total enrollment to 13 , 600 sharing the wealth still , hopkins attracts more research with outside sponsors than any school in the country , according to national science foundation surveys about 300 million goes to the academic divisions , especially the schools of medicine and public health 400 million more goes to the applied physics laboratory , which the university operates for the federal government but relatively little research money about 25 million last year finds its way to the school of arts and sciences , which at hopkins , as at any university , is considered the heart and soul of the educational enterprise and it is the condition of that school that has been the primary source of distress at hopkins in the last few years the university s wealthier divisions have resisted giving up money to cover the school s budget deficits the real underlying issue was not the money , but giving up autonomy , said professor donohue , a member of the university s academic council autonomy is no small thing at johns hopkins , which mr richardson described as one of the most decentralized universities in the united states 'independent fiefdoms' james walker , chairman of the physics department and a member of the search committee that chose mr richardson , said hopkins sometimes seemed to be trying to outharvard harvard , which also demands that each division stand on its own at a university as wealthy as harvard , whose endowment exceeds 5 billion , decentralization might make sense , mr walker said at hopkins , with an endowment of just over 700 million , it does not , he said a university has got to see itself as an interacting entity , mr walker said , not a bunch of independent fiefdoms had hopkins seen itself that way , said lloyd armstrong , dean of the school of arts and sciences , much anguish could have been avoided we would have been much better off if we had had an administrative structure that would have let us adjust this quietly in some back room , mr armstrong said the school s deficits have ranged from 3 million to 5 million since 1987 instead , the efforts to lower the deficit became the subject of newspaper articles and gossip within the higher education industry that made hopkins vulnerable professors leave two of the classics department s four senior faculty members got attractive offers elsewhere and left after the financial crisis hit in 1987 this year , three of the five senior faculty members in the french department decided to move as a group to emory university in atlanta mr armstrong admits the budget troubles played a role in these resignations where the financial difficulties hit us in classics was not in causing the vacancies , he said , but they slowed us down in filling them mr armstrong now has the luxury of filling one of those slots as an endowed chair , for which financing was recently obtained the departures from the french department are another matter hopkins was unable to match the offers from emory because of our financial constraints , mr armstrong said but they were such lucrative offers , he added , i doubt that we would have tried to match them in any case reputation as a conciliator whether it would have or not , mr armstrong admits that it is extremely unfortunate to have abroad in the land the impression that johns hopkins is in financial straits he noted that the fierce autonomy of hopkins s divisions and the customary lack of conciliation drew attention to the budget debates that s where mr richardson comes in members of the johns hopkins search committee said they were drawn by his reputation as a conciliator , a reputation developed at penn state and earlier as vice provost at the university of washington in seattle where mr muller focused on expanding the university s geographic and intellectual breadth , mr richardson is focusing on its educational depth his top priority , he said , is to assure the quality and integrity of our students' education and to promote active learning in a researchrich environment that means insuring that faculty members teach as well as do research and that students , especially undergraduates , work alongside professors in conducting that research a second goal , he said , is to cultivate a new generation of collegelevel teachers by attracting bright undergraduates to the scholarly life he also hopes to promote globalization , encouraging every division to adopt an international outlook in curriculum and programs mr donohue , the chemical engineering professor , thinks hopkins is ready for strong direction from a new leader the university , he says , is in a state where it will be easy to mold to a new vision photo william c richardson , who took over as the president of johns hopkins

following are excerpts from a news conference by president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union and prime minister brian mulroney of canada in ottawa yesterday , and a transcript of statements by secretary of state james a baker 3d and mr gorbachev after the soviet president s arrival in washington all the remarks were recorded through the facilities of the cable news network mr gorbachev spoke through a translator in ottawa dealing with nationalism q i 'd like to ask , mr president , if you expressed , or you have any feelings of sympathy for prime minister mulroney , with facing somewhat similar problems to yours in his own country i mean accommodating rising nationalism and maybe i could ask both of you , particularly president gorbachev , but maybe prime minister mulroney at the same time how do you feel how difficult is it for you to accommodate rising nationalism within your own federations \? a indeed , this problem does exist , and on a philosophical and political plane , was analyzed by us and of course democratic processes are at the base of these developments and these changes of course give an impetus to a feeling of national pride and the national question as such moreover , there are quite a few problems in these relations this is a fact and we , in general , from this point of view , we find that it is a positive development where you talk about the rebirth of national honor , about culture , preservation of national identity i think this is a progressive movement , and this , of course , should be reflected in modern politics undoubtedly this is so but in connection with that , and perhaps because of that , or in spite of that , certain developments take place which are often negative in nature , because where there are elements of nationalism , and then it changes into some sort of super nationalism , and then it leads to separatism , this is what cannot but worry us still , i do believe , and i'm convinced , and our experience has shown that if we are not too late in our policy , and we can catch these impulses , and adequately reflect them in our structures , forms how to realize this national spirit and what is connected with the rebirth of nationalism i think with time this will be channeled into cultural , political channels lead to harmonization of relations i see no other thesis or approach which can replace what we are doing now what we insist upon we have to live together in good cooperation , but mainly so that a human being , no matter of what nationality , in any place of the country , and that s how it should be in the whole world , have the same rights , no matter where he be , and be protected by constitution , by the laws there can be no other approach , because where there are limitations , discrimination , immigrants because there immediately a negative situation arises that assumes a political , social , coloration we view the question of possible developments of national relations in our country , and we need revolutionary , fundamental , changes republics must have economic independence , their identity and broadest possible possibility to develop their culture , language , to preserve their traditions that s how we are going to act the germans and nato q german membership in nato were you able to bring your points of view closer together just a little bit or not \? thank you a you know , we have a general understanding that everything that pertains to internal affairs , pertaining to germany , this is up to the germans now we understand it and we will pay attention to it although the germans will have the problem too they have to get rid of euphoria and to get down to business because they 've got enough problems but let the germans resolve it if they ask us for advice , yes we 'll give it because our interests are kind of intertwined in the internal sphere but our topic as we discussed , we discussed the external issues connected with the unification of germany i must say that we discussed it thoroughly , very thoroughly personally i think that there are certain reserves available to find ways to bring our points of view closer together , a possible way of doing it that will not look like what the west is proposing because the west has n't done any thinking , much thinking they tried to dictate and this will not suit us now , as for the soviet union , we had one proposal , now we have two or three i presented them in moscow and some other approaches that deserve attention to be worked on however , let me stress the main thought and i ask the journalists to look at that we are living a new europe , changing europe , changing for the best as a result of these changes , instead of confrontation and divergence we are getting closer together we get to know each other better we even begin to trust each other and can make very important decisions i think the main thing is about the future from the sole point of view about germany , it must be a version which will help these positive processes that will strengthen and not the other way which will undermine this process , and our hopes are with it
yonkers karen hill has been struggling for more than a year here to find developers who will accept financial and zoning incentives in return for building the subsidized and marketrate housing called for in a 1986 federal desegregation court order now ms hill , the director of the yonkers fair housing office , has given the first indication that a long stalemate may be ending until last week , ms hill has said little publicly and nothing critically about her efforts , although colleagues say she labors under difficult working conditions the potential developers , some of them nationally known , are confused when they discover city officials renewing pledges to oppose the integrated housing certainly , having public officials in yonkers continuing to talk publicly about undoing various components of the housing remedy is not helpful , she said last week the judge in the yonkers case , leonard b sand of federal district court in manhattan , has asked participants in the case to meet with him on feb 2 to take a fresh look at the plan contracts near completion but in recent days , ms hill has suggested that some progress is near two of the halfdozen developers who she said have been seriously pursuing building contracts may complete arrangements before the feb 2 meeting , while extensive negotiations with albany officials over the use of state housing funds in the incentive packages may also prove fruitful possible movement in the pursuit of what is known as the longterm integrated housing comes against a background of continued opposition to the courtordered plan by the city s new mayor , henry spallone , and a majority of the sevenmember city council any agreement reached by the fair housing office would then need approval from the council mr spallone was bolstered in his antihousing stand two weeks ago when the united states supreme court overturned judge sand s 1988 action in levying contempt fines against four councilmen , including mr spallone , for defying a consent decree that the council had approved several months earlier further legal action weighed the court s 54 ruling did not deal with the issue of judicial power and legislative rights , however , and cast no doubt on judge sand s ruling that yonkers housing policy had led to illegal segregation mr spallone , nevertheless , has asked city manager neil j deluca to confer with the corporation counsel , j radley herold , to examine the options of further legal action in preventing construction of the integrated housing for the longterm housing , state financial assistance is being cited by experts as a crucial element in any contract drawn up by the fair housing office we are definitely depending on state support for the initial proposals , ms hill said , and others familiar with the negotiations have indicated that the incentive proposals would be incomplete without state financing the plan to build integrated housing in mainly white neighborhoods was proposed by judge sand as a remedy for his finding in 1985 that yonkers had been guilty of intentional discrimination in housing and schools over a period of nearly 40 years the case was begun in 1980 by the united states justice department in the last days of the carter administration later , the yonkers branch of the national association for the advancement of colored people joined as coplaintiff sand s twopart plan judge sand s plan has two parts the first is construction of 200 units of lowincome housing to be built in a twostory townhouse style on seven sites in east yonkers , the idea being to scatter the units in clusters of 14 to 48 a site and to conform to the architecture of the neighborhoods as much as possible the city has spent 17 million in site acquisition for the 200 units , but the funds for their construction are being provided by the federal department of housing and urban development as part of an agreement removing that federal agency as a plaintiff in the discrimination case the second part of the remedy order , known as the longterm housing , would have 800 low and moderateincome units built with 3 , 200 marketrate units apartments or homes in mixedincome developments they would be built on the 20to80 ratio by private developers who would provide their own land one source familiar with the negotiations said the developers have been telling ms hill that the cost of construction in yonkers is quite high , or at least higher than they expected , a complaint that could represent a true measure of the market or a position intended to exact better conditions such as the city providing the land that would be a bonus that elected officials would probably resist but one that judge sand could order into place ms hill has been authorized to offer potential developers incentives such as density bonuses , or permission to build more units per acre than is normally allowed , as well as tax abatements and zoning variances but these may not be enough , making the requested state financing a crucial addition yonkers is believed to have been seeking help from the variety of state housingsubsidy programs to offset the cost of the longterm housing ordered by the court the funds are available to any municipality in the state but are not often used because of the difficulties in creating packages like yonkers is offering one source of state aid is the new york state housing trust fund , which ms hill said provides loans and grants on a perunit basis to write down , or reduce , the cost of housing she said it would be the developers , rather than her office , that would apply for the funds , although we have been trying to work out the parameters for seeking approval the role of a state task force
auburn hills , mich , may 22 the best the chicago bulls could offer the detroit pistons tonight was a thirdperiod scare the rest of the way , there was too much piston defense , too much joe dumars and not enough michael jordan , and the pistons came away with a 10293 victory at the palace the victory , the pistons' 16th in their last 19 games against the bulls , dating to the 198889 season , provided them with a twogamestonone advantage in the eastern conference playoff finals the fourofsevengame series now shifts to chicago stadium for two games , saturday and monday afternoons we played two different halves , said chuck daly , the coach of the pistons , the defending national basketball association champions we played great and ran it up to 17 points in the first half jordan came out and played aggressively in the second half for them , plus they are a good defensive club , and they were able to turn things around 'nervous time' after playing an awful first half , failing to execute their plays , getting beat off the boards and turning the ball over 14 times as jordan scored only 7 points , the bulls righted themselves in the third quarter after being down by 5338 at halftime , the bulls ran their plays and made their shots , and finally took the lead at 6766 , on a 3point basket by craig hodges with 3 minutes 36 seconds remaining in the third the bulls executed so well as a team during this 2913 run that jordan scored only 8 points but a minute later , dumars , who had 31 points after scoring 27 in game 1 , gave his team back the lead for good with a 15foot jumper this is the time of year when everyone is keyed up and you yourself are keyed up , said dumars , who helped the pistons build their firsthalf lead and then kept them in the game in the third quarter , when he scored 11 points , despite being guarded by jordan once everything starts clicking , everything is easy you take better shots , you make more cuts to the basket , get to your spots and get your shots jordan is a great defender he anticipates everything you try to do if you can counter his move , you can beat him dumars made 12 of his 19 shots from the field tonight , and held jordan to 20 points on 5of16 shooting \( 31 percent \) subpar jordan jordan tonight was not the prolific scorer who fills arenas to capacity this was a beatup jordan , who was a step slow getting up the court and almost never soared to the basket these were clearly effects from a fall he took in the first quarter of the opener , when he suffered a deep bruise to his left buttock moreover , phil jackson , the chicago coach , revealed after the game tonight that jordan s right wrist was bothering him that injury apparently was also a result of the fall , jackson said jordan , almost always approachable after a game , was not tonight instead , refusing to talk , he headed for the bus that took the bulls to the airport horace grant , one of the bulls' starting forwards , who scored 9 of his 17 points in the thirdperiod comeback , explained jordan s refusal to talk in this way he did n't mention names , but he was so disappointed i ca n't blame him some guys do n't know what the playoffs are all about they have to get more physical and step up the pressure i 've never seen michael so upset the bulls missed 11 of their first 12 shots in the first half , and ended up shooting only 28 percent in the half , committing 7 turnovers it was n't a very good start , jackson said , but we had a good third quarter we played our type of game but in the end we played to their defense photo michael jordan of the bulls , right , was guarded by dennis rodman of the pistons last night in auburn hills , mich \( associated press \)
in greenwich , the hottest video is a place in the heart produced by the town , the video commemorates greenwich s 350th anniversary , celebrated this year two other connecticut towns , weston and wesport , have released videos in the last several years weston s production , the outlivers , celebrated its 200th anniversary in 1987 the wonderful world of westport marked its 150th in 1986 in each town , citizens organized and donated services and money to make a halfhour video to show what they believe is a very special place to live and the finished products are completely different the greenwich presentation is a coffeetable video , said judy onthank , president of svp communications in greenwich , which produced a place in the heart we tried to give a little feeling of history but not dwell on it we tiptoed through it the greenwich tape focuses on the essence of each of the town s six geographic communities each one has a definite characteristic , said mrs onthank 'meant to be funny' the weston video takes a lighter approach this is all as historically accurate as we could be , said nancy hammerslough , a publisher of archeological slides who wrote the film s script a lot of it is meant to be funny coating the pill historically , absolutely nothing happened in weston whatsoever the tape is called the outlivers 200 years in weston the term outlivers originally referred to the younger sons of fairfield landlowners and others who were forced to clear and farm the wildnerness at the western end of the long lots stretching from long island sound , mrs hammerslough said what began in the 17th century as a sort of ostracization has now become a point of pride weston s residents cherish their independence the actor christopher plummer , the program s narrator , proudly proclaims in the video we have power failures when no one else does we do n't necessarily know our neighbors we have no town water , sewers , garbage collection , industry , condominiums , sidewalks , franchises , supermarkets , automobile dealers , computer stores , street lights , community centers , movies in fact , almost none of the amenities of 20thcentury living most people want to keep it that way the weston outlivers made their costumes , researched and wrote their script , and even had music composed and performed by fred hellerman , a resident who was an original members of the folksinging group the weavers the weston video , made for 35 , 000 in 1988 , won an emmy for as a new york regional entry for its director , harvey bellen the wonderful world of westport was conceived and underwritten by james mcmanus , chief executive officer of marketing corporation of america , based in the town mr mcmanus commissioned jacoby storm productions inc , a westport production house headed by the husbandandwife team of frank jacoby and doris storm , to make the video we felt very strongly that the people of westport should tell the story , said ms storm there s not a single word of narration the script was developed from the interview material alvin ailey and joanne woodward westport and weston recruited local celebrities , who donated their talents to the videos mr plummer spent hours on the weston production , said mrs hammerslough everybody did , she said one of the stars is a man named james naughton he just got a tony for 'city of angels' frank converse and frances chaney , other actors who live weston , also worked on the production , she said in the westport video , wellknown residents like jim mckay , harry reasoner , alvin ailey and joanne woodward express their thoughts about the town , along with ambulance personnel , a police officer , a housewife , students and others neil sedaka and his daughter composed and performed the upbeat music for the video , which opens and closes with scenes of a man and woman in top hats and tails dancing in the streets , at compo beach , on a bridge and in other panoramic locations celebrity involvement is less conspicuous in the greenwich film the family of the actress glenn close longtime residents of the town donated film footage from the 1920s this depicted the harbor with large yachts and horses and fox hunts , said mrs onthank those who appear or speak include a longtime resident , beezie brownell , whose family founded greenwich hospital bernie yudain , a local columnist , and a bus driver who knows about places that give her town its flavor we rode the school bus on halloween , said mrs onthank we saw boat yards , oyster shacks and a local deli svp filmed boat races , concerts , the audubon center , a spaghetti dinner and a view from the tower of the second congregational church a treasure uncovered while searching for striking visuals for the history touched upon in the greenwich video , mrs onthank and her crew uncovered a works progress administration mural in an unlikely place we found a treasure in the local post office , behind the boxes , depicting the early settlers , she said we also found a portrait of the revolutionary war figure gen israel putnam in the attic of the dar headquarters in putnam s cottage mrs onthank estimated that the cost of the greenwich video would have run between 40 , 000 and 60 , 000 at her usual commercial rates , but she and her coproducer donated their services money was raised from local corporations for the production costs proceeds from the 1995 video go to the town to defray the cost of the 350th anniversary celebration when the video came out in midjune , one store had sold more than 20 copies within an hour many outlets are selling the tape , and mrs onthank said she keeps a supply in her car , just in case she runs into a potential customer in westport , the town s video was estimated to have cost over 100 , 000 also selling for 1995 , it can be purchased at town hall or at jacoby storm productions in westport we have personally sold hundreds to people for birthday presents , for kids away at school and people who moved away , said ms storm the film can be described as a celebration , an entertainment it s not full of nuts and bolts of what it costs to set up a business , or what the tax base is , she said a true weston outliver , mrs hammerslough , seated at the kitchen table in her converted barn , said there is nothing in this video about how affluent weston has gotten it was certainly not meant to get people to move here the outlivers is on sale at weston s town hall , also for 1995 photo judy onthank , president of svp communications in greenwich , on location with her video crew during taping company produced a place in the heart , focuses on each of the town s six geographic communities \( stephen castagneto for the new york times \)
washington , june 6 the senate agriculture committee approved legislation today to bar american chemical companies from exporting pesticides that are banned in the united states the committee then attached the legislation to the 1990 farm bill as an amendment , making it far more likely to be approved by the full senate when the farm policy measure comes up for a vote , probably this month a similar proposal to bar the export of dangerous pesticides is pending in the house the legislation approved today by voice vote is intended to halt trade worth 150 million to 300 million a year in americanmade pesticides that are prohibited here because they are too hazardous to health or too dangerous to the environment environmental groups that have been working on the proposal said today that 52 chemicals that have been banned by the environmental protection agency or withdrawn from use by manufacturers would be affected by the new law in addition , perhaps a dozen chemicals that have never been approved for use in this country but that have been approved by foreign nations , would also be barred from being exported a troubling global issue in recent years , the export of banned pesticides has been one of the most troubling international health issues , according to the world health organization hundreds of thousands of workers exposed to them in asia , africa and central and south america are sickened each year , and thousands more die , the health organization says the trade has also become an important farm and consumer issue in the united states foreign growers use the banned pesticides to raise fresh fruits and vegetables that are imported into the united states united states farmers consider the trade in banned pesticides unfair competition , since they are not able to buy the pesticides , which are often less expensive consumer groups are concerned about the residues of the unsafe chemicals on the rising level of imported food the food and drug administration and the department of agriculture have been criticized by congress for not doing enough to prevent food with unsafe levels of the banned pesticides from reaching food stores because the fda waves through virtually all imported foods without inspection , these chemicals often end up on america s dinner tables , said senator patrick j leahy , a vermont democrat who is chairman of the senate agriculture committee mr leahy , the original sponsor of the legislation , added foreign farmers are able to use 'made in the usa' chemicals that our farmers are not we effectively penalize united states farmers for using safe pesticides and obeying the law companies fear for profits some pesticide manufacturers opposed the bill because it could cost them hundreds of millions of dollars , eliminate perhaps 1 , 000 jobs and possibly result in the closing of several plants in memphis , for instance , passage of the measure would affect a velsicol chemical corporation plant that manufactures heptachlor and chlordane for the export market the two insecticides , among the most toxic ever produced , were banned for use in food in the united states in the 1970 s other manufacturers said they could support the provision to end the trade in banned pesticides we 've said all along that we agree with senator leahy that the issue of public confidence needs to be restored on the matter of products manufactured here that have been banned for use or severely restricted , said jay vroom , president of the national agricultural chemicals association , the industry s principal trade group in washington a 'circle of poison' the export of banned pesticides and the importing of food contaminated with residues of those chemicals was called the circle of poison by the journalists david weir and mark schapiro , who first wrote about the situation for mother jones magazine , a san franciscobased magazine , in 1979 although several pieces of legislation have been proposed in the past to break the circle , none has gained as much attention or has got as far in congress as mr leahy s proposal environmentalists today celebrated the vote in the agriculture committee this is the strongest piece of export legislation for pesticides in 12 years , said sandra marquardt , a pesticide specialist in washington for greenpeace , the international environmental organization a vote for this legislation is a vote for the consumer , the environment , the farmer and workers

jackson hole , wyo , aug 24 the federal reserve apparently decided at a policy meeting this week to make no changes in interest rates until the middle east crisis quieted down and a clearer picture emerged of its effect on the economy such a decision suggests that the federal reserve , for the time being , remains more concerned about controlling inflation than quickly trying to offset any potential recessionary effect of the middle east crisis perhaps more important , some officials said that if oil prices , after the crisis , were to settle at , say , 8 a barrel above their precrisis levels , or at about 26 a barrel , then the longterm effect on the economy would be minimal perhaps shaving onequarter or onehalf a percentage point off economic growth growth rate is weak the commerce department reported today that growth in the second quarter was at an anemic annual rate of 12 percent , after an alsoweak 17 percent in the first quarter that means the gross national product has grown at an annual rate of 15 percent so far this year page 31 the minutes of the closeddoor meeting in washington on tuesday will not be released for six weeks but some federal reserve officials , here for a conference , indicated in offtherecord conversations that a change in policy when no one knows what might happen in the middle east could inject new uncertainty into the jittery bond and stock markets annual twoday event the gathering here in grand teton national park , at a lodge deep in the mountains and woods , is an annual twoday event that brings together federal reserve officials and economists from universities and from wall street the aim is to socialize , to exchange views and to attend five hours of conference sessions each morning , leaving the afternoons free for whitewater rafting and hiking the conference sessions today and saturday center on controlling inflation in the soviet union and eastern europe a halfdozen central bank presidents and finance ministers from these countries traveled here to participate but the middle east was clearly a distraction for the federal reserve delegation , led by alan greenspan , the chairman there was much coffeebreak talk about the latest reports from wall street and the persian gulf and some fed officials suggested that as long as the crisis continued and future oil supplies were uncertain , there was nothing that the federal reserve could or should do it is fairly well accepted that monetary policy , reacting to supply shocks , is not appropriate , a federal reserve official said largely as a result of war fears and oilsupply disruptions , the dow jones industrial average has lost nearly 13 percent of its value since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 , and longterm bond yields have climbed more than half a percentage point regularly scheduled meeting the tuesday policy meeting in washington was one that is held every six weeks the presidents of the federal reserve s 12 regional banks gathered in the capital with mr greenspan and the five federal reserve governors to review the state of the economy and decide whether to use their power to lower interest rates , thus stimulating buying and investing , or push up rates and thus reduce the odds of a higher inflation rate the federal reserve has been slowly pushing down interest rates for nearly a year , out of concern that the economy was weakening the last drop came on july 13 although mr greenspan has not commented on the economy since iraq invaded kuwait , he maintained until then that while the economy was weak , the odds of a recession were low a day after the washington meeting this week , mr greenspan and two federal reserve governors , wayne d angell and edward w kelley jr , traveled to jackson hole and were joined by 6 of the 12 presidents of the federal reserve regional banks two unwelcome developments in informal interviews , several federal reserve officials said the iraq crisis had brought on two developments that the central bank had hoped to avoid one was a fall in the value of the dollar , a potentially inflationary development because it makes imports more expensive the other was the sharp rise in interest rates for longterm government bonds to offset any erosion in the value of bonds from future inflation the rise in bond rates reflected in part a concern on wall street that the middle east crisis might cause the federal reserve to reduce interest rates in an effort to avoid a recession in the wall street view , rather than warding off a recession , such action by the federal reserve might fuel inflation people perceive that the fed might be ready to cave in on interest rates , so the fed has to maintain them longer than it might otherwise have wanted to do , said jerry jordan , chief economist at first interstate bancorp in san francisco decisions not disclosed none of the five or six officials who discussed informally the middle east crisis and the american economy would disclose specific decisions made at the tuesday meeting but they said the nation would not know for a month or more what might happen in the middle east whether war would break out whether oil shipments would be further disrupted , or how high oil prices might rise in such an uncertain situation , the officials said , adjusting interest rate policy would be inappropriate but some said that if the price of crude oil was to stabilize at about 26 a barrel it fell in trading today to about 31 a barrel that would be a 25 billion to 50 billion tax on consumption economic growth would slow a bit , in this view , but not to the point of a national recession , which is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the gross national product
a headline on the front page of the new york times of june 13 said , a new road to learning teaching the whole child the report described the ways in which dr james p comer , a child psychiatrist at yale university , helps young children , most of them poor and black , triumph over their environment key are public schools that attend not only to children s minds but also to their social , psychological and physical needs but the writer of the headline describing the article also , perhaps unwittingly , offered the latest indication that john dewey is returning to the education scene after years in intellectual and political exile it was dewey who , around the turn of the century , first at the university of chicago and , after 1905 , at columbia university , pioneered the theory of the whole child he wanted the school to be a genuine form of active community life , instead of a place apart in which to learn lessons like dr comer , dewey knew that society was changing he did not necessarily like the changes he preferred the pioneering and farming days when the household had been the center of the child s world but , dewey said , it is useless to bemoan the departure of the good old days of children s modesty , reverence and implicit obedience , if we expect merely by bemoaning and exhortation to bring them back if the conditions of life have changed , then the educational response must also change , he wrote school reform to him did not mean an occasional updating of obsolescent practices it meant continual change not just to adjust to society , but also to improve it to his conservative opponents , that sounded revolutionary , even dangerous dewey fell into disgrace , partly because some of his disciples misinterpreted his childcentered philosophy as a license to abandon academic standards , but in larger measure because educational traditionalists and political reactionaries misread his approach as permissiveness they saw red in political terms when told to think of schools as democracies in which children had rights dewey s progressive education seemed to many to subvert traditional values the term progressive was interpreted as meaning communist school administrators who espoused progressive education were exposed and , unless they disowned dewey , dismissed paradoxically , dewey suffered a similar fate in the soviet union soviet school reformers used his ideas in the early years of the bolshevik revolution but he was denounced under stalin s repressive regime when i asked the librarian at leningrad university in 1967 to show me dewey s entries in the card file , there were none they had been purged as subversive in the united states , both the red scare and the conservative gettough education movement of the 1950 s turned opinion against him why the return to his whole child idea now , i asked lawrence a cremin , former president of teachers college at columbia university and president of the spencer foundation , which specializes in behavioralscience research mr cremin , whose threevolume history of american education won a pulitzer prize , also wrote the transformation of the school , a history of progressive education it received the bancroft prize in history in 1961 mr cremin is now working on a dewey biography the return to dewey , mr cremin said , may be partly a response to the fundamental changes that education and society are facing , changes similar to those of dewey s era once again , mr cremin said , the difficulties of educating everyone are being recognized and confronted , making the solutions dewey proposed relevant once again but it is relevance with a difference the 1960 s reformers , mr cremin said , faced school reforms without any sense of the history of past problems now , reformers are again looking at large groups of children whom the schools find hard to educate and using dewey not as a bible , but as a point of departure , he said much new material will be available if the dewey revival takes hold dr jo ann boydston is working on the last three of 37 volumes of the philosopher s complete works at the center for john dewey studies at southern illinois university and there is mr cremin s biography worldwide , the fascination with dewey has never waned he is viewed as one of the few homegrown american philosophers , steeped in this country s pragmatism , with a stubborn faith in the perfectability of grassroots democracy once dewey pointed to a traditional desk and told an equipment salesman we want something at which the children may work these are all for listening like dewey , today s reformers complain that children must do too much listening , while teachers do too much talking once again , mr cremin said , there is a return to fundamental issues like how to provide for the whole child s needs in dewey s terms , the curiosity the child brings to school is uninvested capital to be invested in the child s growth

in moscow less than a week ago , eduard shevardnadze made a brave suggestion , rooted in history and of great political hope the soviet foreign minister said the drive toward german unification , which suddenly has become the most powerful diplomatic blitzkrieg in modern history , brought concern about the revival of sinister shadows of the past to face the shadows , he suggested that european nations , the united states and canada put unification to a referendum or at least hold debate in their legislatures mr shevardnadze s purpose was what reason and morality demanded slow down the mad rush toward unification slow it enough so that some attention be given to trying to make sure the hideous past never becomes the hideous present at least a pause for frank international discussion would honor the memory of the millions slaughtered by the previous unified german nation the very same day , however , chancellor helmut kohl of west germany gave mr shevardnadze a resounding crack across the political ear he told him german unity was a german question mikhail gorbachev swiftly decided that , these days , mr kohl has more clout than any soviet foreign minister so in ottawa this week , the soviet union meekly joined the united states , britain and france in agreeing with the germans to a rapid schedule for unification no more sour notes about world debate or a referendum were heard in the unification chorus mr shevardnadze s proposal had the shelf life of an eye blink so did the hopefulness his candor aroused in romanticists like myself , who believed that one of the governments of the four wartime allies would have the courage or desire to examine in public the full portent of creating a fifth , and probably greater , power out of their former enemy with the west and moscow now in fullthroated hallelujah to swift unification , is there any use for anybody to keep singing sour notes \? any point in continuing to insist that before and after unification the german past must still be discussed openly and fully in planning the german future \? yes , yes , yes for one thing we do not even know exactly what people and attitudes are being unified we know a great deal about west germany we know about strong statements against nazism made by mr kohl and other west german leaders we know of 40 years of recognition by west germany of german national responsibility for the horrors of nazism but we also know some disturbing things , like the resentment with which so many west germans and west german publications react to discussion of the history of german nazism how long are you people going to bring that up \? and new germany will include 16 million east germans what do we really know of the attitudes of a people so long ruled by a communist government that insisted it had no responsibility for the nazi past \? a few days ago the east german government did announce that it recognized the responsibility of the entire german nation for the past a few days ago , 45 years after world war ii but before leaping into a fandango at this awakening , we might at least try to determine the effect of 40 years of arrogant stonewalling what was its impact on the education , thinking and attitudes of east germans \? is n't it just a bit risky to make east germany a part of political western europe without any discussion about that \? but the most important reason to sing out of tune is this enough screeching might arouse thoughtful germans to do themselves what the great powers have neither the courage nor interest to do such as mandating specific machinery in the new german government empowered to combat signs of resurgent racism or political irredentism in politics , journalism , education or any other part of german society such as an international body created and encouraged by germans to poke around the country , looking for those signs and shouting unpleasantly when discovering them such as regular meetings in the new germany among germans , victims and former enemies , to discuss such currently unfashionable topics as nazis and the holocaust such as any better ideas the germans come up with none of these suggestions will be guarantees the four great powers surrendered the very idea in advance , without discussion but until shadows vanish , they are better than docilely singing in tune or keeping your mouth shut altogether
washington , sept 5 'we will review our options' president bush told 30 members of congress during a closed white house meeting that if the sanctions do not work , we will review our options , his spokesman said the comment seemed to convey a threat to turn to the use of offensive military force against iraq but administration officials said mr bush was seeking to address congressional concerns about goods being shipped to and from iraq despite the embargo they said the options he had in mind focused on ways to plug those gaps in the persian gulf today , the defense department announced that the navy had released an iraqi cargo ship that the crew of an american guidedmissile frigate boarded and seized on tuesday it was the first iraqi vessel seized by american forces imposing the blockade soviet suggestion rejected it was not clear why the ship , the zanoobia , was released but the pentagon said the navy was watching the vessel until its ultimate destination has been determined the state department said tonight that it was checking unconfirmed reports that an american citizen had been shot and wounded in kuwait city the department said in a written statement that it had checked with hospitals in the kuwaiti capital and that none said they had any knowledge of the man the department declined to release the man s name , but said it had spoken with his family administration officials said they had no way of determining the truth of the report , which they had received earlier today the source of the report was not known as the sunday meeting with president mikhail s gorbachev approached , the white house went out of its way to praise overall soviet actions during the gulf crisis but it responded coolly to foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze s call on tuesday for an international conference on the middle east and brushed off any suggestion that the helsinki talks could produce a mediator s role for mr gorbachev in the persian gulf mr bush s meeting in the white house was with members of house and senate delegations who had recently returned from visits to saudi arabia , where they inspected american forces who are deployed in the desert in an avowed effort to deter an expansion of the iraqi occupation of kuwait some gaps in embargo marlin fitzwater , mr bush s spokesman , quoted mr bush as telling the lawmakers that his principal weapon against president hussein was the economic embargo of iraq he quoted mr bush as saying we must keep pressure on iraq and convince saddam hussein that time is against him the sanctions must succeed if not , we will review our options mr fitzwater declined to elaborate on the president s remarks but another administration official , who insisted on not being identified , said mr bush was not hinting at offensive military force , but was responding to concerns expressed by some congressmen that there were gaps in the embargo , including air shipments of food and other supplies into iraq what he was saying was that in terms of how we can strengthen the application of the sanctions , there are all kinds of options , the official said we can undertake stricter enforcement measures we can hit the countries that are violating the actions by trying to impose penalties those could involve denying landing rights to their aircraft or bringing the violators into the public eye by naming them , which we 've avoided doing so far the question of how long it would take for the economic sanctions against iraq to take effect , and beyond that how long american forces would remain in the middle east , took the fore today , one day after congress returned to work and lawmakers came home from trips to the middle east crippling effect on iraq during his testimony today mr baker declined to answer repeated questions about both issues instead , he appealed to the public to stand behind mr bush mr baker said the administration was very optimistic that economic sacntions can begin to have some real bite rather soon but a government analyst , who insisted on not being identified , suggested that it would be a long time before the embargo has the kind of crippling effect on the iraqi economy that the administration is seeking short of a conflict breaking out , i do n't see a quick end game , the analyst said we 're talking about months , maybe stretching into a year or more , for the sanctions to have an impact public support for bush s plan the analyst said most of the focus around the world had been on the bans on food imports and oil exports , but noted that iraq imports threequarters of its manufactured goods and 20 percent of its labor force still , he said does everything shut down at once \? no they 'll make arrangements the question of public support during a protracted struggle has been of major concern to policymakers since the gulf operation began , officials said to keep that support going , mr bush has given three speeches on the issue so far and nine news conferences the white house announced today that he will address a joint meeting of congress on tuesday at 9 pm , eastern time representative richard a gephardt , the house majority leader , said he also believed that public support would continue airblockade proposal
jerusalem , march 18 as israel struggles to form a new government over a period that could last weeks or months , prime minister yitzhak shamir will be a very busy man not only must he run his office , confront serious challanges to his role as leader of the likud party and work to form the next government , mr shamir also has to fill some additional chairs he is not just israel s interim prime minister when the cabinet met this morning , he was also defense minister and finance minister in addition , mr shamir now heads the ministries of communications , police , education , health , energy , environment , agriculture and science all these positions had been held by members of the labor party but mr shamir dismissed the labor party leader , shimon peres , from the cabinet on tuesday , knowing that the move would prompt all the other labor ministers to resign intended as a ploy it was a deliberate tactic to insure that the labor party would not be a member of the transitional government that began life on thursday night , when parliament voted no confidence in mr shamir his tactic suceeded likud and a few small parties now have the cabinet to themselves but with the political gain came what could turn out to be a grave practical cost that no one seemed to anticipate , so preoccupied were the nation s leaders with the political wars under the law , during the transition period mr shamir cannot appoint anyone to fill the vacant posts , and none of the remaining ministers may resign today , officials were beginning to assess the cost if the transition period is just for a few weeks , then it s possible no real damage will be done , avi pazner , a close aide to mr shamir , said today but in the past , we 've had transition governments that have gone on as long as 10 months and with all the problems we have to deal with now , that would be unbearable presidential consultations president chaim herzog today began the process of consulting with the major political parties to determine which one he would ask to form a new cabinet as leaders of labor and likud filed into the president s office , they passed a small band of protesters calling for a change in the nation s electoral system to prevent situations like the one israel finds itself in now it seemed likely that mr herzog would give the labor party the first opportunity , but even a labor party official did not believe it likely that labor could conclude the process quickly i think our chances are fairly good , the official said but it would be wrong to tell you that that everything is done , everything is set and we have a new government in our pocket complicating matters , rabbi yitzhak peretz , the immigration and absorption minister , resigned as leader of the shas party today shas which stands for the sephardic torah guardians is the small rigorously orthodox party that brought the government down on thursday night when five of its six members abstained from voting on the noconfidence motion , giving mr peres his 6055 victory rabbi is pessimistic rabbi peretz was the only shas minister to vote , and he cast his ballot in favor of likud today he criticized the others in the party for a wrong move for which shas will have to pay a heavy price his resignation was intended to force the party to join a likudled coalition government mr peres had been counting on shas to join a government led by him but tonight , without explaining why they had changed their mind , shas leaders recommended that the next government be led by likud , even though the party s spiritual mentor , rabbi ovadia yosef , made a scathing attack on mr shamir tonight for blocking movement in the mideast peace process among the urgent problems facing israel while all this is going on is the mass immigration of soviet jews who are arriving here at the rate of more than 1 , 000 a week the finance ministry has responsibility for the job of resettling these people we can go along for now if no new problems come up , a senior immigration official said today but this situation is not static , and if new needs come up and we have to act quickly , it could be a serious problem military and health concerns the palestinian uprising in the occupied territories goes on as well , and other military issues come up every day the defense minister s post is vacant , too no one is sitting in the health minister s chair while the nation s health care system is faced with repeated strikes by doctors , technicians and leaders of the large national healthinsurance conglomerate and then there is the matter of unemployment at the cabinet meeting this morning , labor minister roni milo complained that unemploymzent should be of no less concern than the issue that brought the government down , whether israel should move toward peace talks with palestinians the rate of unemployment has risen to almost 10 percent mr milo assumed the labor minister s post only about two weeks ago for six months before that , during the worst unemployment crisis in the nation s recent history , the labor minister s chair was empty because the religiousparty leader who had filled it had resigned civil servants in charge rabbi moshe feldman , leader of the agudat israel party , said he was upset that mr shamir had not kept his promises to increase funds for religious institutions and pass strong laws on religious observance as it stands now , senior civil service officers are trying to direct each of the agencies that have no ministers but none of them has the authority to make policy decisions the entire ministerial responsibility rests with yitzhak shamir , mr pazner said and that s not good photo prime minister yitzhak shamir \( the new york times \)
they met for five hours and could report agreement only on a labormanagement committee that will meet three times a year and discuss labor relations issues that s after they have a new collectivebargaining agreement the problem is that the new agreement is n't coming so quickly negotiators for baseball s club owners and players failed yesterday to budge each other on the major issue the owners' revenuesharing proposal , which is leading the two sides toward a spring training lockout there were no breakthroughs no particular progress was made , donald fehr , the players' union chief , said we replowed a lot of old ground they also returned to an old negotiating site the doral inn in manhattan the scene of the laborious talks that led to and through a 50day players' strike in 1981 the owners' negotiators have set this friday as a deadline for some type of agreement if none is achieved in the next two days of bargaining , the player relations committee is prepared to tell the owners at a meeting in chicago friday that spring camps will not open as scheduled feb 16 the thing about deadlines , whether you like them or not , charles o'connor , the prc s general counsel , said , is they do put pressure on everybody in that room and in that sense inject a sense of urgency the players , however , do not seem to reflect that urgency because they feel that the owners have imposed an unnecessary deadline when o'connor was asked after yesterday s session to characterize the state of the talks , he said , we 're working as hard as we can we 're dancing as fast as we can to which fehr remarked , he s the guy who set the limit on the number of rounds some people in baseball have speculated that the owners may decide friday to open camps as scheduled , then lock out the players later in spring training if no agreement is reached anything is possible , o'connor said when that matter was raised i do n't think it s probable i'm working on the assumption that the clubs reached a fairly conscious decision in looking at the past history of when baseball has been interrupted as a result of labor stoppages and decided that we might as well settle these issues before the regular season starts the owners , at a meeting in new york last july , endorsed the prc bargaining approach , o'connor said that approach , he added , included the revenuesharing proposal and a lockout if no sort of agreement was reached by the scheduled start of spring training the two sides have done a better job of working toward agreement on minor issues than the major stumbling block in the first half of yesterday s meeting , they agreed to establish a formal committee of general managers , owners and players to discuss matters that arise during the year the disclosure that the negotiators spent two and a half hours on issues they consider minor prompted questions from reporters about their priorities minor matters often are left to the final moments of negotiations , after the major issues are resolved we 're trying to get as much of the nonsalary issues out of the way as possible , o'connor said asked the same question , fehr said you do it because you have to do it you have to get rid of them o'connor was asked why the negotiators did n't spend all of their time on the major issue of revenue sharing sometimes , he replied , you beat it to death it s good to have other issues to get to you solve a minor issue , you get a little momentum , then you say let s go back and tackle the major issues o'connor said the two sides would discuss revenue sharing at their session today boone agrees to contract bob boone , who is approaching his 18th major league season , agreed yesterday to the biggest salary he has ever had boone and the kansas city royals averted a salary arbitration hearing by negotiating a 19 million salary vince coleman of st louis accepted 1 , 012 , 500 three other players awaiting arbitration agreed to multiyear contracts rob thompson of san francisco three years for 43 million , danny darwin of houston two years for 29 million and mitch webster of cleveland two years for 135 million wally joyner and the california angels argued their salary differences in los angeles and await a decision
several members of congress propose creating a nonpartisan commission to dig out the full story of the savings and loan scandal they make it sound like a serious attempt to rise above politics it smells more like a refuge for politicians special commissions can serve useful purposes the rogers commission on the challenger shuttle explosion in 1986 , for example , conducted a highly professional , technical investigation into a subject of widest interest the warren commission , headed by a chief justice with impeccable credentials , helped calm the nation after the assassination of president kennedy the greenspan commission on social security reform brokered a deal between warring democrats and republicans in 1983 that arguably saved the system but none of those special needs exist in the s l scandal the public is certainly entitled to the complete truth about what and who caused this historic bust and it would be useful to pull all the facts together in one place but the proposed commission would also be authorized to secondguess the administration s current efforts to untangle the mess , adding yet another layer to an already topheavy structure of administrators and investigators it would also be useful to uncover all the meddling and conniving by key members of congress and the reagan administration but many of those players are gone from washington already it seems much more likely that a commission would only provide cover for sitting politicians who are embarrassed by their negligence , if not complicity representatives and senators could duck the issue during this fall s reelection campaign by saying we 've appointed a commission when it came time for the commission to report , how boldly would it confront the roles that congress and the administration played \? and would its charter permit comment on the political system that elects and appoints irresponsible officials \? a recommendation to curb political contributions would be welcome from any quarter , but that s not the kind of advice congress is looking for the causes of the savings and loan scandal are no mystery high interest rates , careless deregulation , lax and possibly corrupt federal supervision and , in the industry , incompetence , greed and outright looting who needs a commission to confirm that \? only politicians who want to appear to be doing something
washington , jan 28 many of the leading figures of the nation s operatic establishment converged on the capital during the weekend to attend the 20th annual opera america conference , billed as a forum on the future of opera in the time not spent grandly charting new courses , the conferees had an opportunity to contemplate the present as well , in the three productions of the washington opera s winter season at the kennedy center s 1 , 142seat eisenhower theater nicolai s merry wives of windsor , massenet s werther and argento s aspern papers specifically , the visitors were able to hear a remarkably broad crosssection of singers who have not yet achieved great prominence , mostly young and almost all american , in substantial roles the women tended to make by far the stronger impressions one in particular , the soprano sheryl woods as mistress ford in merry wives , proved an absolute delight , as much for her acting as for her pleasing vocal tone and easy command of fioritura among a company of middling and promising performers , she was the only certifiable star weakest , alas , were the tenors , a perennial problem nowadays \( and if the conferees solve that one for the future , it will indeed be news \) 'werther' predictably , the loss was most acute in the lyrictenor vehicle werther , heard this afternoon the production , new this season , is most attractive directed by roman terleckyj , with scenery and costumes by zack brown , it departs from convention only slightly , paralleling the opera s course psychologically from verdant summer to bleak winter with a sort of voyage into abstraction still , a werther without a great tenor loses much mark thomsen gave an honest and honorable account of the role of the fatally hypersensitive poet , both vocally and dramatically \( the latter is no small consideration as vividly as one recalls the plangency of franco corelli s voice in the role , one also recalls his stickfigure acting \) but even in this relatively intimate auditorium , mr thomsen s voice seemed constricted and lacked the ring needed to bring the big moments to vibrant life as a result of this and of an excellent performance by the mezzosoprano deidra palmour , charlotte , the poet s beloved , came to seem the focal point of the opera ms palmour was especially affecting in her extended thirdact scene , with the soprano sunny joy langton as her sister sophie even when the stage direction had her singing into her sister s shoulder or a piece of furniture , she emitted a rich , secure tone ms langton , though not particularly striking earlier , seemed a worthy partner here 'the aspern papers' less crucially , the aspern papers , seen on saturday evening , also had tenor problems moreover it , too , seemed to undergo a shift in the relative importance of characters from the work s original 1988 mounting in dallas \( at least as that production appeared in pbs s televised version \) , though for different reasons dominick argento s opera considerably alters the henry james novella on which it is based it turns the title poet into a composer and , more important , changes him from a third person only historically alluded to into a dramatic persona through a series of flashbacks this sets up a delicate equilibrium to begin with between past and present , and that balance is susceptible to numerous changes of emphasis among the characters , one of whom appears in both temporal schemes the washington production came by way of dallas , with john conklin s scenery and costumes , but leon major replaced mark lamos as director , and most of the singers were new the mezzosoprano katherine ciesinski , who appeared in the dallas production in a lesser part , here took the lead role of tina , which mr argento conceived for frederica von stade tina is the unmarried niece of juliana , the character who appears in both past \( as an opera singer and the composer s mistress \) and present \( as the selfappointed conservator of aspern s papers , including the score of his operatic masterpiece , written for her \) in the pbs production , ms von stade dominated , though partnered by the formidable soprano elisabeth soderstrom , whose vocal estate made her more believable as the old woman than as the young diva here things were reversed displaying neither the tonal allure nor the sturdiness of pitch of ms von stade , ms ciesinski gave another honest and honorable characterization but her tina was overshadowed by the juliana , pamela south and it was a very different juliana , in no way deficient as the old woman but clearly in her element as the young soprano , a shift that gave the flashbacks greater dramatic weight the tenor david kuebler sang aspern with a somewhat cloudy tone that occasionally rose to a stentorian ring but the composer is not the opera s principal male role in any case more important is the ladies' lodger , an unscrupulous aspern scholar intent on bringing the papers to light laying perhaps tooobvious stress on the complex character s sleazier aspects , the baritone robert orth was adequate on the whole the work was much more enjoyable than the televised version had led one to expect , showing greater coherence musically and a better ratio of drama to melodrama this may of course reflect more on the quality of the video production than on that of the original staging 'the merry wives' the merry wives of windsor , a new production seen this evening at its final performance , afforded the most consistent musical pleasure in addition to several fine vocal performances , the company s rather sorry orchestra rose to mediocrity and sometimes more some of the polish may have resulted from the numerous prior performances , but it probably also stemmed from the conductor , fabio mechetti , seemingly the best of the lot leon major again directed , with a generally light and respectful touch , only occasionally drifting toward camp bob shaw designed the scenery , making clever use of painted flats with various hidden doors and windows , and a few props suzanne mess supplied attractive costumes none of the singers quite rose to the extraordinary level of ms woods s performance , but the bass kenneth cox s sir john falstaff , resonant and agile , made a strong foil the soprano beverly hoch turned in a rather lackluster account of anne page that provided little base of expectation for the vocal acrobatics she eventually delivered as mistress page , the mezzosoprano kathryn cowdrick seemed a little unsteady at the start \( for that matter , so did ms woods , if only for a note or two \) , but grew stronger as the evening progressed merry wives was sung in an english translation by joseph blatt werther was sung in french with english supertitles and aspern in english with redundant supertitles werther will run through thursday and the aspern papers through next sunday ,

moscow , march 13 president mikhail s gorbachev today rejected lithuania s declaration of independence , calling the decision illegitimate and invalid , and he ruled out negotiations with the three baltic republics on their quest for sovereign statehood but representatives from the baltic republics said that while mr gorbachev was taking a hard public line , he had already begun private discussions with them about the nature of their republics' future relations with moscow mr gorbachev s dual posture may well be an attempt to appease conservative deputies , and put off action on the baltic question , while the congress of people s deputies was concluding crucial parliamentary deliberations on the legislation creating a powerful new executive presidency 'no question of talks' lithuanians , along with representatives of latvia and estonia , have asked to hold talks , mr gorbachev said at the start of the second day of the congress s deliberations there can be no question of talks we hold talks only with foreign states despite mr gorbachev s seemingly categorical condemnation of the lithuanian decision and his public rejection of requests from the baltic states for talks on independence , deputies from estonia said their parliament would also make a formal break with the soviet union on thursday estonian deputies said mr gorbachev struck a deal during the congress , promising them immediate negotiations on issues related to their sovereignty in exchange for their votes today in the debate on the presidency many of the baltic deputies had announced that they would refrain from voting at the congress on the ground that they had no right to revise the soviet governmental structure as they were busily attempting to withdraw from it deals for talks asserted so now today we behaved nicely and to some extent participated in the proceedings , said endel lippmaa , an estonian deputy and for this , we are guaranteed the beginnings of the negotiations for the national independence of lithuania and estonia lithuania became the first soviet republic to declare its independence from moscow when its parliament voted unanimously on sunday to restore the independent statehood the country enjoyed before it was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 the decision could not have come as a surprise to mr gorbachev , since lithuania had been steadily and openly pursuing the course leading to sunday s vote but mr gorbachev may well have been annoyed that the lithuanians forced the issue just a day before the opening of the special congressional session , called to consider his proposal for a revitalized soviet presidency free of politburo constraints public vs private gorbachev compounding the potential of mr gorbachev s discomfort over the issue was the decision of the lithuanian parliament not to elect as its president algirdas brazauskas , the republic s communist party leader , with whom mr gorbachev had created a respectfully adversarial relationship during conversations about lithuania s desire for independence instead the lithuanian parliament overwhelmingly chose vytautas landsbergis , head of the grassroots sajudis movement mr brazauskas , who is planning a return to the lithuanian political stage , met today with mr gorbachev and although he gave no details of the meeting , he told reporters that mr gorbachev s criticism of the declaration of independence was just for public consumption the estonian president , arnold ruutel , also said today that mr gorbachev s public stand was quite different from his private one mr ruutel said that deputies from his republic met with mr gorbachev on monday and asked to begin negotiations with moscow on independence mr ruutel reported that far from being antagonistic , mr gorbachev said , let us consider that talks have already begun deputies' conflicting reports yet throughout the afternoon , other baltic deputies brought alternating and often conflicting reports about whether what they took to be their deals with mr gorbachev were on or whether they had fallen through in the end , some of the estonians and latvians but none of the lithuanians took part in the presidential vote nikolai medvedev , a deputy from lithuania , said he understood that bilateral talks between moscow and lithuania about what to do next would begin in moscow on march 15 he said it appeared that estonia would hold separate talks with the kremlin discussions or negotiations \? mr gorbachev did not come out into the foyer of the palace of congresses , where the session is being held , and so could not be questioned by reporters about baltic deputies' assertions that their negotiations with the leadership are proceeding in attempts to reconcile the soviet leader s public utterances with what the baltic representatives asserted were his more private views , some members of the soviet leadership were trying to draw distinctions today between negotiations with the baltic republics and discussions with them yegor k ligachev , considered one of the most orthodox members of the communist party politburo , said today that while there can be discussions , yes , that s natural , he considered it impossible to hold negotiations with lithuania he insisted that there was a fundamental difference between the leadership s willingness to sit down at a table and discuss and negotiations , but he did not specify what that difference was deputies from the baltic republics continued to express confidence that they would in fact gain the independence they are seeking through negotiations for them , the paramount issue was how painful , costly and protracted the disengagement process was likely to be you may call them whatever you like , said andres plotnyeks , a deputy from latvia but there will have to be talks between the center and the republics on the basis of equality and not diktat map of the soviet union showing location of lithuania \( the new york times \) \( pg a18 \)
kitakami , japan , feb 12 two years ago the voters in this mountainous region of traditional rice farms and sprawling new malls delivered the first warning that japan s governing party could lose its 35year grip on power in what became known as the iwate shock , named for the prefecture in northern japan about 300 miles from tokyo , they tossed out a liberal democrat in the upper house of parliament , a movement that gained remarkable momentum nationwide last summer but if the muchtalkedabout political revolution in japan is about to arrive , the liberal democrats will also have to be ousted from the stronger lower house and as sunday s election approaches , the farmers in iwate , and elsewhere in japan , seem dissatisfied with the choice and suddenly hesitant to expel the party that presided over japan s economic miracle most polls now suggest that the liberal democrats will probably hold on to their majority , though not by much if sentiment has begun to shift , voters here suggest , one reason may be that the choices are far less stark than they were last summer hard to distinguish even enthusiasts of the japan socialist party and its leader , takako doi , say that in recent months the party has moved to the mainstream so quickly that it is hard to distinguish its positions from the ruling party s farmers , who strayed from the liberal democrats for the first time in decades to protest agricultural imports , say they are reluctantly edging their way back even women , whose emergence as a important electoral force last summer was cited as a huge change in japanese politics , have proven far quieter in this election than expected less than 7 percent of the candidates running for the lower house are women , and none are running here in iwate the people who left the ldp last year are coming back this year , miyako tomokai , a middleaged housewife and parttime farmer said here the other day many undecided voters a good number of voters still appear undecided , and so these days japan s ubiquitious campaign weapons , blaring soundtrucks , wind through the narrow streets and even pull up to the edge of rice fields the other day kijuro sugawara , a member of the opposition democratic socialist party and one of seven candidates here vying for four seats , stopped his truck opposite the jusco mall here , undeterred by a snowstorm mr sugawara faced a group of 15 or so umbrellaclutching shoppers , whose primary interest was finding someplace warm he shouted about the need for clean politics and leadership , of achieving a balance of power in japan s lower house after so many years of oneparty rule , but sensed that he was not getting through generally speaking japanese are not willing to entertain change , mr sugawara said after his speech they are quite conservative within range still , mr sugawara seems to be within range of defeating the ruling party s weakest candidate in the district , setsu shiga , japan s environment minister mr shiga s staff was caught hinting of scandal about another candidate , but the scandal fizzled and a campaign worker was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had planted the stories the indiscretion may cost the liberal democrats one of its three seats in the district surprisingly , even when voters have the chance to vent their frustration at the liberal democrats this year , they rarely do among the candidates here is ichiro ozawa , the secretary general of the liberal democratic party and thus a perfect target for voter anger at the party yet he is so powerful that most people in the district say it would be foolish to displace him what sells in tokyo has little appeal in yuda only 12 men showed up to hear moto shiina , a powerful figure in the ruling party , and when the topic turned to the big issues , like exports , a few of them quietly dozed off at the end of the talk , there were no questions people here are really still concerned with local issues , said tetsu sasaki , a pediatrician who is leading mr shiina s supporters in the area voters here say one of the biggest failures of the japan socialist party has been its inability to convince people that if the opposition gained power , very much would change one big issue for example , there is little difference on the one issue that makes the iwate district scream rice imports when the people here talk about the trade problem , for example , they are not talking about cars and electronics , but about america s insistence that japan open its markets to foreign rice rice is hardly at the forefront of japan s economic miracle these days , but even people who do not depend on rice for their sole income vote like they do the socialists , in fact , may have gone too far in search of those votes trying to convince farmers that the urbanbased , laborsupported socialist party is really on their side , miss doi told farmers she would increase japan s food selfsufficiency , increasing their business but probably also swelling the trade gap no one believes they are really serious , says susumu iwabuchi , a fulltime farmer who is sticking with the liberal democrats but that is the way politics here has always been
pierre bonnard the graphic art at the metropolitan museum is in itself a selfsufficing delight , even if it was initially overshadowed in the minds of many visitors by the temporary proximity of two bigname neighbors \( velazquez and canaletto \) but those neighbors have now taken their leave , and we have until feb 4 to linger over the bonnard exhibition and recognize it as a major event in its field pierre bonnard \( 18671947 \) was one of the most intelligent men who ever picked up a paintbrush born just before france s humiliation in the francoprussian war of 187071 , he was the son of a senior official in the french ministry of war educated at two of the most exacting schools in paris , and the holder of a law degree before he was even 21 , he could have done well in many a department of life but he was the near contemporary , and in many cases the friend , of a particularly brilliant group of young frenchmen and frenchwomen who were to make their mark in literature , in the theater , in music , in painting , in the decorative arts and in the leadership of esthetic opinion france in the 1880 s and 1890 s may have been a defeated country , and a country mutilated by the loss of alsace and lorraine to the german invader , but it was also the country in which marcel proust , maurice ravel , henri matisse , colette , alfred jarry and the avantgarde theater director lugnepoe were coming to maturity france in the 1880 s was about to produce la revue blanche as distinguished an intellectual and literary review as ever came off the press among painters , paul cezanne , georges seurat , edgar degas , claude monet , vincent van gogh and paul gauguin were in full output so were claude debussy in music , stephane mallarme in poetry and henri bergson in philosophy these were the men of whom pierre bonnard was to prove himself the peer , and they make up a formidable list for this reason , pierre bonnard the graphic art is not only a cabinet of marvels in itself but a landmark in what might be called the reintegration of france there is no reason to suppose that bonnard ever saw it as his duty to bind up the wounds of his country , but that is precisely what he did , in the lightest and most delicate way , in his 20 s and 30 s his was , at that time and for the most part , a highstepping , lightfooted graphic art he got away to a great start in 1891 with a poster called francechampagne that was the very epitome of wellbeing and had a widespread popular success \( toulouselautrec was one of the artists who most responded to it \) thereafter , and for more than a decade , bonnard was here , there and everywhere he was active as a painter , but he was also active as a participant in practical life at that time , he said many years later , i had ideas of my own about how art could be within the reach of everyone and be put to practical use prints , pieces of furniture , fans , screens and so forth the poster , the flyer , the theater program , the sheet music cover , the book jacket , the instructional manual , the wedding announcement , the avantgarde almanac , the calendar , the marginal vignette that caught every reader s attention all tempted him not only were they fun to do but they might make him some money what more could a man ask of life \? fired up by the idea that there might be a virtually unlimited demand for commercial graphic work of high quality , bonnard in no time at all was producing what one visitor described as hundreds of such projects in the catalogue of the present show we are reminded by colta ives , curator in charge of prints and photographs at the met and organizer of the exhibition , that between 1889 and 1902 bonnard produced over 250 lithographs , most of which were designed either to announce , advertise , ornament or illustrate publications in which he collaborated with many of the avantgarde poets , novelists , musicians and dramatists of the day much of his graphic work has a conversational quality that makes it look as if it was easy to do in reality , it gave him infinite trouble to get my courage up , he wrote in 1891 , i have to think of the decorators of ancient missals , and of the art that the japanese brought to the decoration of encyclopedic dictionaries none of that showed in the finished product when he illustrated a treatise for children on the theory and practice of music , every page was a masterpiece of wit and observation by the time we close that little book we are convinced that drudgery has no place in a musical eduction , no matter how rigorous it may be when called upon to illustrate the notation prestissimo , bonnard brought it to life with a drawing of racehorses at full tilt that makes us wish we had laid money on the winner the difference between the major and the minor scale was acted out in a party game in which people of every age could take part as for the concept of oneinabar , when beating time , bonnard expressed it in terms of an immensely fat woman who filled an entire sofa and might , by the look of things , have filled a second one without overmuch trouble on the detail of parisian life , he was unerring even after 100 years , there is nothing that needs amending in bonnard s narrow , unfashionable streets , his beadyeyed schoolboys , his lean , evercurious dogs and his little grocers' shops all aflare at nightfall in such matters he had perfect pitch \( he took care to keep it , too almost at the end of his life , he liked to stay at a big trainstation hotel in paris , the better to monitor the body language of the thousands of men , women and children who went about their daylong business beneath his window \) as for the archetypal parisian young woman , he got her down on paper once and for all what colette did with claudine in her early novels , bonnard did over and over again with a pretty head of hair , a white shift and the blackest of black stockings

no team in the national football league incorporates its offense around a running back more than the chicago bears do with neal anderson , who on sunday , in chicago s 3113 victory over green bay , continued to show why he is worth the investment anderson ran for a 1yard touchdown and caught a 16yard scoring pass he rushed 21 times for 71 yards and made 4 catches for 35 yards but behind the numbers was the demanding and versatile ways that the bears relied on anderson anderson showcased his speed on a 29yard sprint draw and showed his power on a thirdand1 run on which he bullied his way into the middle of the line , heartily accepting crunching blows for the first down on his scoring catch , he ran in motion and then down the sideline , maneuvered his way between two defenders , leaped near the front of the end zone and landed with his feet in bounds and with the ball as he was hit , hanging onto the ball during the collision on another pass play , he remained in the backfield and adeptly blocked a charging linebacker , brian noble , who was blitzing at full speed and who at 6 feet 4 inches and 248 pounds is 5 inches taller and 38 pounds heavier than anderson neal got a beat on today , said mike ditka , the bears' coach , wincing but during the game , ditka never winced he kept calling on anderson anderson , from the university of florida , began his arduous task of replacing walter payton in 1986 after he was taken as the 27th player in the draft each season he has progressed in carries , from 35 to 129 to 249 to 274 and in rushing yards from 146 to 586 to 1 , 106 to 1 , 275 he has been selected for the pro bowl in each of the last two seasons there are a lot of good backs in the league and i am fortunate to be with a team that regards me highly and shows it , anderson said being asked to do a lot of things is my strength it makes the games more exciting and more fun chicago does not rely on a razzledazzle offense but simply on getting the ball into anderson s hands he has made 45 of the team s 77 rushing attempts and has 9 of its 32 receptions anderson and a healthy bears pass rush have helped lead chicago to victories over seattle and green bay by a combined score of 4813 saints silent on offense of the six teams without a victory in two games new orleans , houston , san diego , seattle , indianapolis and philadelphia none are reeling more on offense than the saints new orleans has not scored a touchdown in its two losses and has managed only five field goals the saints even allowed a safety in their 323 loss to minnesota john fourcade , the nfl s lowest rated passer , has been intercepted six times the saints have fumbled three times fourcade finished strong last season and showed that he is a capable pro quarterback new orleans must patiently wait for him to get on track or sign bobby hebert , its longstanding holdout the raiders still want hebert , but this week the saints may realize that they need him more bozo but no fool tony mandarich , the packers' offensive tackle and the no 1 pick in the 1989 draft , continues to take his lumps in green bay he was soundly beaten on sunday by the bears' defensive line in general and by the defensive end trace armstrong in particular but mandarich was n't backing off on the making of his tv commercial that questioned the bears' grit and prompted ditka to call him bozo that was done in fun , tongue in cheek , and it got me 30 , 000 , mandarich said i'm not going to get into a verbal war with ditka , but he s made his share of commercials , for sure i may be a bozo , but i'm a 30 , 000 bozo hearing for dickerson eric dickerson is protesting his being placed by the indianapolis colts on the sixweek nonfootball injury list at a cost of 634 , 000 of his 145 million salary without the league intervening to have dickerson see a neutral physician the colts say dickerson s camp holdout and failure to pass a physical left them no choice paul tagliabue , the nfl commissioner , listened to both sides for two hours yesterday and should make a decision this week at issue is whether the league should have intervened dickerson and his attorney , arn tellem , argued that under nfl policy , the league should have acted unilaterally to provide a neutral physician but the nfl normally takes such an action when one team argues that another club is stashing players to avoid roster limits no such claim has been made in this case dickerson has hinted that if he is not reinstated he will pursue the issue in court
to the editor rethinking foreign aid \( editorial , april 9 \) is on target in calling for revitalization of united states development assistance policies in the face of radically changed international circumstances but the alternative you suggest is only half a program the principal rationale you put forth for new development assistance initiatives is promoting america s own economic wellbeing and political security that s undeniably important , but it is an incomplete justification that would lead to a seriously deficient program the four horsemen of the modern age have been the ascendancy of militarism and the vast armadas it has spawned the authoritarian suppression of human rights the widespread poverty and hunger afflicting onefifth of humanity , and the unrelenting assault on the environment and the natural systems here , on the cusp of the 1990 s , as the cold war seems winding down and democracy rising , america should commit itself to encouraging these geopolitical developments and to starting a new era of action against world poverty and environmental deterioration , with particular focus on helping those who need it most in the developing world , the foremost challenges are mass poverty and environmental decay , with excessive population growth contributing to each the united states should make these the primary focus for cooperation and assistance in the third world our goal should be to promote sustainable , nondestructive livelihoods for the rural and urban poor and to promote environmental protection that conserves the resource base for longterm production protects public health , and establishes a sound basis for international environmental cooperation none of the great environmental challenges of the 1990 s global warming , ozone depletion , biodiversity loss , soil and water deterioration can be met without increasing northsouth cooperation americans have shown they want this country to stand for more than shortterm political and economic selfinterest the time is ripe for a new united states mission internationally , one based on the concept of cooperative action to sustain the earth and its people gus speth president , world resources institute washington , april 10 , 1990
warsaw the flush of excitement with which most of the world has greeted political change in eastern europe obscures the reality about artistic life in cities like this if improvements are to come here , they are far off and will be hard earned so far , at least , the collapse of communism has not prompted the burst of creativity that many people in the west expected , perhaps because the absence of a clear and common enemy has drained some artists of a sense of purpose , certainly because the new economic system has preoccupied everyone as the government seeks solutions to the economic crises that accompany the turn to a freemarket system , artists and cultural institutions can no longer expect to receive the subsidies that have kept them afloat , if only barely , for the last few decades in this respect , the story of warsaw s national museum , the principal storehouse of poland s cultural past , is emblematic of a deep and widespread concern about financial survival with workers and organizations of all kinds lobbying for government aid and with the continuing need to pour whatever resources there are into basics like housing and food , art is obviously not a priority for the new administration yet in neglecting the needs of institutions like the national museum , poland risks the further erosion of a cultural heritage that has been ravaged over the last 200 years by wars , foreign occupations and territorial divisions cut off from the west for years , it is now to the west that the polish arts community must look for help but the cycle of disadvantage is difficult to break without money to promote themselves , without the resources to care properly for their collections or to pay for important loan exhibitions , artists and arts institutions in poland are having a tough time attracting interest and support from the west opus sacrum , the lavish display of western religious art belonging to the polishborn american collector barbara piasecka johnson , which is now at the royal castle here , is the exception that proves the rule , having resulted only from mrs johnson s largesse poland has no collector or patron of culture with anything like the more than 300 million that mrs johnson inherited from her husband , j seward johnson sr , the son of the founder of the johnson johnson pharmaceutical company despite the interest of a few western dealers in poland , artists and arts institutions have experienced nothing like the influx of capital that has flooded the soviet union in recent months here , the market remains little more than a concept to sense the extent of the economic woes , consider the memorandum , dated march 21 , from poland s ministry of culture , that is now pinned to a bulletin board near the director s office at the national museum rumors , it states , that the ministry has ordered a 10 percent cut in personnel are false costcutting decisions rest with the director , marian soltysiak , and the trade union for museum workers but no one here feels comforted by the news the national museum faces rough times during this country s reconstitution after communist rule , and it is no secret among the museum s staff that many of them are likely to be out of a job within months the irony is that now we have the freedom to do whatever we want without interference from the government , but we have no means to do anything , says justyna guze , curator of drawings at the national museum in my 12year career here , this is the worst moment for the museum a tour of the ailing fourstory , 1930 s modernist structure that houses the museum underscores dr guze s point this is poland s largest museum , with roughly 800 , 000 objects , and its encyclopedic collection includes ancient , medieval , renaissance , baroque , modern and asian art the museum s greatest asset , in many ways , has been its staff of conservators and curators , who for decades included the noted scholar jan bialostocki several curators acknowledge privately that their institution owns large numbers of irrelevant objects , but they are also proud to point out such impressive holdings as the archeological remains excavated during the 1960 s from faras , a site in the sudan these include the very beautiful eighthcentury mural fragment of st anne that is the pride of this collection the museum s medieval panels and wood sculptures are on a par with any in eastern europe and of course there are the very finest examples of 19thcentury polish painting \( some of which were exhibited at the national academy of design in new york two years ago \) , an art still widely unfamiliar and hence undervalued in the west more broadly , in a country whose cultural heritage has been trammeled and dispersed over the course of the last two centuries , the national museum remains an institution of symbolic importance it is one of the cruel paradoxes of the turn to a freemarket system that just when the museum should be able to rebuild itself , the new government is beginning to suggest its dismantling pressure has mounted on the museum from some official quarters to choose the solution that , increasingly , american museums have accepted as a response to the crisis of an escalating art market , namely , to raise money by selling parts of the collection
deinstitutionalization removing mental patients from big state hospitals for more humane treatment in communities has become a textbook example of failed social policy yet gov mario cuomo of new york and the state legislature now behave as if it never happened if allowed to prevail , their denial of a disastrous history will inflict new suffering on thousands of mental patients and the communities they inhabit back in the 1960 s , state mental hospitals held more than 80 , 000 patients overcrowding and other abuses led reformers to call for their release to community programs during the 1970 s , hospital populations fell below 20 , 000 but if the state succeeded in pushing patients out , it failed miserably at providing community care upstate towns dependent on hospitals , and unions of hospital workers , pressured lawmakers to keep the hospitals open and heavily staffed that limited money for communities many discharged patients , and thousands of new ones whom hospitals refused to take in , migrated to new york city and its suburbs for a time they found shelter in cheap hotels when the 1980 s real estate markets eliminated many of them , the patients wound up on the street as the mentally ill homeless have become more visible , state officials have finally begun to respond with more support for community programs , residences and caseworkers but that effort is in trouble to save 43 million , albany would resume deinstitutionalization in a big way proposed cuts would reduce the current state hospital capacity of 15 , 599 to about 14 , 000 but none of the savings would go to communities instead , state support would also shrink for community residences and psychiatric emergency rooms hundreds of community mental health staff jobs would be wiped out , including 200 in a highly successful program of intensive case work reducing both state hospital beds and community programs virtually guarantees thousands more homeless mental patients on the streets in new york city alone , the cutbacks would leave at least 5 , 000 without help as the state faces a 15 billion budget gap , the governor and legislative leaders are right to insist that all agencies accept a fair share of pain but the mental health cutbacks cross an unacceptable line for the sake of savings that might be made up with a modest tax or other cuts , they would exact a huge price in terms of official decency and public morale
picturing will by ann beattie 230 pp new york random house 1895 ann beattie is a master of indirection her stories are propelled not so much by event as by the accumulation of the details that build a life as surely as the tumble and drift of sediment builds shale or sandstone pay attention to the small things , she tells us all the rest will fall in place in the novels , the technique does not always work with the grace that illuminates the stories , but here , in her fourth novel and eighth work of fiction , it positively shines picturing will is her best novel since chilly scenes of winter in 1976 , and its depth and movement are a revelation the eponymous will , a 5yearold abandoned by his father , is at the center of the novel , which is an extended meditation on generation , parenthood and the way in which individual lives are shaped by experience will s mother , jody , is a photographer with higher aspirations compelled to earn a living by documenting weddings and other smalltown social gatherings the irony of her position is not lost on her , and she transforms the seemingly routine moments of the nuptial ceremony with a unique and wistful vision a vision that will eventually make her the darling of the new york gallery scene in fact , jody reflects a good deal on art and photography , and one of the book s many joys is the insight into the creative process ms beattie allows us through the eyes of her heroine for jody , a good photograph is almost adventitious , a moment of transcendence that manifests itself while the focus is on the mundane you had zoomed in on details people were too preoccupied , or too nervous , to notice , she realizes , and the resulting images came together like pieces of a puzzle truly to picture will is to capture the world around him , the world of his mother , of his father , of his stepfathertobe , and of all the characters who crowd his life and the lives of the supporting cast this is the strategy of the novel , which focuses on will s crucial sixth year , a year in which his mother is surprised by fame and he loses one father only to gain another ms beattie gives us multiple points of view in order to help us picture will , and she divides the book into three sections mother , father , child as a way of examining each of these interlocking relationships the first two sections are of nearly equal length the last is a sixpage coda in which will , 20 years older and a father himself , takes his place in the hierarchy of generations the first section is jody s we see her some four years after she has been deserted by will s father , wayne , as she struggles to raise will and make a career for herself in charlottesville , va she is aided and abetted by mel , the sort of fairytale prince who inhabits so much of ann beattie s fiction like frank , the herbgrowing lawyer of her story where you 'll find me , or noel , the sweet hippie of vermont , mel is nurturing and supportive , if not particularly exciting mel was nobody s fool and came close to being ideal he was a more patient lover than wayne and found will s laughter contagious he loved her and had let it be known that he was very sad that she had not yet chosen to marry him and move to new york through mel , jody is able to establish an equilibrium that will enable her work to blossom and further , it is through mel s connections in the art world that she first meets haveabud , the starmaker who will back her first show in new york if mel seems somewhat bland in the opening pages , it is perhaps by design , the author s way of masking his true importance in the scheme of will s life for to picture will is to allow for surprise , and ms beattie purposely keeps the reader off balance by shifting focus and constantly rearranging the pieces of the puzzle the moment of transcendence , the moment when the pieces cohere , reveals mel as the heart and soul of the book there is a trick here , and it works beautifully interwoven with the narrative is a series of unascribed italicized sections that speak directly to the reader in the intimate way of a diary or monologue the language is inspired , rhapsodic and true , and the voice speaks to us of the connection between parent and child , of the child s needs and fears and the parent s responsibilities we assume that these are jody s thoughts , but in the book s climactic pages , when wayne has finally and irrevocably absolved himself of any interest in will , we discover that we have been reading mel s journal all along , that it is mel who has been the truest parent , the wisest and most loving in the end , he leaves the journal for will , that he might profit from its advice the second section , father , seems at first to belong to wayne , the most vividly realized character in the book , but in fact it points to the ultimate triumph of mel it is the story of will s journey to florida , accompanied by mel , haveabud and haveabud s 7yearold ward , for a visit with his father again , through the use of multiple points of view , ms beattie gives us a portrait of wayne in composite , and we come to see just how selfish , violent and selfdeluding he is , and how little he cares for will when will arrives , his father is not there to greet him wayne is preoccupied with thoughts of a fling he is having with a young woman tourist and leaves will to his third wife , corky , who becomes , for a brief period , yet another of will s trial parents and as will prepares to leave , prematurely , wayne is absent again this time at the behest of the local police will peers out the window to see his father handcuffed and led away , out of his life for good then he returns to jody , now living in new york and to mel if mel is a type recognizable from ms beattie s previous work , so too is wayne he is handsome , virile , misogynistic , seductive he is untamed and dangerous he uses sex as a weapon , as when he makes love to the mother of a man who slights him , and he dodges responsibility by picturing himself the victim of imaginary injuries he is like the husband who walks out on the wife in vermont he is like frank wayne of the story the burning house , who delivers what has to be the most devastating parting shot a dissection of the irreconcilable differences between the sexes in all of ms beattie s , or anyone else s , fiction wayne is cruder , perhaps , but no less destructive than those characters we see that will is nothing to him or worse , an irritation , a springboard for the mother , a launch pad from which her presence could shoot up to hover hugely over the scene if jody could not remain in wayne s heart herself , she would send an envoy to penetrate his world it is no surprise that wayne will ultimately turn his back on his son
pittsburgh , oct 7 bobby bonilla considered the depressing fact that the hardesthitting outfield in the national league was a quiet 5 for 23 in the first two games of the playoff and said it has n't happened yet he was right during the regular season , the pirates amassed the remarkable total of 82 home runs and 311 runs batted in from bonilla , barry bonds and andy van slyke during the first two games of the playoff against the cincinnati reds , with the pennant at stake , they amassed the paltry total of four singles and one double from the same three only one of them knocked in a run , and that was van slyke in the opening game when eric davis misplayed his fly to left field into a double two games , said van slyke , is not an assessment of what barry , bobby and i can do it better not be , or the pirates will have trouble breaking the tie in the series , even though the next three games will be played in their home ball park , three rivers stadium they won the opener in cincinnati on thursday , 43 , but lost the second game , 21 then , after a twoday layoff dictated by television schedules , they will resume the playoff monday afternoon with zane smith pitching against danny jackson of the reds bullpen and bream the first two games were dramas marked by some singular work the pirates' unsung bullpen shut down the reds in the first game sid bream hit a tworun home run and van slyke got lucky when davis misjudged his fly ball with two down in the seventh inning and it dropped behind him for the winning run but in the next game , the pirates put six runners on base inside three innings and scored none of them paul o'neill drove in two runs for the reds and intercepted one for the pirates with a rifle throw from right field to third base to cut down van slyke barry larkin made two dazzling plays at shortstop in the ninth inning that averted an uprising by the pirates and the reds eventually prevailed when their celebrated bullpen shut the door in the final three innings we had tons of chances , said wally backman of the pirates too many chances you 've got to capitalize you 've got to give the other guys some credit , but we had opportunities we just did n't take control of the opportunities we had but during the regular season , taking charge was the quality that separated the pirates from the mets and other pretenders in the national league s east and most of the time , it was the killer bees , bonds and bonilla , plus their ally in center field , van slyke , who were the ones taking charge impressive statistics bonds , fulfilling the potential insinuated by the record of his father , bobby bonds , became a triplethreat star who batted 301 , hit 33 home runs and drove in 114 runs but during the playoff , he has one single in seven times up , no home runs , no runs batted in bonilla , who is also rated a ranking candidate for the league s most valuable player award , batted 280 this season with 32 home runs and batted in 120 runs in the playoff two singles van slyke hit 284 this season with 17 home runs and knocked in 77 runs against the reds in two games in the playoff one single , one gift double cincinnati is a very tough ball park to hit in when you have shadows , van slyke said , analyzing the small slump by the big three of the pirates' outfield the depth perception is hard it s difficult to see the ball from sunshine to shade the hitters are in the shade , bonds said the ball is coming out of the sun you ca n't even see the ball sometimes you 're out there trying to make things happen , and you want to do it right then because there s no looking back a lot of us have n't been in this situation but i 've been in it a million times during the season , and came through the pirates' outfield will be altered when the playoff resumes if jeff king is unable to start at third base and bonilla is brought in from right field to play there , as he did friday after king left the game in the second inning with a strained lower back he apparently was injured diving back into second base twice to avoid being picked off by tom browning he avoided it the first time , but not the second the pirates' trainer reported that king could not have returned to the lineup this weekend if games had been scheduled but king expressed optimisim that he would be ready to play when game 3 begins monday afternoon photo reds' danny jackson , who is scheduled to start today against the pirates , working out saturday in cincinnati \( associated press \)

for many months and several reasons , high and low modern art and popular culture , which opens sunday at the museum of modern art , has been widely anticipated coming after a decade in which fine artists have mixed references to popular culture in new and provocative ways , this show could not have been better timed on a broader historical front , the incessant crossfertilization between 20thcentury art and less exalted forms of visual culture has long been known , primarily by its most famous parts from picasso and braque s introduction of parisian newsprint into their synthetic cubist collages , to roy lichtenstein s careful croppings and adjusting of ordinary comicbook images for his pop art paintings a more thorough , egalitarian examination of this vast subject seemed to hold out the tantalizing possibility of a redefinition of modernism , and on the walls of the very institution that helped define its terms in the first place finally , as the first largescale exhibition to be organized by kirk varnedoe since he succeeded william s rubin in august 1988 as director of the museum s department of painting and sculpture , high and low would certainly have much to say about the modern s future course now , high and low is a fact , one that occupies both floors of the modern s temporary exhibition galleries with more than 250 artworks and related material organized by mr varnedoe in concert with adam gopnik , the art critic for the new yorker , it is a big , ambitious show , and it contains many great works of art , some of them juxtaposed in unusual ways with comicbook or advertising images but the tale this exhibition tells is crushingly familiar , superficial and onesided , none of which bodes well for the modern s preeminent department under mr varnedoe s stewardship at nearly every turn , this exhibition hangs back , seemingly intimidated by the immensity of its subject , setting limits and making excuses and , by and large , simply excerpting past museum of modern art exhibitions like the handsome christian without his cyrano de bergerac , it often looks wonderful , but when it opens its mouth , it says little that is original it is strange to be so critical of an exhibition that contains robert rauschenberg s rebus , elements of claes oldenburg s store , five boxes by joseph cornell , 10 portraits by jean dubuffet , and substantial groups of work by cy twombly and stuart davis , as well as more venerable names like picasso , braque , leger , miro and duchamp but , despite its timely concept , high and low in actuality is , at best , the wrong exhibition in the wrong place at the wrong time at worst , it may be a textbook case for the maxim that an exhibition topheavy in masterpieces can still be a disaster another possible explanation is that the exhibition is virtually impossible to bring off the curators' thick catalogue oozing facts , reproductions and opinions , some of them quite debatable , is the arena in which the symbiosis of high and low culture is most convincing here the four categories of popular culture that mr varnedoe and mr gopnik have staked out advertising , caricature , the comics and graffiti are traced back to their historical roots and brought forward in a constant crossfire with their highart counterparts in contrast , the exhibition is plagued by severe , often contradictory limits and goals in various parts of the catalogue introduction and brochure , the curators avow to bypass a full chronicle in favor of an exhibition whose principal focus is on particular objects and people just how particular is made ominously clear when they add that their examinations will emphasize events in new york city and paris , and concentrate on popular culture s interaction with painting and sculpture identifying popular culture as only a provisional term of convenience , they eschew hard and fast categories , seeking to convey the circular exchange in which modern art and popular culture have continuously fed off and redefined each other yet this show , in which text panels announce a new heading or subheading in every gallery , is a hostage to categorization , which accounts for both its abrupt shifts in time and style and its spacedevouring repetitions the wellknown road from paris to new york or , stylistically speaking , from cubism to pop is traced not once but twice , in the upper galleries devoted to art and advertising and again in the lower ones , where art and graffiti , caricature and the comics are scrunched together proceeding in this manner , high and low , reiterates the modern s chronic biases a francophilia that makes short shrift of developments in italy , russia and germany in the first half of the show , and , in the second , a new york centricity that all but ignores postwar europe an exception is the opening section of the exhibition s lower tier , which displays the big tornposter collages of the parisian affichistes , raymond hain , jacques de la villegle and mimmo rotella , lifted from the streets of paris in the early 1960 s their pieces , not well known in the united states , mark one of the few points where the raw energy of urban life directly enters the show it would have been exciting to see them beside the efforts of other popularcultureconscious artists , from asger jorn , sigmar polke and gerhard richter to david salle and julian schnabel
call me , ishmael we 'll do lunch ishmael , i protested , is but a creation of my restless pen i am sure right have it your way any man writes a threepound book , i 'll call him whatever he wants i make it a policy never to disagree with a writer till the script is in listen , ish , i 'll have my people call your people , we 'll take a meeting i'm heading into the valley now , so reception s about to static exploded on the line i could envision sid s mocha rolls plunging down a precipitous slope into the valley of san fernando suddenly an alien voice filled the ether , shouting , hey ! any you guys on my line interested in quality storm sash \? an hour later , i received a call from my agent , al detocqueville weintraub sid had authorized him to fedex me a ducat on mgm grand air , had engaged a minisuite at one of the tony new hostels with names that sound like french colognes i was on my way not a moment too soon , either , for 10 years in the customs house with no action had turned my life to something resembling suet pudding imagine , if you will , the damage done by a regimen of unrelieved tedium to a mind such as mine , accustomed to scouring the benthic abysses of the human soul envy was the hag that brewed my ink my days were filled with listening to the salty tales of raffish lascars who stormed into my puny office with bales of exotic commodities like cinnabar \( they called it cinnabar , though i had my doubts , for when they would sneak a pinch of it and surreptitiously place it beneath their hats , after a few seconds they would burst into a chorus of sit down , you 're rockin' the boat \) oh , there had been a few paltry options taken on some of my works over the years , and now and then some fading player in search of a golden globe nomination had actually filmed a truncated version of one or the other , but none had ever borne fruit by which i mean enough of the long green to secure me a decent twobedroom in a building with a health club , and maybe the first few payments on a keogh plan now , thanks to the literary sensitivity of a man i had never met sid fennel of the fennel entertainment group , an investment partnership formed by convicted felons and the second sons of arab sheiks i had hope i recall precious little of the flight into the setting sun the first two hours were spent repelling the advances of a serving wench in a merry widow and sequined pumps , who insisted on forcefeeding me fish eggs and cold duck after a brief and troubled nap , during which i suffered my recurring nightmare of being compelled , stark naked , to serve canapes to the academie francaise , i passed the remainder of the time watching a film about an adolescent who , by uttering a shibboleth , magically transforms himself into a skin lesion on the face of the leader of the soviet union and thus brings peace to the world i wondered would sid fennel have the temerity to suggest butchering my classic oeuvre to pander to illiterate bumpkins for the sake of a quick buck \? never , i decided whatever else he was and intimates had used such diverse terms as maniac and cruller sid was , he assured me , a respecter of artistic integrity i was met at the airport by a blackcaparisoned chauffeur holding a placard on which had been scribbled in lip gloss , apparently the word melville he was a strapping lad , broad of shoulder , keen of eye \( there was but one , the other having been sold , he was to tell me later , to finance lessons in interpretive dance \) as he hoisted my sea bag and escorted me to an automobile designed solely to violate the mann act , he said , melville melville that name rings a bell did n't you used to be somebody \? if only i muttered , and climbed aboard sid had said we would meet at first light or noon , whichever came first , and so , after consuming a roomservice order of mineral water and a tuna melt the tab for which came to more than i had earned since 1851 i tucked myself into sheets as soft as maidens' hair and drifted off we met for brunch at la puanteur , purveyors of entrails to the stars the maitre d' , imperiously androgynous , greeted me with the same enthusiasm he would have accorded to a gravy stain on his waistcoat , and escorted me to sid s table sid fennel was a small man who resembled nothing so much as a bass he had recently had a hair transplant \( or else enjoyed recreational trephination \) , and his scalp looked like a hardused country lane over which a few scraggly saplings had fallen at random we ordered , then exchanged a few moments of small talk about the practical applications of cold fusion the food came , and conversation flagged as sid , like a starved panther , assaulted his order of braised pancreas on a kaiser roll at last , he sat back and , like a bellows , expelled a gust of fetid air and said , goodnews , badnews time i beg your pardon al may be a ball of slime , but i love him he s my amigo he pressed , i caved , he got you 50k for the underlying rights worldwide in perpetuity , plus a first draft , two sets and a polish no back end , but never mind with a gross player in the game , the back end s funny money anyway is that the good news or the bad news \? the bad news is , ish , there 'll have to be a couple little changes
washington , july 24 the commodity futures trading commission charged today that four traders on the floor of the new york mercantile exchange engaged in a conspiracy to use their advance knowledge of customer orders to make illegal profits the commission said that the four defendants defrauded their customers in 34 illegal transactions in the oil futures market between july and december 1988 the amount of money involved was not disclosed today s charges are the first to emerge from a federal investigation into trading on the four new york futures markets the investigation began last may when commission officials descended on the trading floor of the exchanges to issue subpoenas more charges are expected , federal officials said named in the ninecount civil complaint were douglas m friedman , a former trader from forest hills , queens michael s pomerantz , from scarsdale , ny lawrence a beck of fort lee , nj john j king of old bridge , nj , and msp trading inc , a firm owned by mr pomerantz none could be reached for comment none of the defendants have settled the charges a hearing will be scheduled before an administrative judge
the college football association said yesterday that it had agreed to smaller television contracts with abc and espn that reflected the university of notrereame s deciconoto drop out of the agreements as a result , instead of receiving a projected 350 million over five years beginning in 1991 , the 63 schools covered by the new packages would receive 300 million , the association s commissioner , chuck neinas , said since notre dame will receive none of the association s money , and since its share would have been about 20 million under the original arrangement , mr neinas said the net loss to the football association in the revised contracts would be only 30 million 30 million for notre dame earlier this week , notre dame reached a separate agreement with nbc , saying it would receive more money and broader exposure under that contract , notre dame will receive 30 million over five years the teams that play notre dame will also receive money from nbc under the new arrangements with the football association , abc will carry the same 25 to 35 games a year , including regional telecasts , that it had agreed to in the original fiveyear deal with espn , the cable sports channel in which abc holds an 80 percent stake , the association extended the original fouryear , 110game agreement to a fiveyear deal that provides for national telecasts of 138 games mr neinas and officials of both abc and espn declined to provide a breakdown of how much each network was paying but it was learned that the new agreement with abc would be 175 million , reflecting a 35 million reduction that the network had proposed earlier this week in light of notre dame s move the package had previously been put at 210 million instead of paying 110 million for four years , espn will pay 125 million over five years an opening for cbs because the new abc agreement averages 35 million a year instead of the 42 million average under the original pact , cbs , whose fouryear agreement with the association expires after this season , may have an opening to seek to overturn the abc deal and claim the association s package for itself that is because the current cbs contract gives it an option to match any offer of less than 40 million a year a cbs spokesman said yesterday that network executives were huddling behind closed doors , discussing whether to seek to exercise the option , but that no decision had been made mr neinas , who repeatedly described the abc contract as binding , said lawyers had assured him that it would withstand any such challenge at a news conference at the football association s headquarters in boulder , colo , mr neinas also stressed that he had firm legal commitments from all of the 63 schools covered by the new arrangements
cambridge , mass many american officials and strategic analysts seem to be making the preservation of nato the principal objective of american policy in europe this goal makes sense in the short run nato is still the only organization that gives the us a preponderant role in europe , and it remains critical to preserving stability and balance there but for the longer run , we need new institutions , and we had better begin thinking about them now and for both the long and short run , the west has to pay careful attention to the soviet union s humiliation arising from its loss of the cold war this blow could be softened if the western allies made it clear that today s nato an integrated military alliance dominated by the us is entering its final phase and will need to be transformed when the period of european transition is over american policy makers' devotion to nato is understandable nato not only helped to safeguard peace in europe through the worst years of the cold war , it also successfully managed the initially traumatic issue of west german rearmament nato forces are also still needed to counterbalance soviet forces for reasons of policy , prestige and practicality , soviet troops will not be removed entirely from what is still east germany for some time some soviet forces may remain in poland as long as poland is not fully reassured that germany intends to abandon its claims on polish areas that were once german moreover , nato as well as what is left of the warsaw pact will play a useful role in negotiating reductions of conventional forces and tactical nuclear weapons in europe above all , nato is still needed as a home for germany nobody has an interest in a neutralized and united germany , unattached and tempted again to be a freewheeling major player or subject to fits of insecurity because of real or imagined threats from the east or west why do the soviets still talk about a neutralized germany \? because a united germany in nato even a germany that guarantees that nato forces will not move into the former east germany would be psychologically painful it would symbolize the soviet union s loss of the political empire and eastern european security buffer zone won in the war but moscow has not pushed hard for a neutralized germany because this goal has no support in eastern europe the soviet union is not really convinced that a freewheeling germany is in its longterm interest nor does moscow have cards strong enough to insist on neutralization neither are the germans enticed by the idea of neutrality , because they do not want to risk repeating their history and moscow s threat to keep soviet forces in east germany until the germans and their western partners agree on a formula to remove germany from nato could boomerang these forces would find themselves amid a hostile population , far from their homeland and isolated if germany induced poland to request the departure of soviet troops from polish soil in effect , the soviets have already acknowledged the inevitability of german unity it is remarkable that they have not tried to use their acceptance of unification to gain bonn s agreement to certain security arrangements at the least , they can try to obtain a reward for having made unification possible such arrangements would include limits on german weapons and forces , which germany and its nato allies would have no reason to refuse perhaps an agreement on the removal of us nuclear weapons from german soil and an economic deal for german contributions to the failing soviet economy beyond these immediate issues , the need is for longrange thinking against what enemy would today s nato need to be preserved \? none of the main hypotheses about the soviet union s future a victory of perestroika , disintegration and civil strife , an authoritarian and repressive reaction against disorder and separatism entails the likelihood of a soviet military threat against europe for many years , if at all how long , under these circumstances , would germany want to remain a subordinate member of a usdominated alliance and to be the last occupied country in europe \? not long this would be especially true if us forces remained in the western parts of germany well after the soviet troops left the eastern parts how long , indeed , will the american public and congress want to pay for today s nato once the soviet threat has been removed , once the european members confront only far weaker , entirely friendly and westernoriented central and eastern european nations , and once the only rationale for preserving the old nato is stability \? \( that code word means distrust of germany , which , ironically , is america s most powerful nato ally \) can nato s present structure be maintained once us conventional and tactical nuclear forces are reduced \? west germany s army , nato s largest , has been under direct us command how acceptable will this arrangement be to the germans and other europeans once the us military presence has shrunk \?
to say that terry bradshaw talks with his hands is not to suggest that the cbs commentator does n't have a clear , strong and sometimes booming voice or that he is not articulate to the point of occasional eloquence indeed , in bradshaw s case , his sweeping , expansive gestures may not even be unconscious efforts to provide visual shape or punctuation to his patter , but rather a sign of reflexive muscle memory in which the big hands seem forever agrope , searching for something familiar to grasp and hold on to , just long enough to fling into some distant end zone that at least seemed to be the case last week when bradshaw , the former pittsburgh steeler quarterback , appeared as a sort of walking , talking , handwaving relic among the static memorabilia at the official sendoff of the super bowl silver anniversary tour the tour is a romannumeralladen multimedia exhibition that will visit xii cities before reaching tampa , fla , the site of super bowl xxv in january bradshaw , who played xiv seasons and appeared in iv super bowls before his retirement in mcmlxxxiv , was an obvious choice to help open the exhibition the show includes jerseys of super bowl stars , super bowl game balls , tickets and coins from the pregame flips , the vince lombardi super bowl trophy , video highlights from each super bowl game , a complete collection of the grenadesize super bowl rings and enough copies of the new 50 simon schuster book , the super bowl , to stock a small library even so , for bradshaw , who brought along one of his no 12 super bowl jerseys , the visit to the exhibit at the citicorp center in new york was an unaccustomed trip down lockerroom lane if you walked into my house in fort worth , he said , you would n't know i ever played football there are no footballs , no football pictures , no football souvenirs or memorabilia or anything bradshaw wears none of his four super bowl rings \( ix , x , xiii and xiv \) he said that he keeps two in a bank vault in shreveport , la , and that he gave one to his father , bill , who still has it , and one to his brother , gary , who lost it as for nostalgia , talking over the old days and reliving the old glories , bradshaw suggests that was for those who sat in the stands if you 've done it , he said , extending his arm through a long arc , you do n't have to talk about it drawing
i got my first , and worst , tax headache of the year choosing a program to prepare the return last year , i wanted a program , and even selected it , but was afraid to spend the money until i had finished doing my family s taxes and knew we could afford it but by the time i had finished , i realized that a program could pay for itself , even if it did n't uncover a hidden deduction it might not reduce the three days or more spent organizing receipts and filling out forms , but it could save the two days or more i spent finetuning the return programs offer expert advice and the magic of automatic recalculation no more anguished cries and adding and subtracting whole series of numbers because you find a receipt peeking out of the dustballs under the desk , i thought just enter one number on schedule c and press a key my tax filings are elaborate productions , because i'm a freelance writer and smalltime entrepreneur with a fully employed wife and two small children , stock trades and rental property i have lots of forms detailing earnings that are unfortunately all too small my wife asked a friend for advice , saying a tax program was the only thing i wanted for christmas her friend was filled with sympathy and said that was sad but writing and selling tax programs is apparently like bottling nouveau beaujolais nothing can start until the grapes are in \( or the new federal tax forms are released \) my wife found no programs in stock before christmas and was relieved to give me a book on egyptology instead by midjanuary the programs began to appear , and i went shopping for a program for my ibmxt the time i spent shopping would be time saved from going to the irs office to round up forms and pamphlets because i might need one , only to discover at the last minute that something critical was missing after all , a tax program has a comprehensive library of schedules and forms even then , the programs were earlyrelease versions , but i did n't mind i could start entering data , mail in the registered user s form to get the final version and wait to send in the return until the final diskettes had arrivedin the mail and verified everything i had clipped a rave review of one called andrew tobia taxcut , by meca ventures , inc the reviewer , peter h lewis , said the program brought andrew tobias , a financial writer i find easy to understand , and daniel caine , a tax lawyer , together that sounded good to me still , i wanted to see the competition software etc did not have tax cut in stock , although it offered an enticing package , turbo tax by chipsoft bundled with quicken , a yearround program for personal finances , for 8996 the packaging said the program supported my printer , but surely any one should support a printer as popular as my hewlettpackard desk jet i had a lot to learn i also looked at timeworks' swiftax for 4999 , but it did n't list my printer and was n't decorated with badges and prizes from computer magazines like the other one , so i was n't impressed and finally there was jk lasser s , \( 7196 at software etc \) , which looked like a real nutsandbolts cpa special it came down to a choice between turbo tax and tax cut the software etc salesman roundly endorsed tax cut , which he did n't have in stock , over turbo tax , which he did i went up the street to 47th street photo , which had it for 4495 15 less than its turbo taxquicken price tax cut s packaging mentioned hp laserjets and compatibles but not my printer the expert behind the cash register was reassuring desk jet , laser jet , same thing , he shrugged , so i bought it it took all of two or three minutes to load the program and the very thinness of the users guide was encouraging just one nagging question it did n't mention the printer buying a computer program is like eating raisins in the dark you 're never really sure what you 've got until you 're committed in this case , tax cut s technical support told me , the program would n't support my printer i had visions of going shamefaced to a friend s apartment to use his dot matrix printer , which would churn out all my successes and failures with dollar signs attached but , the technician added , my printer would print out the forms in a fashion acceptable to the irs it just wo n't emulate the fancy graphics and shaded boxes of the federal 1040 within a half hour i was clattering away , pouring data into my 1040 through a questionandanswer routine called asktheexpert it would silently classify me and gather necessary forms for the most part it made easy sense , although ambiguous wording left me guessing once or twice another feature i enjoyed was scratch pad \( alt s \) the user can call up a separate scratch pad for any line item and list component items in one column , their dollar values in another it keeps a running total and carries it back to the form i used it for various categories of business expenses , lists of donations , interest expenses and many other things the biggest shortcoming with pads is that correcting a mistake means rekeying the whole line the program was smart when i jumped from one form to another and then went back to the 1040 , i wound up at the line i had been working on it was going so well that i did n't mind when my 4yearold daughter climbed into my lap to watch she asked for a glass of water i went to get it , came back , and the screen was blank no fault of the program my monitor had died but i had learned enough to go through a save routine blind and lost only three days and 60 to get the monitor fixed back at work i met a few other disappointments i moved into schedule c , profit and loss for a small business i had to fill out two and really wanted the help of my expert , but he had evaporated so , i still had to go to the irs office to pick up bulletins and advisories fortunately , the expert was there to help me through the mine fields of depreciation and amortization and interest and dividend income he even made a game effort to steer me through a rentalincome form , but admitted i might need a human adviser if my situation was complex the final version of tax cut works , but much to my disappointment i had to reenter all the data when my final version arrived in late february , an enclosed card said a transfer disk would be in the mail within two weeks , but i had waited long enough i had come close to chucking the program after bugs in the early version sent my tax forms disintegrating into a crawling parade of programming characters only the thought of shopping again kept me at it these bugs were exterminated in the final version , which still is not perfect the documentation advises doublechecking a few areas there s still no getting around it , whether you use a pencil or a keyboard taxes are taxes they are not fun and there is no substitute for having your data organized but if nothing else , tax programs and automatic calculation eliminate one odious tool from the process the eraser tom sawyer says he will probably buy a program again next year , but none too early drawing
