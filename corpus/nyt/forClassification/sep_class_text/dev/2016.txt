moscow the fallout from s failed drug test has ensnared her native russia as it becomes clear that the banned substance found in her system is creating wider problems for russian sports sharapova , a fivetime grand slam winner , announced monday that for meldonium during the australian open in january , shocking the tennis world and by a number of her sponsors few in the los angeles hotel conference room with sharapova on monday probably recognized the name of the drug , but in russia , meldonium , also known as mildronate , was a common treatment for athletes before it was added to the world antidoping agency s prohibited list in january the new ban is causing farreaching troubles for the russian sporting establishment , which is already reeling from an international track and field suspension over accusations the country conducted a massive doping program on wednesday , a spokesman for the kremlin said sharapova s failed drug test should not be projected onto russian sports generally but even as the kremlin sought to play down sharapova s lapse as an individual case , more russian athletes were drawn into the controversy in the two days since sharapova s announcement , seven russian athletes have been confirmed as having tested positive for meldonium among those provisionally suspended are an olympic gold medalist in shorttrack speedskating , semion elistratov , and his teammate , the world champion pavel kulizhnikov russia s sports minister , vitaly mutko , has warned that more positive tests for meldonium are likely to come athletes from sweden , ethiopia and ukraine have also reportedly tested positive for meldonium this year the surge in positive tests has been linked to the larger russian doping scandal , but it also seems to reflect a clash of understanding about meldonium between russian trainers and wada , the antidoping body in january , wada included meldonium on its list of hormone and metabolic modulators the decision to ban the drug has been met with bafflement and anger among top russian athletes and sports physicians they said that they did not understand why the drug , legal for decades but monitored by wada for at least a year , had been outlawed and that they did not believe that using it constituted doping until the fall , russian teams had used the drug regularly and openly , viewing it as a remedy for fending off exhaustion and heart problems most team coaches would keep a supply , administering it along with other standard vitamins i 've been working for 20 years we could never imagine that it would be included as a doping substance , said sergei sheremetiev , a physician with russia s skijumping team created as a treatment for heart conditions in 1975 , meldonium is widely available from russian pharmacies without a prescription , selling for 3 to 10 for about 40 capsules it can also be purchased online meldonium is not approved by the food and drug administration for sale in the united states , where sharapova has been based since she was 7 the russian tennis federation said its doctors had not known she was taking meldonium meldonium helps increase blood flow and therefore increases the amount of oxygen taken into the body , which would allow athletes to recover faster while training the drug s inventor , ivars kalvins , a professor at latvia s institute of organic synthesis , said in a 2009 newspaper interview that the drug was once used by soviet soldiers lugging heavy equipment at high altitudes during the invasion of afghanistan on its website , grindeks , the latvian company that is the main supplier of the drug , said that in addition to its use for cardiovascular disease , the medication was used for the improvement of work capacity of healthy people at physical and mental overloads and during rehabilitation period sheremetiev said it s a good drug until they banned it , we used it in many types of sport hockey , skiing in those where there s pretty serious strain grindeks said in a statement that it did not believe meldonium should be banned for use by athletes because it cannot improve athletic performance but it can stop tissue damage in the case of ischemia , which is the lack of blood flow to the heart until the ban , sheremetiev said , he had given the drug to his own athletes about twice a year sharapova and her lawyers said she was prescribed meldonium by her family doctor in 2006 for a variety of health problems , including signs of diabetes , irregular ekg readings , magnesium deficiency and frequent cases of the flu she said she had failed to read an email sent by wada that confirmed the medication had been added to the prohibited list for 2016 the russian trainers and officials said they were obeying the ban on meldonium , but they insisted the drug despite its benefits should not be considered a performance enhancer sheremetiev and other team physicians said it was merely for restoring physical fitness but wada has disagreed the body s president , craig reedie , in , wrote that meldonium was a big concern because it s clear that people are abusing the drug several studies in the past year have bolstered wada s case a , funded in part by the partnership for clean competition , analyzed 8 , 300 urine samples collected at doping control sessions and found that 182 \( 22 percent \) contained the substance a study of last year s european games in baku , azerbaijan , , found an alarmingly high prevalence of meldonium use by athletes according to the study , 13 winners or medalists were taking meldonium , and 66 athletes tested positive for it growth in the use of meldonium , particularly among eastern european athletes , was from the german network ard , which first reported on systematic russian doping in 2014 the investigation cited a 2015 russian study that found meldonium in 17 percent of 4 , 316 urine samples tested still , mark stuart , a london pharmacist who is on the medical and antidoping commission of the european olympic committees , said the evidence around whether the drug enhanced performance was quite thin still , the fact that so many athletes were using it suggests that they believed it improved performance , he said , adding , i ca n't see how so many athletes young , quite fit and healthy would really have a need for this particular drug russian physicians acknowledged that they had received plenty of notice to stop their athletes from using meldonium national teams stopped treating their athletes with the drug in september , officials said , after wada warned the drug would be banned beginning in january some federations said they had destroyed their supplies of the drug sheremetiev and a number of other federation officials and trainers said that , given the warnings , it was incomprehensible that top athletes had continued to take meldonium russia s national speedskating team appeared to have been hit particularly badly by the new ban three of its athletes tested positive , including elistratov , a worldrecord holder at a news conference in moscow , the speedskating federation s president , aleksey kravtsov , insisted that none of his athletes had taken the drug knowingly and that the team s trainers had been told not to administer it kravtsov said the federation had evidence to prove it and would be appealing its athletes' suspensions
i'm not being cheeky i'm not being shocking i'm noting something that we cannot lose track of , should not shrug our shoulders about and must not gloss over trump has succeeded at nothing as fully as he has at infusing the presidential race with a vulgarity that s absolutely breathtaking he has done so well at dragging his rivals so far down into the sewer with him that portions of what we watched on thursday night were a fetid farce we actually witnessed an interchange in the first 10 minutes , no less about how well endowed \( or not \) he is it s worth stopping for a second , letting that sink in and wondering what it says about our country and political process right now here s how it happened one of the moderators upbraided marco rubio \( rightly \) for abandoning incessant pledges of a positive campaign , answering trump s schoolyard taunts with adolescent jokes and jabs of his own , and even going so far as to claim that trump had wet his pants under the pressure at the prior debate trump butted in to take special issue with one of rubio s digs he hit my hands , trump said , alluding to rubio s assertion that they were small and correctly noting that rubio had insinuated that if they 're small , something else must be small trump lifted his chin puffed up his chest i guarantee you there s no problem , he said i guarantee there is absolutely a problem , and i'm going to be careful here not to characterize it as big or small or use any adjective related to size the problem is that trump , rubio , ted cruz and were on the stage in detroit to debate their qualifications for the most powerful job in the world , at the helm of its most important democracy , and trump and rubio were n't just hitting , but also dwelling , below the belt surreal sickening so , yes , the size of trump s penis matters or , rather , what matters is that it was an actual subject of discussion that it reflected and set the tone of the encounter and that this tone favors trump , because it s where he lives , it s his kingdom , and if rivals join him there , they merely become his subjects remember the first debate of this election cycle , when there were more than double this number of candidates and the night opened with fox s moderators confronting all of them , one by one , with what were seen as their greatest vulnerabilities and flaws \? the moderators were similarly merciless on thursday night , at least when it came to trump , and trump was the rightful focus the whole show they hounded him about his inconsistencies , his lies , his lack of specificity all of it if substance can pull trump s voters away from him , the moderators set that up to happen if substance can prevent undecided voters from lining up behind trump , the moderators gave them a firm nudge in the opposite direction and nothing about trump s overly defensive , excessively pouty and sometimes outright mendacious performance beckoned those voters to his side although there were moments when his ability to maintain his composure was heroic , there were as many or more when he grew flustered , reddened , sputtered and resorted to insult , looking tinier than i thought that a man who stands well over 6 feet tall could fittingly , he reached his nadir under interrogation from megyn kelly , his nemesis from that first debate the subject was fraud charges against trump university , and every time he tried to portray them as baseless and the school and its students as the happiest place this side of disneyland , kelly pushed back confronted him with contrary evidence corrected his selective , selfserving version her victory was clear when trump pivoted from defending himself to pummeling rubio , saying that if fraud was the topic , rubio s poor record of attendance in the senate should be examined he scammed the people of florida , trump said he defrauded the people of florida of no small relevance florida , which votes on march 15th , is a winnertakeall primary rubio has staked his campaign his reputation on winning it but in polls there , trump remains in the lead cruz and rubio keep making this assumption they made it anew on thursday night once again and at great length , cruz recited the list of liberal democrats to whom trump had contributed over the years , dwelling in particular on how many checks he 'd written to hillary clinton and asking an excellent question how would trump be able to campaign effectively against someone whom he 'd supported and demonstrated such excitement about in the past \? rubio denounced trump as someone whose positions are not conservative he mentioned trump s defense of planned parenthood he disparaged trump s commitment to national defense and in the days leading up the debate , a rapidly growing , increasingly prominent chorus of republican standard bearers made that same he snorepublican argument , detailing the ways in which trump betrays conservative principles this was a component of mitt romney s message when he delivered his extraordinary speech on thursday , telling republicans that this was a time of reckoning and that if they do n't say no to trump , they 're saying yes to the demise of the republican party and , possibly , the country but here s the problem trump s voters are n't with him because he s the purest conservative trump is their protest vote , and part of what they 're protesting is preoccupations of the republican party that have n't improved or been immediately relevant to their lives they 're protesting foreign wars , free trade and the coddling of corporations , and some of trump s apostasies are precisely what draw them to him republican leaders' failure to take down trump is n't simply a function of hesitancy it s not just about waiting too long it s about their own lack of credibility and authority with the part of the electorate that s defying them one of the most fascinating dynamics of the debate was the degree to which cruz , rubio and kasich declined to go after one another , no longer angling to emerge as the trump alternative but working harder instead to erode trump s support , no matter where that support went in debates past , cruz and rubio were at each other s throats on thursday night , they were practically arm in arm , tagteaming trump this supported the notion that none of trump s rivals maintains much hope anymore of exceeding his delegate count what they 're banking on is the ability to gather enough delegates between them , and to hold trump s tally in check , so that he finishes with a plurality but not a majority and the nominee is decided at the convention i'm going to play pollyanna , minus the long blond hair and the bow , and remark on a refreshing development over the last few weeks and especially days more emphatically and unequivocally than at any recent juncture that i can recall , republican leaders and standard bearers are saying that their party has no tolerance for any racism , no room for any sexism , no forgiveness for bigotry there have always been republicans , many of them , who felt this way passionately , but they often spoke in muffled voices or chose to keep silent there were racist , sexist , bigoted voters whom they were all too happy to have a party needs to reach the 50percent mark to win elections , and it makes ugly deals and unseemly compromises to cross that threshold but disgust with trump and a recognition of the damage that he could do have prompted many of the republican party s stewards to make unwavering statements and articulate principles that they 'll be judged by and maybe even have to live up to down the line trump has reconnected them with their soul or rather , if you want to be a cynic , forced them to find one maybe the detour down his pants will amount to something more and better , in the end , than phallic braggadocio
west indies stands atop the cricket world after its double triumph in the world twenty20 , when it became the first country to win the men s and women s titles in the same championship but even as its players celebrated sunday , there were reminders that made their triumph a surprise there was genuine joy as both the men s and women s teams danced on the field in kolkata , india , after the presentation of the men s trophy but there was also open anger from the west indies men s captain , darren sammy , who used the platform of a live television interview to express his grievances with the west indies cricket board i really want to thank the heads of caricom throughout the tournament they have been supporting the team , he said , referring to a flow of messages from the nations and states in the west indies region and i'm yet to hear from our own cricket board that is very disappointing sammy reminded his audience that the participation of his team had been in doubt until a few weeks before the tournament started because of the latest in a long series of contractual disputes between the board and the players at the same time , he said , the dispute had helped pull his team together we had a lot of issues we felt disrespected by our board , he said , adding a reference by the former england player and television commentator , mark nicholas , who called west indies a team without brains he continued all these things before the tournament just brought this team together his comments came less than an hour after west indies became the first men s team to win the world twenty20 twice its victory over england had echoes of baseball s fabled shot heard round the world , the walkoff home run by bobby thomson that won the national league pennant for the new york giants in 1951 over the brooklyn dodgers this was four shots rather than one to win , but they were no less remarkable west indies needed 19 runs , usually considered an impossible target , from the final over to beat england , and batsman carlos brathwaite struck english bowler ben stokes over the boundaries for four consecutive sixes stokes was visibly devastated but was cleared of blame by his captain , eoin morgan , who said england s total of 155 had been well short of what was needed and that his bowlers had done brilliantly to put england in a position where it could win each team s innings followed a similar pattern , with the loss of three early wickets followed by determined comebacks as the game went on , england looked as if it had an increasing stranglehold on west indies , despite the resistance of marlon samuels , whose 85 not out is the highest ever individual score in a world twenty20 final but then came brathwaite s barrage to win it for west indies samuels was named man of the match , while the indian star virat kohli was named the tournament s best player the victory by the west indies women was perhaps even more joyful for the players , as they won the title for the first time , beating the threetime defending champion australia i do n't think it has sunk in yet , west indies captain stafanie taylor , the tournament s top player , told reporters when we wake up in the morning , it s going to be like , is this the real trophy \? ' i will ask myself , is this real \? ' when we touch down in the caribbean , that s when it is going to hit you taylor also had a message for the west indian cricket authorities we have to move on from there , not just enjoy , look at it as a steppingstone we do n't want to be stuck here we definitely need some infrastructure , like in england and australia australia had looked set for an unbeatable total when its captain , meg lanning , and elyse villani played hardhitting innings of 52 , but it lost the momentum when deandra dottin held australia to a single run in its final over and its total to just below 150 taylor and hayley matthews at 18 the youngest woman to play in a world twenty20 final started slowly but soon caught up they scored 120 before matthews was dismissed for 66 taylor fell for 59 just before the final runs were scored on a wild throw by an australian fielder it was a slightly anticlimactic end , but none of the west indian players and coaches who surged onto the field or the men s squad , who joined the celebrations before heading to the locker room before their own match complained about the result there is plenty , as sammy s comments show , to put right in west indian cricket , but its happiest day in 20 years was not a bad place to start
on oct 26 , 1981 , a beautiful fall monday in new york , a small group of cbs sports officials gathered in the executive dining room at the network building at west 52nd street and sixth avenue , the dark granite heap known as black rock after a sumptuous lunch served on fine china , a vote was on the agenda the winner of the poll would become the network s top nfl playbyplay voice and the partner of john madden , the new primary color commentator for cbs s football coverage the loser was , of all broadcasters , vin scully yes , that vin scully , the legendary voice of the los angeles dodgers and major league baseball broadcasts , now in his 67th and final year behind the microphone the veneration scully has received during his victory lap this season is well earned as one of the game s foremost raconteurs , the 88yearold scully is widely considered among the best in the business but there was a time when his trademark wordiness and deliberate pace cost him a prime gig and the chance to work with one of football s biggest personalities cbs sports had little prestige in the spring of 1981 when terry o'neil , then 31 , became an executive producer a fallen wunderkind , o'neil had risen quickly through the ranks at abc , at the time considered by many the leading broadcast sports network he had been producer of the highestrated show in sports television at the time , monday night football , but had lasted only a few weeks his mistake was to run afoul of the show s star , howard cosell , who ran o'neil off the show and eventually off abc \( a side note scully had been considered for the original playbyplay role on monday night football but could not escape his baseball contract to take the job \) o'neil was hired by the president of cbs sports , van gordon sauter , a bearish man with \( he is also a brotherinlaw of gov jerry brown of california \) , and given the mandate to turn around the entire operation that included remaking the announcing teams for the nfl , then , as now , the network s most important sports property o'neil made the operation more professional , but it was sauter who saw the potential in a former coach and everyman who had completed two undistinguished seasons as a cbs analyst madden he 'd only done a handful of games to that point , o'neil said , and none of them were sent to new york audiences i had never seen him live on the air after hunting up tapes of madden s work on games and watching his , o'neil was convinced he was obviously a great personality waiting to burst , o'neil said once it was agreed upon at cbs that madden would become the star , sauter gave o'neil new marching orders find him a partner ! ' a seasoned hand was required to guide the nascent color analyst cbs was fortunate to have two top choices , even having let two promising young announcers , bob costas and al michaels , slip to the competition was entrenched in the top slot , but there were two concerns first , summerall , a former giants kicker with a basso profundo voice , had taken to drinking in the broadcast booth with his partner , tom brookshier , and his work had suffered as a result second , sauter hugely preferred another cbs broadcaster , scully in 1975 , scully reduced his workload with the dodgers to assume a more frequent national presence on cbs , including prestigious assignments like the masters and less distinguished ones , like celebrity challenge of the sexes he also called regional football games for the network sauter thought it was time to elevate the elegant scully to a more prominent role the two men shared a powerful agent , ed hookstratten , and it was widely assumed in television circles that the fix was in the rumors were that it was a done deal , o'neil said o'neil , however , strongly preferred summerall , thinking that his terse style would make a better combination with the energetic and verbose madden than the similarly loquacious scully it was a question of the pacing , the timing , o'neil said in televised football , replays are a tremendous part of the production o'neil said the better person to frame madden would be summerall the decision carried extra weight because cbs would broadcast that season s  sauter and i went back and forth for a few weeks , o'neil said i hoped it would remain private , but , of course , it did n't the sports media world was alive with the gossip that , as o'neil put it , the new kid from abc was already in trouble with his boss he added , the only hail mary i had to achieve the correct outcome was to suggest that we listen to both teams together in actual game action o'neil suggested that cbs put off a final decision until after the eighth week of the nfl season scully would work four games with madden in september while summerall was working the tennis tournament then , in october , when scully jumped to cbs radio for the baseball postseason , madden would work four games with summerall i knew it was no way to treat two guys on the way to the broadcasting hall of fame , o'neil said we tried to camouflage it in the press the new kid , being me , needs to see the personnel at work , that sort of thing but it inevitably took on the feeling of a faceoff for the role i belatedly realized there was going to be a loser , and it would be awkward it swiftly became apparent that o'neil s initial judgment had been correct summerall s concision worked far better with the bombastic madden than did scully s pull up a chair storytelling once you saw the two combos on the air , o'neil said , it was very easy to see only one man sauter remained unconvinced speaking of the maddenscully pairing , o'neil said that sauter could have bruteforced it on me if he wanted to instead , o'neil persuaded his boss to take a straw poll , including votes from a halfdozen other cbs sports lieutenants in late october , and just after that lunch in the cbs executive dining room , the executives voted one by one for summerall sauter went around the table , o'neil said , saving him for last o'neil recalled the moment i began to agree with the rest of the guys well , not to echo what s already been said , but ' that sort of thing before i got any further , sauter slammed his fist down on the table , rattling the china i know what you think ! ' he yelled outflanked , sauter relented , and summerall was given the top spot o'neil said , the fact sauter allowed himself to be outvoted tells you a lot about him there was one tricky detail left someone had to tell scully that he had lost a broadcasting contest the job fell to o'neil in my na vet , i thought i could sell it as a positive , he said but i did n't handle it well scully was across town , in a hotel , preparing to call game 6 of the world series between the yankees and the dodgers for cbs radio , when the telephone rang in his room o'neil said , i offered to come over to talk to him , but he said , just tell me' o'neil tried some hamhanded spin , telling scully that he had good news scully would be working the rest of the season with hank stram and would call two playoff games , including the nfc championship game he left out the fact that the super bowl would be called by the winner of the competition , summerall , who went on to work with madden for the next 20 seasons \( they moved together to fox in 1994 \) i should have just said that the decision has been made , in pat s favor , o'neil said indeed , scully did not see any good news i understood his disappointment , o'neil said , but it went beyond that scully was spitting mad his contract with cbs was nearing its completion , and he soon began to seek other broadcast homes by the spring of 1982 , he had left cbs for nbc , taking over as the primary voice of its baseball coverage he turned down a hefty sum to stay at cbs , reportedly 10 million over seven years according to o'neil s 1989 memoir , the game behind the game , scully told cbs management that the two huge factors in his decision to leave were his loss of the vote to summerall and the good news phone call from o'neil scully finished the 1981 season with stram , including a memorable call of the nfc championship game , which pitted the dallas cowboys against the san francisco 49ers o'neil produced the game from candlestick park and worried about tensions backstage , but scully took the high road he was always professional , as you would expect , o'neil said we did the game together without any problems indeed , the game became a classic when joe montana threw the winning touchdown pass in the bay area gloaming , with dwight clark hauling in what would later be called the catch scully s call of the moment , while not as iconic as his famous descriptions of kirk gibson s world series home run in 1988 \( she is gone ! \) or sandy koufax s perfect game in 1965 \( when he wrote his name in capital letters in the record books , that k' stands out even more than the oufax' \) , was superb , hitting hard on dwiiiiiight claaaaaark ! his voice rising an octave or two to tower above the roar of the delirious home fans it was his last nfl game scully s only comment for this article was to remember thinking as he boarded a plane out of san francisco that this was a hell of a game to quit doing football the thought that scully might be as synonymous with the pigskin as he is with the hardball is a tantalizing one but it is hard to argue that cbs erred in selecting summerall to work with madden o'neil has no regrets , save for the clumsiness in how he told a broadcasting titan that he had been passed over and he remains a fan of scully s work i thought then , and still do now , that he s a legend , he said
sydney , australia it was on a recent trip to indonesia that , as a male bureaucrat sounded forth on a vast span of subjects without being asked to do so , i realized that the english language was in need of a new addition the manologue this otherwise perfectly charming man droned on and on , issuing a steady stream of words as i sat cramped in a tiny room with a group of fellow journalists and squinted at the labels on the soda cans hospitably placed on a table in front of us finally , i deciphered the words herbal to release trapped wind after several minutes during which i silently prayed none of my colleagues would reach for a drink , the official at last uttered the words , now , to answer your question so why did we get so many words between the question asked and the answer given \? why were they spoken at all \? and how can you stem such extraneous , longwinded trains of thought \? how can you politely say to a prolix associate , as a tv host might we 're almost out of time can you keep this short \? above all , why do so many men do this \? it was not the first time one of us had asked a question about a minor issue during our study tour of the bustling , gridlocked capital jakarta and been treated to a largely unrelated exposition on an entirely different idea our schedule was jammed with politicians , diplomats , ministers and editors from indonesia and australia , important men who were used to occupying space , time and attention , and would talk at numbing length the perfect conditions , in other words , for an epidemic of manologues the manologue takes many forms , but is characterized by the proffering of words not asked for , of views not solicited and of arguments unsought it is underwritten by the doubtful assumption that the audience will naturally be interested , and that this interest will not flag and that when it comes to speeches or commentary , longer is better the prevalence of the manologue is deeply rooted in the fact that men take , and are allocated , more time to talk in almost every professional setting women selfcensor , edit , apologize for speaking men expound of course , some women can be equally longwinded , but it is far less common the fact that this tendency is masculine has been well established in social science the larger the group , the more men are to speak \( unless it is in a social setting like a lunch break \) one study , by researchers at brigham young university and princeton , found that when women are outnumbered , they speak for between a quarter and a third less time than the men men also talk more directly women hedge they use more phrases like kind of , probably or maybe , as well as more fillers like um , ah and i mean they also turn sentences into questions , seeking affirmation is n't it \? women are interrupted more , by both men and women it is also clear that the more powerful men become , the more they speak this would seem a natural correlation , but the same is not true for women the reason for this , according to a yale , is that women worry about negative consequences that is , a backlash if they are more voluble troublingly , the study found that their fears were well founded , as both male and female listeners were quick to think these women were talking too much , too aggressively in other words , men are for speaking , while women are punished the problem is global and endemic across all media female characters in disney films today than they used to even princesses get a minority of the speaking lines in films in which they 're the principal in the 2013 animated movie frozen , for example , male characters get 59 percent of the lines a quick search for best monologues in film or movies reveals that they are almost all male if you took princess leia out of star wars , the total speaking time for female characters is 63 seconds out of the original s 386 minutes one new zealand found that in formal contexts calling for expository speech , like seminars , tv discussions and classroom debates , men talk more often and for longer women use words to explore , men to explain so here is the conundrum including women is not the same as hearing women as the princeton and brigham young study noted , having a seat at the table is very different than having a voice women at the table will attest to finding themselves talked over , cut off , interrupted or forced to politely listen to reams of lengthy speeches the required for women to speak more are , not surprisingly , that more women are present , and that women are leading according to a , female students spoke more when a female instructor was in the classroom one leading australian current affairs television show , , came up with an obvious yet smart response after a review found that the program featured a greater number of male panelists , who were asked more questions and spoke longer , the producers promised to publish data documenting not just the show s gender balance , but accounting for how much time guests spoke we wo n't get the voice share perfect straight away , the show s producer , amanda collinge , but we are actively trying to improve , and being open about it but if you 're a man who wants to counter your manologue tendency , try this when you hear yourself saying , now , to answer your question , ask yourself whether there was a good reason you did n't start at exactly that point otherwise , these manologues may never , ever end

when doctors and nurses arrived at room 834 just after 11 am , a college student admitted to the hospital hours earlier lay motionless on the floor , breathing shallowly , a sheet draped over his body a houston police officer with a cut on his head was being helped onto a stretcher , while another hovered over the student blood smeared the floor and walls what happened \? asked dr daniel arango , a surgical resident at the hospital , st joseph medical center the student , 26yearold alan pean , had come to the hospital for treatment of possible , accidentally striking several cars while pulling into the parking lot kept overnight for monitoring of minor injuries , he never saw a psychiatrist and became increasingly delusional he sang and danced naked in his room , occasionally drifting into the hall when two nurses coaxed him into a gown , he refused to have it fastened following protocol , a nurse summoned security , even though he was not aggressive or threatening soon , from inside the room , there was shouting , sounds of a scuffle and a loud pop during an altercation , two offduty houston police officers , moonlighting as security guards , had shocked mr pean with a , fired a bullet into his chest , then handcuffed him i thought of the hospital as a beacon , a safe haven , said mr pean , who survived the wound just millimeters from his heart last aug 27 i ca n't quite believe that i ended up shot like mr pean , patients seeking help at hospitals across the country have instead been injured or killed by those guarding the institutions medical centers are not required to report such encounters , so little data is available and health experts suspect that some cases go unnoticed police blotters , court documents and government health reports have identified more than a dozen in recent years they have occurred as more and more american hospitals are arming guards with guns and tasers , setting off a fierce debate among health care officials about whether such steps along with greater reliance on law enforcement or military veterans improve safety or endanger patients the same day mr pean was shot , a patient with problems an offduty police officer working security at a hospital in garfield heights , ohio last month , a hospital security with bipolar illness in lynchburg , va two psychiatric patients died , one in utah , another in ohio , after guards repeatedly shocked them with tasers in pennsylvania and indiana , hospitals have been disciplined by government health officials or opened inquiries after guards used stun guns against patients , including a woman bound with restraints in bed hospitals can be dangerous places from 2012 to 2014 , health care institutions reported a 40 percent increase in violent crime , with more than 10 , 000 incidents mostly directed at employees , by the international association for healthcare security and safety assaults linked to gangs , drug dealing and homelessness spill in from the streets , domestic disputes involving hospital personnel play out at work , and disruptive patients lash out in recent years , dissatisfied relatives even shot two prominent surgeons in baltimore and near boston to protect their corridors , 52 percent of medical centers reported that their security personnel carried handguns and 47 percent said they used tasers , according to a 2014 more than double just three years before institutions that prohibit them argue that such weapons and security guards not adequately trained to work in medical settings add a dangerous element in an already tense environment they say many other steps can be taken to address problems , particularly with people who have a mental illness massachusetts general hospital in boston , for example , sends some of its security officers through the state police academy , but the strongest weapon they carry is pepper spray , which has been used only 11 times in 10 years in new york city s public hospital system , which runs several of the 20 busiest emergency rooms in the country , security personnel carry nothing more than plastic wrist restraints \( like many other hospitals , the system coordinates with the local police for crises its staff cannot handle \) tasers and guns send a bad message in a health care facility , said antonio d martin , the system s executive vice president for security i have some concerns about even having uniforms because i think that could agitate some patients but many hospitals say that with proper safeguards some restrict armed officers to highrisk areas like emergency rooms and parking areas and supervision , weapons save lives and defuse threatening situations the cleveland clinic , which has placed metal detectors in its emergency room , has its own fully armed police force and hires offduty officers as well the university of california medical centers at irvine and san diego and small community hospitals are among the more than 200 facilities that use stun guns produced by taser international , which has courted hospitals as a lucrative new market i 've worked in systems where everyone has a firearm and an intermediate weapon , and i 've worked in systems where a call to security meant the plumber and every ablebodied man would respond , said david larose , past president of the health care security association how much has your system thought about safety and security \? in some places that s a 2 or 3 in some places it s a 10 after mr pean s shooting , st joseph s chief executive , mark bernard , said the officers were justified the hospital said it was reviewing its practices but declined to respond to questions the houston police department , citing an internal investigation , declined to comment or to make the officers available for interviews , and released only a heavily redacted version of its report on the shooting this account is drawn from a review by federal health investigators , medical records , criminal complaints and interviews with medical personnel and family members mr pean had expected an apology after the shooting instead , during four days in intensive care , with two counts of felony assault on a police officer they accused him of attacking with four deadly weapons an unspecified piece of furniture , a wall fixture , a tray table and his hands james kennedy , a lawyer representing mr pean , says his client disputes that he was the aggressor and other allegations by the police , but cannot discuss specifics until the charges are resolved his family has filed complaints with the justice department and health care regulators , including the centers for medicare and medicaid services , which provides funding to most american hospitals after an emergency investigation , the agency faulted st joseph for the shooting , saying it had created immediate jeopardy to the health and safety of its patients threatening to withdraw federal money , the agency demanded restrictions on the use of weapons a family with haitian and mexican roots who settled in mcallen , tex , the peans were shocked that mr pean s effort to get medical aid ended so badly though his father , harold pean , and a halfdozen other relatives are physicians , they said they had no idea that guns could be used against patients after watching the nation roiled by the shootings of unarmed black men by police officers over the last year or so , the family now wonders whether race contributed to alan s nearfatal encounter we never thought that would happen to us , dr pean said in his family of highachievers , alan pean \( pronounced payon \) is the softspoken and mellow middle sibling , into yoga , video games and pickup football christian , 28 , now a medical student at mount sinai in new york , is the type a leader dominique , 24 , is following his path , applying to medical school while pursuing a master s degree alan , who had never been in any sort of trouble , is probably the nicest of us three , dominique said like many people with mental health issues , he did not get a clearcut diagnosis after a brief delusional episode in 2008 , he was hospitalized for a more severe recurrence the next year , at the end of his second year at the university of texas he was kept for a week and told that he had possible bipolar disorder , though his symptoms did not reappear for years even after he tapered off medication he was prone to bouts of sadness and anxiety , he recalled in an interview , but had attended college , taking breaks from time to time , and worked for a while as a medical assistant back home in mcallen , near the mexican border though he had smoked marijuana regularly to help tame his symptoms , he said in an interview , he quit last summer when he enrolled at the university of houston to complete his bachelor s degree just days into the semester , though , he barely slept and found himself increasingly agitated and delusional on aug 26 , he talked repeatedly on the phone with his parents and brothers , who tried to calm him but worried that he sounded disoriented christian had been concerned enough that he called the houston police to do a welfare check on his brother at his apartment , though no one answered the door when officers arrived when mr pean sounded worse in the evening , his family summoned a fraternity brother in houston to take him to an emergency room his parents would fly in the next morning but mr pean did not wait his mind vacillating between the knowledge that he needed psychiatric medication and encroaching delusions that he was a barack obama impersonator or a cyborg robot agent who was being pursued by assassins , he said , he got into his white lexus and drove at high speed to st joseph medical center , the only major hospital in downtown houston turning into the parking lot just before midnight , he crashed , nearly totaling his vehicle as mr pean was helped into the emergency room and onto a stretcher by paramedics and nurses , he recalled , he yelled i'm manic ! i'm manic ! he was seen immediately by a doctor from the trauma team to assess his injuries \( scans and exams showed none \) the physician s initial note , minutes after arrival , lists the young man s history of bipolar disorder his father and brother , in separate phone calls to the emergency room , and a family friend who came to the hospital , alerted the staff about his psychiatric issues , they recalled nonetheless , mr pean was admitted for observation to room 834 on a surgical floor the diagnoses hand abrasion , , motor vehicle accident his toxicology tests were negative for alcohol , opiates , pcp or cocaine , records show \( they did disclose some thc , the active ingredient of marijuana , but the chemical remains in the body for many weeks \) while st joseph does have a psychiatric ward , mr pean was never seen by a psychiatrist or prescribed any psychiatric medicines before the shooting because he had complained of back pain , he was given flexeril , a muscle relaxant , which can exacerbate symptoms in interviews with the medicare investigators and notations in medical records , the nurses who cared for mr pean describe a man who had flashes of lucidity , but was increasingly restless and bizarre he pulled out the iv in his arm he thought it was 1989 he could not remember the car crash or why he was in a hospital but even in the throes of his illness , he was polite when a nurse told him to return to his room after he repeatedly emerged naked into the hall , he complied , she told investigators , with a yes ma'am , rightyo , ok ma'am though the trauma team had planned to discharge mr pean that morning , his parents were so alarmed when they arrived about 10 am that they insisted a psychiatrist see him as they waited for doctors to discuss their concerns , the peans went to their nearby hotel to try to rent a car and drive their son to a psychiatric facility in their 30minute absence , a nurse made the call to security at st joseph medical center , the security force included armed offduty police officers as well as unarmed civilian officers who responded to a call depended only on availability , according to the investigators' interview with the chief nursing officer the two men who arrived were houston police officers roggie v law , 53 , who is white , and oscar ortega , 44 , who is latino , each had decades on the force they supplemented their base salaries of about 64 , 000 by moonlighting at the hospital their records were unremarkable both had some commendations , and officer ortega had one distant fourday suspension for failing to submit an accident report houston police officers get 40 hours of crisis intervention training , according to the department the naacp and the greater houston coalition for justice , a civil rights group , have complained that local officers too often use their weapons , and repeatedly requested the appointment of an independent police review board from 2008 to 2012 , there were 121 police shootings , in which a quarter of the victims were unarmed , according to an investigation by the houston chronicle the two offduty officers had signed on with criterion healthcare security , a fouryearold staffing agency based in tennessee whose executives had previously managed prisons and owned gyms their training at st joseph consisted of an orientation and online instruction , which investigators found inadequate the facility had no clear guidance for the role , duties and responsibilities of the police officers they employ to provide security services , the medicare investigators' report said like many other security firms , criterion encourages applications from those with law enforcement or military backgrounds , who are trained to use weapons and to deal with volatile situations but working in health care settings requires a different mindset , security experts emphasize if they come from law enforcement or the military , i ask them directly , how would you respond differently here than if you encountered a criminal on a street in la or when you are kicking down a door in iraq \? ' said scott martin , the security director at the university of california , irvine , medical center you have to send the message that these are patients , they 're sick , the mental health population has rights and you need to be sensitive to that many mental health professionals strongly object to weapons in hospitals , saying they have numerous other means from talk therapy to cloth restraints and seclusion rooms to quickacting shots of to subdue patients if they pose a danger state mental health facilities typically do not allow guns or tasers on their premises even police officers are asked to check weapons at the door \( twentythree percent of shootings in emergency rooms involved someone grabbing a gun from a security officer , by dr gabor kelen , director of emergency medicine at johns hopkins medical school \) uniforms and weapons may , in fact , exacerbate delusions , since many psychotic patients are paranoid and , like alan pean , believe they are being pursued anthony o'brien , a researcher at the university of auckland , in new zealand , said , that s not a good thing , pointing something that looks like a gun at a patient with mental health issues when the two houston officers arrived on st joseph s eighth floor , they headed for room 834 unannounced , and unaccompanied by doctors , nurses or social workers , they went in , the door closing behind them racing upstairs to a code blue in room 834 , dr arango found a cluster of about 20 houston police officers in the hall , according to his interview with investigators when he pulled back the sheet covering mr pean , he saw that the patient was in handcuffs , his torso dotted with taser probes and a bloody wound on his upper chest it was only after the doctor noted the blood pooling around the young man , who began shouting that he was superman as the physician tried to examine the wound , that someone mentioned he had not only been hit with the taser , but also shot take the damn handcuffs off ! dr arango yelled , according to an employee initially combative and flailing , mr pean allowed a staff member to start an iv as she told him it s ok , alan , i'm a nurse we 're here to help within minutes , doctors placed him on a ventilator , inserted a tube into his chest and whisked him away for a scan , which showed that the bullet had fractured his fifth and sixth ribs , scattering metal fragments and causing extensive bleeding as it ripped through his chest according to a statement on the police department s website , alan struck one officer in the head , causing a , when they arrived in the room officer law shocked the patient with a taser , to no apparent effect , and then officer ortega , fearing for their safety , shot mr pean after the shooting , his father said officers asked over and over if alan had a criminal record the next day , christian pean asked sgt steve murdock , a houston police investigator , why the officers had to shoot his brother in a phone conversation , christian recalled , the sergeant replied , let s just say the term tasmanian devil' comes to mind it was like a big whirlwind , he went on everything was fair game objects , chairs , eating trays , everything was being thrown an ambiguity in allowed alan pean s conversion from delusional patient to felony suspect if a patient throws a tray at a nurse and the staff responds with restraints , it can be considered a health care incident if the same patient throws the same tray at a police officer , even one offduty , who shoots in response , the encounter is subject to a criminal investigation while mr pean was in the intensive care unit , he was handcuffed to his bed , even though he was heavily sedated , with a houston police officer standing guard his family had to post 60 , 000 bail days later so he could be discharged from the hospital mr pean s felony case is likely to go before a grand jury in the coming months under the care of a psychiatrist and on medication , mr pean left texas behind living with his brother in new york , he is finishing his degree at hunter college and planning to go to graduate school in public health but the day before christmas , mr pean learned that prosecutors had brought a new charge reckless driving against him , referring to his race to the hospital accompanied by his father , he flew to houston in five hours of processing at the harris county detention center , mr pean was interviewed by a detention officer , photographed for a mug shot and fingerprinted being paraded around was really stressful , he said did they not understand what i 'd gone through \? i 'd been shot in a hospital room by an officer

verona , italy in a country famed for its fine leather products and fashion sense , shining shoes was never a particularly exalted profession the practice was imported during world war ii , when american and british soldiers paid young boys on the street to buff up their boots , sometimes in return for chocolate and cigarettes even one of the ways to call it , as described in vittorio de sica s 1946 movie of the same name comes from the neapolitan dialect that imitates the sound of the english shoeshine and it was certainly never a woman s job but do n't tell any of that to eleonora lovo she is the latest example of how women have moved into the decidedly outoffashion trade , once exclusively the domain of men , and even made it hip today the 43yearold ms lovo walks around verona in black men s shoes , a stretchy belowthe knee skirt , a white shirt and ample , black oval eyeglasses from her forearm hangs a rectangular brown leather bag full of attentively polished shoes , which she picks up and returns to clients herself ms lovo s laboratory is a corner of her family s living room sitting on a wooden chair on a recent day , surrounded by art books , beeswax , colored cream polishes , all sorts of brushes and a cuckoo clock , she started brushing off the dust and dirt from one of her babies , and described the work that is her passion i do n't think it s a job for men only , ms lovo said i have always loved men s shoes they have a history , for the models , the ways they are sewed together women s shoes simply do n't the second woman in to gain renown for choosing the job in recent years , ms lovo began her business out of her home , and at several business congresses , hotels and shoe fairs , in 2014 from there her reputation spread but before she started , she learned the art and craft of treating leather from books and at a local tannery , and started polishing shoes for her family and friends while i was learning , i once ruined a friend s fine shoes , she recalled with anguish i could n't sleep that night my challenge is to give them a new life , she added , smiling , while cleaning a pair of decadeold brown american shoes with a blue microfiber cloth soaked in a delicate liquid detergent my favorite thing about my job is to see my customers' faces when they unpack their polished shoes while she polishes mostly men s shoes , ms lovo owes her success mostly to women , she conceded on one hand , she has taken the place of the traditional italian housewife , whose chores included cleaning shoes now most women work outside the home and no longer have the time for the task on the other hand , her very first promoters were her fellow soccer moms some moms first asked me to clean their leather bags , and then they spread the word , she said , explaining that women are also her principal promoters on social media men , in turn , trust women for these kinds of jobs for them , it s like entrusting their shoes to their mothers or girlfriends ms lovo is not italy s first shoeshine woman in 2000 , another female entrepreneur , rosalina dallago , 51 , opened a shoeshine shop in rome s city center a former model and later a restaurateur , ms dallago has gently brushed the shoes of italy s elites , including the actor and assorted politicians her tiny , narrow shop , she likes to say , is nested between the sacred the san lorenzo in lucina church and the profane the lower house of parliament you know , when i took over his shop , the 72yearold owner gave me his brushes , ms dallago said , gently passing wooden brushes made of horsehair it was a real baton passing i felt like crying in 16 years , ms dallago s career rapidly expanded she has run a shoeshine corner inside fiumicino airport , and another in a roman club had a 12minute national television program and held entrepreneurship courses for women she collaborates with a female cobbler all of her enterprises are managed by women her business , portrayed as a glamorous and sexy new way of shoeshining , made headlines in publications all over the world , from germany to japan her fame , however , still did not generate much competition until ms lovo came along , 500 kilometers , or about 310 miles , to the north it s a job that makes your hands dirty , and stay bent all day long , ms dallago said with a smirk not many women , and people in general , like it traditionally , shoeshining is considered a humble job in italy , one not in demand for decades its ranks grew even thinner in recent years while it is common to see shoeshiners at international airports or in shopping areas in the united states or britain , a city like rome had fewer than 10 shoeshiners even in the golden era of the 1950s and all of them were men it was a historically mendominated job only now things are changing a bit , said tommaso cancellara , the chief executive at micam , italy s main shoe fair mr cancellara said that although shoeshining was still considered a humble job and clients could be somewhat haughty in italy , the use of professional shoe cream polishes was on the rise stores offering a barbershop , shoeshining service and shirt shopping all together have opened since 2014 in cities around italy that to me suggests that italians are fed up with the crisis , and at least enjoy a moment of personal joy , he said , adding that men no longer spend much money on holidays or clothing , but they do treat themselves a bit they have their shoes professionally shined and go to the barber s shop , mr cancellara explained i doubt any man complains it s a woman attending his shoes being a woman in the profession , ms lovo and ms dallago agree , can indeed be an advantage the latter recounted flowers or cartier boxes she had

ise , japan eleven united states presidents have served since president harry s truman decided to drop an atomic weapon on hiroshima , and none has set foot in that traumatized city in the 71 years since , at least not while in office intends to end that streak with his visit on friday , a decision that speaks volumes not only about his presidency but also about the increasingly worrisome struggle among powers great and small in east asia mr obama s predecessors had good reasons to avoid hiroshima none wanted to be seen by american voters as apologizing for a decision that many historians even today believe , on balance , saved lives and there were worries about how such a visit would be viewed in , south korea and other countries in asia that suffered from the brutal killing machine that was imperial  but mr obama and his closest aides have become increasingly disdainful of what they view as  no american president had visited cuba in nearly 90 years mr obama did none had visited myanmar he has gone twice few saw merit in negotiating with iran s autocratic mullahs mr obama struck a nuclear deal with the iranians that he ranks among his greatest accomplishments and in vietnam this week , he lifted a decadesold embargo on military sales mr obama has made clear that he will not apologize for the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki , but with no election left for himself he cares far less that any remorse he expresses might be included in what opponents have caricatured as an of foreign cities mr obama also hopes a visit to hiroshima will further his efforts to curb the world s stockpile of , a signature issue for him and an important reason he won the 2009 nobel peace prize as the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon , the united states has a moral responsibility to act , he said in prague just 10 weeks after becoming president in a recent , mr obama admitted that his efforts to reduce the world s nuclear risks had resulted in only modest progress in at least not seeing a huge increase in nuclear stockpiles his record on nuclear nonproliferation is mixed with russia , he struck a deal ratified in 2010 to limit weapons , but president vladimir v putin has shown no signs of wanting to go further under the 2015 deal with iran , the government there and mr obama s annual nuclear security summit meetings and other efforts out of countries like ukraine and chile but his push to could cause a new arms race , and nuclear weapons programs in north korea and pakistan have arguably made the world less safe during his tenure north korea is the worst example , but we also have other parts of the world where you 're still seeing the development of new nuclear technologies that could be very dangerous , mr obama said this week the calculus about how a visit to hiroshima would be seen elsewhere in asia has changed although an estimated 40 , 000 to 50 , 000 in the two bombings in 1945 more than any nonjapanese ethnic group koreans have long been wary of a presidential trip to hiroshima , fearing it could be interpreted as an apology for a war that ended japan s occupation of korea more broadly , there is unease in south korea , china and other asian countries that mr obama s visit will amount to an endorsement of prime minister shinzo abe s campaign to move japan beyond guilt over its militarist past and toward his vision of a normal country with a larger role in global affairs mr abe has promoted a version of history that plays down japan s wartime transgressions , and has moved to give the military limited powers to fight in foreign conflicts , shedding pacifist constraints in place since world war ii pressed by washington , mr abe in december on the issue of comfort women , sex slaves taken by the japanese military from korea and other nations , long seen as an open wound to koreans many in south korea as insufficient , but president park geunhye accepted it and mr abe appeared to win credit in washington we will acknowledge the korean experience when we have opportunities , but we do n't think we have to choose between different people s histories , benjamin rhodes , a deputy national security adviser , said in an interview south korea has not issued a formal statement either for or against mr obama s visit to hiroshima ms park left wednesday on a tour of africa as disputes with china mount , the white house has also become less concerned about how the visit will be received in beijing one of washington s great parlor games involves whether tokyo or beijing has the president s favor for the first years of mr obama s presidency , many japan hands were convinced that the obama team favored china , seeing it as the only indispensable asian nation and crucial to a climatechange pact but with a climate agreement in paris concluded and mounting concern about china s territorial claims in the south china and east china seas , many in washington see a turn torward tokyo i think the debate tipped last year in japan s favor after china built airfields in the south china sea , said michael j green , who served as a senior adviser on asia during the george w bush administration mr abe , meanwhile , has worked diligently to tighten japan s already close embrace of the united states new guidelines written last year will further integrate the two militaries , and an unpopular statesecrets law passed in 2014 was intended , in part , to make intelligence sharing easier along with new security laws that allow japanese forces to engage in combat missions overseas , these moves have won mr abe plaudits in washington the visit to hiroshima is a gesture of respect for the japanese people , mr rhodes said , adding it s always been evident that it would be meaningful for the japanese people to pay this kind of visit , and insofar as it helps us to advance this alliance , that s important china has criticized the visit as an opportunity for japan to recast itself as a victim rather than aggressor in world war ii , and for the united states to cozy up to japan , which the official communist party newspaper , people s daily , derided as mr obama s righthand man in east asia we hope that when inviting other state leaders to visit hiroshima , japan bears one thing in mind , lu kang , the foreign ministry spokesman , said this month that is , it will never tread on the path of militarism again , as it once brought unspeakable suffering to its people and people of asia and around the world even in tokyo , there is some ambivalence about mr obama s visit mr abe is expected to get a political lift , and ordinary japanese have embraced mr obama s support for nuclear disarmament but the policy establishment is not keen to be drawn into a new debate over history , and some worry that mr abe may come under pressure to visit pearl harbor in return and while japan is publicly committed to the abolition of nuclear weapons , it is also anxious about the potential threat from north korea , and to a lesser extent , china
santa clara , calif here s a perfect ending for or even an imperfect one at least it s an ending 24 , 10 on sunday night , manning won his second but this time , in contrast to the last time , in 2007 , he should feel equal parts relieved and grateful for his super bowl ring bling because this time , manning was the sidekick , not the star the broncos' defense won the game it scored the team s first touchdown when linebacker von miller , the game s most valuable player , sacked panthers quarterback cam newton defensive end malik jackson recovered the fumble to score none of those broncos ever backed down manning ended with no touchdowns and one interception he finished 13 of 23 for 141 yards to end a personally rickety season now he should exhale and end his career manning , who has been coy about whether he will retire this year , should acknowledge that 18 seasons as an nfl quarterback have been more than enough at 39 , he should feel lucky to have lasted this long with an aging , creaky body and an oftrepaired neck this season , he missed six games with a foot injury before that injury , he threw 17 interceptions , a league high , and had his worst completion percentage , 599 percent , since his rookie year yet manning returned to a team that nearly ran on autopilot all the way to a super bowl victory to end sunday night , he should have stood at the center of levi s stadium and dropped the mike but players do n't think that way especially top ones like manning they like to drag out their answer when deciding whether to retire they ponder and consult and consider they make everyone else ponder and consider , too after the game , manning did n't announce whether he would retire instead , he said he would take the advice of the former nfl coach tony dungy and refrain from making an emotional decision he would take some time to reflect this has been an emotional week , an emotional night , manning said i want to celebrate with my family i'm going to drink a lot of beer tonight those are my priorities tonight priorities for tomorrow \? deciding whether he should come back for the money \? or come back because he would miss the spotlight \? what would persuade manning to just walk away \? i do n't know so many reasons to retire , maybe 150 to 200 reasons he might call his financial adviser to find that he really does n't need the millions he s set to make in 2016 because , miracle of miracles , he has made more than 200 million in his career \( not including endorsements or sponsorships \) he might read the sad and jarring , the former oakland raiders quarterback who died of colon cancer in july at age 69 last week , it was revealed that stabler , who was voted into the pro football hall of fame on saturday , had chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or cte , the degenerative brain disease thought to be caused by repeated blows to the head stabler s end came after years of cognitive decline he heard ringing in his head and worried that football had damaged his brain maybe manning saw my colleague john branch s about stabler and noticed that branch quoted dr ann mckee , chief of neuropathology at the va boston healthcare system and a professor of neurology and pathology at boston university school of medicine she examined stabler s brain the very severity of the disease , at least that we 're seeing in american football players , seems to correlate with the duration of play , mckee said the longer they play , the more severe we see it stabler s nfl career lasted 15 seasons three fewer than manning s , so far it could be that manning heard stabler s story and the stories of other former players who had the disease and made up his mind about leaving the league , win or lose , at the conclusion of this super bowl after all , he has two young children , 4yearold twins he might want to spend time with them , and be able to remember them , as the years go on maybe he would want to help marshall , one of those twins , learn how to write after the broncos beat the new england patriots in the afc championship last month , marshall was practicing his letters on a dryerase board in the locker room if peyton manning had put the boy s hand in his right hand to guide him , would he even have been able to feel his son s soft skin \? manning lost the feeling in his fingertips after his neck surgery in 2011 the former 49ers quarterback joe montana retired partly to spend time with his children , but he said he now regretted not being able to ski or snowboard or play basketball with them he told last week that he cannot straighten one of his legs because of a knee injury and that he ca n't really run or do much because of it montana , 59 , has neck issues that could lead to yet another neck fusion surgery and has nerve damage in an eye arthritis wracks his hands my hands have been , oh my gosh , in the middle of the night , they hurt like crazy , said montana , who played in the nfl for 15 seasons manning did n't miss an nfl start until he was 35 , when back and neck problems began haunting him he did n't take the hint a bell was tolling , reminding him to consider retirement now , four years later , that bell has gone silent after ringing so long , and so loudly , the clapper fell off this season , there was another clue for manning that enough was enough in december , reported that he had received shipments of human growth hormone , a drug banned by the nfl , from an indianapolis antiaging clinic the year he had neck surgery manning said that he never used the drug the situation has n't helped manning s reputation as the squeakyclean guy next door , and it did n't boost his appeal as a product pitchman , either the signs for manning to quit are everywhere , and manning should heed them now is the time to say goodbye he needs to hang up his cleats , for his sake and for the sake of his body and his brain and his children and his reputation even the panthers can see manning retiring now everybody wants to see him go out and perform at a high level and kind of ride off into the sunset , panthers linebacker thomas davis said before the super bowl why not a northern california sunset \? no better a backdrop for a beautiful , fitting finish
baltimore the have traveled almost a decade with on his current contract , weaving through dark corners and over rugged terrain his production and priorities have shifted through the years , but rodriguez has been a reliable attraction , a reason for fans to show up or tune in even this season , with the yankees stuck in last place in the american league east , rodriguez commands attention he struggled early and then started to hit , pulling within eight home runs of 700 for his career the meaning of those homers is a tiresome topic no matter how a hitter does it , smashing 692 homers stamps him as a slugger who will never be forgotten contextualize arod however you like , but never deny his star power the yankees , and most of their fans , made peace with rodriguez last season he returned from a yearlong drug suspension and belted 33 homers , helping the team to a wildcard berth humble , courteous , grateful name an adjective you would want from a chastened celebrity , and it applied to rodriguez once scrubbed from the team s giveaway calendar , rodriguez now has a replicabat day in his honor at yankee stadium the first 10 , 000 guests age 14 and younger will still receive their arod bat at the stadium on may 14 but rodriguez will not be using a real one in the game that day he was placed on the disabled list wednesday with a strained right hamstring i ca n't think of a worse time to go on the dl , rodriguez said obviously , the offense has been struggling , and i take a lot of pride and responsibility in making sure that our offense plays well i talked to the team yesterday there s no reason why we ca n't score five runs per nine innings that should be a good par for us the yankees surpassed that standard on wednesday , beating the baltimore orioles by 70 to improve their record to 916 but they ranked 26th in runs per game before that , at 342 , and rodriguez was hitting just 194 in his last six games , though , he had gone 7 for 19 \( 368 \) with three homers it was a small sample , to be sure , but a flatlining patient can find hope in any blip usually you have two or three guys that rotate and carry the team , first baseman mark teixeira said take your no 1 hitter , your no 3 hitter and your no 5 hitter if they 're all doing well and a couple of guys are getting on in between , you 're scoring five or six runs a game well , none of us are doing that right now you have a big team slump rodriguez understands his standing in that framework after starting last season not knowing what to expect from himself , he was again a force in the lineup the yankees , whose leftleaning order faces more infield shifts than any other team , need rodriguez s thump that is the duty he signed up for after his last most valuable player season , in 2007 , when the yankees brought him back for 10 years and 275 million i enjoy it , rodriguez said i mean , the thing is , it s twofold no 1 , i'm in the middle of the lineup , but i'm also one of the few righthanded batters , which for our lineup is extremely important , especially with all the lefties that they throw at us the yankees' bigger problem is not losing rodriguez , who faded down the stretch after turning 40 in july it is relying so much on him in the first place it is hard to ask rodriguez , or the yankees' over30 freeagent power hitters teixeira , carlos beltran and brian mccann to be more than they are at this stage of their careers what they need are homegrown hitters who provide primeyears production at low cost they have none the injury to rodriguez gave the yankees a free shot at injecting new life into the lineup they resisted the old \( nick swisher \) and the new \( aaron judge \) in favor of another relief pitcher , the lefthander james pazos the middling rotation is a pressing problem , too we believe in them , manager joe girardi said of his hitters i'm not saying we 're going to have 13 pitchers the whole time , but it s what we decided to do without rodriguez as the designated hitter , the yankees can put other veterans there and use aaron hicks more often in the outfield that improves their defense and gives hicks , who is batting 067 with no homers , a chance to find his swing learning more about hicks , a former firstround draft pick who never quite established himself in minnesota , is the kind of thing the yankees should be doing now at 26 , he still has the chance to get better few other yankees do finding and developing true offensive stars is difficult , of course the yankees never had a chance to draft bryce harper , who went first to the washington nationals in 2010 , or manny machado , who went to the orioles two picks later but impact hitters do not always go in the top of round 1 mike trout was drafted 25th over all , josh donaldson 48th , nolan arenado 59th , giancarlo stanton 76th not to mention the many superstars signed internationally all teams have access to players like that trout , in fact , was chosen in a slot the yankees abandoned to sign teixeira but none of those players are on the team so the yankees are left to absorb a body blow when a 40yearold designated hitter falls to injury rodriguez makes things interesting , and that does count for something but most of his stature is based on his past the yankees need reasons to be excited about the present , and they do not have enough
athens when s threatened to sink the s single currency last summer , the rest of europe , led by chancellor of , ganged up to deliver the greek government a stern message overcome your domestic political problems and do what is necessary to hold the continent together eight months after agreed to do its part , it is the rest of europe that is failing to muster the will to address a threat to the bloc s unity , this time the continued influx of migrants from the middle east and beyond and greece , the main entry route for asylum seekers , has been largely left to fend for itself we are now in the situation where greece is essentially becoming a holding pen for refugees and is being asked to solve a problem created by other countries , said jens bastian , an economics consultant based in athens and a former member of the european commission s task force on greece you are basically putting the management of europe s migrant crisis at the doorstep of greece the chaos has saddled prime minister with the challenge of simultaneously handling growing numbers of migrants , while carrying out austerity measures and structural reforms required under the to avoid exiting the euro just as greece has fallen into yet another recession but if the situation is generating more despair in an already battered nation , it also holds the potential for mr tsipras to exert new leverage over the rest of europe with a possible ally in ms merkel , long seen in greece as a usurper of greek sovereignty and a dispenser of economic punishment perhaps more than any other european leader , ms merkel , who continues to welcome refugees from syria and iraq to despite intense opposition at home and among other governments , needs a deal to defuse the migrant problem she would find her job that much tougher if greece deteriorates further into humanitarian and political crisis with mrs merkel angered by decisions in austria and nine other countries to tighten their borders , trapping tens of thousands of migrants in greece , this creates an opportunity for a closer alliance between athens and berlin , said mujtaba rahman , the head of european analysis at the eurasia group in london the refugee crisis could win greece some bailout flexibility , he said some members of mr tsipras s fragile coalition government have also hinted they would like creditors to reduce some of greece s debt in exchange for greece bearing the burden of warehousing the migrants europe will not allow in there is little outward sign that european leaders are willing to link the two issues and let up on requirements in last summer s bailout plan for deep budget cuts and painful overhauls of many elements of the economy wolfgang sch uble , the german finance minister , warned on thursday in a speech at the london school of economics that the refugee crisis did not mean greece could relax its fiscal efforts of course , there is a new situation , the refugee crisis , and therefore greece needs beyond all discussion additional solidarity , he said this does not mean that greece should not continue to work to regain competitiveness yet , with dramatic scenes of thousands of migrants piled up at greece s northern border , enduring tear gas and increasingly unsanitary conditions , european officials moved with unusual speed this week to promise , about 770 million , in humanitarian assistance over the next three years , most of it for greece and they are intensifying their efforts to bottle up more of the migrants in turkey , before they can reach greece , with hopes of relocating those who qualify for asylum directly to the heart of europe but mr tsipras s challenge remains substantial , with political opponents coming at him from the far left and right the economy has continued to weaken since last summer , when greece imposed capital controls during turbulent negotiations with its creditors for a new bailout in exchange for accepting harsh austerity terms despite tentative signs that the worst was over , the economy has continued to contract after mr tsipras imposed new taxes and began cutting pensions further to comply with the terms of the bailout greece s overall unemployment rate has been stuck above 25 percent for more than two years , while the number of young people without jobs remains near 50 percent mr tsipras s biggest immediate challenge is to complete an overhaul of the nearbankrupt pension system , without which greece cannot move forward in talks with creditors on sorely needed debt relief the pressure from creditors has sparked raucous street protests in recent weeks the creditors have also delayed disbursing billions of euros in new bailout funds , citing slow progress by mr tsipras s government in implementing the austerity measures throughout last year , the government had effectively waved through migrants almost none of whom wanted to stay in the economically moribund country to germany and other prosperous nations where they wanted asylum but when the nations along the migrant trail decided to constrain the flow of people , the rest of europe warned greece that it could be kicked out of the schengen system of passportfree travel if it did not exercise control over its borders faced with an ultimatum , mr tsipras has moved to get new migrant registration centers operating on the islands and of refugee camps around athens and elsewhere at the same time , he has hardened his position with europe , demanding this week that the european union explicitly recognize that greece cannot assume all the responsibility by itself , and demanding sanctions for countries that do not take their share of refugees under a europewide relocation plan that has so far been a flop it s a huge challenge for tsipras because the nature of the crisis is changing , and rather than seeing refugees and migrants simply pass through , we 're now talking about having to find places to house them , said nick malkoutzis , the editor of , a political analysis website the one thing he ca n't let happen is for migrants and refugees to be left out in the open , where they become not only vulnerable to extremists , but turn into a focal point for the far right to try and rally support , he said in a peculiar reversal , analysts say , mr tsipras s greatest hope may lie with mrs merkel , who has steadfastly admonished other countries not to let greece plunge into chaos , and rebuked austria and the nine balkan states that shut their borders do you seriously believe that all the euro states that last year fought all the way to keep greece in the eurozone and we were the strictest can one year later allow greece to , in a way , plunge into chaos \? she said in a weekend interview with the public broadcaster ard yet on the streets of athens , few are buying talk of european solidarity this just shows you how notunited europe is , said jackie rogers , a briton who has lived in greece for nearly 40 years , sweeping her eyes over migrants scrambling for donated food , water and clothing at victoria square in central athens i think it suits northern european nations who do n't want the problem in their backyard to use greece as a dumping ground
paris milos raonic went down in straight sets at the on sunday to the spanish outsider albert ramosvi olas in the sort of cool , overcast and heavy conditions that attacking players have learned to rue on the red clay of roland garros bring on the grasscourt season , and the bighitting raonic , already a contender , will be much more of a conversation piece than usual raonic , a canadian , has hired as a coaching consultant , which means headlines and camera flashes galore before raonic , ranked no 9 in the world , so much as smacks one huge serve in anger at the all england club in late june it does n't seem like he s been able to do as well as certainly someone with his game could do , and i think he could win it , mcenroe said of raonic s chances at wimbledon , where he reached the semifinals in 2014 but has never been past the third round otherwise hopefully i can add that little bit and give him a little bit better understanding of how to take advantage of his attributes , his size he s a big strong , great , dedicated and smart kid and yet for a deeply rational young man like raonic , who likes to be the boss , hiring mcenroe is a surprising move , all the more so because he already had two coaches in riccardo piatti , an italian considered one of the game s better technicians , and carlos moy , a spaniard who , like mcenroe , was once no 1 could too many top chefs spoil the bouillabaisse \? at the end of the day , every coach i have is to some extent an adviser , raonic said after his 62 , 64 , 64 defeat in the fourth round and it s my job personally , out of everything i hear , to weigh what it s worth and weigh what is best for me i'm the ceo of milos raonic tennis that s it a former superstar who decides to coach is now on a wellblazed trail in tennis it began with jimmy connors coaching andy roddick in the 2000s and began in earnest with ivan lendl helping andy murray end britain s wimbledon singles drought in 2013 others have piled in , including am lie mauresmo , martina navratilova \( very briefly \) , michael chang , goran ivanisevic and mcenroe s former rivals stefan edberg and boris becker , with becker helping novak djokovic strengthen his grip on the men s game but none of these tennis luminaries has had quite the media footprint at the time of their appointment as mcenroe he is the most prominent englishlanguage voice in the sport as a commentator and is still , at 57 , a bigger magnet than most of today s contenders , including raonic he announced his own hiring during his daily show on eurosport at roland garros , delivering the news as a lyric while strumming a guitar i thought that was a different way to announce it , because i do n't do social media do n't tweet , do facebook , any of it , he said when we spoke on sunday i actually prefer talking to people but can mcenroe really sublimate his ego and put himself at the service of a 25yearold player \? i think so i mean i hope so , mcenroe said that s what we are going to find out i'm hoping this is not a oneshot thing i think it would be incredibly difficult to make an impact that quickly i think it s a process mcenroe remains a bundle of nervous energy shifting in his chair and folding and unfolding his arms repeatedly in the sparsely decorated nbc office at the french open he does have recent coaching experience as the eponymous director of his academy on randalls island in new york and offering occasional counsel to young american prospects like noah rubin his coaching r sum on tour is not nearly so uptodate there was an informal arrangement with becker in 1993 shortly after mcenroe retired mcenroe was also the united states davis cup captain for one season in 2000 boris asked me to work with him between wimbledon and the in 1993 , and it s a long story and pretty humorous , but basically , he did n't listen to a word i said , mcenroe said i was going through a divorce he was going through this fight with tiriac , mcenroe said , referring to becker s former agent ion tiriac so the tennis part suddenly seemed to become secondary but the idea was good for most of the last 20 years , the timing seemed wrong to mcenroe \( or his personality seemed too strong for contemporary stars to bring him on board \) , but he sounded genuinely eager now for at least a parttime role only one of my six kids is still at the house , and i'm not getting any younger , he said i think the former players coming in has been great for the sport and especially for some of the players like boris i think it was a great move , and it turned out to be a winwin mcenroe also praised moya s work with raonic the best i 've ever seen milos play was this year at the australian , he said of raonic s attackminded run to the australian open semifinals in january i really felt he was playing the style of play in order to get into these top guys' heads and potentially take it to that next level mcenroe and raonic have mutual friends in the family of jann wenner , the founder of rolling stone , and have gotten to know each other away from the courts i was sort of just looking for another set of eyes to be a bit more efficient on grass , said raonic , who emphasized that it was also about generally improving mcenroe was one of the game s great volleyers and won three wimbledon singles titles moya never got past the fourth round , and ivan ljubicic , who had previously helped coach raonic , never got past the third perhaps that consulting fee will be money wellspent , after all , even if the odds of a longterm gig have to be viewed as long with all the alpha males involved they just need clarity of roles and responsibilities , and john can be a tremendous added value the message just has to be unified to milos , said paul annacone , the former coach of pete sampras and roger federer john can help milos get more comfortable coming forward and finishing at net mcenroe got a head start in paris attending practice on saturday and sitting next to moya in the players box on the suzanne lenglen court on sunday for the first two sets as raonic was gradually enmeshed in the unseeded ramosvi olas s web believe me , i know what it s like to get sucked into playing the type of game you do n't want to play and proving something you do n't need to prove , so i really felt for him , mcenroe said the results did not improve after mcenroe left to fulfill his television duties there will be more such multitasking during wimbledon along with plenty of camera flashes but first come the practice court and the grass court tournament at queen s club let the crossborder consulting project begin if not an american , a canadian , a north american brother , said mcenroe , arms folded , with a slightly nervous chuckle
if you tried to create the ideal moderate supreme court nominee in a laboratory , it would be hard to do better than judge merrick garland in to fill the vacancy created by the death of justice antonin scalia last month , president obama has taken his constitutional duty seriously , choosing a deeply respected federal appellate judge with an outstanding intellect , an impeccable legal record and the personal admiration of republicans and democrats and yet , within minutes of mr obama s on wednesday morning , senator mitch mcconnell , the republican majority leader , was again outrageously claiming that mr obama made his pick not with the intent of seeing the nominee confirmed , but in order to politicize it for purposes of the election he again vowed not to hold hearings until after mr obama leaves office but there is no reason to believe that mr mcconnell and his party will hold hearings at all what they have claimed is blanket authority to veto any nominee before hearings or a vote takes place this is a dangerous new role for the senate , one that could turn the court into nothing more than a group of blackrobed politicians under normal , even routinely partisan , circumstances , judge garland would sail through confirmation hearings and be confirmed by the senate in a matter of months , if not weeks that was obvious to senator orrin hatch , the senior republican from utah who sits on the judiciary committee , who in 2010 said mr garland would be a consensus nominee and said there would be that he would be confirmed to the supreme court with bipartisan support just last week , mr hatch repeated his praise , that if mr obama wanted a real moderate , he could easily name mr garland , but predicted that he probably wo n't do that because this appointment is about the election but we are no longer operating in the realm of sense or normality the republican party is staring down the very strong possibility that donald trump will be the party s presidential candidate and now , its leaders , in a stupendous show of political malfeasance , are putting the supreme court s constitutional duties on hold while they make about letting the people s voice be heard there is some irony to the republican rejection of judge garland , a 63yearold white man , who might be considered too moderate for democrats hoping that the next justice would have a more liberal legal record it is a choice that does not bring more diversity to the court in his 19 years on the bench , judge garland has established a that reflects no strong political ideology he has sided with the government in cases involving habeas corpus petitions from detainees at guant namo bay , and has voted against criminal defendants more often than his liberal colleagues have he has generally voted in favor of deferring to the considered decisions of federal agencies in civil rights cases , he has voted in favor of plaintiffs who have claimed rights violations none of this matters to senate republicans , who have pledged that there will be no hearings , no vote and , not even the courtesy of a meeting with judge garland that a nominee appearing before the senate would be treated like a pi ata this intransigence is unlikely to win votes for the party in november americans the republican blockade , which is unprecedented in the nation s history as mr obama said wednesday , i simply ask republicans in the senate to give him a fair hearing , and then an upordown vote if they do not , he said , the process of nominating supreme court justices one of the most important jobs of any president will be beyond repair mr obama has picked a strong nominee , who won bipartisan support in his confirmation to the appeals court if the republicans refuse to accept him , they will face one of two scenarios a nominee selected by hillary clinton , who may well be more liberal , or one chosen by president donald trump a racist , vulgar demagogue who many republicans have said is unfit to run the country
as she often does , justice sonia sotomayor got to the human heart of a complicated legal dispute at the supreme court monday morning , in united states v texas , one of the most politically explosive cases to reach the justices in years the lawsuit involves a challenge 26 states brought against president obama s 2014 executive actions protecting millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation for three years , and letting them apply to work here legally in the meantime everyone agrees that setting immigration policy is the sole province of the federal government , and that congress has given the president extremely wide latitude to exercise his or her discretion in enforcing that policy a discretion presidents from dwight eisenhower through george w bush have used liberally in a 2012 opinion written by justice anthony kennedy and joined by chief justice john g roberts , jr , the court held that the broad discretion the president enjoys includes deciding whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all everyone also agrees that there are more than 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the united states , and no one save donald trump actually believes we can deport them all in fact , mr obama has already deported more people than any president before him an average of about 400 , 000 per year during an oral argument that frequently veered into the swamps of supposition , speculation and outright imagination , justice sotomayor stuck to these concrete , undisputed numbers in an exchange with donald verrilli , the united states solicitor general , she asked him to confirm that you only deport 400 , 000 annually we have resources for about 400 , 000 , mr verrilli responded right so we have basically 10 million , nine hundred thousand people that cannot be deported because there s not enough resources , correct \? justice sotomayor said that s correct , mr verrilli replied so , justice sotomayor concluded , they are here whether we want them or not the state challengers to mr obama s actions keep trying to obscure this blunt , obvious reality but in a debate whose outcome will directly affect the lives of millions of people and their families , it must not be forgotten mr obama took his actions only after years of failure by congress to enact meaningful immigration reform as he said at the time , the moves were necessary but not a substitute for federal legislation  meanwhile , the challengers clung to a single twoword phrase lawfully present that the obama administration used in a legal memo setting out its 2014 policy mr verrilli admitted that the term has caused a terrible amount of confusion , but that it has a specific meaning in the context of immigration law it does not confer a new legal status on millions of people , he said it only indicates that their presence will be tolerated temporarily he invited the court to strike those two words from the memo , saying it would change nothing chief justice roberts and justice samuel alito , sounding like two men aware of their imminent relegation to the court s minority bloc , mocked the idea that words could have different meanings depending on context lawfully present does not mean you re legally present in the united states , chief justice roberts said incredulously , before repeating the phrase for effect i m sorry , that just so i get that right i m just talking about the english language i just don t understand it , justice alito said how can it be lawful to work here but not lawful to be here \? mr verrilli responded gently , let me just go through the reality here , before explaining to justice alito that there are in fact millions of people who are already free to seek work authorization even though they are not in the united states legally in the end , the outcome of the case could turn on none of these issues , but rather on the preliminary question of standing what gives texas and the other 25 states the legal capacity to challenge mr obama s actions in the first place \? the court s answer should be nothing  texas claims it has that capacity , known as standing , because it has suffered a concrete injury mr obama s executive actions mean that the state will bear the extra costs associated with providing driver s licenses , which it already subsidizes heavily , to thousands of newlyprotected immigrants but no one is forcing texas to provide licenses to these immigrants , or even to subsidize its licenses at all if states are allowed to run to the courts over any dispute they may have with the federal government , they will do so every day and before you know it , justice stephen breyer suggested , power will be transferred from the president and the congress , where power belongs , to a group of unelected judges during his decade leading the court , chief justice roberts has been a strong proponent of stricter standing rules if he wants to avoid a chaotic 44 split in this extremely politicized case in the middle of a hotly contested election , the standing issue gives him an easy way out
the ramones' selftitled first album came out in april 1976 , and by sales standards alone it was a flop , reaching only no 111 on the billboard chart but with its raw sound and extremely bare songwriting style , ramones became a founding document of punk rock for its 40th anniversary , the album is being celebrated with an expanded reissue due this summer from rhino records and an exhibition , opening at the queens museum on april 10 none of the original band members , , and ramone survive , but some of the people involved in making the first album recently recalled the early days of the band and its rushed but calculated time in the studio here are edited excerpts from their comments formed in 1974 in forest hills , queens , the ramones named for a pseudonym once used by paul mccartney \( paul ramon \) dressed in leather jackets and ripped jeans , and began to make a name for their chaotic , lightningfast shows at cbgb they had a special gig for me , but i had the flu so the next day , i rented a rehearsal studio for an hour in 20 minutes , they had gone through about 20 songs i fell in love with them until we made the record , they literally had n't rehearsed how to end songs joey was so sweet the songs he wrote were so tender dee dee was dee dee tommy was the brains johnny was the paul mccartney of the group he was the one who held the band together john was dominant my brother was easily intimidated , as john knew , but he had his talent they loved dee dee s favorite band was abba they were trying to abba they were hoping to have an album that would sell six million copies so they could retire for life in february 1976 , shortly after being signed to sire , the band spent less than a week in , a cavernous space above radio city music hall where arturo toscanini had once rehearsed the nbc symphony and where the rockettes still practiced i got us four days in the studio and a long weekend to mix the record my budget was 6 , 400 relative to the amount of time , money and effort that went into a standard album in the mid70s , it was so short as to be mythically concise i'm glad it sounded raw at first listen , but it was calculated to be that way we used the best equipment we possibly could every kind of mike we used on the ramones , i later used at abbey road on the london symphony orchestra there was a lot of studio trickery there are several songs where there is much more than one guitar there is a triangle on i wanna be your boyfriend we overdubbed a bomb sound on havana affair it s a tomtom drum tuned very low and held under a piano , with someone holding the sustain pedal down so that it would ring when something hit it that was me and tommy , doing the fuse and bomb craig wanted it to sound like an early beatles record artificial tape delay was a technique perfected by the beatles to slightly change the pitch so that it sounds like two people singing along on the same part if you listen to and then hey , little girl , , it s the same effect tommy wanted to have a fidelity that would be competitive with what was coming out in that period john did n't want it to be slick when you asked them what key they 're in or could you tune that up a little bit , they just were n't interested if you asked them to play it up an octave , they would just play it exactly the same way tommy played to a modification of what we now have as a click track it was a little metronome that would click , and a little orange light would go off he turned off the click sound and put it right in front of the drum kit , with him staring at the light like a robot he would count off with sticks and then dee dee would go , one , two , three , four ! , and they 'd start during the sessions , mr stein objected to the lines in the song today your love , tomorrow the world the band changed the line \( but kept another nazi reference \) , though today those involved disagree about exactly what happened it was shocking to me , i'm sorry i'm a jewish kid from brooklyn seymour got them to change the words it was almost a deal breaker i was not offended by it i thought it was kind of a perfect way to portray the mindset of a nazi youth it was funny the strongest language i could have used was wait a minute , something like that it s greatly exaggerated it took 38 years for ramones to go gold , but the album s influence has been incalculable hey , ho ! let s go ! from blitzkrieg bop , for example , has become a sports stadium chant around the world mr leon , who later , once shared the ramones' music with another famous artist he worked with luciano pavarotti i got hate mail the manager of two of my bands threatened to sue me if i did n't drop the ramones when you 're in the middle of it , you ca n't see that you 're making the revolution you go to kansas city , and there are kids saying , you changed my life that s gratifying it will not make you rich overnight , but the influence was immense that did n't happen until decades later , when bands like soundgarden and green day started alluding to them as being their inspiration sometime around 2000 , we were hanging out at luciano s house in pesaro , drinking wine he started singing football songs from modena , his hometown , and said he would love to make an album of football songs i said , let me sing you an american football song by a band i recorded i took the guitar and sang blitzkrieg bop they 're forming in a straight line , going through a tight wind he said this is great ! it s like football formation i taught him the song , and he was singing hey , ho ! let s go !

and while we expect the audience to be enthusiastic and responsive at times \( cheering \) \( applause \) baier they may have already been we also expect them to be respectful , and we want the candidates to get their full time so , somewhere between a library and a red wings game \( laughter \) \( cheering \) baier am i right \? is that ok \? let s get started wallace mr trump , as you may have heard , the 2012 republican nominee for president , mitt romney , had some things to say about you today he said your domestic policy will lead to recession , he s said your foreign policy will make us less safe , and then he listed what he said are your personal qualities quoting now romney on trump , quote , the bullying , the greed , the showing off , the misogyny , the absurd , thirdgrade theatrics \( cheering \) he challenged you to answer with substance , not insults how do you answer mitt romney , sir \? trump well look , he was a failed candidate , he should have beaten president obama very easy he failed miserably , and it was an embarrassment to everybody , including the republican party it looked like he went away on a vacation the last month so , i do n't take that , and i guess , obviously , he wants to be relevant he wants to be back in the game as far as domestic policy and trade which is killing our country , he said free trade and i believe in free trade also but , if you look at china , and you look japan , and if you look at mexico , both at the border , by the way , where they 're killing us both at the border , and with trade and every other country we do business with we are getting absolutely crushed on trade and , he said free trade , i say free trade great but , not when they 're beating us so badly with china we 're going to lose 505 billion dollars in terms of trades you just ca n't do it mexico , 58 billion dollars japan , probably about , they do n't know it yet , but about 109 billion dollars every country we lose money with as far as i'm concerned , we 've got to reduce we have to redo our trade deals 100 percent i have the greatest business people in the world lined up to do it we will make \( bell ringing \) trump great trade deals \( cheering \) wallace mr trump , romney also talked about your position on race , and the controversy over your failure to denounce david duke on sunday you have repeatedly disavowed him since then , but i 'd like to go deeper than that what are your views on the klu klux klan , and white supremacists \? trump i totally disavow the klu klux klan i totally disavow david duke i 've been doing it now for two weeks , this is your you 're probably about the 18th person that s asked me the question it was very clear , that question was also talked about in the form of groups groups , i want to know which groups are you talking about \? you have to tell me which groups \? ultimately , he got to the klu klux klan , which obviously i'm going to disavow and , by the way , if you look on my twitter account , almost immediately after the program they were disavowed again you know , it s amazing when i do something on twitter , everybody picks it up , goes all over the place but , when i did this one nobody ever picks it up take a look at my twitter account wallace thank you , sir trump thank you thanks \( applause \) baier senator rubio , three weeks ago you said , quote i do n't do the personal attacks , primarily because it s not who i am , because i think it s beneath the office that i'm seeking but also because i do n't want to embarrass my kids but in the past week you 've mocked mr trump s tan you 've made fun of his spelling you called him a con artist you suggested he wet himself backstage at the last debate , along with other vulgar jokes and jabs so what happened \? rubio yes , you know , bret , let me say something this campaign for the last year donald trump has basically mocked everybody with personal attacks he has done so to people that are sitting on the stage today he has done so about people that are disabled he has done it about every candidate in this race so if there is anyone who has ever deserved to be attacked that way , it has been donald trump , for the way he has treated people in the campaign now that said , i would much prefer to have a policy debate i hope that s what we will have here tonight let s have a policy debate trump and we will rubio let s talk about donald trump s strategy and my strategy and ted s strategy and john kasich s strategy when it comes to isis and on health care and on the important issues facing this country but let s be honest too about all this the media has given these personal attacks that donald trump has made an incredible amount of coverage let s start talking again about the issues that matter to this country i'm ready to do that starting right here right now tonight baier mr trump , your response \? trump well , i also happened to call him a lightweight , ok \? and i have said that so i would like to take that back he is really not that much of a lightweight and as far as and i have to say this , i have to say this he hit my hands nobody has ever hit my hands i have never heard of this look at those hands are they small hands \? \( laughter \) trump and he referred to my hands , if they are small , something else must be small i guarantee you there is no problem i guarantee baier ok moving on kelly ok , senator cruz , you say that you are the true conservative in this race but 15 states have voted now , and you have won only four of them you have lost repeatedly with what is supposed to be your core voter groups , including evangelicals and conservatives has n't your brand of conservatism been rejected by an electorate that appears to be more taken with mr trump s populist message \? cruz well , megyn , you know , at the end of the day for the folks at home , this is not about the insults back and forth between the candidates this is not about what attacks we can throw at each other this is the people at home who are struggling through seven years of barack obama this is the single moms who are working two and three jobs , 28 , 29 hours a week because their hours have been forcibly reduced because of obamacare this is the truck drivers and the steel workers and the mechanics with calluses on their hands who have seen their wages not grow year after year after year while the cost of living goes up this is all the young people coming out of school with student loans up to their eyeballs that are n't able to find a job and i do n't think the people of america are interested in a bunch of bickering school children they are interested in solutions , not slogans it s easy to say , make things better , make things great you can even print it and put it on a baseball cap but the question is , do you understand the principles that made america great in the first place \? as president , i will repeal every word of obamacare i will pull back the regulators that are killing small businesses and we will pass a simple flat tax and abolish the irs and what that s going to do , megyn , is small businesses are going to explode we are going to see millions of highpaying jobs we are going to see wages going up we are going to see opportunity that s where our focus needs to be that s where my focus is and that is why our campaign is the only campaign that over and over again has beaten donald trump to date , and it s why we are the one campaign that going forward can and will beat donald trump in this election kelly go ahead , mr trump trump i have heard ted say that over and over again on television , that he is the only one that can beat me just , for the record , i have won 10 he has won three or four last week , in fact , on tuesday , i was a half a million votes higher than him i was a million votes higher than marco , 1 million votes that s a lot of votes and was by far in first place so i keep hearing that he is the only one that can beat me but he is getting beaten very , very badly so where does this come from \? where does it come from \? kelly go ahead , senator rubio rubio yes , i would just say a couple of things there is no doubt that donald has done well in these elections there is no doubt about that the numbers are there here is what the numbers also say twothirds of the people who have cast a vote in a republican primary or caucus have voted against you they do not want you to be our nomineerubio and , the reason why is because we are not going to turn over the conservative movement , or the party of lincoln or reagan , for example , to someone whose positions are not conservative to someone who last week defended planned parenthood for 30 seconds a debate stage to someone , for example , that has no ideas on foreign someone who thinks the nuclear triad is a rock band from the 1980 s trump oh yeah , you 're rubio to someone who time and again on issue after issue has not proven that he has the principals \( bell ringing \) rubio that outline what the conservative movement has been about and , as ted said , the things that made america great america is great because of the conservative principles of limited government and free enterprise , and a strong national defense kelly ok rubio and , our nominee needs to be someone that stands by those things kelly alright rubio donald has not demonstrated that kelly go ahead , mr trump , and then we 're going to have to go to governor kasich \( applause \) trump very nice words , but happens to be wrong cnn just came out with a poll two days ago that rubio \( inaudible \) trump that national poll excuse me rubio \( inaudible \) trump the national poll a national poll where he s at 15 , he s at 14 rubio \( inaudible \) trump and , i'm at 49 , so when he says 75 percent , that would mean that 80 percent of the people do n't dig you , and i'm back down to 50 rubio of all the people on this stage , he performs the worst against hillary clinton trump wrong rubio if you 're our nominee , we will lose trump i beat hillary clinton i beat hillary clinton in many polls rubio you lose by \( inaudible \) points \( ph \) she will wipe you out trump i beat hillary clinton in many polls rubio if you 're our nominee \( inaudible \) kelly hold on , senator , hold on trump i think i'm talking rubio oh , excuse me \( inaudible \) trump i beat hillary clinton kelly hold on , hold on , hold on trump i hope you think \( inaudible \) kelly the audience cannot understand when you 're talking over each other finish your point , mr trump trump i beat hillary clinton in many polls the cue \( ph \) poll just came out i beat hillary clinton in a recent fox poll , i beat hillary clinton in usa today , i beat her today in a poll in ohio i beat i'm the only one that beats hillary clinton i beat and i have not started on hillary yet believe me , i will \( cheering \) trump start soon i have n't even started kelly ok baier governor kasich , today you admitted that you have a narrow path to the nomination through a contested convention today also mitt romney proposed that republicans should vote for senator rubio in florida they should vote for you in ohio they should vote for senator cruz in states that he can beat mr trump to prevent mr trump from getting the nomination so , do you buy romney s blueprint , and can you say tonight to your florida supporters that they should vote for senator rubio to get a contested convention \? kasich you know , this so much about process it frankly is boring to me i would like it clear though , since we 're talking about polls , i beat hillary clinton by more than 11 points , and the reason it happens \( cheering \) trump in one poll kasich the reason it happens trump in one poll kasich you know , the reason is because , as the democrats tell me all the time , i can get the crossover votes you see , because throughout this campaign i 've talked about issues , i have never tried to go and get into these scrums that we 're seeing here on the stage and , people say everywhere i go , you seem to be the adult on the stage \( applause \) in terms of you know , mitt romney s a great guy , but he does n't determine my strategy the fact of the matter is i'm running for president because i worked hard to fix this country when i was in washington as the chairman of the budget committee where we had some of the most significant job growth after we balanced the budget we had wages going up , it was very successful in ohio our wages grow faster than the national average we 're up over 400 , 000 jobs we paid down , back in the old days , they paid down half a trillion dollars of the national debt it s a formula that works and , i believe that formula will work when i return to washington as the president and , by the way , i wo n't need on the job training because i know how to do all of this , and within the first 100 days i will have a plan that will pass the congress because \( bell ringing \) kasich it is reasonable , and i can bring both sides together \( applause \) baier but governor , this is all about process for voters , they need to see a path to get to the nomination if they 're going to support you on super tuesday you finished in single digits in nine out of 11 states so , you can see that your path is through a contested convention how do you kasich well , bret , i think we 're all really there i mean , the simple fact is that , you know , you all wrote me off you wrote me off before i even got to new hampshire , then when i finished in new hampshire you wrote me off in the south , then you wrote me off in super tuesday i split delegates in vermont with donald trump , i finished second in massachusetts , and we won delegates in virginia but , guess what \? it s now march madness and we 're heading up north to the place to my turf , ok \? \( cheering \) kasich and , let me just tell you this , i will win ohio , and i am going to move all across this country , and over time as people begin to finally hear my message you know what people say , bret , to me all the time \? why do n't they give you any time on the debate stage \? why is that \? \( cheering \) kasich so now all of a sudden , i'm starting to get it , and what i want the people to know is , i know how to bring people together , republicans and democrats i have successfully , both at the federal level and the state level brought economic growth , wage growth , and economic security to this country and i want to go back and do it again , and i'm going to keep talking about my message of bringing people together and motivating people in the neighborhoods that realize they do n't need somebody from washington galloping in there are many things they can do where they live , because the strength of our country is in our neighborhoods and our families and i'm going to keep doing this \( applause \) baier thank you wallace well , then , we want to focus now on the economy , which is one of the top issues on facebook , with 66 million people discussing it online a lot of that conversation is happening here in detroit , where the unemployment rate is 109 percent that s more than double the national average senator rubio , you have taken to calling mr trump a con artist who portrays himself as a hero to working people while he s really been , in your words , sticking it to the american workers for 40 years but he has built a big company that employs thousands of people question how many jobs have you created \? rubio well , first of all , government does n't \( audience boos \) first of all , chris , my point is exactly right he has spent a career of convincing americans that he s something that he s not in exchange for their money now he s trying to do the same in exchange for their country this is a fact he talks about these great businesses that he s built he inherited over 100 million trump wrong wrong rubio and with that money , he lost more money than he made wallace mr trump , it s not your turn you 'll get your turn , sir \( crosstalk \) rubio he can start tonight by announcing that all the donald trump clothing will no longer be made in china and in mexico , but will be made here in the united states \( applause \) and on the issue of job creation , i find this interesting the private sector creates jobs the jobs of those of us in public service are to put in place policies that allow the economy to grow that s the problem with the democratic party they think government is what creates jobs government does not create jobs now , the way you create jobs is you make america the easiest and the best place in the world to start a business or to expand an existing business if you go on my website , , you will see a real plan to fix our taxes , to roll back regulations , to repeal and replace obamacare , not just lines around the states serious policies and proposals wallace sir \? mr trump , i 'd like you to respond you have 30 seconds to respond but as part of that , could you respond to his specific assertion about trump collection clothes , which you say some of it is made in mexico \? trump this little guy has lied so much rubio here we go trump about my record rubio here we go it s personal \( audience boos \) \( crosstalk \) trump he has lied so much about my record wallace mr rubio senator rubio , why do n't you let him finish \? trump and i will tell you this first of all , i got a call from my sister and brother tonight , and they said we had no idea dad gave you 200 million believe me , i started off with 1 million i built a company that s worth more than 10 billion and i say it not in a bragging way , but that s the kind of thinking we need very low debt , tremendous cash flow my financials are all they 're all in there with the federal elections you 've seen them everybody has seen them i say it only because that s the kind of thinking this country needs with 19 trillion in debit believe me \( applause \) wallace but wait one second specifically and quickly on the question , will you promise that you will and how soon will you move your clothing collection , the clothes that are made in china and mexico \? trump they devalue their currencies i will do that and by the way , i have been doing it more and more but they devalue their currencies , in particular china mexico is doing a big number now , also japan is unbelievable what they 're doing they devalue their currencies , and they make it impossible for clothingmakers in this country to do clothing in this country and if you look at what s happened on seventh avenue , and you look at what s happened in new york with the garment industry , so much of the clothing now comes out from vietnam , china , and other places and it s all because of devaluation by the way , the transpacific , if you look at the tpp , a total disaster , which , by the way , marco is in favor of , they need it is a disaster for our country it s trying to be approved by various people , including president obama and i 'll tell you something the biggest problem with that is they do n't take into concurrence the devaluation they 're devaluing their currency wallace thank you thank you , mr trump senator rubio \? trump and they 're killing they 're going to \( crosstalk \) wallace wait , wait , senator rubio rubio the answer is , he s not going to do it and you know why \? because there are plenty of clothing makers in america \( applause \) \( crosstalk \) rubio if you go on my website , , everything we have on there is made in america the reason why he makes it in china or mexico is because he can make more money on it that s why he s doing it and the second point , you see what happens , again , when you challenge him on a policy issue you asked him about the economy , and the first thing he does is launch an attack about some little guy thing because he does n't have answers trump no , no i have very good answers rubio and he s asking us to make him the president of the united states of america \( crosstalk \) \( applause \) rubio this is not a game trump i know what s happening with the economy you do n't know a thing rubio well , then answer the economy question trump you have n't employed in your life one person rubio but he does n't answer the employment questiontrump i have employed tens of thousands of people \( crosstalk \) trump you have n't employed one person rubio you ever heard of trump steaks \? you ever heard of trump vodka \? trump oh , you know what \? you know what \? take a look at trump steaks rubio all of these companies he has ruined trump by the way , that s the other thing rubio trump steaks is gone you have ruined these companies trump mitt romney \( crosstalk \) trump false , totally false and now the funny thing is he did n't talk about the hundreds of really successful jobs , the buildings all over the world that have made a fortune \( crosstalk \) wallace i have a policy question for you , sir rubio let s see if he answers it trump i will do n't worry about it , marco do n't worry about it do n't worry about it little marco , i will rubio all right , well , let s hear it big donald trump do n't worry about it , little marco \( crosstalk \) wallace gentlemen gentlemen \( crosstalk \) wallace you have got to do better than this trump this guy has a number one the number one absentee record in the united states wallace mr trump , i would like to ask you a policy question trump he does n't show up to vote wallace your proposed tax cut trump that s why the people in florida do not like him wallace mr trump , your proposed tax cut would add 10 trillion to the nation s debt over 10 years , even if the economy grows the way that you say it will you insist that you could make up for a good deal of that , you say , by cutting waste , fraud , and abuse trump correct wallace like what \? and please be specific trump department of education we 're cutting common core we 're getting rid of common core we 're bringing education locally department of environmental protection we are going to get rid are of it in almost every form we 're going to have little tidbits left but we 're going to take a tremendous amount out we have various other things if you look at the irs , if you look at every single agency , we can cut it down , and i mean really cut it down and save the waste , fraud , and abuse is massive larry kudlow , great guy , everybody respects him , said my plan for taxes and tax cutting is the best by far of everybody wallace but , mr trump , mr trump , your numbers do n't add up please put up full screen number four the education department , you talk about cutting , the total budget for the education department is 78 billion and that includes pell grants for lowincome students and aid to states for special education i assume you would n't cut those things the entire budget for the epa , the environmental protection agency , 8 billion trumo ok wallace the deficit this year is 544 billion that s more than a half trillion dollars your numbers do n't add up , sir trump let me explain something because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies are not mandated to bid properly , they have hundreds of billions of dollars in waste we do n't bid properly we do n't have proper bidding procedures the reason we do n't is because they take care of all of the senators , all of the congressman , and they do n't bid they do n't go out to bid wallace mr trump trump take a look excuse me you are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars wallace no , you are not trump if we went out to the proper bid of course you are wallace no , you 're not , sir let s put up full screen number 2 you say that medicare could save 300 billion a year negotiating lower drug prices but medicare total only spends 78 billion a year on drugs sir , that s the facts you are talking about saving more money on medicare prescription drugs trump i'm saying saving through negotiation throughout the economy , you will save 300 billion a year wallace but that does n't really cut the federal deficit trump and that s a huge of course it is we are going to buy things for less money of course it is that works out wallace that s the only money that we buy the only drugs that we pay for is through medicare trump i'm not only talking about drugs , i'm talking about other things we will save 300 billion a year if we properly negotiate we do n't do that we do n't negotiate we do n't negotiate anything kasich can i wallace no i promise i will get to you in a moment , sir senator cruz , one of centerpieces of your campaign , in fact , you mentioned it again tonight , is that you will abolish the irs question though , who will collect the taxes that you are still calling for \? who will oversee to make sure that people pay the taxes that they rightfully owe \? and who will check on the various tax deductions and tax credits that you still want \? cruz so my simple flat tax i have rolled out in precise detail how it will operate where every american can fill out our taxes on a postcard and if you want to actually see the postcard , see all the details , you can find them on our web site it s  when he we get rid of all the corporate welfare , all the subsidies , all the carveouts in the irs code , it dramatically simplifies it and under obama , the irs has become so corrupt and so politicized we need to abolish it all together now , at the end of that there will still be an office in the treasury department to receive the postcards but it will be dramatically simpler cruz and let me take a moment , chris , to go back to go back to this exchange that was going on in between all of the insults , let me point out the specificity that was lacking it s very easy to say , let s cut waste , fraud , and abuse i 've rolled out a detailed plan to cut 500 billion in federal spending , specifying exactly what i would cut \( applause \) it s easy to say it , but one of the great disconnects to all the people , all of the voters , i understand the folks who are supporting donald right now you 're angry you 're angry at washington , and he uses angry rhetoric but for 40 years , donald has been part of the corruption in washington that you 're angry about \( applause \) and you 're not going to stop the corruption in washington by supporting someone who has supported liberal democrats for four decades , from jimmy carter to john kerry to hillary clinton you 're not going to stop the corruption and the cronyism by supporting someone who has used government power for private gain instead , we need a president who stands with the american people \( applause \) wallace governor kasich , i promise i will get to you but you do get 30 seconds to respond , mr trump trump well , all of a sudden , i hear for 40 years i 've been involved in washington i have been supporting people for many years and these people have been politicians , and they 've been on both sides , democrats , republicans , liberals , conservatives i 've supported everybody , because , until recently , i was n't a politician , and i hope maybe you do n't all consider me a politician right now i hate the term politician but i 've been supporting politicians a recent article somewhere said donald trump is a worldclass businessman who goes out and he does get along with everybody i 've supported democrats , and i 've supported republicans and as a businessman , i owed that to my company , to my family , to my workers , to everybody to get along part of the problem we have in washington , chris wallace mr trump trump is it s total gridlock nobody gets along we need people to get along we need to be able to get things done \( applause \) wallace governor kasich , democrats , as you know , will make income inequality a big issue in the general election you support raising the minimum wage , although you say not to the 15 an hour that democrats are talking about mr trump opposes any increase because he says it will price american workers out of the world market is he wrong about that \? no increase in the minimum wage \? kasich well , well , wait a minute , first of all , i did n't say i was for an increase in the federal minimum wage i said in ohio we increased it modestly every single year so i'm not for a federal minimum wage increase wallace but you did talk about states doing it kasich well , states if states want to do it , they ought to sit down with businesspeople and the lawmakers and figure out what will work but hold on a second here with everything else i'm the only person on this stage who actually was the chief architect of balancing the federal budget it s not a theory for me it s not it s not some you have to know how to put everything together and you know , i spent 10 years of my life to get there , and i did not do that because i'm worshiping at some balanced budget shrine the reason i did it is when you have commonsense regulations , lower taxes on individuals and businesses , and you have a fiscal plan that makes sense , the job creators will expand employment and what happened \? when i was there , the jobs were exploding bill clinton s tried to take credit for it when i went to ohio , we 're up 400 , 000 jobs it s the same formula but it is n't easy i fought the entire washington establishment and won , because when you balance a budget , you must affect every single thing everything in the federal government specifically you cannot get there with theories or broad statements , and you have to be willing to take the heat in fact , i fought a republican president , who i thought was not offering constructive proposals to fix this economy so when we talk about all this , there s one person on this stage and one person who s been a candidate for president in either party that restored economic strength , growth , a balanced budget , paid down debt , cut taxes , the things that people in this country want no theories reality \( applause \) wallace thank you , governor \( applause \) kelly all right let s talk immigration for a little bit senator cruz , let s start with you you have repeatedly touted how you have stood shoulder to shoulder with senator jeff sessions to fight illegal immigration and amnesty but senator sessions just endorsed donald trump if voters want jeff sessionsstyle immigration policies , is n't their choice rather clear \? cruz yes , their choice is very clear if you look to the actual record you know , donald mentioned a moment ago that he was just doing business when he was writing checks to liberal democrats but that s not , in fact , the checks he was writing listen , we could all understand if you write a check to a city commission because you 're looking for a zoning waiver on building a building that may be corrupt , but you could understand real estate developers doing thatcruz that s not what donald trump did donald trump supported jimmy carter over ronald reagan donald supported john kerry over george w bush if you do n't like obamacare , donald trump funded harry reid and nancy pelosi taking over congress to pass obamacare on immigration , if you do n't like amnesty , if you do n't like the gang of eight , donald trump funded five of the eight members of the gang of eight 50 , 000 and let s talk about this election the choice republican primary voters are making is who is best prepared to stand up to hillary clinton and beat hillary clinton donald trump has written checks to hillary clinton not once , not twice , not three times ten times and four of those checks were not to her senate campaign it was n't that she was the new york senator and it was a cost of doing business it was to her presidential campaign donald trump in 2008 wrote four checks to elect hillary clinton as president kelly ok cruz so i 'd like to ask donald , why did you write checks to hillary clinton to be president in 2008 \? it was n't for business and how can you stand on a debate stage now with her and say you do n't think she should be president \? \( applause \) trump actually , it was for business it was it was it was for business i pride myself , including outside of the united states i'm doing almost 120 deals outside of the which i hope to be able to stop very soon and let my children handle it but we 're doing many , many deals outside of the united states i support politicians in 2008 , i supported hillary clinton i supported many other people , by the way and that was because of the fact that i'm in business i did support very heavily ronald reagan i also supported george bush , by the way kelly all right mr trump cruz but what would you say kelly well , stand by stand by , senator cruz cruz to hillary clinton on the debate stage when you wrote her a check in 2008 , wrote her four checks to be president \? trump let me tell you , something , ted the last person that hillary clinton wants to face is donald trump that i can \( applause \) kelly let s move on and with all due respect , we have we have questions we have questions trump that i can tell you \( crosstalk \) kelly no , no , no hold on hold on we can do more of this later mr trump , hi trump hello kelly how are you doing \? trump nice to be with you , megyn kelly great to have you here trump you 're looking well you 're looking well kelly as are you \( applause \) back in january , you gave an offtherecord interview to the new york times it was apparently audiotaped now , a recent report in buzzfeed citing sources at the times reports that in that interview you expressed flexibility when it comes to your immigration policy , specifically with respect to your promise to deport the 11 million people who are now living here illegally you have suggested that you may have expressed some flexibility when it comes to the size of the wall that you want to build but did you tell them , specifically , that you are flexible when it comes to your deportation plan \? trump i do n't know exactly what when you talk about off the record first of all , buzzfeed \? they were the ones that said under no circumstances will i run for president and were they wrong but a lot of people said that then , i did have a meeting with the editorial board of the new york times , a very nice meeting many of those things were off the record , i think at their suggestion and my suggestion and i think being off the record is a very important thing i think it s a very , very powerful thing and i will say this these three gentlemen have gone off the record many times with reporters and i think they want to honor it , and i would always honor that i will say , though , in terms of immigration and almost anything else there always has to be some , you know , tug and pull and deal and , you know , when i watch ted stand on the senate floor , i had great respect for what he did he stood there for a dayanda half or something in the meantime , what came of it \? nothing you have to be able to have some flexibility , some negotiation now , sometimes you ask for more than you want and you negotiate down to the point i may have discussed something like that with the new york times , but i would never release offtherecord conversations i do n't think it s fair , frankly , to do that to anybody kelly how flexible are you on this issue \? \( audience boos \) trump not very flexible no , not very flexible i give the example i'm going to build a wall i'm the one that wants the wall i'm the one that can build the wall \( applause \) it s going to get built and by the way , mexico is going to pay for the wall i can tell you that mexico is going to pay for the wall \( applause \) but and i used an example and this is n't necessarily what was said , but whatever was said , the wall s 50 feet high is it going to be 45 feet or 40 feet \? that could very well be that could very well he wants it to be higher \( laughter \) that could very well be but there s always give and take there s always negotiation and the best negotiator that knows what he s doing will make a great deal but we need give and take in government if you do n't have give and take , you 're never going to agree on anything \( applause \) kelly senator rubio , you not only supported the failed immigration reform effort through the gang of eight , but you 're still on record as favoring an eventual path to citizenship for those who are here illegally and in addition \( audience boos \) you favored instate tuition for florida illegal immigrants you 've been hitting mr trump hard on this flexibility discussion with the new york times , but his supporters might say at least his opening stance was tough rubio well , first of all , let me say that on the issue of the offtherecord , that s not up to the new york times that s up to you , donald if tonight you tell the new york times to release the audio , they will do it , and we can exactly see what your true views are on immigration trump fine \( ph \) rubio because it is a major issue , in your campaign that you 've made a center issue now , as far as my record on it is concerned , i absolutely want to solve this issue and i did the best we could in a senate that was controlled by liberal democrats and harry reid in the hopes that the house , made up of conservatives , would take it up and make it even stronger and i said that repeatedly at the time i'm not just saying that now i said it throughout that process we do need to do with this issue \( audience boos \) rubio when i'm president it will not be dealt with the way it was done in the senate it will be done first and foremost by bringing illegal immigration under control and proving it to the american people and only after that is done can anything else happen and it will be something the american people support we 'll see what they are willing to support it s not going to be an executive order and we 're not going to ram it down their throats kelly mr trump , we will let respond , but will you release the tapes \? will you authorize of the times to release the tapes \? trump i will say one thing , what marco said is i understand it he is talking about a little give and take and a little negotiation and you know what \? that s ok that s not the worst thing in the world there is nothing wrong with that i happen to be much stronger on illegal immigration sheriff joe arpaio endorsed me and if he endorses you , believe me , you are the strongest , from arizona but give and take is ok and i thought what he said is ok we may differ on the degree but what he said to me is ok kelly will you release the tapes \? trump no i never do that i would not do that i do n't think i have too much respect if i deal with you off the record , if i deal with bret or chris off the record , i have too much respect for that process to say , just release everything i would not do that kelly ok stand by we 're going to continue this right after the break we have more baier coming up , more with megyn on immigration , plus questions on other top issues , including the war on terror the fox news republican presidential debate live from detroit continues after a quick break \( commercial break \) kelly welcome back everybody to the fox news republican presidential debate , live from the fox theater here in detroit let s get back now to the questions mr trump , your campaign website to this day argues that more visas for highly skilled workers would , quote , decimate american workers however , at the cnbc debate , you spoke enthusiastically in favor of these visas so , which is it \? trump i'm changing i'm changing we need highly skilled people in this country , and if we ca n't do it , we 'll get them in but , and we do need in silicon valley , we absolutely have to have so , we do need highly skilled , and one of the biggest problems we have is people go to the best colleges they 'll go to harvard , they 'll go to stanford , they 'll go to wharton , as soon as they 're finished they 'll get shoved out they want to stay in this country they want to stay here desperately , they 're not able to stay here for that purpose , we absolutely have to be able to keep the brain power in this country \( applause \) kelly so you abandoning the position on your website trump i'm changing it , and i'm softening the position because we have to have talented people in this country kelly and you 're not releasing the discussion with the new york times behind closed doors trump that is correct kelly which will have some asking whether , on your immigration policies , you 're really just playing to people s fantasies , which is a tactic trump no , i'm not playing kelly you praised in your book , the art of the deal trump i'm not playing to anybody s fantasies , i'm playing to the fact that our country is in trouble , that we have a tremendous problem with crime the border is a disaster , it s like a piece of swiss cheese we 're going to stop it , we 're going to stop people from coming into our country illegally we 're going to stop it \( applause \) \( cheering \) kelly senator cruz , not long ago you propose quintupling the number of these foreign worker visas after you announced for president , you reversed yourself , citing reports that the program was being abused but , that abuse had been around long before your 180 in fact , it was so bad that just a few months earlier that a bipartisan group of senators called for an investigation and you declined to join them is n't it a good thing that the american public did n't trust ted on that one \? cruz well , the abuse of the h1b program has been rampant on the face of that h1b abuse , i have proposed , and promised as president that i will impose a 180 day moratorium on the h1b program to implement a comprehensive investigation and audit because you got us companies that are firing american workers , bringing in foreign workers , and forcing them to train their replacements and , i would note that is not dissimilar to what we discovered at the last debate concerning the hotel that donald owns down in florida down in florida that hotel has brought in hundreds of foreign workers , and afterwards it was really striking i watched the cnn interview donald did where he explained , he said , well the problem is you ca n't find americans who are qualified , or who want to work as waiters and waitresses now , let me ask the people here , how many people have worked as a waiter or waitress \? \( applause \) cruz millions across this country that is an astonishing statement you know , marco s dad started as a bartender my dad started washing dishes , and yet , you know how many americans wanted those jobs \? \( bell ringing \) cruz roughly 300 applied , donald hired 17 and , that s why this new york times tape is so troubling because what s been reported is that donald told the editorial board of the new york times what i'm saying on immigration , i do n't believe i'm not going to build a wall , i'm not going to deport people , this is all just rhetoric for the voters now , if he did n't say that , he has an easy solution simply release the tape but , for everyone at home who s mad at politicians that lied to us , donald s record right now as he standing here kelly ok cruz his record right now is one of repeatedly hiring illegal aliens kelly times up , sir cruz abusing \( ph \) american workers kelly go ahead , mr trump trump first of all i 've had tens of thousands of people working for me , most of which are 98 , 97 , 98 percent of the people in this country , from this country i'm very proud of it you have a club in palm beach , florida called the maralago club , it s a very , very successful club it has a very short season , it s called , the season , and it goes from november until march it s a few months , five months at the most people do n't want a shortterm job they do n't want so , we will bring people in , and we will send the people out all done legally , all done with the process that s \( bell ringing \) trump approved by government in palm beach , or west palm beach we bring people in , we bring them out we want to hire as many americans as we can , but they do n't want parttime , very short parttime jobs kelly understood thank you rubio that s not accurate i'm sorry , megyn , that s not accurate that s my there were at least 300 americans that applied last year , none of them were hired some of them trump wrong rubio have been interviewed trump that s wrong rubio they were not hired trump wrong rubio and , here s why he does it this way , let me explain why he \( inaudible \) h2b trump wrong rubio because when you bring them in this way , when you bring someone in on one of these visas they ca n't go work for anybody else they either work for you or they have to go back home you basically have them captive , so you do n't have to worry about competing for higher wages with another hotel down the street and , that s why you bring workers from abroad you argue that you 're here to fight on behalf of the american worker , but when you have chances to help the american worker \( bell ringing \) rubio but when you have chances to help the american workers , you 're making your clothes overseas and you 're hiring your workers from overseas \( applause \) kelly go ahead , sir trump the the the other hotels during the season , they do the same thing they take in a lot of people , because you ca n't get them they take in a lot of people longterm employees , we do n't do that , but shortterm employees , we have no choice but to do it , and other hotels in that very , very hot area it is a very hot area rubio there were americans in that hot area trump it s very , very hard to get people but other hotels do the exact same thing and just so you understand , just again , this is a legal process this is a procedure it s part of the law i take advantage of that there s nothing wrong with it we have no choice kelly all right cruz donald , you could resolve this issue very quickly by simply \( audience boos \) releasing the new york times tape because , listen , maybe it s right trump this was n't on the subject cruz that you did n't tell them you 're misleading the american people if that s the case trump tapes were not on the subject , but that s cruz if you did n't tell them that , the tapes will prove you 're innocent kelly ok cruz but if , in fact , you went to manhattan and said i'm lying to the american people , then the voters have a right to know trump no , no you 're the liar you 're the lying guy up here \( crosstalk \) cruz because we 've been lied to too many times trump you 're the you 're the one you 're the one cruz why do n't you release the tapes \? release the tapes trump you 're the one now , let me just tell you let me just tell you \( crosstalk \) trump excuse me excuse me i 've given my answer , lyin' ted i 've given my answer kelly all right let s leave it at that \( audience boos \) let s leave it at that we have more to get to \( audience boos \) baier gentlemen , the next topic to discuss is terrorism senator rubio , isis is a big topic of conversation on facebook we have a map that shows the conservation about isis around the country you proposed sending a larger number of american ground troops to help defeat isis in syria and iraq rubio that s correct , and libya baier but military commanders say the biggest isis threat to europe in particular now is coming from libya , not syria rubio correct baier so just to be clear , if you 're for putting more us ground troops in iraq and syria , are you also ready to send us ground troops on the ground in libya \? rubio well , bret , what i 've argued from the very beginning is isis in order to defeat isis , you must deny them operating spaces this is how isis or any radical group , for that matter , can grow it s how al qaida was able to carry out 9 11 , is that the taliban gave them an operating space in afghanistan today that operating space has largely been based in iraq and syria , but i 've been warning about the libyan presence for the better part of two years so they need to be targeted wherever they have an operating space they do need to be defeated on the ground by a ground force made up primarily of sunni arabs themselves this is a radical sunni movement they can only be defeated if they are driven out and the territory is held by sunni arabs but it will require a specific number of american special operators , in combination with an increase in air strikes and that will include , if necessary , operating spaces in libya , which , in fact , they are using to project into the sinai against egypt and ultimately into europe , as well baier governor kasich , would you put ground troops in libya \? kasich well , first of all , just to be clear , not only did i serve for 18 years on the defense committee , more than anybody on this stage , but , secondly , i was called into the pentagon after 9 11 to help secretary rumsfeld with some of his difficulties i will say , look , let me tell you what happened with libya and i pointed out in the last debate hillary clinton worked aggressively to depose moammar gadhafi we had no business doing it he was working with us he was cooperating with us he denuclearized and now they pushed him out , and now we have a fertile ground for isis fortunately in libya , there s only a few cities on the coast , because most of libya is a desert the fact of the matter is , we absolutely have to be and not just with special forces i mean , that s not going to work come on you 've got to go back to the invasion when we pushed saddam hussein out of kuwait we have to be there on the ground in significant numbers we do have to include our muslim arab friends to work with us on that and we have to be in the air and we it should be a broad coalition , made up of the kinds of people that were involved when we defeated saddam now , you 've got to be on the ground and in the air both in syria and iraq and at some point , we will have to deal with libya i am very concerned about isis getting their hands on the oilfields in libya and being able to fund their operations the fact is cool , calm , deliberate , effective , take care of the job , and then come home that s what we need to do with our military foreign policy \( applause \) baier mr trump , just yesterday , almost 100 foreign policy experts signed on to an open letter refusing to support you , saying your embracing expansive use of torture is inexcusable general michael hayden , former cia director , nsa director , and other experts have said that when you asked the us military to carry out some of your campaign promises , specifically targeting terrorists' families , and also the use of interrogation methods more extreme than waterboarding , the military will refuse because they 've been trained to turn down and refuse illegal orders so what would you do , as commanderinchief , if the us military refused to carry out those orders \? trump they wo n't refuse they 're not going to refuse me believe me baier but they 're illegal trump let me just tell you , you look at the middle east they 're chopping off heads they 're chopping off the heads of christians and anybody else that happens to be in the way they 're drowning people in steel cages and he now we 're talking about waterboarding this really started with ted , a question was asked of ted last two debates ago about waterboarding and ted was , you know , having a hard time with that question , to be totally honest with you they then came to me , what do you think of waterboarding \? i said it s fine and if we want to go stronger , i 'd go stronger , too , because , frankly \( applause \) that s the way i feel can you imagine can you imagine these people , these animals over in the middle east , that chop off heads , sitting around talking and seeing that we 're having a hard problem with waterboarding \? we should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding that s my opinion baier but targeting terrorists' families \? \( applause \) trump and and and i'm a leader i'm a leader i 've always been a leader i 've never had any problem leading people if i say do it , they 're going to do it that s what leadership is all about baier even targeting terrorists' families \? trump well , look , you know , when a family flies into the world trade center , a man flies into the world trade center , and his family gets sent back to where they were going and i think most of you know where they went and , by the way , it was n't iraq but they went back to a certain territory , they knew what was happening the wife knew exactly what was happening they left two days early , with respect to the world trade center , and they went back to where they went , and they watched their husband on television flying into the world trade center , flying into the pentagon , and probably trying to fly into the white house , except we had some very , very brave souls on that third plane all right \? \( applause \) baier senator cruz , you were mentioned trump i have no problem with it baier senator cruz \? cruz bret , you know , i think the american people understand that yelling and cursing at people does n't make you a tough guy we need a commanderinchief that , number one , will rebuild the military , just like ronald reagan did in 1981 coming out of the weak jimmy carter administration he passed tax reform and regulatory reform the economy took off it generated millions in highpaying jobs , trillions in new revenue he rebuilt the military , bankrupted the soviet union , and won the cold war as president , i will do the exact same thing with radical islamic terrorism we will rebuild this military so that it remains the mightiest fighting force on the face of the planet and then , when i am commanderinchief , every militant on the face of the earth will understand that if they go and join isis , if they wage jihad against the united states of america , they are signing their death warrant \( applause \) baier but , senator cruz , in 2013 , you said you were open you were open to the possibility that edward snowden had performed a considerable public service , you said back then , in revealing certain aspects of the nsa procedures many of your colleagues in the senate , including senator rubio , called him a traitor it took you until january of this year to call him a traitor and say he should be tried for treason why the change of heart \? and why did it take you so long \? cruz well , bret , as someone who spent much of his life in law enforcement , i believe you should start with the facts and evidence first before ending up with the verdict when the news first broke of the united states government engaging in massive surveillance on american citizens , that was a very troubling development , and it s why the united states congress acted to correct it now , at the same time , i said in that initial statement that if the evidence indicated that edward snowden violated the law , he should be prosecuted for violating the law and , indeed , since then , the evidence is clear that not only does snowden violate the law , but it appears he committed treason treason is defined under the constitution as giving aid and comfort to the enemies of america , and what snowden did made it easier for terrorists to avoid detection and snowden s comments afterwards , and his behavior afterwards , he fled to russia , he fled to china his conducts afterwards indicates that he was not a whistleblower , but instead he was undermining the ability to defend this country but we need a president who is n't rash , who does n't just pop off at the at the hip , but waits to see what the facts are and then acts to defend this country \( applause \) baier mr trump , you 've repeatedly deflected calls for specific national security or defense policy plans with the claim that you 'll ask the best people when you become president , and take their advice so who are the best people \? can you reveal two or three names that you trust for national security \? trump i think richard haass is excellent i have a lot of respect for him i think general keane is excellent i think that there are i like colonel jacobs very much i see him i know him i have many people that i think are really excellent but in the end it s going to be my decision when you just asked the question about snowden , i will tell you right from the beginning , i said he was a spy and we should get him back and if russia respected our country , they would have sent him back immediately , but he was a spy it did n't take me a long time to figure that one out believe me but i would get the best people , people that i 'd be comfortable with and we will do the right thing kasich bret , it s very interesting to note , i think it s for the good of the record here that they took a survey of foreign policy magazines , 700 foreign policy experts , who would be the best person to conduct foreign policy of all the candidates in the race \? i received 55 percent of the vote jeb bush received 30 percent of the vote and everybody else , none of them made double digits and that s because you have to have the experience and you know , we hear about ronald reagan rebuilding the military i was there when ronald reagan rebuilt the military i worked with him i was there when ronald reagan rebuilt the economy i was there , and i worked with him i knew ronald reagan and i 'll leave it right there with what comes after that you can figure that one out baier governor kasich , thank you kelly we 're going to have more questions for the candidates right after this break and during the commercial break , join us for a facebook live on the fox news facebook page and tell us what you think about tonight s debate in the comment section \( commercial break \) baier welcome back to the historic fox theater in downtown detroit and the republican presidential debate let s get right back to the questions kelly mr trump , one of the things people love about you is they believe you tell it like it is but time and time again in this campaign , you have actually told the voters one thing only to reverse yourself within weeks or even sometimes days we 've teed up just three examples in a videotape , similar to those we used with senator rubio and senator cruz in the last debate the first is on whether the war in afghanistan was a mistake watch \( begin video clip \) cuomo what about in afghanistan \? do you believe that american boots should stay on the ground in afghanistan to stabilize the situation \? trump we 've made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place that thing will collapse about two seconds after they leave just as i said that iraq was going to collapse after we leave \( unknown \) about afghanistan , you said we made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place trump we made a mistake going into iraq i 've never said we made a mistake \( unknown \) our question was about afghanistan that day on october trump well , ok , i never said that \( unknown \) was on afghanistan trump ok would n't matter i never said it \( end video clip \) kelly next , on whether we should accept trump should i respond to that first \? kelly two more , and then you 'll have the floor next on whether we should accept the syrian refugees trump you 'll be here a long time kelly on whether we should accept the syrian refugees \( begin video clip \) o 'reilly do you object to migrants who are getting out of the middle east and north africa \? do you object to them coming to the usa \? trump i hate the concept of it , but on a humanitarian basis , with what s happening , you have to it s living in hell in syria there s no question about it they 're living in hell hannity are you saying absolutely people from syria , the middle east , should we allow any of them into this country \? trump look , from a humanitarian standpoint , i 'd love to help , but we have our own problems we have so many problems that we have to solve \( end video clip \) kelly most recently , on whether president george w bush lied to get us into the iraq war \( begin video clip \) trump they lied they said there were weapons of mass destruction there were none and they knew there were none i do n't know if he lied or not he could have lied maybe he did maybe he did n't i guess you 'd have to ask him \( end video clip \) kelly and there are many other examples so how is any of this telling it like it is \? trump well , on afghanistan , i did mean iraq i think you have to stay in afghanistan for a while , because of the fact that you 're right next to pakistan , which has nuclear weapons , and we have to protect that nuclear weapons change the game and i was always against going into iraq in fact , i believe me , i was always against it there was some cases where i sort of in one interview with a great friend of mine , and yours , howard stern said that said that \( laughter \) i said very meekly , long before we went in , i said very meekly , well , maybe , maybe , i do n't know by the time it got to that point , i was always against iraq but afghanistan , i felt and in that one , if you notice , i corrected it the second day ok \? second question \? kelly there are several examples , mr trump trump no , no but kelly we went through the afghanistan being a mistake within one day , you reversed yourself on syrian refugees trump now on let me explain that you 're right let me explain first time the question had been put to me , it was very early on the migration had just started and i had heard that the number was a very , very small number by the second day , two or three days later , i heard the number was going to be thousands and thousands of people you know , when they originally heard about it , they were talking about bringing very , very small numbers in and i said , begrudgingly , well , i guess maybe that s ok it was not like , let s bring them in , because i think we should build a safe zone in we should really what we should be doing is building safe zones so they can stay in their own country and not go all over , and at least this way we 're not going to have the problem that s what we have to do \( applause \) but just just to set because i fully understand what you 're asking when i first heard the question , first time the question was ever asked to me , first time i really had known about the question , the migration had just started i was very much like , ok , by the time i went back and studied it , and they were talking about bringing thousands and thousands , i changed my tune and i do n't think there s anything wrong with that kelly but the point i'm going for is you change your tune on so many things , and that has some people saying , what is his core \? trump megyn , i have a very strong core \( applause \) i have a very strong core but i 've never seen a successful person who was n't flexible , who did n't have a certain degree of flexibility you have to have a certain degree of flexibility \( applause \) you ca n't for instance , let s say , on on the second question , you ca n't say it s ok , and then you find out it s not ok , and you do n't want to do anything you have to be flexible , because you learn i mean , before i knew the question was asked by bill , and the next day , or the couple of days later , the question was asked by , by you know i was asked by a number of people , actually i was asked by sean , but i was asked by a number of people but by that time , the number had increased significantly kelly sean was the next day after bill trump the next day but i had learned i mean , nobody had ever asked me the question this was brand new but and i really mean it you have to show a degree of flexibility if you 're going to be one way and you think it s wrong , does that mean the rest of your life you have to go in the wrong direction because you do n't want to change \? \( applause \) kasich megyn trump \( inaudible \) kelly go ahead , governor kasich i did 200 meetings in new hampshire , i do n't know how many in michigan now in these townhalls people come in and they 're very emotional meetings and , you know what they really want to know \? if somebody tells them something , can they believe it \? and , the reason why people are so upset in this country is because politicians all the time tell them what they want to hear and , they go to washington , or they go to the state capital , wherever , and they do n't deliver on those promises you know , when i ran for governor of ohio , i said not only would we balance the budget , but we would cut taxes people said that ca n't be done i would n't have said it if i did n't believe it we cut taxes in ohio more than any governor in the country , and 5 billion dollars worth of tax cuts we 're not running a surplus in ohio but , you see , what s getting in the hearts and souls of the people is they want change , and they keep putting outsiders in to bring about the change , then the change does n't come then they put more outsiders in because we 're putting people in that do n't understand compromise they do n't understand policy \( bell ringing \) \( applause \) kasich they 're getting more and more frustrated with the system which is why we must pick somebody that has a record of achievement , not just talk kelly ok kasich not just talk , but a record of achievement that s how we 'll restore credibility rubio this is n't just about flexibility kelly go ahead , senator rubio there s a difference between flexibility and telling people whatever you think you need to say to get them to do what you want them to do \( cheering \) rubio and , that s what donald has done throughout his career trump \( inaudible \) rubio well , he did , and that s why trump university trump that s not right rubio is so relevant here i saw this video last week where he s sitting in front of a camera saying we 're going to hire the best people , and i'm going to hand pick them there are going to be hand picked and instructors , the best instructors in the world one of them , but the way , was the manager at a buffalo wild wing and , that s who they hired to do this , and people borrowed money , and they signed up for this fake university and , these people owe all this money now , and they got nothing in return for it , but you are willing to say whatever you had to say \( bell ringing \) rubio to get them to give you their money kelly go ahead , mr trump trump we 'll find out when we have the \( inaudible \) rubio and , we 're not going to do that to our country trump and , by the way , just so you understand \( applause \) trump this is a case i could have settled very easily , but i do n't settle cases very easily when i'm right ninetyeight percent approval rating , we have an a from the better business bureau rubio that s false trump we have a 98 percent approval rating from the people who took the course we have an a from the better business bureau and , people like it now , he s saying they did n't learn we have many , many people that will be witnesses again , i do n't settle cases i do n't do it because that s why i do n't get sued very often , because i do n't settle , unlike a lot of other people we have a situation where we will win in court \( bell ringing \) trump but , many of the people that are witnesses did tremendously well , and made a lot of money rubio that s false trump by taking the course kelly go ahead , senator trump you 're going to see , you do n't know rubio the better business bureau gave it a d minus trump you 're going to see , you 're going to see kelly it s senator rubio s turn trump no , no before they had the information rubio go on my website , marco  trump before they had the information kelly senator rubio , standby , let him finish his point , and then i 'll give you the floor trump before they had the information it got it is right now an a , once they had the information rubio \( inaudible \) this anymore trump the only reason that is was a d was because we did n't care we did n't give them the information rubio a third of the people \( inaudible \) trump when they got the information it became an a kelly with respect wait with respect trump marco you do n't know \( inaudible \) kelly with respect , we went back and looked at this trump yes kelly the rating from the better business bureau was a d minus \( cheering \) \( applause \) trump \( inaudible \) kelly that s the last publicly available rating in 2010 , and it was the result of a number of complaints they had trump but it was elevated to an a unidentifiable male \( inaudible \) kelly that s never been publicly available trump i can give it to you i can give it to you tomorrow kelly let s just bring the viewers up to speed , let s just bring the viewers up to speed trump it was elevated to an a kelly let me just set the record , and then you guys can have at it there was trump university , which was a business that you started , and it was marketed trump small business kelly to many people , and now there is a classaction of over 5 , 000 plaintiffs against you , mr trump trump right kelly and , it involves veterans , and it involves teachers , and it involves socalled little guys , working class , and lower working class and middle class who say that they were fleeced , who say that it was as scam the class has been certified , and in that case you countersued the lead plaintiff alleging that you were being defamed that case was thrown out against her trump the lead plaintiff is now getting out of the case because it s so bad for her kelly but , what happened was trump excuse me , the lead plaintiff signed a letter saying how great it was , and it on tape saying how great it was kelly ok , no , but standby but , what happened in that case was you countersued her the court threw out your countersuit , and made you pay almost 800 , 000 dollars in legal fees of hers , and you made the same argument about 98 percent of the people being happy with trump university and , that woman in particular signing a survey saying she liked it while someone was standing over her shoulder trump she s trying to get out of the case she s trying to get out of the case kelly and this is what standby , this is what the court of appeals found they said that the plaintiffs against you are like the madoff victims trump oh , give me a break kelly this is what the court of appeals said trump give me a breakkelly this is what the court of appeals said trump give me a break kelly they found that victims of con artists often sing the praises of their victimizers until they realize they have been fleeced trump you know what , let s see what happens in court this is a civil case very easy to have settled could settle it now very easy to have settled let s see what happens at the end of a couple years when this case is over , ok \? kelly it has been going for five years trump yes , it has been going for a long time kelly go ahead , senator rubio i spoke to one of the victims yesterday trump we 'll win the case rubio i spoke to one of the victims yesterday trump one , one of the victims rubio no , there are several obviously there are so many , i ca n't talk to them every day i spoke to one of them , he told me exactly what happened they signed up for this course because they believed mr trump was this fantastic businessman , that donald is going to teach them the tricks of the trade they signed up they paid 15 , 000 for this course they were asked for additional money for this course if they really wanted the real secrets of success , they had to pay even more money , and so they did and you know what they got in these courses \? stuff you can pull off of zillow when they finally realized what a scam it was , they asked for their money back and you refused to give them their money back why do n't you tonight trump i gave many people their money back rubio then why do n't you tonight say you 're going to give the money back to everybody who wants trump let me just \( crosstalk \) kelly ok senator rubio , let him answer \( crosstalk \) kelly let him answer go ahead , mr trump trump we will see who s right at the end of a few years but all of the almost all of the people , many , many people signed what s called the report card at the end , did you like the course , how did you like it almost all of them said it was terrific , ok \? with letters , with this some of them are on tape saying it was terrific let s see what happens at the end of three years kelly with respect , mr trump , onethird of the plaintiffs in that case demanded refunds so it s not the case that 98 percent were trump i gave some refunds to people because if they asked for the refunds in a certain period of time , and we gave refunds to people kelly ok trump but let s see what happens at the end of three years let s see who s right kelly still a pending litigation \( crosstalk \) trump it s called pending litigation rubio megyn , this is why this is relevant to this election kelly all right senator rubio then senator cruz go ahead rubio this is why , because he s trying to do to the american voter what he did to the people that signed up for this course he s making promises he has no intention of keeping and it wo n't just be 36 , 000 that they lose , it s our country that s at stake here the future of the united states and the most important election in a generation , and he s trying to con people into giving them their vote just like he conned these people into giving him their money trump let me tell you the real con artist excuse me excuse me the real con artist is senator marco rubio who was elected in florida and who has the worst voting record in the united states senate he does n't go to vote he s absent he does n't go now , the people of florida ca n't stand him he could n't get elected dogcatcher the people of florida the people of florida and by the way , i know he s going to spend 25 million on ads without that he would n't have a chance he s 20 points south the people in florida would n't elect him dogcatcher he could n't get any he s right now 21 points down to me and , you know kelly ok trump again , there will be a lot of advertising it s the only thing that might save him but i doubt it rubio notice that s not an answer kelly i'm coming to you next but go ahead \( crosstalk \) trump he scammed the people of florida he scammed people he does n't vote he does n't show up for the us senate he does n't vote he scammed the people he defrauded the people of florida kelly with respect , you 've made that point go ahead rubio there s no as you can see in his answer , it s always the same thing trump you defrauded the people of florida , little marco rubio he has defrauding people out of things , and not just and not just , by the way , on the issue of trump university he had another development in mexico that he had nothing to do with except his name on the building people put money into that building trump that was licensing rubio they lost their money yes , licensing , but you told them you owned the building so they gave him his money they lost their money time and again kelly all right stand by i will come back to you senator cruz wants to weigh in you 're coming back go ahead cruz megyn , let me ask the voters at home , is this the debate you want playing out in the general election \? the stakes in this election are too high for seven years , millions of americans , we 've been struggling , wages have been stagnating , people are hurting , our constitutional rights are under assault and if we nominate donald , we 're going to spend the spring , the fall , and the summer with the republican nominee facing a fraud trial trump oh , stop it cruz with hillary clinton saying trump it s just a minor case it s a minor case cruz why did you give my campaign and my foundation 100 , 000 \? trump it s a minor civil case cruz and with hillary clinton trump give me a break cruz pointing out that he supported her four times in her presidential race trump it s a minor civil case cruz donald , learn not to interrupt it s not complicated trump there are many , many civil cases cruz count to 10 , donald count to 10 trump give me a break cruz count to 10 the stakes are too high and if you are one of the 65 to 70 percent of republicans who recognize that nominating donald would be a disaster , then i ask you to come join us if you 're supporting other candidates , come join us we welcome you to our team because we 've demonstrated not once , not twice , not three times , but five separate times we have beat donald and if you do n't want him to be the nominee , then i ask you to stand with us as a broad coalition of people who believe in the constitution , believe in freedom , and want to turn this country around kelly go ahead , mr trumptrump i do n't believe these politicians all talk , no action i'm standing here listening to i'm hearing him say about a percentage cnn , he gets 15 that means 85 percent , based on what you 're saying , of the people do n't dig you , number one , number one is that a correct statement \? how do you get are you at 15 in the new cnn poll \? do you believe in cnn \? i mean , i know we 're with fox but cnn spent cnn cruz all right , i 'll respond \( crosstalk \) trump cnn spent a lot of money on a poll , just came out i'm at 49 he s at 15 he tells me about 65 percent of the people it s not 65 percent of the people if you go by that , 85 percent of the people then he goes , we have five and well , excuse me , i won 10 i won 10 states if you listen to him , it s like i won 10 states everybody knows that on super tuesday trump was the winner there was n't one person that did n't say that even the two people on your left and right said we did a great job so how does he take how does he take five and say it s better than 10 \? kelly go ahead , senator trump i am by far the leader but if you listen to a politician , he 'll try and convince you otherwise kelly senator cruz , go cruz all right , well , donald lives by the polls every day he tweets about the polls trump no , i do n't no , i do n't cruz he s told us to look to the cnn poll well , that s a very good poll to look to , because that cnn poll showed that head to head donald trump loses to hillary clinton by 8 points he does n't just lose close he loses by 8 points that same poll he told you to look at shows me beating hillary clinton \( applause \) we cannot mess this up and , by the way , the last four polls in a row , when you nominate a candidate who literally has been on every side of every issue , and in the course of this debate may be on two other sides before we 're done , that s not how you win and the stakes are too high \( crosstalk \) kelly all right i'm going to let mr trump i'm going to let let me just trump according to your poll \( crosstalk \) kelly i'm going to let you respond to that , mr trump i'm going to then go to you , governor you 're up next trump i know , but your recent polls have me beating hillary clinton , and very , very easily kelly ok do you want to weigh in \? kasich all right , look , honestly , when i see people at these meetings , these town halls , where we take massive questions , and i get to spend time with them last night , there was a woman that came to tell me about the loss of her 15yearold son , who took his own life see , there s people in this country and ted s right their wages have n't gone up for so long , they see the rich get richer , they believe , and they 're not moving and they put their money in the bank , and they got no interest on their money they receive none and their sons or daughters are living in the basement because they ca n't get a good job after they rang up so much college debt what people are hungry for is , who can fix this \? people want to know who what can you do to solve the problems in washington , to make sure that we have stronger job growth and better wages \? but you know what else they 're yearning for \? they want to believe that they have the power to fix things where they live , and they want the power back , so they can begin to do things in their community now , listen , this has been going on for a long time here and i appreciate the discussion back and forth but there are a lot of people out there yearning for somebody who s going to bring america back , both at the leadership level and in the neighborhood , where we can begin to reignite the spirit of the united states of america and let s stop fighting \( applause \) kelly governor , thank you gentlemen , thank you wallace much more to come live from the fox theater , including where the candidates stand on the social issues facing the country the republican presidential debate continues in a moment \( commercial break \) kelly welcome back , everybody , to the fox news republican presidential debate we want to get right back to the questions \( applause \) baier we are here in detroit the top issues in michigan , according to facebook , are displayed in a word cloud you 're taking a look at the second biggest issue is clean water that , of course , is directly tied with the situation in flint senator rubio , bernie sanders and hillary clinton have both been to flint they are both running ads in this state focusing on that , focusing on supporting flint and fixing the problems , showing images of people in flint thankful that they 're there without getting into the political blame game here , where are the national republicans' plans on infrastructure and solving problems like this \? if you talk to people in this state , they are really concerned about flint on both sides of the aisle so why have n't gop candidates done more or talked more about this \? rubio well , i know i 've talked about it , and others in our campaign have talked about it , and other candidates have talked about it , as well what happened in flint was a terrible thing it was systemic breakdown at every level of government , at both the federal and partially the both the state and partially at the federal level , as well and by the way , the politicizing of it i think is unfair , because i do n't think that someone woke up one morning and said , let s figure out how to poison the water system to hurt someone \( applause \) but accountability is important i will say , i give the governor credit he took responsibility for what happened and he s talked about people being held accountable \( applause \) and the need for change , with governor snyder but here s the point this should not be a partisan issue the way the democrats have tried to turn this into a partisan issue , that somehow republicans woke up in the morning and decided , oh , it s a good idea to poison some kids with lead it s absurd it s outrageous it is n't true \( applause \) all of us are outraged by what happened and we should work together to solve it and there is a proper role for the government to play at the federal level , in helping local communities to respond to a catastrophe of this kind , not just to deal with the people that have been impacted by it , but to ensure that something like this never happens again baier thank you , senator \( applause \) kelly governor kasich , the city of detroit has long suffered with urban blight , broken street lights , dilapidated and vacant houses , and so on in 2013 , detroit actually declared bankruptcy , which helped , but the schools here remain a big problem they 're 35 billion in debt and are some of the most troubled and poorly testing in the country the kids too often go to classrooms that are unsafe , falling apart , infested with rodents and insects experts say the schools could go bankrupt by next month question to you if the federal government bailed out the auto industry here in detroit , should it also bail out the detroit schools \? kasich well , look , first of all , i think the mayor now is controlling the schools this is not much different than what happened in cleveland , ohio , where the africanamerican democrat mayor , the union , and business leaders came to see me and said , would you help us to pass legislation to really create a ceo environment so that we can take control of the schools \? we even invested in a buyout plan , where we bought out the teachers who had been there a long time , because there were so many young teachers who had been laid off who were so enthusiastic to get back in the schools it worked beautifully cleveland s coming back the cleveland schools are coming back because of a major overhaul it s the same thing that has to happen in all of our urban schools and , frankly , look , if i were president , i 'd take 104 federal programs , bundle them into four buckets , and send it to the states , because fixing schools rests at the state and the local level , and particularly at the school board level \( applause \) kasich now , i also believe i also believe that you need to introduce vocational education in those schools you need mentoring in those schools and you need to have a situation where people can have an alternative forum to get a degree and you need school choice , both vouchers and charter schools all of those things can come together to help , megyn but here s the bottom line and i 'll go quickly we as adults have to fight in our neighborhoods , in our communities , for our children s education put the politics aside , and everyone in this room can play a role in lifting their schools and lifting the students who are in those schools , because too much politics gets in the middle of it , and where we focus as adults , and put children first , we see tremendous results and the people of this town are going to rise and they need to be involved thank you \( applause \) wallace for for half a century , as you all know , detroit was the symbol of america s industrial might 300 , 000 manufacturing jobs in this city at last count , there are now fewer than 30 , 000 manufacturing jobs here , and the unemployment rate in this city is 11 percent , twice the national average senator cruz , i know that you have general plans for tax reform , but what specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to america and train residents of cities like detroit to do those jobs \? cruz well , chris , thank you for that question let me start by observing that detroit is a great city with a magnificent legacy that has been utterly decimated by 60 years of failed leftwing policy \( applause \) you know , henry ford revolutionized automobile manufacturing and brought automobiles to the middle class during world war ii , detroit provided funded the arsenals of democracy to help us win world war ii in in the 1960s , detroit was the silicon valley of america it had a population of 2 million people , had the highest per capita income in the country and then , for 50 years , leftwing democrats have pursued destructive tax policies , weak crime policies , and have driven the citizens out \( applause \) this city now has just 700 , 000 citizens there are vacant homes , one after the other after the other crime has been rampant , and it is an outrage and let me say to folks in the media that is a story that the media ought to be telling over and over again , the destruction of leftwing policies and the millions who have hurt because of it \( applause \) wallace well , i was going to say , i 'll give you 30 seconds to try to answer my question what specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to detroit and to train the residents here to do those jobs \? cruz the way you bring manufacturing back to america is , number one , you lift the regulations as president , i will repeal obamacare , the biggest jobkiller in america i will pull back the federal regulators , the epa and all the regulators that are killing small businesses and manufacturing and my tax plan , which is a very , very detailed plan on the website , , is what s called border adjustable we get rid of all the taxes we get rid of the corporate income tax and the death tax and the obamacare taxes and the payroll tax and we replace it with a 16 percent business flat tax that is border adjustable , which means all exports are entirely taxfree and all imports pay the 16 percent business flat tax that s a 32 percent differential what that will do , chris , is bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to this country , bring the steel industry back to this country , create an environment where when we compete on a fair and level playing field , american ingenuity can beat anyone but right now , the federal government is n't giving us a level playing field wallace thank you , senator \( applause \) baier gentlemen , the next series of questions will be on social issues governor kasich , the last debate , you were asked a question about religious liberty , in a hypothetical situation where a samesex couple approaches a cupcake maker to do their wedding here s what you said \( begin video clip \) kasich if you 're in the business of selling things , if you 're not going to sell to somebody you do n't agree with , today i'm not going to sell to somebody who s gay , then tomorrow maybe i wo n't sell to somebody who s divorced \( end video clip \) baier governor , some faith leaders got nervous about that answer do gay marriage dissenters have rights \? kasich well , look , first of all , i try to be a man of faith every day as best as i can , and i try to focus in my faith on the dos and i think the do n'ts will take care of themselves once i get the dos right , which is humility , and loving my enemy , and caring for my neighbor but secondly , look , you 're in the commerce business , you want to sell somebody a cupcake , great ok \? but now if they ask you to participate in something you really do n't like , that s a whole nother issue , ok \? another issue here s what i 'd like to see happen the supreme court ruled , i do n't agree with the ruling i'm of favor of marriage between you know , traditional marriage , a man and a woman what i hope was going to happen after the supreme court ruling is things would settle down if you go to a photographer to take pictures at your wedding , and he says , i 'd rather not do it , find another photographer , do n't sue them in court you know what , the problem is in our country in our country , we need to learn to respect each other and be a little bit more tolerant for one another and at the end of the day , do n't go to court ca n't we have common sense in america \? that s the way it used to be and there was a book written called the death of common sense we need to bring it back but at the end of the day , if somebody is being pressured to participate in something that is against their deeplyheld religious beliefs , then we 're going to have to think about dealing with the law but you know what , i 'd rather people figure this out without having to put another law on the books and have more arguments in this country why do n't we come together as a country , respect one another , love one another and lift this country \? i think that s what people want so thanks for asking baier senator cruz , the us supreme court obviously declared samesex marriage legal in all 50 states , a decision you have criticized given the current status of the law , do you believe a gay couple should be able to adopt \? cruz well , listen , adoption is decided at the state level and i am a believer in the 10th amendment in the constitution , i would leave the question of marriage to the states , i would leave the question of adoption to the states that s the way it has been for two centuries of our nation s history until five unelected judges in an illegitimate and wrong decision decided to seize the authority over marriage and wrongfully tear down the marriage laws of all 50 states now , interconnected to this is the question of religious liberty and at the last debate , one of my colleagues on this stage said on the question of religious liberty and supreme court nominees that he 'd be willing to compromise and negotiate i can tell you , for me , there are areas that we should compromise on marginal tax rates , we can reach a middle ground on but when it comes to core principles and convictions , when it comes to the constitution and bill of rights , i can tell the men and women at home i will never compromise away your religious liberty and for me , bret , religious liberty has been a lifelong passion i 've spent two decades defending religious liberty , including defending the ten commandments before the us supreme court and winning defending the pledge of allegiance before the supreme court and winning and defending the mojave desert veterans memorial , a lone white latin cross that was erected to honor the men and women who gave their lives in world war i i represented 3 million veterans for free defending that memorial and we won 54 before the supreme court baier senator , thank you senator cruz definitely avoided saying your name , mr trump , but i think he was referring to you and your religious liberty answer would you like to respond \? trump i have nothing to say i mean , generally speaking , agree with what he said i would have certainly have rather left it to the states i was always in favor i was very surprised when they came up with that decision i would have certainly i would have preferred had it been left to the states and i think most people would have preferred that baier senator rubio , the late supreme court justice antonin scalia , a conservative icon , obviously , pointed out , in the united states versus heller , that like most rights , the second amendment right is not unlimited just like the first amendment does n't allow you to go into a theater and yell fire , he said the second amendment leaves room to regulate guns so do you agree with justice scalia \? and if so , what limits would you draw around the second amendment \? rubio as few as possible the second amendment , as i 've said before , is not a suggestion it is the constitutional right of every american to protect themselves and their families it is a right that it is the second amendment for a reason it is right after the defense of the freedom of speech for a reason , for clearly the founders of our nation understood and the framers of the constitution understood that you cannot have life and you cannot have liberty and cannot pursue happiness if you are not saferubio and the second amendment when people talk about gun laws , what they need to realize is , criminals do n't follow gun laws they 're criminals by definition , they ignore the law \( applause \) but the gun rights of americans , if you are talking to a law abiding citizen and a gunowner like myself , if you pass a law , i will follow whatever the law is a criminal will not do it they will continue to pursue these guns on the black market , where they then go out and commit crimes and they steal guns from each other gun laws are not effective they simply do not provide for safety but they do , however , ensure that lawabiding people do n't have access to weapons to protect themselves and guns to protect themselves , but criminals always will be well armed they do n't care about the law they do n't follow the law we will protect the second amendment when i'm president of the united states \( applause \) baier mr trump , you were once a supporter of an assault weapons ban so do you think there should be any restrictions on the second amendment \? trump no , i'm a big defender of the second amendment and if you look at what s happened , whether it s in california , where you had the 14 people killed , whether it s in paris which , by the way , has the toughest gun laws in the world and 130 people killed many , many people in the hospital gravely injured they will be dying many people will be dying in addition if we had guns , or if they had guns on the other side of the room , with the bullets going in the opposite direction , you would not have had 130 people killed that i can tell you right now \( applause \) so i'm a very , very big supporter of the second amendment baier but in 2000 , you wrote in your book , i generally oppose gun control , but i support the ban on assault weapons trump i do n't support it anymore i do not support the ban on assault \( audience boos \) baier senator cruz \? any limits to the second amendment \? cruz well , listen , unlike donald , i would not support banning firearms in that instance , bill clinton banned many of the most popular firearms in america and by the way , the study showed that ban did nothing to reduce violent crime it just took away the second amendment rights of lawabiding citizens \( applause \) and let me point out , you know , it is easy for political candidates to have rhetoric and say , i support the second amendment but you cannot say that and at the same time say what donald just said , which is that on the question of supreme court nominees he wants to compromise and reach a middle ground with harry reid and chuck schumer that s what he said in the last debate trump i i did not say that i did not say that cruz and any justice that harry reid and chuck schumer sign off on trump i did not say that cruz and i would point out , harry reid and chuck schumer are both democrats that mr trump has written checks to repeatedly any justice that those two sign off on is going to be a leftwing judicial activist who will undermine religious liberty , and we are one vote away from the heller decision being overturned , which would effectively erase the second amendment from the bill of rights if you care about the second amendment , then you need to ask who on this stage do you know will appoint principled constitutionalists to the court and not cut a deal with your second amendment rights \? baier mr trump trump so we 're listening to the alltalk , noaction politician , and he was the primary supporter of john roberts , who gave us obamacare cruz that s flatout wrong trump no , it s not you take a look he was the primary supporter he pushed john roberts , and pushed him , and pushed him , and bush ultimately appointed him he got appointed and when it came his time to raise his hand and kill obamacare , not once , but twice , he let us down , and he did the wrong thing this is the man that was the primary supporter and you can read law journal , you can read whatever you want to read i 've read plenty of it there was no stronger supporter of john roberts than him and it was a very , very big mistake baier quickly , senator cruz cruz you know , donald has a tenuous relationship with the truth \( laughter \) i wrote one oped supporting president bush s nomination after he made it i would not have made that nomination but let me point out trump not what you say in the oped cruz if donald actually cared about trump that is not what you said in the oped cruz but , donald , please , i know it s hard not to interrupt but try trump yeah , i know it is but it s not what you said in the oped cruz breathe , breathe , breathe trump lyin' ted cruz you can do it you can breathe i know it s hard i know it s hard but just rubio when they 're done with the yoga , can i answer a question \? cruz you cannot \( laughter \) rubio unbelievable cruz i really hope that we do n't we do n't see yoga on this stage rubio well , he s very flexible , so you never know \( applause \) cruz but you cannot , in fact , care about conservative supreme court justices and support jimmy carter for president you cannot care about conservative supreme court justices and support john kerry for president , as donald did you cannot care about conservative supreme court justices and support harry reid for senate majority leader and you cannot care about conservative supreme court justices and write four checks to hillary clinton for her to be president if you care at all about the second amendment or religious liberty or anything else baier gentlemen , gentlemen , we 're going to move on thank you very much we want to talk about some more policy questions coming up wallace and coming up , the candidates tackle foreign policy but first , during the commercial break , join us for a facebook live on the fox news facebook page and tell us what you think about tonight s debate in the comments section stay with us more to come \( commercial break \) kelly welcome back , everybody we 're going it get right back to the questions wallace and gentlemen , we 're going to focus for a bit now on foreign policy senator rubio , you like to take a shot at mr trump on the campaign trail saying that negotiating a hotel deal in a foreign country is not foreign policy the other day you even compared him to kim jongun , the north korean leader , as lunatics trying to get a hold of nuclear weapons please tell mr trump why he s unprepared to be commanderin chief rubio well , first of all , i think , as we 've seen throughout this campaign , donald has not shown a seriousness about the issues of foreign policy he just simply has n't whether it was the structure of our military , even today he was asked a question about the issue of commanders not following his lead on killing the family of terrorists and his answer basically was , if i tell them to do it , they 're going to do it now that s just not true foreign policy is not only consequential , i think much of our future now depends on it you know , i see a lot of young people at my events around the country i feel great when they come and i always them that despite the hardships of the moment , i honestly believe that today s millennials have a chance to be the greatest generation we 've had in 100 years i really do because the world today has hundreds of millions of people that can afford to be their clients , their customers , their partners , people they collaborate with but that wo n't happen if the world is dangerous and it s unstable and that will require strong american leadership the next president of the united states is going to have eight years of a mess of a foreign policy to clean up that s why it ca n't be hillary clinton and quite frankly , that s why it ca n't be someone who simply has not shown the intellectual curiosity or the interest in learning about these very complicated issues and donald simply has n't wallace mr trump , your response trump well , let me just say this i 've gotten to know marco over a period of time , believe me , he is not a leader believe me rubio but that does n't answer the question \( crosstalk \) wallace he did n't interrupt you let him talk trump he did n't answer he s not a leader and , frankly , when i say they 'll do as i tell them , they 'll do as i tell them and that s very it s very simple it s very simple we are in a very dangerous place we have a depleted military totally depleted we have by the way , our vets are treated horribly we 're going to take care of our vets we 're going to start taking care of our vets , properly , like we should \( applause \) but we 're going to build up our military , and we 're going to get the equipment we want , not the equipment that s sold to us by somebody that gave him and him and not the governor campaign contributions ok \? we 're going to get the equipment that the generals and the soldiers want i will prove to be a great leader and , you know , it s very interesting , we talk about the polls every single poll when it comes to isis and the military and the border say , by far , trump is the best wallace mr trump , your time is up rubio yeah , i just want to a couple points once again , he was pressed on a policy issue to show his understanding of the foreign policy , and his reaction was just to attack somebody else with a name here s the bottom line and i'm going to repeat it again the world today is as complicated and as complex as it has been certainly in a very certainly in the lifetime of anybody here today you indeed do have a lunatic in north korea with nuclear weapons you indeed do have the chinese government taking over the most important shipping lane in the world and vladimir putin , who you 've expressed admiration for , donald trump wrong wrong rubio you 've expressed admiration for him trump wrong \( crosstalk \) rubio donald , you said he s a strong leader trump wrong rubio he is now dividing europe up trump he said very good things about me , and i said \( crosstalk \) rubio all right , i'm going to finish my statement here trump yeah , finish rubio and he s also sowing instability in the middle east you have iran who s going to get 100 billion of sanctions relief you have radical jihadists spreading all over the world this is a time for seriousness on these issues you have yet to answer a single serious question about any of this will you give us a detailed answer about foreign policy any time you 're asked on it \? trump let me just tell you , first of all , i 've been hearing this man so long talking about putin putin said about me i did n't say about putin putin said very nice things about me and i say very nicely , would n't it be nice if actually we could get along with russia , we could get along with foreign countries , instead of spending trillions and trillions of dollars \? you 're talking about flint , michigan you 're talking about places we need to rebuild the infrastructure of our country would n't it be nice if we got along with the world , and maybe russia could help us in our quest to get rid of isis , et cetera , et cetera \? \( crosstalk \) wallace gentlemen , you both have had a chance to talk you both have had a chance to talk a couple of times i 'd like to move on to senator cruz senator , we have some breaking news tonight north korea s dictator , kim jongun , has ordered that country s nuclear weapons to be made ready at a moment s notice cruz yes yes wallace and this comes just hours after the un security council announced that approved the toughest sanctions in two decades against that country assume you 're president cruz tonight what do you do \? cruz well , you 're right , the news is very disturbing that kim jongun has put their nuclear weapons on ready state i'm glad that we 're sending another carrier group to the south china sea i'm glad that congress passed sanctions on north korea but this is all the result of the failures of the clinton administration two decades ago that negotiated a deal with north korea lifting the sanctions , allowing billions of dollars to flow in , and they used that money to develop nuclear weapons in the first place what we now we 're in a much harder position when you have a lunatic with nuclear weapons , to some extent , it constrains your options we need to be moving the carrier carrier group to the south china seas we we need to be putting in place missile defense , such as the thaad missile defense system in south korea we need to be pursuing spacebased missile defense one of the advantages of spacebased missile defense is that if you have a missile launch in north korea or you have a missile launch in iran , a spacebased missile defense can take out one or two or three missiles before it can cross over and do damage and we also need to be putting pressure on china , because north korea is effectively a a client state of china all of that will happen with a strong commanderinchief that is devoted to keeping this country safe wallace thank you , senator governor kasich , i want to move back to the debate that we heard earlier about vladimir putin in december , after vladimir putin had some nice thing to say about donald trump , calling him bright and talented , your campaign ran a video suggesting that trump might name the russian president as his running mate here s a clip kasich i 'll have to see this \( begin video clip \) \( unknown \) if elected , trump promised that the dictatorial duo would , quote , make tyranny great again trump i think i 'd get along very well with vladimir putin i just think so \( end video clip \) \( laughter \) wallace that was your campaign video , sir kasich that was a pretty good one wallace well , ok kasich no , i \( crosstalk \) wallace if i may sir , if i may ask my question kasich of course wallace i think you were kiddingwallace but it was your video and the serious question is , because the suggestion is , do you think that donald trump is naive about the threat that vladimir putin represents \? kasich i'm not biting let me take you around the world , ok \? let me look , i'm going to take you very quickly in russia , we need to tell them we 're going to arm the ukrainians with defensive lethal weapons and we 're going to tell putin if you attack anybody in eastern europe in nato , you attack finland and sweden , which is not in nato , consider it an attack on us and he will understand that secondly , i would tell the chinese you do n't own the south china sea stop hacking us and we 're going to beef up our cyber command and we 're going to be in a position to be able to take out your systems if you continue to do this now let s move over into the middle east the egyptians , they know they 're on their last legs there because of the attack from isis the jordanians are really have been our friends they know that they are at risk so do the saudis so do the gulf states they are our allies , really , or have similar aims , we need to bring them closer to us turkey a critical avenue to the middle east we have to bring them towards the west , and not towards the east wallace governor kasich and we have a joint , good human intelligence that is called a semitrip around the world and if you gave me more time , i 'd finish the trip wallace governor , thank you kasich thank you baier coming up , a final question and closing statements and take a look at this the volume of conversation on facebook surrounding the remaining candidates over the last month whether that conversation is good or bad , donald trump clearly dominates the field we 'll be back with more of the republican presidential debate live from detroit \( commercial break \) baier welcome back to the republican presidential debate let s get back at it gentlemen , this is the last question of the night it has been a long time since our first debate , seven months ago in cleveland a lot has transpired since then , obviously , including an rnc pledge that all of you signed agreeing to support the party s nominee and not to launch an independent run tonight , in 30 seconds , can you definitively say you will support the republican nominee , even if that nominee is donald j trump \? senator rubio , yes or no \? rubio i 'll support the republican nominee baier mr trump \? yes or no \? rubio i 'll support donald if he s the republican nominee , and let me tell you why because the democrats have two people left in the race one of them is a socialist america does n't want to be a socialist country if you want to be a socialist country , then move to a socialist country the other one is under fbi investigation and not only is she under fbi investigation , she lied to the families of the victims of benghazi , and anyone who lies to the families of victims who lost their lives in the service of our country can never be the commander inchief of the united states baier senator rubio we must defeat hillary clinton baier senator cruz , yes or no , you will support donald trump is he s the nominee \? cruz yes , because i gave my word that i would and what i have endeavored to do every day in the senate is do what i said i would do you know , just on tuesday , we saw an overwhelming victory in the state of texas where i won texas by 17 percent and i will say it was a powerful affirmation that the people who know me best , the people who i campaigned , who made promises that if you elect me , i 'll lead the fight against obamacare , i 'll lead the fight against amnesty , i 'll lead the fight against our debt , and i will fight for the bill of rights and your rights every day , that the people of texas said you have kept your word , and that s what i 'll do as president baier governor kasich , yes or no , would you support donald trump as the republican nominee \? kasich yeah but and i kind of think that , before it s all said and done , i 'll be the nominee but let me also say \( applause \) but let me also say , remember baier but your answer is yes \? kasich but i'm the little engine that can and , yeah , look , when you 're in the arena , and we 're in the arena and the people out here watching we 're in the arena , we 're traveling , we 're working , we spend time away from our family , when you 're in the arena , you enter a special circle and you want to respect the people that you 're in the arena with so if he ends up as the nominee sometimes , he makes it a little bit hard but , you know , i will support whoever is the republican nominee for president \( applause \) wallace mr trump , i'm going to ask you a version of the same question as we saw today with mitt romney , the nevertrump movement is gaining steam some people are talking about contributing millions of dollars to try to stop you again today , you raised the possibility that you might run as an independent if you feel you 're treated unfairly by the republican party so i'm going to phrase the question that the other three people on this stage just got can you definitively say tonight that you will definitely support the republican nominee for president , even if it s not you \? trump even if it s not me \? \( laughter \) let me just start off by saying wallace thirty seconds , sir trump ok that i'm very , very proud of millions and millions of people have come to the republican party over the last little while they 've come to the republican party and by the way , the democrats are losing people this is a trend that s taking place it s the biggest thing happening in politics , and i'm very proud to be a part of it and i'm going to give them some credit , too , even though they do n't deserve it but the answer is yes , i will wallace yes , you will support the nominee of the party \? trump yes , i will yes i will kelly candidates , it s now time for your closing statements governor kasich , we 'll start with you kasich well , ladies and gentlemen , i love being here in michigan , and i want to say to all of you here that i have a record of being able to solve some of the biggest problems

behind we 've not left behind the mentally ill , the drug addicted , the working poor , the developmental disabled , and we have raised our minority community and as president of the united states , i

neighborhoods , your state , and together , we 'll restore the spirit of america and i know you want that thank you \( applause \) wallace senator rubio , 30 seconds , closing statement rubio well , i know this has been an unusual election cycle , as it continues , and there s a lot of problems in america , and people are truly hurting but this election is not just about confronting our problems it s also about embracing our opportunities i believe the 21st century holds the potential to be the greatest era in the history of the united states , if we get this election right and if we act now if we do , if we do what needs to be done , we can leave our children as the freest and most prosperous americans that have ever lived , and the 21st century can be the greatest era in the amazing story

the way to the conventions and onto the general election baier our thanks to detroit and the crowd here thank you again for joining us have a great evening
on april 19 , 2011 , the los angeles kings and the san jose sharks were tied at 55 in game 3 of their firstround nhl playoff series when the broadcaster john buccigross posted on twitter , i got doughty and pavelski for my ot winners with that act , he started a tradition that now engages thousands of hockey fans as soon as a game heads to overtime buccigross said it was a little game he used to play with barry melrose and ray ferraro when they were on nhl 2nite our show did n't start until the last game finished , and when they 'd go to overtime , we 'd throw a dollar on the table and pick a guy from each team , and if your guy scored , you got the extra two bucks , and if none of our guys scored , we 'd take our dollar back , put it in our pocket and start the show the show has been off the air since 2004 when he sent that message out on twitter , he simply wanted to play the game again it was like an instant scratch ticket , buccigross said it was easy it heightened the experience of watching the game it gave you something to root for , and it was a way to gamble without losing any money but that first night , he got enough responses from his legion of followers that he kept doing it as more playoff games went into overtime he randomly picked a few winners among the correct guesses \( the gamewinner was scored by devin setoguchi for the sharks \) at the time , he offered only retweets as a prize for being right i noticed there was real currency in being retweeted , and people used to get real mad at me when they 'd guess right but i did n't pick them as one of the random winners i'm talking real mad but then they started getting really creative and including funny gifs with their disappointment tweet , so i started retweeting some of those , too , buccigross said twelve days later , when alex ovechkin scored with 68 seconds left in regulation to tie game 3 against the tampa bay lightning and force the extra session , buccigross gave the game a name and started using the hashtag bucciovertimechallenge \( tampa bay won the game on vincent lecavalier s overtime goal \) now , becomes an instant trending topic across north america anytime a playoff game , or even a regularseason game , goes into overtime most of the stuff i do happens by accident , buccigross said i'm not that smart , so if i come up with a good idea , there s a very good chance i did n't even mean to do it i had no intention of creating a brand i just wanted to see if it could trend so it threw it out there it caught on , and thousands participated by the time the boston bruins won the stanley cup that year buccigross thought , maybe next year , i 'll do tshirts he put the idea to his followers and decided to go for it he figured he would just send them to the winners , but as soon as he released the picture of a simple white tshirt with the hashtag across the chest , he started getting messages asking how to buy them demand was strong enough that he decided to sell them , with all profits to be donated to hockeyrelated charities at the end of the year that first year , he had no website for his business , so buyers would send cash or checks with their orders in the mail he raised enough money to donate 17 , 000 to charities like defending the blueline , the mario lemieux foundation , you can play , the travis roy foundation and hockey in harlem in its five years , the hashtag bucciovertimechallenge has been used nearly two million times , according to twitter with the introduction of and an expanded product line that now includes hats and tank tops , buccigross has been able to donate nearly 150 , 000 and expects to add at least 50 , 000 to that total this july he has generated enough interest that bauer , a hockey equipment manufacturer , and tiqiq , a ticket sales website , offer prizes for the winners buccigross s social media enterprises have grown beyond the overtime challenge in 2013 , he started using another hashtag , cawlidgehawkey when he did the playbyplay of the ncaa tournament for the first time he added this to his apparel line with a tshirt and hats in various school colors this year , he introduced a shirt with the thinmints hashtag , after the popular girl scout cookies that resemble hockey pucks , a reference he often uses on sportscenter when calling highlights buccigross stores his apparel in a room above his garage , where he personally packages each order and prints the shipping label before taking it to the post office on an average day , he will get up to 10 orders , but there are days , such as when he launches a new product , when he will get more than 100 orders he will spend a whole day getting them out the door with more than 300 , 000 , he knows his reach is large , but he also knows that he is reaching only a small slice of hockey fans still , there were more than 18 , 000 tweets with the hashtag last sunday after game 6 of the series between the islanders and the panthers went into overtime in a first , buccigross announced a winner on sportscenter that night buccigross said he happened to be working when it happened and thought it would be fun to introduce that twist because john tavares s goal in the second overtime  i love that people enjoy playing the game , but the real hysterical part for me is when it s trending , he said with a laugh it s just a silly little game , he added , but as a hockey community , we 've been able to do some really great things because of it i'm just really so shocked by what it s become
donald trump s twitter account has long been famous for its creative spelling and less creative insults now it s rapidly building a reputation for something else endorsing the work of bigots on friday , mr trump tweeted the following whitegenocidetm realdonaldtrump poor jeb i could ve sworn i saw him outside trump tower the other day ! https tco e5ulrubqla  donald j trump \( realdonaldtrump \) 22 jan 16 the image is relatively tame , if in poor taste more concerning is its source , a twitter user going by whitegenocidetm benjy sarlin at msnbc has done the unpleasant work of going back through this user s timeline , and writes  recent tweets and retweets from the account include antisemitic imagery , quotes from nazi propagandist joseph goebbels and tweets deriding martin luther king jr the profile also listed a link to a website promoting a biographical documentary of adolf hitler , including a section that casts doubt on whether the holocaust actually occurred this is not the first time mr trump has retweeted something linked to neonazism as mr sarlin notes , mr trump retweeted a graphic in november that made the false claim that 81 percent of white murder victims are killed by black people \( actually , 82 percent of white people murdered in 2014 were killed by other whites \) that graphic was apparently first posted on twitter by a user whose avatar was a swastika responding to criticism over the fake stats \( from none other than bill o reilly \) , mr trump said he got millions of messages on twitter am i gonna check every statistic \? he asked well , yes somebody in the trump campaign certainly should be checking the source and accuracy of tweets before realdonaldtrump retweets them but no extensive checking would have been necessary to determine that someone with the twitter handle whitegenocidetm might not be the kind of person whose sentiments a presidential candidate should be spreading if mr trump actually wanted to avoid promoting racist ideology , though , his twitter account and his entire campaign would be different
palo alto , california cementing its standing as the most selective institution of higher education in the country , stanford university announced this week that it had once again received a recordsetting number of applications and that its acceptance rate which had dropped to a previously uncharted low of plummeted all the way to its inevitable conclusion of 0 percent with no one admitted to the class of 2020 , stanford is assured that no other school can match its desirability in the near future we had exceptional applicants , yes , but not a single student we could n't live without , said a stanford administrator who requested anonymity in the stack of applications that i reviewed , i did n't see gold medalists from the last olympics summer or winter games and while there was a 17yearold who 'd performed surgery , it was n't openheart or a transplant or anything like that she 'll thrive at yale news of stanford s unprecedented selectiveness sent shock waves through the ivy league , along with amherst , northwestern and at least a dozen other elite schools where , as a consequence , there could be substantial turnover among underperforming deans of admission administrators at several of these institutions , mortified by acceptance rates still north of 6 percent , chided themselves for insufficient international outreach carnegie mellon vowed that over the next five years , it would quadruple the number of applicants from greenland the university of chicago announced plans to host a college fair in ulan bator officials at the university of pennsylvania , meanwhile , realized that sweatshirts , tshirts and glossy print and web catalogs were n't doing nearly enough to advertise its charms , and that the university was n't fully leveraging the mystique of its worldrenowned business school so early next fall , every high school senior in america who scored in the top 4 percent nationally on the sat will receive , in the mail , a complimentary spray bottle of wharton the fragrance , which has a top note of sandalwood and a bottom note of crisp , freshly minted 100 bills seniors who scored in the top 2 percent will get the scented shower gel and reed diffuser set as well on campuses from coast to coast , there was soul searching about ways in which colleges might be unintentionally deterring prospective applicants were the applications themselves too laborious \? brown may give next year s aspirants the option of submitting , in lieu of several essays , one haiku and one original recipe using organic kale compositions of 750 or even 500 words give some students syllable fatigue , said a school official , while others exhibit their greatest creativity around roughage we want to meet them on turf , especially if it s leafy and a rich source of vitamin b6 current high school seniors who had set their sights on stanford responded to its announcement with astonishment and fury this is the worst thing that has happened to anyone , ever , said alissa parker , 18 , a senior at sidwell friends in washington , dc she added that whether she accepts an offer of admission from mit or one from duke , she 'll defer enrollment and take a gap year to regain her confidence taylor abramovich , a 15yearold senior at the horace mann school in new york city , blamed his parents for his dashed stanford dream when he was a toddler , they hired the lawyer david boies and successfully sued horace mann to let taylor begin kindergarten far ahead of schedule if i 'd been held back a year , i would have been applying to the stanford class of 2021 , when the school might start accepting students again , taylor fumed he said that his one consolation for not getting in was knowing that none of his peers did , either at first blush , stanford s decision would seem to jeopardize its fundraising the thousands of rejected applicants included hundreds of children of alumni who 'd donated lavishly over the years , their expectations obvious in the fact that they affixed their 50 , 000 checks to photographs of emma playing an obscure woodwind in an umbrian chamber orchestra or scott donning the traditional dress of an indigenous people for whom he tailored a special socialmedia network while on spring break but over recent years , stanford administrators noticed that as the school rejected more and more comers , it received bigger and bigger donations , its endowment rising in tandem with its exclusivity , its luster a magnet for silicon valley lucre in fact just 12 hours after the university s rejection of comers , an alumnus stepped forward with a financial gift prodigious enough for stanford to begin construction on its longplanned center for social justice , a firstever collaboration of renzo piano and santiago calatrava , who also designed the pedestrian bridge that will connect it to the student napping meadows
burns , ore the protesters arrived in this old lumber town to support a 73yearold rancher and his son who had been sentenced to prison for setting fires that spread to federal lands it was billed as a peaceful demonstration , but after amazing grace was sung and hugs were exchanged , a small , armed contingent declared outside a supermarket that it was taking a stand and asked who wanted to join so began the latest armed flareup in a decadeslong struggle between federal officials and local landowners and ranchers over how to manage the western range the armed antigovernment group seized empty administrative buildings on a federal refuge for wildlife about 30 miles away through the snowy sagebrush , and by sunday night , had hunkered down for what they vowed would be an indefinite standoff with the government we will be here for as long as it takes , said ryan payne , an army veteran who characterized the group s action as a liberation of public lands people have talked about returning land to the people for a long time finally , someone is making an effort in that direction he said there was already talk of renaming the refuge the harney county liberty center relatives of the ranchers convicted of arson , dwight l hammond and his son steven d hammond , 46 , distanced themselves from the armed takeover , but said they understood the underlying anger over federal land policies that many here feel are intrusive and overreaching i do n't know those people that well , except that i just see from the outside that we have a lot of things in common , said dwight hammond s wife , susan we share a lot of sentiments in regards to our government , and the overreach into management of our country the harney county sheriff , david m ward , said in a statement on sunday , these men came to harney county claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers , when in reality these men had alternative motives to attempt to overthrow the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the united states despite the stern language , there did not appear to be any imminent plan to confront the protesters there was no sign of law enforcement outside the wildlife refuge on sunday night , though the oregon state police urged people to stay away and federal authorities said they were monitoring the situation at the entrance to the malheur national wildlife refuge , people associated with the occupying group blocked the road as the temperature dropped below freezing sunday night in the high desert outside the stone cottage that is the refuge s headquarters , the occupiers set a small fire to stay warm , but the snowsaturated sagebrush would not stay lit other local ranchers periodically drove up , looked and then drove away roger wilson , 74 , a retired outdoor outfitter , drove about 60 miles just to sit in his vehicle and watch what was happening he said his own view of the situation was a bit conflicted mr wilson said he was an admirer and a friend of the hammond family i support them 100 percent , he said but he added that he was wary about what might unfold with the arrival of the armed outsiders i do n't want to see them causing problems down here , he said members of the protest group allowed reporters to walk down to the cluster of buildings which include the headquarters , a visitors center and a museum but did not allow entry into any of them a few people lingered outside in the cold among a cluster of brick and stone buildings , picnic tables and birdfeeders a lookout tower near the headquarters was clearly manned by at least one person lavoy finicum , 55 , a cattle rancher from mohave county , ariz , said he had not planned on being part of the protest he said he had originally come to support the hammonds then he found himself involved i want to leave as soon as possible , but i will stay as long as necessary , he said when asked how long the protests might go on he said none of the buildings had been damaged because doors had been open or keys could be found the group was led by ammon bundy , a rancher whose family became a symbol of antigovernment sentiment in 2014 when his father , cliven bundy , inspired a standoff between armed local antigovernment activists and federal officials seeking to confiscate cattle grazing illegally on federal land in nevada in a , ammon bundy said sunday that his group was prepared to be out here for as long as need be and would leave only when the people of harney county can use these lands as free men but their actions drew a mixed response here in harney county , an economically struggling rural area with 7 , 100 residents that has relied on sheep and cattle ranching and the timber industry residents expressed sympathy with the underlying complaints , but elected officials criticized the armed protesters as an outsider militia group whose actions had thrown their community into a harsh national glare the battle was brought to us , said dan nichols , a county commissioner who is a neighbor of the hammond family this county is n't supportive of what s being done here at all once again , it s a bunch of those who live without the county telling us what we need to do , how we need to be doing it and the repercussions if we do n't in this parched corner of eastern oregon , some counties are nearly 90 percent public land and many ranchers depend on grazing leases from the federal government ranchers in the region have tried to buck federal management since at least the 1970s , when ranchers tried to claim federal land during the socalled sagebrush rebellion the hammonds bought their ranch in oregon in 1964 , and have spent years at odds with federal land officials in the area three years ago , dwight and steven were convicted of lighting fires , in 2001 and 2006 , that they said were efforts to protect their property from wildfires and invasive plant species the fire in 2001 accidentally spread to about 140 acres of government land , documents show in 2006 , a burn ban was in effect while firefighters battled blazes started by a lightning storm on a hot day in august steven hammond had started a back burn to prevent the blaze from destroying the family s winter feed for its cattle the hammonds each served sentences for the arson charges , but they were ordered to report to a prison in california on monday after a federal judge ruled that the sentences they had served were not long enough under federal law ms hammond said her husband and son would surrender themselves as ordered the case caused a local uproar , but it also touched a nerve with farright groups like the one headed by mr bundy the bundys have been organizing opposition to the government case against the hammonds on social media in recent weeks they described the case as a tyrannical use of federal authority in a posted to facebook on saturday , mr bundy called the hammonds' case a symptom of a very huge , egregious problem that he described as a battle over land and resources between the federal government and the american people he said his group was occupying the federal site to take a hard stand against this overreach mr payne , the veteran who is also at the site , said the group was not violent but he also said members had discussed the possibility that the standoff could turn violent referring to the federal government , he added , if they think that s worth bringing their armies in here and harming or fouling that endeavor , we 'll just have to read the constitution and look at our bibles and see who s on the right side
washington vulnerable republican incumbents are increasingly raising fears about guant namo bay detainees , following a campaign strategy used by scott brown before his surprise victory in a massachusetts special election for a senate seat six years ago on monday , senator mark s kirk of illinois put forward a that would add iran and sudan to the list of troubled countries to which the military is not allowed to transfer guant namo detainees he that allowing the transfer of these dangerous criminals to terror hot spots only makes it easier for them to rejoin in the fight against america on tuesday , senator kelly ayotte of new hampshire proposed a bill that would bar the transfer of any more guant namo detainees , regardless of the individual circumstances , to other countries until at least october 2017 she that the obama administration s dangerous releases have allowed terrorists to return to the battlefield mr kirk and ms ayotte both won their seats in the 2010 midterm elections as part of the republicans' sweeping wave of victories that year , but they are in danger of losing this fall because their states are leaning to the democrats illinois and new hampshire voted for president obama in 2012 they and three other republicans who face similar challenges are using as a major campaign theme , adding to a recent pattern that has prompted mr obama to that his proposal to close the prison which he argues costs too much and fuels antiamerican sentiment is a hard case to make because it s easy to demagogue the issue but with control of the senate at stake in this election , the success or failure of the guant namo strategy may carry consequences far beyond the fate of the prison if a democrat wins the presidential election , he or she will have a far easier time governing including filling supreme court vacancies if democrats pick up at least four senate seats and regain a majority another endangered republican is senator ron johnson of wisconsin , a state that mr obama carried in 2012 last month , mr johnson that every remaining detainee was among the worst of the worst and should be locked up forever in february , he introduced a called the terrorist release transparency act it would force the government essentially to make public , two weeks before any transfer , who is leaving and where he will go , a step that could complicate the ability to reach the diplomatic deals that make many of the transfers possible and the campaign websites of pennsylvania s and ohio s , the other two republican senators running for reelection in states won by mr obama , feature petitions against the president s plan to close the prison and to move the remaining detainees to a prison on domestic soil a page on mr portman s website juxtaposes a blackandwhite photograph of the prison with a colorful photograph of a farm and invites visitors to stand with rob against closing guant namo bay and bringing terrorists to america ! the candidates hope that highlighting guant namo will not only spur more republicans to vote but also appeal to independents and moderate democrats a nationwide in march by the new york times and cbs news found that republicans favored keeping the prison open by 74 percent to 19 percent independents favored keeping it open 48 percent to 39 percent thirtyeight percent of democrats said it should stay open , while 52 percent wanted it closed still , the candidates' proposals can lack policy nuance for example , mr kirk s bill barring the military from sending detainees to iran or sudan appears to be unnecessary already bans the transfer of detainees to countries deemed to be state sponsors of terrorism , and iran and sudan are both on that list and none of the are from either of those countries while ms ayotte is warning about the risk that detainees transferred by the obama administration will return to the battlefield , shows that all but seven of the 118 former detainees who are confirmed to have engaged in terrorist activity after their release \( out of 676 transfers as of the most recent report \) left the prison under the bush administration those transferred as a result of the more individualized obamaera decisionmaking process have been far less likely to cause problems and despite mr johnson s claim that every detainee who remains in the prison is the worst of the worst , none of the 35 recommended for transfer , if security conditions can be met in the receiving country , are linked to any terrorist plot most of them are yemenis who went to afghanistan before the 2001 terrorist attacks , and are accused only of training to help the taliban fight the northern alliance they are stranded because their home country has been too chaotic to repatriate them the strategy of republican senate candidates running in democraticleaning states by striking a hard line on terrorism detainee issues traces to the jan 19 , 2010 , special election to fill the massachusetts senate seat left vacant by edward m kennedy s death mr brown had been expected to lose , but after the attempted destruction of a detroitbound plane on dec 25 , 2009 , by a terrorist who hid a bomb in his underwear , mr brown pounded on the theme that the obama administration should have sent the terrorist to guant namo rather than handling him in the criminal justice system \( it later emerged that federal bureau of investigation interrogators persuaded the terrorist to provide large amounts of intelligence , and a civilian court later sentenced him to life in prison \) while many commentators portrayed that election as a rebellion against the affordable care act , , a republican pollster who helped the brown campaign , said that was a misconception the health care issue did make the race closer , he said , but that issue was already baked in for voters by early january 2010 , when an internal campaign poll found that mr brown was going to lose to the democrat , martha coakley , by 10 points but that same poll , mr newhouse said , also showed that voters preferred by an overwhelming margin 61 percent to 29 percent handling terrorists as enemy combatants , not criminals the brown campaign jumped on that theme , even producing a television ad the terrorist issue was new information' to voters , it was timely and important , and it moved the electorate in our direction , mr newhouse wrote in a recent email along with a strong debate performance by mr brown nine days before the election , he said , it made the difference from that moment , some republicans seized on the brown campaign strategy mitch mcconnell of kentucky , the republican senate leader , in february 2010 , i tell my members , hey , you can campaign on these issues anywhere in america as scott brown demonstrated in the most liberal state in america'
manila as filipinos prepare for the on thursday of the people power revolution that toppled , the marcos family legacy is undergoing a political renaissance by those who claim it was a golden age of peace and prosperity i think marcos was our best president , said richard negre , a manila resident who was born two years after the dictator was overthrown that was when the was the leader of asia we were respected ferdinand marcos , who in hawaii in 1989 , ruled the with an iron fist for two decades , with his wife imelda , whose lavish lifestyle and thousands of pairs of shoes became a global symbol of greed and corruption marcos was removed from power in 1986 when millions of filipinos poured into the streets for days of peaceful protests but in the decades since marcos was ousted and fled the country , the outrage has faded for many filipinos despite the accusations of widespread corruption and human rights violations , none of the marcos family members have been jailed the family has quietly returned to politics mrs marcos is a now member of congress , while her daughter imee marcos is a governor the family s political resurgence is led by marcos s son , ferdinand marcos jr , known as bongbong , a popular senator who is tied for first place in the vice president s race for the may 9 national election , according to a recent survey mr marcos has built a coalition from his father s remaining supporters and young people who were not alive when martial law was declared in the 1970s he is also backed by the wellfunded families who benefited from the marcos presidency , according to ramon c casiple , executive director of the institute for political and electoral reform in manila mr marcos has also drawn close to popular politicians he often appears at rallies with the boxer , a senatorial candidate who is loved by millions of filipinos miriam defensor santiago , who is running for president with mr marcos , has a large following among young people on social media on the campaign trail , mr marcos usually discusses his plans for the future , but he has also touched on what his father s supporters consider the golden age of the philippines imelda ordu a , a 70yearold retired schoolteacher living in the city of caloocan , north of manila , who attended one of his recent political rallies , said she remembers well the time of marcos when there was no traffic , police officers did not extract bribes and criminals were on the run life was easier under marcos , she said we had peace and order and corruption was minimal we have to tell our children and grandchildren about these times mr marcos was campaigning and not available for an interview , his staff said , but during a television interview in august he said he would not apologize for his father s administration what am i to say sorry about \? he said during the interview , adding that under his father thousands of miles of roads were built , the country had one of the highest literacy rates in asia , and it was an exporter of rice the country s staple food not an importer , as it is now but , he noted during a feb 17 news briefing , the issue of martial law and his father s human rights record does not come up that often on the campaign trail people no longer ask about martial law , he told reporters they are interested in the current problems of the country , such as jobs and traffic michelle pulumbarit , 31 , a customer service operator who lives north of manila , said mr marcos was putting forward a proposal for the future that will bring back the best of the marcos years she is not concerned about martial law and human rights violations , she said for me , those are things of the past , she said that was a time when our economy was booming even imelda did a lot of good things she shared our culture with the world i can forgive her for having so many shoes for others in the philippines , the idea of a marcos golden age is not supported by the facts in her recent book , marcos martial law never again , the journalist raissa robles estimated that more than 3 , 200 people were murdered by the government during the marcos years , and about 40 , 000 were tortured it was a golden age' if you were politically aligned with marcos , said mr casiple of the institute for political and electoral reform the cronies and the warlords of marcos lived well and got the best of everything , but not the rest of society our school textbooks do n't reflect the agony of what was taking place during that time on tuesday , a spokesman for president benigno s aquino iii told reporters that the country is more successful now than it was under mr marcos it took us three decades to return our country s honor , he said we are now known as asia s rising star , an investmentgrade economy and an example of good governance lisandro claudio , a professor at the center for southeast asian studies at kyoto university , said the marcos family has changed the political narrative over time , focusing on the glamour and highprofile achievements of the marcos years they have poured a lot of money into this , he said they have engineered this resurgence for decades and it taps into something genuine that filipinos do n't think they are respected in the world anymore they feel they are globally insignificant marcos supporters note that most of the accusations against the family have never been proved in court ferdinand marcos was never convicted of a crime , but in a classaction lawsuit after his death the united states district court in hawaii for torture , summary executions and disappearances the philippine government estimates that marcos and his associates spirited away 5 billion of government funds by moving the money to overseas bank accounts , as well as buying lavish works of art and jewelry some fear that the election of mr marcos could slow the recovery of that fortune mr casiple noted that the court system is overwhelmed and in some cases judges are not motivated to rule against associates of the marcos family some of the people in the courts were appointed by marcos during martial law , he said this is a statement of the residual power of the marcos family all of the administrations that have followed marcos have had a very difficult time prosecuting them in the courts apple buiza , 26 , an employee of a manila aluminum siding company , said the fate of was not a priority for her in the next election ms buiza spends hours each day battling traffic to get to work and is frustrated by the current government she said she has heard stories of how orderly the country was during the marcos years during the time of martial law , the philippines was disciplined , ms buiza said as she gestured toward a group of jaywalkers dodging vehicles and blocking traffic people do n't even know how to cross the street now

there is a malaise within the community of moroccan origin , the mayor of molenbeek , fran oise schepmans , said , dismissing arguments that terrorism is a byproduct of religious faith leftwing politicians and community leaders , she said , had missed and amplified the trouble brewing in molenbeek by treating young belgianmoroccans as victims who had no chance of succeeding there is a strong sentiment of victimhood , she said , noting that turks have also endured discrimination but there is a force in their community much of this force comes from the turkish state , which controls many of the mosques attended by belgianturks and keeps a close eye on potentially wayward elements in the community through a wellestablished network of local leaders and imams who are trained in turkey and then sent to belgium at the government s expense at a turkish mosque in molenbeek run by diyanet , turkey s statecontrolled religious affairs agency , the imam , who speaks only turkish , expressed revulsion at the march attacks in brussels and said that he and his worshipers never tolerate extremist views he stressed that his congregants respect and follow the law worshipers at a nearby moroccan mosque angrily shooed away reporters , accusing them of fanning islamophobia and stigmatizing their neighborhood as a haven of jihadists in contrast to belgium s turks , the moroccan community is far more divided and resistant to authority , in part because many of the early immigrants came from the rif , a rebellious berberspeaking region often at odds with the ruling monarchy in morocco when emigration to europe started , the king was happy to get rid of these people , said bachir m'rabet , a youth worker of moroccan descent in molenbeek another source of anger in his community , he added , is that many turks often speak poor french and no dutch , belgium s two main languages , and cling to their turkish identity , while most moroccans speak fluent french and aspire to be accepted fully as belgians this , he said , means that many moroccans feel discrimination more acutely and , at least in the case of young men on the margins , tend to view even minor slights as proof that the entire system is against them philippe moureaux , who served for two decades as molenbeek s mayor , described this as the paradox of integration a lessintegrated turkish community has resisted the promise of redemption through jihad offered by radical zealots yet , a moroccan community that is more at home in frenchspeaking brussels has seen some of its young fall prey to recruiters like khalid zerkani , a moroccanborn petty criminal who became the islamic state s point man in molenbeek the turks suffer much less from an identity crisis , mr moureaux said they are proud to be turks and are much less tempted by extremism suspicion of and hostility toward authority , particularly the police force , run so deep among some north african immigrants in molenbeek that when the police mobilized in the area this month to prevent a group of antiimmigrant rightwing hooligans from staging a rally , local youths , mostly young men of moroccan descent , began hurling abuse and objects at the police molenbeek immigrants of turkish or other backgrounds generally have a less hostile view of the police a turkish shopkeeper who runs a general store near the police station said he feared not the police but aggressive north african youths who accuse him of being a bad muslim because he sells alcohol he noted that the youths steal , which is also forbidden emir kir , the belgianturkish mayor of saintjossetennoode , a heavily immigrant brussels borough that is worse off economically than molenbeek , said the only turk he knew about who had tried to go to syria was a young man who had fallen in love with a girl of moroccan descent he got as far as istanbul before being sent back this was a love affair , not an act of extremism , he said
existential question if a team plays an entire regular season , but few choose to watch , did it really finish with 61 losses \? unfortunately for , the past six months do count , even if their 82game campaign was of no particular interest to the general public on wednesday night , as the nets lost to a group of impostor , 10396 , they finished their season ranked among the bottom five teams in average attendance their television ratings stood 30th , dead last yet those final 201516 standings will forever record that the nets played and lost the vast majority of their games , by an average margin of more than 7 points , while laboring in relative obscurity it s bittersweet , point guard shane larkin said about reaching the finale i love the game of basketball i love my teammates you do n't want it to end without the playoffs but it s been a long season the nets bravely showed up for their final game at barclays center riding a ninegame losing streak to face a skeleton crew wearing raptors jerseys toronto already had clinched the second playoff seed in the eastern conference , and coach dwane casey was resting his top players in preparation for the postseason norman powell , who had averaged 51 points entering the game , was the highestscoring raptor in the starting lineup he proceeded to torch the nets with 30 the announced crowd of 16 , 517 rooted against the ghost lineup of visitors the nets scored the first 12 points and led by 214 nine minutes into the game yet blew that entire edge well before halftime it all looked frighteningly familiar the owner , mikhail d prokhorov , left his suite and the arena several minutes before the final buzzer we had a scrappy group out there , the interim coach tony brown said after coaching what was probably his final game for the nets lot of small guys scrapping around you want to see guys fight to the bitter end the end was surely bitter the nets' past may be unremarkable , and their present may be depressing , yet it is their future that is perhaps most discouraging the team will most likely hand over its high firstround picks to the boston celtics in each of the next three drafts that leaves only trades and the freeagent market as longshot paths for the new general manager , sean marks , who faces a challenge of enormous proportions it is unlikely that top stars in the league will flock to brooklyn , considering the team s sorry state of affairs it will also be difficult to recruit a highprofile coach larkin , though , declared that anything was possible in the nba , including a rapid turnaround this league is so crazy , you do n't know what happens , he said maybe a guy says , i 'd love to play with brook lopez' all it takes is one big free agent or maybe this team as is could just jell , the way that dallas did a few years ago nobody expected the mavericks to be that good , either since moving to brooklyn in 2012 and trading away their future for three aging celtics , the nets have gone through five coaches avery johnson , p j carlesimo , jason kidd , lionel hollins and brown lopez is the only player remaining from the team that migrated and the only one left from the squad that made the playoffs under kidd two years ago meanwhile , public indifference has taken a firm hold the nets' average television rating was just 047 for the first half of the season , according to sports business journal , down 15 percent from last season s already unimpressive numbers that translates to about 35 , 000 households , just over 20 percent of the average msg viewership for the knicks , who are having their own problems on the court jeff coplon , a brooklyn resident and a longtime nets fan who gave up his season tickets last fall after six years , said he blamed the team s sad demise on prokhorov the owner pressured the former general manager billy king into creating an instant winner , and king responded by trading away those draft picks for the fading kevin garnett and paul pierce the nets made the cover of sports illustrated at the start of the 201314 season , which may have been their highwater mark at the end of our long day s journey into night , the buck stops with prokhorov , said coplon , who still attends a halfdozen nets games against watchable opponents once you get past his raffish , russian charm , he amounts to a queasy cross between ted stepien and james dolan across the street from the barclays center before wednesday s game , a long line of eager patrons stretched around the block they were waiting to spend many dollars on the newly released air jordan 10 nyc sneakers at nike s store , and none seemed much interested in the basketball game about to begin nearby they 're not very good , russell jarvis , one of the sneaker aficionados , said of the nets from what i can tell , they 're not going to get any better any time soon but coplon had some hope i want to believe that sean marks will be empowered to turn this mess around , he said he s got that spurs pedigree but they 're going to have to show me
houston on paper , the choices have been clear for months when it comes to the s big , probably imminent return to los angeles the want to move to inglewood , calif , about 10 miles from downtown , and build a stadium as part of an entertainment district , while the and the favor an outdoor stadium in carson , calif , about 20 miles south of downtown , with enough parking for tailgaters the teams applied to relocate last month but when it comes to the league s 32 wealthy team owners and billions of dollars at stake , nothing is clear or simple as they make the call knowing they have to live with one another after the dust settles , the owners have been doing back flips to figure how to get one or maybe two teams back in the nation s secondlargest television market , while making sure the losers in the sweepstakes leave with something the league s committee on los angeles opportunities , made up of six powerful owners , including robert k kraft of the new england patriots and john k mara of the giants , have tried to broker a solution for a year , but have found none the contortions and confusion continued through tuesday first , after a threehour dinner monday night , word leaked tuesday morning that the committee voted , 51 , in favor of the carson solution the lone dissenter , clark hunt of the kansas city chiefs , is said to prefer one or no teams in los angeles then , late in the afternoon , owners revealed they had voted on two proposals the chargers and the raiders in carson or the rams in inglewood with a second team to be determined , which got the most votes , though neither option garnered the necessary 24 votes the reason the second team with the rams was not named is because the chargers and the raiders have a deal not to partner with another team , so another evening huddle was called to hash out a solution league officials , fans and a large gathering of reporters were left to parse fragments of information somebody noticed that e stanley kroenke , the rams' owner , had his limousine parked in front of the hotel where the meetings are taking place , with one of his employees saying it was waiting to take him to his private jet was he bolting because he lost \? was he bolting because he was about to win \? did he simply not like walking through parking lots \? robert a iger , the chairman of disney , who is serving as a promoter for the chargers' plan , also caused a stir just by walking through the hotel to get a coffee iger was expected to give the chargers and the raiders an extra boost he is not working for free he can take an equity stake in one of the teams as well i happen to think the carson site is the best site and the twoteam approach is the best approach and the raiders and chargers should be there , iger said after making his case to the owners if you 're going to bring the nfl back to los angeles , you should be big and bold kroenke , though , has not given up backed by shootfromthehip owners like jerry jones of the dallas cowboys , kroenke wants the nfl to plant its flag in inglewood , and he is willing to bring the chargers or the raiders in as a partner in the stadium , but not the other parts of the real estate development the horsetrading , though , has taken place behind closed doors one hint of a possible resolution came with the arrival of the seattle seahawks' owner , paul allen , who has n't been spotted at an owners meeting for years what his presence meant , besides the fact he deems the matter important , is unclear through the haze of scheming and months of posturing , dawdling and resistance , what has emerged is a snapshot of how the owners align those with some of the longest tenure the old guard , for lack of a better phrase have generally sided with the chargers' owner , dean spanos , whose father , alex , bought the team more than three decades ago art rooney of the pittsburgh steelers , jerry richardson of the carolina panthers and tom benson of the new orleans saints , among others , are said to be on his side their loyalty is based partly on spanos s long efforts to get a new stadium in san diego , and his image as a team player with the nfl , at least when it comes to league business some owners still resent al davis , who owned the raiders until his death in 2011 , and do not want his son , mark , to benefit by moving to the los angeles market , which is larger than oakland this has led to talk that spanos may be able to move to carson if he severed his relationship with the raiders but that would mean that the owners would collect on only one relocation fee expected to be around 650 million paid over 20 years instead of two a core of newer owners , though , led by jones of the cowboys , stephen m ross of the miami dolphins and woody johnson of the jets , sees the benefits of kroenke s plan to put his stadium in a splashy shopping mall they have pushed a plan that would have the chargers move to inglewood with the rams all of the scheming was cold comfort to the handful of fans of the chargers , the raiders and the rams who traveled to houston and were left to mill around outside the hotel for months , they have rooted for their favorite teams yet hoped against hope that the owners of those teams do n't abandon them if mark davis builds in oakland , he 'll be a king in a mansion , said godfather griz jones , a raiders fan who traveled to texas if he goes to la , he s renting a room
london france has no competitive league to speak of , given that paris stgermain , stocked with imported stars , already has clinched the domestic title with two months left yet players sold on the cheap by french clubs are good enough to be among the most outstanding in england this season when votes are cast for the english premier league player of the year , it could come down to a choice between leicester city s riyad mahrez and west ham united s dimitri payet both are regularly described as magicians both are dribblers from the old school , relatively small and slight figures with the flair to trick opponents , the ability to score and create goals , and the hunger to keep doing it consistently there is a third player in english soccer who might eclipse both in the eyes of some managers his name is n'golo kant he , too , plays for leicester , the team that just keeps winning at the top of the league kant , a midfielder , is different from the other two because his role is the equivalent to being a longdistance runner he clocks up the miles , game after game he wins possession like a pickpocket , so quick and so clean that he steals the ball almost before opponents realize they have been robbed kant is my battery , leicester manager claudio ranieri often says he energizes everyone when you add up the fees it cost to acquire these three gamechangers , it amounts to small change mahrez cost half a million dollars to get from le havre kant s transfer fee was 9 million from caen , and payet was traded by marseille for 16 million it has been more than 20 years since the thenpresident of the french football federation lamented at a uefa meeting that unless something was done about the english and their television money , they could destroy soccer in his country that has n't happened true , from thierry henry to eric cantona to the best of the french players now , it seems that every english club has at least one prominent frenchman but france replenishes what it loses or sells abroad one reason is that the french clubs coach technique , rather than robustness , in their academies another is that it has a huge pool of players from the immigrant communities within france , along with those youngsters from the country s overseas departments and territories who end up on the continent henry s parents moved to paris from guadeloupe and martinique zinedine zidane is from marseille of an algerian family of kabyle berbers patrick vieira , marcel desailly , jean tigana and claude makelele all moved from africa to france at a young age and learned their skills there the talents have global roots , and give credit to france for finding and schooling them of the three individuals currently standing out in english clubs , mahrez is the one who has captured the most headlines as leicester has risen , the partnership of mahrez and jamie vardy has blossomed mahrez , a winger , was born in france but represents algeria , his father s country , at the international level he has came out of the french second division to star for leicester , and he has teamed with vardy whose struggles to rise from the depths of english soccer are well documented to form the most productive striking partnership in the league , bar none payet s story is just as inspirational born on the tropical island of r union in the indian ocean , the nearly 29yearold is the player the artist who makes west ham tick last sunday at old trafford , he struck a goal against manchester united that transcended anything and everything united could conjure up payet won a free kick from 30 yards out everyone knew he would take the shot at the goal from there , and manchester goalkeeper david de gea knew exactly what to expect de gea is one of the best keepers in the world he guessed which way payet would aim the free kick , but even with his agility and his long arms , the keeper simply could not reach the ball such was the power , the precision and the trajectory from payet as he guided it inside the post last month , west ham moved to double payet s salary because the revolution going on in chinese soccer had marked him as an exciting target for its moneyisnoobject recruitment payet said no to china he is just getting recognized , still hoping to get a spot on the french team for the euro 2016 and enjoying his status with the east london team west ham and its coach , slaven bilic it is bilic , a croatian who played defender for west ham , who placed payet at the fulcrum of his team the coach sees payet as still a developing talent and would not swap his playmaker for any other player in the league what is perhaps surprising is that it took payet so long to reach his level there are reasons he was just 12 when , under a reciprocal arrangement between the island and the french mainland , he was shipped , without his family , to the academy of le havre almost 6 , 000 miles away he was homesick , immature and temperamental by 16 , le havre rejected him and sent him back to r union eventually he agreed to try again , though he was reluctant at first he progressed through nantes , st tienne , lille and marseille to where he is now a big talent but a nonconformist , he found consistency under marcelo bielsa , an argentine who happened to coach marseille for the short time payet was there when a second coach , bilic , raised the bar , payet leaped right over it he is still exploring his limits
doctor foster was recently nominated for a bafta award as britain s best miniseries of 2015 you could take that as a national lapse in taste , but consider that we nominated for an emmy in that category last year apparently , luridly melodramatic limited series constitute a universal language this threeepisode \( each runs two hours \) show makes its american debut on sunday on lifetime , which is expanding the title to doctor foster a woman scorned that represents not just american literalmindedness and lifetime womaninextremis branding , it also constitutes a minor spoiler the writer , mike bartlett , keeps you guessing for a while as to whether gemma foster \( suranne jones \) , a physician with a seemingly shiny life , is imagining that her husband is having an affair the title change offers a hint that by the end of the first hour , we and she will know that she s not crazy being right does n't mean being entirely rational , though while doctor foster has the slightly cold , melancholy vibe typical of british dramas set in the present , it also possesses a fine lunacy plunged into suspicion by a single blond hair on a scarf , gemma proceeds with breathtaking speed to cellphone snooping and then blowing off patients in order to follow her husband around town and doctor foster does n't stop there by the time gemma has worked through her problems , providing us with a dramatized tour of a number of current clich s about marriage and fidelity \( all men cheat all women want to cheat \) , she s violated most of the ethical standards of her profession and carried out blackmail , fraud and assault it s all very hard to take seriously but not that hard to enjoy the show and the cast are admirably committed to the craziness they 're perpetrating doctor foster joins the recent and then there were none in lifetime s effort to give its schedule some class by adding british miniseries the network can be congratulated for finding imports that are so close in spirit to the farfetched original movies it s already known for
viewership for thursday s two college football playoff semifinal games was down drastically when compared with last season , a clear indication that paid a price for the games' move to new year s eve had hoped to turn new year s eve into a new sports holiday to showcase the semifinal games , much as thanksgiving has become for the nfl and christmas day for the nba the network aggressively marketed the advent of the semifinals in a promotional campaign , but the effort apparently did not succeed the disappointing ratings for the orange and cotton bowls each of which turned into blowouts in the second half suggested that the semifinals are better off on new year s day , as they were last year more people watch television on new year s day than a day earlier , when many are working or celebrating still , seven of the next 10 years' semifinal games are scheduled for new year s eve espn was rebuffed in its request to move the games to saturday this season , when a larger audience would be available last year , on saturday , jan 3 , about 15 million more people were watching their televisions than on new year s eve s 3717 victory over oklahoma in the orange bowl , which started at 4 pm eastern , was seen by an average of 156 million viewers , a 45 percent decrease from the 282 million for the 2015 rose bowl , the semifinal game played in the comparable time slot on jan 1 the second semifinal , alabama s 380 rout of , averaged almost 186 million viewers in prime time , down 34 percent from the nearly 283 million for the sugar bowl last season espn tried to make the best of the performance of the semifinals by comparing them \( and the peach bowl , which started at noon eastern on thursday \) to the three bowls played on dec 31 , 2014 that allowed the network to boast of a 79 percent overnight ratings boost , although none of those bowls \( the peach , fiesta and orange \) were a part of the semifinals last season despite lower viewership of the semifinals on tv , espn said streaming of the first game was up 158 percent from last year and up 24 percent for the second game , based on average minute impressions while viewership was down for the semifinals , the primetime audience held steady for dick clark s new year s rockin' eve with ryan seacrest on abc , espn s broadcast sibling at the walt disney company that program s audience rose 2 percent to 98 million
it was a night to celebrate strong women amy schumer was the host , caitlyn jenner was honored and the guests included arianna huffington , madeleine albright and the actress reese witherspoon they also included ivanka trump when the crowd at glamour s women of the year event on nov 9 sat down for dinner at the rainbow room , a person at ms trump s table asked the question that others were no doubt thinking what would her father , who was being pilloried for remarks that struck many as misogynistic , make of her attending an event like this \? ms trump quickly broke the strained silence by saying that she was her own person soon after , she and her friend wendi deng rupert murdoch s exwife left a spokesman for ms trump said she went home not because she was uncomfortable , but because it was late and she had two small children but it was an awkward collision of the two worlds she inhabits one as a 30something manhattan socialite and role model to young professional women , the other as s oldest daughter , biggest champion and perhaps most valuable asset a lot of women have come and gone over the course of mr trump s life but through his two highprofile divorces , numerous public romances and three marriages , ivanka trump has remained a constant in interviews , the trumps , their friends and people who have done business with them described donald s and ivanka s relationship as especially close , with ms trump holding an exalted position in the family , in their company , and even in the campaign among the trump children , she is the acknowledged favorite daddy s little girl , as her older brother donald jr once described her when ms trump and her father are not together , she said , they speak as often as five times a day in the trump family business , he has given her a level of authority none of his wives , or for that matter executives , have ever had she handles some of the trump organization s biggest deals , including its acquisition of the doral resort in miami , and its agreement to convert the old post office building in washington , dc , into a luxury hotel and with mr trump s wife , melania , the slovenian former model , less than comfortable on stage , ivanka trump has served as a surrogate political spouse for a candidate who may need one more than anyone else in the race cutting a starkly different image from mr trump s more combative and impulsive public supporters , like chris christie or sarah palin , not to mention the candidate himself , ms trump , 34 , radiates disciplined poise and practiced reserve while her father uses twitter as a grenade launcher , she treats her welltended social media feeds , which are notably politicsfree , as marketing tools for the trump organization and her own line of women s clothing and accessories on march 15 , with her father in the midst of a political clearcutting through florida while facing accusations of stirring up racially charged violence at his rallies , she posted a highlighting the trumphotels creative team in waikiki under a serene image of a woman relaxing in a sundappled pool it was a fitting image for a devoted daughter who exists as an almost surreally detached counterpoint to her father s bellicosity , and yet may be his most important ally , particularly if he finds himself facing a democratic opponent who aspires to be the first female president of the united states ms trump tried to do damage control after her father seemed to have made reference to megyn kelly s menstrual cycle she was the unlikely star of a cnn town hall program last week with the trump family , talking about how her father had encouraged and empowered her and in a recent interview at trump tower , ms trump attacked , however gently , her father s critics what bothers me is how rash people are to make claims as if they knew him and they knew his viewpoint on certain topics , she said my father has an enormous heart and truly loves people all people inside her father s campaign , which has brazenly eschewed the advice of political experts , ms trump is one of a few people who can , on occasion anyway , influence the candidate s thinking she failed to persuade mr trump to apologize for accusing mexico of sending its rapists over the border , according to a person close to mr trump who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak for the campaign but , this person said , she successfully convinced her father to maintain his qualified support for planned parenthood in the face of republican criticism i think her father really listens to her , and when i say listens to her i mean i think her father respects her a great deal , and not just because she s his daughter , said carl icahn , a longtime friend of the trump family i do n't say that lightly i have a lot of wealthy friends who have kids and a few of them stand out , but not that many ms trump is the second of three children from mr trump s marriage to ivana , a former model from the former czechoslovakia she was 8 when she learned about her father s affair with marla maples from the horde of photographers waiting for her outside the chapin school on the upper east side love on the rocks , read the front page of the new york daily news in the first of many stories about their contentious split in the public imagination , mr trump had become a symbol of greed and excess to ms trump , he remained a doting father and unlike donald jr , who did not speak to their father for a year , ms trump never blamed him for the divorce at chapin , a close friend recalled , ms trump would check in with him almost every day , calling him collect from a pay phone tucked away in a janitor s closet on weekends , he often brought her to visit his various construction sites , or whisked her and her friends off to palm beach with him on his jet to play golf and order room service at maralago after eighth grade , ms trump s parents sent her to boarding school at choate rosemary hall in connecticut in college , she was featured prominently in the 2003 documentary born rich , as part of a cast of heirs and heiresses reflecting on their extreme privilege most of her costars spoke about the corrupting influence of wealth on their young lives by contrast , ms trump seemed to idealize her family , speaking about how proud she was of her parents and the trump name , and showing off her childhood bedroom , with its sweeping view of central park there was no hint of teenage rebellion on or off the screen , recalled the film s producer , dirk wittenborn she had a message to deliver and she delivered it ms trump sought a degree of independence , taking up modeling in part to have her own spending money \( she s got the best body , mr trump said of his daughter to howard stern in 2003 she made a lot money as a model a tremendous amount \) but she never strayed far from her father after ms trump s sophomore year at georgetown , she transferred to the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania , his alma mater , majoring in real estate she would soon go to work for the trump organization a childhood friend of ms trump s , tamara goldstein , remembers standing on the roof of trump tower with her in the summer of 2004 , shortly after they had both graduated from college how amazing is it that i have an opportunity to change the actual landscape of this skyline , ms goldstein recalled ms trump saying over the years , ms trump began to assume more responsibility and autonomy within the family business in the past , he 'd have 10 deals going with lots of different lawyers and nondescript employees , said thomas barrack , a real estate investor who sold the plaza hotel to mr trump in 1988 and has remained close to the family since but nobody really had the authority to do anything that all changed with ivanka her father still has the final say over what to buy and how much to pay for it , but ms trump now personally negotiates almost all of the company s major deals she is very , very trusted by me , mr trump said in an interview she has great realestate instincts and great political instincts those who have sat across the table from her describe her as atypically calm and eventempered in an industry often characterized by threats and bluster she s been thrust into this environment of hightestosterone realestate males , and she never loses her cool , said michael ashner , the chief executive of winthrop realty trust , which sold the doral to the trump organization in 2011 for 150 million in cnn s trump family interview last week , ms trump cited her power within the family business to defend his attitude toward women so for me , his actions speak louder than the words of many politicians who talk about gender equality but it s not evidenced in their daily employment practices , she said her style may be more lowkey than her father s , but like him , ms trump has also been accused of engaging in hyperbole a 2010 lawsuit claimed that she , as well as her father and older brother , had in public statements drastically overstated the number of units that had been sold in trump soho to make the luxury condominium project appear financially healthier than it really was mr trump and his codefendants settled the case , agreeing to refund 90 percent of the plaintiffs' deposits , while admitting no wrongdoing and ms trump ran into some trouble with her own business recently , when 20 , 000 of her ivanka trumpbrand scarves were recalled for violating the united states' flammability standards they , like some of her father s own clothing products , were manufactured in china , the kind of outsourcing mr trump is fond of criticizing on the stump ms trump and her husband , jared kushner , were married in 2009 at the trump national golf course in new jersey to marry mr kushner , ms trump had converted to judaism under an orthodox rabbi , and she recalled her father wearing a skullcap beneath a huppah erected on the 18th green guests were given white flipflops with the words jared and ivanka engraved on the insoles mr kushner s father , charles kushner , had also made a fortune in real estate and was a democratic power broker in new jersey but he was perhaps better known for his fall than his rise not long before jared kushner and ms trump met , for tax fraud , election law violations and witness tampering among other things , he had hired a prostitute with a hidden camera to entrap his brotherinlaw ms trump and her husband now live in a penthouse on park avenue with their three young children jared kushner is also doing his part to help sand his fatherinlaw s rough edges he has made phone calls on mr trump s behalf to influential republicans , while the newspaper mr kushner owns , the new york observer , his candidacy ms trump , meanwhile , has traveled across the country with her father , joining the populist swirl of rallies

hsiuchen kuei waited until her husband and three sons had gone to bed one night recently before surreptitiously beginning work on an ambitious personal project as they slept , kuei , 48 , a stayathome mother from san jose , calif , hunkered down at her computer and began poring over highlight videos featuring charlotte hornets guard , her favorite player she fumbled around on final cut pro , a videoediting program , splicing together the specific clips she had sought she did this for six straight nights , three hours each night on april 5 , kuei uploaded her finished product , a sixandahalfminute video , to youtube she called it piecing together clips of lin being whacked in the face , clotheslined , bleeding , tumbling to the floor all without ever drawing a flagrant foul kuei tried to convey that lin , an americanborn son of immigrants from taiwan , was the victim of excessive physicality from opponents and insufficient protection from the league and its referees to kuei s surprise , the video soon attracted close to a million views , capturing the attention of basketball fans around the world and the eye of the league with its bruising simplicity , it revived questions about the fairness and consistency of officiating in the nba and led to conversations about latent racial biases with its farflung reach , it reiterated the power of social media in the contemporary sports landscape i'm just happy that people are noticing this , kuei said in a telephone interview on tuesday it s not about views i did n't get money or anything i did n't want attention i just want lin to get fair calls kuei s original clip had been viewed more than 980 , 000 times and had more than 1 , 000 comments through thursday morning a of the video with chinese subtitles had more than 750 , 000 views on youtube threads on online messages boards , like reddit , engendered fevered discussion and debate the video kept spreading media outlets in taiwan and hong kong , where lin has many fans , ran stories on it this week though it seems not yet to have attracted the attention of the news media on the chinese mainland , fans on social media there have taken notice a copy of the video has spread on weibo , a popular microblogging service to accompany the video , kuei recruited two online acquaintances from lincentric message boards to help draft a letter to send to the nba she then encouraged fans some of whom she understood might not be comfortable writing in english to copy the letter and send it to the league , too throughout lin s six years in the nba , we have continuously witnessed lin as the recipient of numerous hard fouls with unnecessary and excessive force by other players , the letter reads in these cases , the referees either did n't make the calls or made incorrect calls the nba responded with a statement it was a notable victory a grassroots , fanled project receiving acknowledgment from a major sports league but the nba stood by the handling of all the plays highlighted in the video fans who wrote to the league received a letter encouraging them to read the rules that categorized fouls a similar statement was forwarded to news media outlets seeking comment while some of the plays in the video involved hard contact , none was subsequently deemed a flagrant foul given the full circumstances , angles and comparables from past games , the statement reads kuei and her partners found the league s response disappointing and unsatisfactory they are telling us to look at the rules , but it does n't seem like they are looking at the rules , said jenny wei , who was born in taiwan and now is a stayathome mother in los angeles she composed the first draft of the letter i feel like they think we 're not smart or we do n't know basketball we know basketball the video eventually made its way to lin , who expressed his appreciation for the group s efforts after the hornets' game on sunday night in an interview with dennis tsai , a reporter for apple daily of taiwan , lin said he agreed with the premise of the video , even as he acknowledged that there was little about the situation that he could control i'm just psyched that the fans are trying to do something about it and trying to push the league to at least review some of the stuff ,  the three fans involved in the project kuei , wei and koonping chan , a fan from bayside , queens , who was born in hong kong and helped edit wei s draft have never met in person , but they interact almost daily in online chat groups they all began following lin and now belong to the fervent community of lin supporters that spreads over multiple continents they did not attempt to establish a case through statistics because data cannot capture what was at the heart of their complaint it was the brutality of the individual fouls , not the overall tally , that angered them did you see those fouls , how his neck snapped back \? wei said critics of the video have suggested that similar ones could be made about other players kuei , who was born in taiwan , does not disagree but does not feel that it contradicts her view that lin gets shortchanged she said fans of other players should make their own videos through this , i just want to make sure the rules apply to every player and players get protected by the rules , kuei said though kuei s video does not attempt to speculate on the root cause of lin s perceived treatment , much of the ensuing discussion has gravitated toward lin s race when yu guohua , a first cousin of lin s mother and a retired plastic factory worker who lives near hangzhou on mainland china , learned of the video , he said , of course he s being badly mistreated statecontrolled media in mainland china occasionally highlights what it portrays as unfairness to asians in the west , and yu was quick to attribute any unfairness toward lin to such bias that is probably the cause , yu said kuei noted that neither the video nor the letter accused anyone of racism but she and her partners said they understood why people might be drawn to such conclusions i do think , in my mind , clearly at a minimum , we could say he s being treated differently , said chan , 68 , a former banker we want people to make up their own minds , to try to interpret it wei agreed i experience things as an asian in america , she said it s there though the group has found the league s response underwhelming , it has been invigorated by the reaction from other fans and the news media the video inspired a followup examination on wednesday from the espn reporter tom haberstroh , who noted that the 813 fouls that lin had drawn over the past three seasons represented the highest total for a guard and the third highest number for any position without a flagrant foul , a particularly hard foul that can lead to an ejection that proved it , wei said of the report , laughing we 're not crazy kuei said she had more hard fouls in mind to use for a video sequel , if she determines it is necessary for now , she will watch the playoffs carefully to see if lin gets any calls from the referees and just as important , she will divert some of her attention back to other issues she left unattended while defending her favorite player i have n't filed my tax returns yet , kuei said with a sigh i spent too much time on the video
when i first met antonin scalia , i was a small child with one brown ponytail atop my head which is odd , because i was a fullgrown woman and my hair was short and blond still , sitting on the black leather sofa in his chambers , i remember shrinking overpowered by his intellect and his enormous personality , i felt that my feet no longer touched the floor i had become lily tomlin s iconic character , edith ann , in that great big rocking chair and now i had to convince this giant of a man to hire me as his law clerk when i share that memory with others who were fortunate enough to have worked for him , heads , mostly male and uniformly accomplished , nod in recognition i do n't believe that any of the clerkorati , as he liked to call us , ever felt quite fullsize in his presence i am often asked what it was like to be a woman clerking for justice scalia much like being a man clerking for him is my easy answer justice scalia believed in one simple principle that law came to the court as an not an statutes , cases and the constitution were to be read for what they said , not for what the judges wished they would say each of his opinions needed to conform to that principle and to be written clearly , forcefully and accurately if you could help him with that , you were useful to him if not , then not when we were working , we sometimes joked that he could not even remember our names the final step in producing an opinion , after the justice had turned his elegant and pointed pen on the humble drafts we law clerks submitted , was called booking we would wheel a library cart into his chambers \( we used actual print volumes back then \) and sit beside him on the big leather couch , feeling ourselves once again grow smaller as he read through every statute , case or article cited in support , front to back woe to the clerk who tried to cut a corner , or to cheat even a little worse yet if he thought you had done it to try to reach a particular outcome that the law would not support and no explaining why it was n't your fault strict liability for law clerks , we used to joke but that was the right rule this is the supreme court , not a moot court competition , he would remind us we have a duty to get things right as impatient as he may have been with our missteps , he truly valued our input he had no use for sycophants he wanted to get things right and , therefore , he valued clerks who would argue with him about why his initial thinking might be wrong if you could prove your case , you could win him over but it could not be done with appeals to emotion , or outcome , or legacy , or anything else the only way to convince him was to show him that the law was on the other side \( usually by peeking nervously over his shoulder as he read , and questioned , and then reread the cases \) my proudest moment as his clerk was convincing him , with two sleepless nights of research into dusty old precedents , that a criminal defendant should win a case that none of the justices originally thought he should win i'm pretty sure that was the moment he was most proud of me , too as much as he was all about the work , the boss , as all his clerks affectionately called him , also loved to play we once had a beer tasting in chambers , when the boss s questions at oral argument revealed that he did n't know the difference between a porter and a pale ale he was more of a chianti man and would often take us to lunch at his beloved av ristorante italiano , where he would order a pizza with extra anchovies we began the year casting lots for which one of us would be forced to help him eat it by the end of the year , we had all decided that anchovies were pretty good when we were n't working , he had no trouble with our names and , indeed , treated us as though by being his law clerks , we had all acquired a new one scalia his annual lawclerk gathering a blacktie dinner , with a comical roast of the justice and a reading of some of his best zingers from opinions past was a family reunion he and his wife , maureen , took a personal interest in our lives , our careers and our children , whom the justice referred to as his grandclerks like any family , we had our disagreements , both with him and among ourselves we have differing views on law , politics and religion but i have yet to meet a scalia clerk who was not grateful to the man who taught us , shaped us , and launched us into our lives in the law justice scalia s passing leaves a giant void in the court and in the intellectual discourse over the law it is difficult to imagine anyone filling the gap we , the clerkorati , left behind in our great big chairs , feel also an enormous hole in our hearts we will miss him
the texas attorney general said tuesday that daily fantasy sports constituted illegal gambling under the state s laws , putting that nascent billiondollar industry at odds with another of its most vital markets in his opinion , the attorney general , ken paxton , wrote that fanduel and draftkings , the two largest daily fantasy sports companies , were clearly taking illegal bets under state law texas prohibits bets that hinge on the partial or final result of a game or contest or on the performance of a participant in a game players of daily fantasy sports assemble their own teams of professional athletes and engage in competition based on the players' statistical performances in games paid daily fantasy sports' operators claim they can legally operate as an unregulated house , but none of their arguments square with existing texas law , mr paxton said in a statement simply put , it is prohibited gambling in texas if you bet on the performance of a participant in a sporting event and the house takes a cut mr paxton , however , said that traditional fantasy sports leagues , those played over the course of a season , were legal under texas law texas is among the largest states to determine that daily fantasy sports are forbidden by state law it is unclear what mr paxton will do next the opinion reflected his view that a court would likely determine that participation in daily fantasy sports leagues is illegal gambling mr paxton s spokeswoman , katherine wise , said that his role was to provide legal interpretation on existing texas laws on illegal gambling and fantasy sports we cannot speculate on potential legal actions , she said we will allow the opinion to speak for itself draftkings said it would continue to operate in texas we strongly disagree with the attorney general s prediction about what the courts may or may not do if ever presented with the issue of whether daily fantasy sports are legal under texas law , said randy mastro , a lawyer representing draftkings john s kiernan , a lawyer for fanduel , said in a statement today s advisory opinion by the attorney general of texas is founded on a misinterpretation of the law and misunderstanding of the facts about fantasy sports fantasy sports has always been a legal contest of skill in texas attorneys general in new york and illinois have already said that daily fantasy sports are not legal under their state laws , prompting fanduel and draftkings to initiate costly and probably lengthy litigation in both states with texas accounting for more than 5 percent of those companies' players , it means the companies are at risk of losing more than 25 percent of their customers , according to eilers krejcik gaming , a research firm focused on the gaming industry new york , with more than 12 million customers , is the largest market , and the companies will lose a combined 35 million to 40 million annually , according to eilers illinois is its thirdlargest market , with 67 percent of the industry s customer base last week , john treadwell , vermont s assistant attorney general , said the games were illegal in his state , while maryland s attorney general asked the state legislature to revisit a 2012 law that made fantasy sports legal , but without first conducting a referendum legally , these fantasy sports sites will have to go at it state after state after state , said the rev richard mcgowan , a gaming expert and an associate professor in the economics department at boston college now there are certain states , like massachusetts , that are going to be friendlier than others , but fanduel and draftkings are really going to have a tough time on their hands if they have to defend themselves in each state the new york attorney general , eric t schneiderman , in particular , appears to have dug in for a long legal battle by concluding the games constituted gambling , he highlighted the conflicted relationships that major sports leagues had with daily fantasy sports while opposing legalized sports betting he has since amended his lawsuit and wants fanduel and draftkings to give back the hundreds of millions they have made in the state and pay a stiff penalty for running what he contends are illegal gambling operations mr schneiderman said that the two sites engaged in repeated and persistent fraudulent acts , including misrepresenting the likelihood that a casual player would win a jackpot and the degree of skill involved in the games father mcgowan said the survival of the companies may depend on their agreeing to state regulation and paying a premium each state will protect them as long as they make sure they share a certain amount of their revenue , he said the state will say , ok , we 'll allow you to set up an entry barrier as long as you give us a nice chunk of money back in the form of taxes'
in sunday s season premiere of hbo s , selina meyer \( \) is locked in a cliffhanger electoralcollege tie , girding for a recount in nevada and facing the possibility that congress may give the presidency to her running mate and frenemy , tom james \( hugh laurie \) but her more immediate problem is appearing in public with an enormous stress pimple on her face richard nixon had a cancer on the presidency veep has a zit on the president over four seasons , veep , created by armando iannucci \( the bbc s the thick of it \) , has been american politics' most obscenely funny satire , developing a feel for the war of appearances and the exquisite humiliations of washington by focusing on the vice presidency , the spare tire of democracy , it rendered the government small enough to drown in an acid bathtub its fifth season is in fine , familiar form but something funny has happened to its context amid the threats , apocalypticism and ugly passions of the 2016 election , its bloodless cynicism and petty stakes are almost reassuring , like president bartlet s idealism was after the clinton impeachment this is what we 've come to , america veep is now our west wing as expressed through ms louisdreyfus s electric hunger , veep is about the sisyphean tease of being this close to power and never quite grasping it even when selina became president last season , after a surprise resignation , she was already midcampaign , empowered but not elected , sworn in but not ratified in the premiere , selina addresses the public passiveaggressively it falls to the people to choose their president , and that is what you to do last night and assembles a team to litigate the recount \( offcamera , she snaps , i forgot to thank the voters for making our country look like a high school spanish club \) the tie puts the new season in the zone of uncertainty where veep thrives , a schr dinger s oval office in which selina is simultaneously president and not president her toadies and allies of convenience are unsure where the power lies now , who best to suck up to mr iannucci left the show after season 4 , but while his caustic language is indispensable , it is fortunately not inimitable the new episodes are just as amorally hilarious when selina needs to keep a conversation from going public , she tells her aide amy \( anna chlumsky \) , this meeting cannot make it past the schoolbook depository amy answers , i'm loading my gun , i'm going to the sixth floor right , amy s back you remember her quitting in exasperation last year \?

in january , when the saudi royal family first floated the idea of in saudi aramco , the kingdom s company , many analysts regarded the proposal as an intriguing nonstarter they were intrigued because even a partial privatization could create a company larger than , the world s largest publicly owned oil company they were skeptical because initial public offerings on global exchanges require disclosure and scrutiny , as well as a record of transparent corporate governance these are not aramco s strong points the idea got another look this month , when king salman issued several royal decrees to revamp the oil ministry and other agencies the decrees were seen as support for saudi vision 2030 , a development plan by the deputy crown prince , mohammed bin salman , to modernize the saudi economy and society by ending its oil dependence and perhaps making other limited reforms the crux of the plan is an ipo of a stake in aramco to help finance the kingdom s transformation the king s endorsement increases the chances that an ipo will occur , though the scale of the offering remains unclear it could be relatively small and restricted to saudi investors , thus avoiding the need for the heightened transparency normally associated with ipos conversely , despite the lack of transparency , a larger offering could be in the cards , promoted in part by bankers and consultants who stand to reap a fortune in fees on the transaction either way , an aramco ipo raises questions , and what investors do n't know about the company the accuracy of its claimed oil and gas reserves , for instance is only one of them an investment in aramco would also be an investment in a kingdom that systematically represses women , and hence , in human and social capital none of the many officials named to new posts in the decrees were women though ostensibly aimed at modernization , neither the development plan nor the decrees propose changes in the kingdom s basic political arrangements , in which religious fundamentalists uphold the legitimacy of the royal family in exchange for freedom to foster and spread extremist ideology there is also no explanation of how even a big infusion of cash would build new industries from nothing and transform s estimated 20 million subjects into selfsupporting employers and employees moody s investors service , the , alluded to all that when it a week after the decrees were issued , citing the kingdom s reduced ability to weather future shocks in the face of lower growth , higher debt and dwindling financial reserves low oil prices in moody s view , it is too soon to tell if the new plan will revive the credit rating or if the proposed reforms can be achieved without causing social unrest saudi arabia desperately needs to modernize , and even talking about that need is a step forward but neither the saudis nor their global bankers should pretend that an ipo of aramco , as the company is currently configured , is a viable means to that end
manchester , nh and senator of vermont are both playing to win the democratic primary here , and there may already be a handful of losers in their battle the mainstream republican candidates bear with me here in most states , republican and democratic primaries unfold on different tracks but in new hampshire , the state s open primary creates a strange tug of war between candidates in opposite parties , as they fight over a shared group of political independents who can vote in either primary a democratic candidate who wins over independents may do more than pick up support in her own campaign she may also pull away votes from a moderate republican pursuing the same constituency had mrs clinton won iowa by a big margin , some of the drama might have left the democratic contest here , releasing a sliver of centrist and leftofcenter independents to vote on the republican side gov of ohio has organized his campaign around attracting those voters so , too , to some extent , have gov of new jersey , former gov of florida and senator of florida but the stronger mrs clinton looks in her fight with mr sanders , and the more assertively she positions herself toward the political center , the more votes she is likely to shave away from every republican not named or  it happens routinely in campaign events here a candidate finishes his speech by praising the granite state electorate he hails the unique seriousness with which voters here embrace democracy in other states , he says , they 're not like you but when he begins taking questions , only a few minutes go by before someone in the audience begins , i came in from massachusetts this morning in a small state like new hampshire , in easy driving distance of cities across new england , a political circus of this scale attracts no small number of tourists some hail from even farther away one questioner at a townhallstyle meeting with mr christie on monday introduced herself as an undecided independent voter i drove the furthest , she said i came from montana for candidates , the interlopers are , at worst , a small distraction from wooing actual new hampshire voters but for reporters looking to gauge the energy and momentum around a candidate , the influx of outsiders can be deceptive the large crowds at mr trump s campaign events are studded with voters from massachusetts or maine who freely admit that they drove in to see a great show none of them can vote on feb 9 new hampshire s special status turns local officeholders and community leaders into political kingmakers endorsements do not come only from senators and governors the owner of a popular local restaurant can be a prized recruit in a presidential campaign the role of an endorser , however , is not necessarily a glamorous one leaving a kasich campaign event , i spotted a dignified gentleman with white hair handing out pamphlets he looked like gordon j humphrey , but surely it could not be \? it was mr humphrey , 75 , a former twoterm senator from new hampshire , is an enthusiastic supporter of mr kasich asked if distributing leaflets was below his pay grade , mr humphrey insisted it was not he said he would do whatever he could to help his candidate when mr humphrey first ran for the senate , in 1978 , he was the consummate political outsider an airline pilot by training , he ran on a strident conservative message and he won yet the republican primary race this year , defined by mr trump s incendiary rhetoric , has been too much for him it is out of control , mr humphrey said we now have candidates who are appealing to base emotions on a scale never before seen that s out of control
, engaged in a brutal war against the islamic state , faces myriad other problems , including a depleted treasury and a weakening dam in mosul that if not repaired could flood a huge strip of territory and kill thousands none of these problems can be effectively addressed given the failure of governance and societal cohesion that has now produced another political crisis on tuesday salim aljubouri , the parliament speaker , suspended parliament , days after lawmakers voted to remove him and elected an interim replacement the turmoil centers on political corruption and fiscal mismanagement , which have become major issues since oil prices , sharply reducing the country s main revenue source as iraq s military battles  in february , under pressure from the shiite clergy and with support from america and iran , prime minister haider alabadi proposed a cabinet overhaul that would remove appointees with political and sectarian connections and replace them with presumably less corruptible nonpolitical technocrats after the list of technocrats was announced on march 31 , shiite political blocs , which dominate the government and fear the loss of patronage and influence , pushed back and forced mr abadi to include more of their allies moktada alsadr , a radical shiite muslim cleric who once fought american troops and has refashioned himself as an anticorruption reformer , is using the threat of street protests to demand more representation for technocrats and mr abadi s resignation parliament has postponed action on mr abadi s cabinet overhaul three times and this has led to moves to oust mr jubouri as well mr abadi has been unable to repair the social divisions and sectarian tensions that former prime minister nuri kamal almaliki fed by alienating sunnis and kurds , who are minorities in the majority shiite nation by refusing to consult other political leaders in advance , mr abadi has failed to build the coalitions needed to support initiatives like the cabinet overhaul even the went unaddressed until the americans publicly warned of impending disaster only then did baghdad name an italian firm to make repairs such political dysfunction has been the one constant in iraq since the american invasion in 2003 it has made some people rich and powerful , and has left millions of others without jobs , public services and hope of a better life now with the islamic state holding significant territory in iraq , including mosul , the secondlargest city , the government s incompetence poses a regional threat the united states is working with iraq to prepare for a major assault to retake mosul , a necessary goal but president obama has done little to explain the expanding mission to the american people to win public support there are now about 5 , 000 american forces in iraq , despite mr obama s past pledges to withdraw all troops on monday , pentagon officials said they were moving american military advisers closer to the front lines , giving iraqis eight helicopters and providing 415 million to pay the salaries of kurdish militias american officials have been trying to persuade iraqi leaders to calm the frictions and focus on the urgent islamic state threat even as the iraqis pursue military victory , they also need to create a plan to rebuild mosul and allow sunnis who remained after the terrorist group forced yazidis , assyrians and other minorities to flee more selfgovernance but so far , the political chaos makes that impossible it would be disastrous if americans , iraqis and their partners were to succeed in the military campaign against the islamic state only to have the politicians in baghdad squander another chance to build a better future more than 13 years since saddam hussein s overthrow , there s less and less reason to be optimistic

paris as rain again drenched the , the lone grand slam tournament without at least one roofed court , no men s matches were played to completion for a second straight day on tuesday but two women s fourthround matches interrupted by rain on sunday were finished despite intermittent drizzle , leaving the favorites losing and fuming the more striking reversal came on suzanne lenglen court , where secondseeded agnieszka radwanska led 102ndranked tsvetana pironkova , 62 , 30 , when play was halted on sunday pironkova turned the tables on tuesday and completed a 26 , 63 , 63 victory pironkova raced out of the gates and did not look back , winning the first 10 games to take the second set and build a commanding 40 lead in the third radwanska had trouble guiding the weighty , waterlogged balls in the changed conditions , and she received medical attention for her right hand midway through the third set mentioning an operation she had on her hand years before , radwanska said she could n't really play in that conditions , end of story , before criticizing tournament officials i'm just so surprised and angry that we have to play in the rain , radwanska said before unfavorably comparing the decision to those made at a low level of sanctioned professional tennis i mean , it s not a 10 , 000 tournament it s a grand slam how can you allow players to play in the rain \? radwanska was not the only favorite whose play was bogged down sixthseeded simona halep led , the no 21 seed , 35 , in the first set when play was stopped on sunday , but stosur returned tuesday with newfound purpose and poise in sopping conditions on court 1 , stosur quickly gained the upper hand , beating halep , 76 \( 0 \) , 63 stosur , a finalist here in 2010 , was beaten badly by halep three weeks ago in the semifinals at madrid , losing by 62 , 60 in less than an hour i 've really had to learn quickly what went wrong there and why it went wrong , more importantly , stosur said again , i was pretty sure about all those things , and then had a good plan of what i wanted to do and had to stay on that path halep , like radwanska , was upset about having to play through the drizzle i have no words , halep said it was impossible to play , in my opinion , and to play tennis matches during the rain , i think , is a bit too much but everyone was in the same situation , and who was stronger won today stosur voiced fewer complaints about the conditions i'm just playing , she said if the umpire says we 're stopping , we 're stopping i do n't know what the forecast is i know what it feels like out there , and i know it was raining for the first time we went out today , but the court was ok , for the most part in a quarterfinal scheduled for wednesday , stosur will face pironkova , a 28yearold bulgarian , who has been and other fast surfaces , having reached the wimbledon semifinals in 2010 and the quarterfinals there in 2011 like stosur , she was more accepting of the conditions usually if the court is not fit for play , like if it s slippery , they would cancel the match right away , '' pironkova said but today the court was still hanging in it was ok we could have played , and so we did the men in action tuesday were more vocal about their grievances midmatch , though since no matches finished , none of the men made it into news conferences , where they could have provided more details in the match after stosur and halep s on court 1 , david goffin and ernests gulbis fumed about the conditions before the match was suspended with gulbis leading , 30 goffin , normally one of the tour s most placid players , was irate from the beginning of the match and received a code violation for launching a ball out of the stadium after only two games he expressed skepticism at the ability of the supervisor donna kelso to assess the conditions as play stopped and started despite the rain , saying that she had never played tennis goffin had frequently complained about the risk of injury , and he and gulbis had packed their bags to leave the court before any postponement was declared goffin s coach , thomas johansson , was more supportive of the officials , saying , they know what they are talking about monday s , creating a backlog of fourthround matches for tuesday , the day the quarterfinals were supposed to begin on tuesday , with only two singles matches completed , play was called off shortly before 7 pm i think they made a great decision yesterday canceling early they were right , johansson said i think today , they also made a good decision justin gimelstob , a former player who is working as a tennis channel commentator at this tournament , said the officials' decision involved more factors than just the slippery clay surface , which can absorb more moisture than any other surface on tour when you do n't have any traction on the clay , then you ca n't play on it , gimelstob said that s what they look for but it s not just the clay it s the lines , it s water in your eyes , it s the increased weight of the wet ball that puts more pressure on your arm everything is affected everything matters there is nothing that is n't affected by the rain marcel granollers , like radwanska , received medical attention on his wrist and hand during his match against dominic thiem , who won the first set , 62 , before dropping the second , 67 \( 2 \) david ferrer led tomas berdych , 21 , in the first set when the match was stopped topseeded novak djokovic , who was leading roberto bautista agut , 36 , 64 , 41 , when play was suspended , had expressed eagerness to play on after a subpar start in which he dropped the first set in 47 minutes during one stoppage , he walked back onto the court to a smattering of applause he then politely took a roland garrosbranded umbrella from a woman sitting courtside and began jauntily skipping along the baseline in a scene reminiscent of gene kelly in singin' in the rain four women s fourthround matches , including those involving serena williams and venus williams , and two men s quarterfinals scheduled for tuesday will be played wednesday weather permitting , of course
le bourget , france french aviation officials on sunday called for stricter international monitoring of the mental health of pilots and for guidelines that could require doctors to report pilots whose psychological condition might imperil public safety the recommendations were part of a report by french accident investigators into the deliberate crash last year of a germanwings jetliner by its copilot , the inquiry found that doctors had prescribed mr lubitz powerful antidepressants and sleeping pills in the month leading up to the disaster and that at least one had urged that he be hospitalized for a possible psychotic disorder but none of those physicians alerted the german aviation authorities or the airline about mr lubitz s condition or his treatment for fear of running afoul of germany s strict privacy laws investigators said such warnings might have prevented mr lubitz , 27 , from getting behind the controls of an airbus a320 and killing himself and 149 others as a result , the final report on the march 24 crash by s bureau of investigations and analyses strongly recommended that international health agencies and air safety regulators redefine the conditions that would oblige doctors to warn the authorities when an airline pilot s mental health posed a potential risk to public safety even without the patient s consent the report also called for much closer monitoring of pilots who have a history of mental health trouble of any sort , and urged european regulators to consider allowing some pilots to fly while taking certain antidepressant drugs under strict medical supervision that is already the case in some countries , including the united states the french report urged the german authorities to consider limiting the legal penalties for doctors who breach patient confidentiality in good faith and , in the case of airline pilots , to clearly define the types of health issues that can represent an imminent danger to the flying public while the french bureau does not have the legal authority to compel the changes recommended in its report , the airline industry and its regulators traditionally act on investigators' proposals after air crashes however , the germanwings report is the first time that an air accident investigator has issued recommendations to the global medical community investigators also recommended that airlines promote confidential peersupport programs for pilots with mental health problems and called on the industry to find ways to mitigate the economic consequences for pilots who fear losing their livelihoods if they reveal a mental illness prosecutors in germany and in determined that mr lubitz had a history of depression dating back to august 2008 the 109page french report published sunday indicated that mr lubitz had suicidal ideation and had made several nosuicide pacts with his doctors at the time these coincided with his withdrawal from an elite flighttraining school operated by lufthansa , the parent company of germanwings , for nine months from january to october 2009 lufthansa has acknowledged that mr lubitz informed the company of his illness at the time , but said that the airline was unaware of its severity he was eventually reinstated with the approval of lufthansa flight doctors and subsequently hired as a pilot for germanwings in 2013 the french report indicates that mr lubitz s psychological problems resurfaced in late 2014 , when he began complaining of vision problems , for which no medical cause could be found , and sleep disorders toxicological examination of mr lubitz s remains found traces of the antidepressants mirtazapine and citalopram as well as zopiclone , an insomnia treatment , the report said it indicated that on march 10 , two weeks before the crash , an unidentified private physician referred mr lubitz for inpatient treatment at a psychiatric hospital none of these health care providers reported any aeromedical concerns to authorities , the report said it is likely that breaching medical confidentiality was perceived by these doctors as presenting more risks , in particular for themselves , than not reporting the copilot to authorities r mi jouty , the director of the bureau of investigations , expressed hope that the findings would lead to a broader discussion among medical and aviation regulators worldwide about the need to find the proper balance between privacy and public safety mr jouty acknowledged that attitudes about individual privacy varied widely among cultures , making it difficult to prescribe solutions that could be accepted universally while countries like germany have strict patient privacy laws that doctors can be prosecuted for violating , others , including canada , israel and norway , require doctors to alert regulators about a pilot who may pose a safety risk , he said mr jouty said he was optimistic that the bureau s report would lead to concrete changes the fact that our recommendations are public means that the addressees can be questioned about what they are doing in response , he said it places pressure on them to act the french bureau s investigation was limited to determining the facts of the case and to making recommendations to safety regulators to reduce the risk of similar episodes a separate by a panel of three french judges , which aims to apportion legal responsibility for the crash , is continuing the french criminal investigation is seeking to establish whether the airline , regulators or any specific individuals may be charged with involuntary homicide in the case such inquiries , similar to a grand jury investigation in the united states , often take several years any potential criminal case against lufthansa would hinge on whether the investigating judges can prove that the group was negligent in its oversight of mr lubitz lawyers representing the families of some of the crash victims say they are convinced that lufthansa shares responsibility for the disaster because it allowed mr lubitz to resume his flight training and ultimately hired him , despite knowledge of his extended treatment for depression victims' families from a halfdozen countries plan to file a civil suit this month against a near phoenix , where mr lubitz completed several months of training after he had informed the company of his illness after the crash , european safety regulators made a separate list of recommendations last year aimed at strengthening the medical and psychological oversight of pilots several of those recommendations are expected to be put into effect this year and include requirements for more rigorous and frequent psychological screening of pilots throughout their careers as well as confidential peersupport programs for pilots pilots' unions continue to resist a proposal that would oblige pilots across the 28member european union to submit to random tests for alcohol and certain controlled substances , as in countries like the united states and australia steps have also been taken to enhance cockpit security , with a mandate that two crew members be in the cockpit at all times during flight the twoperson rule , which became standard in the united states and other parts of the world after the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , was not widely adopted in europe before the germanwings crash
justice antonin scalia , whose transformative legal theories , vivid writing and outsize personality made him a leader of a conservative intellectual renaissance in his three decades on the supreme court , was found dead on saturday at a resort in west texas he was 79 he was an extraordinary individual and jurist , admired and treasured by his colleagues , chief justice john g roberts jr said in a statement confirming justice scalia s death his passing is a great loss to the court and the country he so loyally served the cause of death was not immediately released a spokeswoman for the united states marshals service , which sent personnel to the scene , said there was nothing to indicate the death was the result of anything other than natural causes justice scalia began his service on the court as an outsider known for caustic dissents that alienated even potential allies but his theories , initially viewed as idiosyncratic , gradually took hold , and not only on the right and not only in the courts he was , judge richard a posner in 2011 , the most influential justice of the last quartercentury justice scalia was a champion of originalism , the theory of constitutional interpretation that seeks to apply the understanding of those who drafted and ratified the constitution in justice scalia s hands , originalism generally led to outcomes that pleased political conservatives , but not always his approach was helpful to criminal defendants in cases involving sentencing and the crossexamination of witnesses justice scalia also disdained the use of legislative history statements from members of congress about the meaning and purposes of laws in the judicial interpretation of statutes he railed against vague laws that did not give potential defendants fair warning of what conduct was criminal he preferred brightline rules to legal balancing tests , and he was sharply critical of supreme court opinions that did not provide lower courts and litigants with clear guidance all of these views took shape in dissents over time , they came to influence and in many cases dominate the debate at the supreme court , in lower courts , among lawyers and in the legal academy by the time he wrote his most important majority opinion , finding that the second amendment protects an individual right to bear arms , even the dissenters were engaged in trying to determine the original meaning of the constitution , the approach he had championed that 2008 decision , district of columbia v heller , also illustrated a second point justice scalia in his later years was willing to bend a little to attract votes from his colleagues in heller , the price of commanding a majority appeared to be including a passage limiting the practical impact of the decision with the retirement of justice john paul stevens in 2010 , justice scalia became the longestserving member of the current court by then , justice scalia was routinely writing for the majority in the major cases , including ones on the first amendment , class actions and arbitration he was an exceptional stylist who labored over his opinions and took pleasure in finding precisely the right word or phrase in dissent , he took no prisoners the author of a majority opinion could be confident that a scalia dissent would not overlook any shortcomings justice scalia wrote for a broader audience than most of his colleagues did his opinions were read by lawyers and civilians for pleasure and instruction at oral argument , justice scalia took professorial delight in sparring with the advocates before him he seemed to play to the crowd in the courtroom , which rewarded his jokes with generous laughter justice scalia s sometimes withering questioning helped transform what had been a sleepy bench when he arrived into one that chief justice roberts has said has become too active , with the justices interrupting the lawyers and each other some of justice scalia s recent comments from the bench were raw and provocative in an affirmative action case in december , he said that some minority students may be better off at a less advanced school , a slowertrack school where they do well i do n't think it stands to reason that it s a good thing for the university of texas to admit as many blacks as possible , he said , describing some said distorting an argument in a supporting brief about the harm that can be caused to students with inferior academic credentials by admitting them to colleges where they do not thrive justice scalia was a man of varied tastes , with a fondness for poker , opera and hunting his friends called him nino , and they said he enjoyed nothing more than a good joke at his own expense he seldom agreed with justice ruth bader ginsburg on the important questions that reached the court , but the two for years celebrated new year s eve together not long after justice elena kagan , another liberal , joined the court , justice scalia took her skeet shooting antonin gregory scalia was born on march 11 , 1936 , in trenton , to salvatore scalia and the former catherine panaro he was their only child and was showered with attention from his parents and their siblings , none of whom had children of their own justice scalia and his wife , the former maureen mccarthy , had nine children , the upshot of what he called vatican roulette we were both devout catholics , justice scalia told joan biskupic for her 2009 biography , american original and being a devout catholic means you have children when god gives them to you , and you raise them he said his large family influenced his legal philosophy parents know that children will accept quite readily all sorts of arbitrary substantive dispositions no television in the afternoon , or no television in the evening , or even no television at all , he said at a harvard lecture in 1989 but try to let one brother or sister watch television when the others do not , and you will feel the fury of the fundamental sense of justice unleashed young antonin was an exceptional student , graduating as valedictorian from xavier high school in lower manhattan , first in his class at georgetown and magna cum laude at harvard law school he practiced law for six years in cleveland before accepting a position teaching law at the university of virginia in 1967 four years later , he entered government service , first as general counsel of the office of telecommunications policy and then as chairman of the administrative conference of the united states , an executive branch agency that advises federal regulators both positions drew on and expanded his expertise in administrative law , a topic that would interest him throughout his career in 1974 , president richard m nixon nominated him to be assistant attorney general in charge of the office of legal counsel , an elite unit of the justice department that advises the executive branch on the law he was confirmed by the senate on aug 22 , 1974 , not long after nixon resigned in 1977 , mr scalia returned to the legal academy , now joining the law faculty at the university of chicago he also served as editor of regulation magazine , published by the american enterprise institute after ronald reagan was elected president in 1980 , mr scalia was interviewed for a job he coveted , solicitor general of the united states , the lawyer who represents the federal government in the supreme court he lost out to rex e lee , and it stung i was bitterly disappointed , justice scalia told ms biskupic i never forgot it he was offered a seat on the federal appeals court in chicago but he turned it down in the hope of being nominated instead to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit , whose docket , location and prestige appealed to him the court was also widely viewed as a steppingstone to the supreme court the first opening on the dc circuit in the reagan years went to another prominent conservative law professor , robert h bork but the second one , in 1982 , went to mr scalia he served for four years , issuing opinions favoring executive power , skeptical of claims of employment discrimination and hostile to the press the opinions , which were forceful and sometimes funny , attracted the attention of the white house he appeared to enjoy intellectual giveandtake from the bench , with his colleagues and in his chambers on the appeals court and in his early years on the supreme court , he would hire one liberal law clerk each year to keep discussions lively he made it a point of telling me that i was his token liberal , said e joshua rosenkranz , who served as a law clerk for judge scalia in 1986 , his last year on the appeals court to his credit , i'm sure it was largely because he wanted to be sure he always heard the arguments against the positions he was taking in 1986 , after chief justice warren burger announced his intention to retire , mr reagan nominated judge scalia to the supreme court though his conservative views were well known , he was confirmed by the senate by a vote of 98 to 0 he may have benefited from the fact that the liberal opposition was focused on the nomination of justice william h rehnquist , who was already on the court , to succeed chief justice burger judge scalia seemed to enjoy parrying with the senators at his confirmation hearing when senator howard m metzenbaum , democrat of ohio , recalled losing to judge scalia in a tennis match , he responded that it was a case of my integrity overcoming my judgment the lopsided vote for justice scalia also reflected a different era , one in which presidents were thought to have wide latitude in naming judges that era seemed to come to an end in 1987 , with the defeat of the nomination of justice scalia s former colleague on the dc circuit , judge bork in 1993 , at the confirmation hearing for justice ginsburg , senator joseph r biden jr , who was then chairman of the senate judiciary committee , said that the vote that i most regret of all 15 , 000 votes i have cast as a senator was to confirm judge scalia because he was so effective three days before the court handed the presidency to george w bush in december 2000 , in bush v gore , the court shut down the recount of votes in florida in an unsigned opinion over the dissents of the four more liberal justices justice scalia felt compelled to respond in a concurrence the counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to mr bush and to the country , by casting a cloud upon what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election , justice scalia wrote he would later say privately that his brief concurrence doomed his chances of being named chief justice he was often asked about the bush v gore decision at public appearances his stock response get over it the centerpiece of justice scalia s judicial philosophy was his commitment to the doctrine of originalism , which sought to interpret the constitution as it was understood at the time of its adoption that made him uncomfortable with some of the supreme court s most important precedents we have now determined , he said in remarks in philadelphia in 2004 , that liberties exist under the federal constitution the right to abortion , the right to homosexual sodomy which were so little rooted in the traditions of the american people that they were criminal for 200 years he added that his colleagues may soon discover a right to assisted suicide between the lines of the text of the constitution we 're not ready to announce that right , he said , more than a little sarcastically check back with us justice scalia said that some of the court s leading decisions could not be justified under the original understanding of the constitution the court was wrong in gideon v wainwright in 1963 , justice scalia said , to require the government to provide lawyers to poor people accused of serious crimes it was wrong in new york times v sullivan in 1964 , he said , to say the first amendment requires libel plaintiffs to meet heightened standards justice scalia also appeared to have reservations about brown v board of education , which struck down segregation in public schools as a violation of the 14th amendment s guarantee of equal protection brown , decided in 1954 , is widely considered the towering achievement of the court led by chief justice earl warren but for originalists , the brown decision is problematic the weight of the historical evidence is that the people who drafted , proposed and ratified the 14th amendment from 1866 to 1868 did not believe themselves to be doing away with segregated schools in remarks at the university of arizona in 2009 , justice scalia suggested that brown reached the right result as a matter of policy but was not required by the constitution he added that the decision did not refute his theory do n't make up your mind on this significant question between originalism and playing it by ear on the basis of whether , now and then , the latter approach might give you a result you like , justice scalia said hitler developed a wonderful automobile , he went on what does that prove \? i 'll stipulate that you can reach some results you like with the other system but that s not the test the test is over the long run does it require the society to adhere to those principles contained in the constitution or does it lead to a society that is essentially governed by nine justices' version of what equal protection ought to mean \? in other settings , justice scalia took pains to say that he would not follow his theory wherever it would take him he was , he said , a fainthearted originalist i am a textualist , he said i am an originalist i am not a nut critics seized on the concession , saying it undid the very qualities that made originalism appealing as a historically grounded theory that constrained judges otherwise apt to follow their policy preferences if following a theory consistently would make you a nut , is n't that a problem with the theory \? david a strauss asked in his 2010 book , the living constitution there was certainly a more committed originalist on the court , justice clarence thomas unlike justice thomas , justice scalia , especially in his later years , was willing to compromise at the expense of theoretical purity a 2010 decision , mcdonald v chicago , illustrates the point the question in the case was whether the second amendment applied not only to federal gun control laws , a point the court established in 2008 , but also to state and local laws the answer was not much in doubt , as the fivejustice majority in the 2008 case , district of columbia v heller , was still on the court what was in doubt was how the court would use the 14th amendment to apply or incorporate , in the legal jargon the second amendment to the states other provisions in the bill of rights had been applied by means of the 14th amendment s due process clause but many judges and scholars , including justice scalia , had never found that methodology intellectually satisfactory due process after all , would seem to protect only procedures and not substance the very name given to the methodology substantive due process sounds like an oxymoron originalists hoped the court would use the mcdonald case to repudiate substantive due process and instead rely on another provision of the 14th amendment , one that says no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states there is evidence that the authors of the clause specifically wanted it to apply to allowing freed slaves to have guns to defend themselves justice scalia would have none of it what you argue , he told a lawyer challenging a chicago gun law , is the darling of the professoriate , for sure , but it s also contrary to 140 years of our jurisprudence he told the lawyer to focus on winning his case rather than pressing a new constitutional theory why do you want to undertake that burden , justice scalia asked , instead of just arguing substantive due process , which as much as i think it s wrong , even i have acquiesced in it \? the decision was 5 to 4 the justices in the majority agreed about the result but not how to get there justice scalia accepted the substantive due process rationale , with misgivings justice thomas , in a separate opinion , relied on the privilegesorimmunities rationale that had been pressed by originalists still , justice scalia s fidelity to originalism frequently caused him to take legal positions almost certainly at odds with his policy preferences he voted in 1989 to strike down a law making it a crime to burn an american flag he said his fidelity to the constitution overrode his sympathies i do n't like scruffy , bearded , sandalwearing people who go around burning the united states flag , he said in 2000 justice scalia also helped transform aspects of the criminal law , often in ways that helped people accused of crimes here , too , his understanding of the sixth amendment , which sets out defendants' rights in criminal prosecutions , may have been in tension with his policy preferences the sixth amendment is a meaningful presence in american courtrooms today in large part because of justice scalia , said jeffrey l fisher , a law professor at stanford he followed his understanding of the original intent of the sixth amendment , even when it made prosecutions harder and less efficient he said it was necessary to keep the people free the right to trial by an impartial jury , justice scalia said , means that juries must find beyond reasonable doubt all facts that give rise to punishment he made the point in a 1998 dissent , and it ripened into the majority view in apprendi v new jersey in 2000 , which struck down a new jersey hate crime law in 2004 , justice scalia relied on the apprendi decision in writing the majority opinion in blakely v washington , which struck down the sentencing system of washington state for giving judges too large a role he later voted with the majority to strike down the federal sentencing system on the same grounds it s not because i'm in love with the jury necessarily , justice scalia told ms biskupic it s because i'm in love with the constitution justice scalia also reinvigorated the clause of the sixth amendment that guarantees a criminal defendant the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him here , too , he first expressed his views in dissent later , in a 2004 decision , crawford v washington , he wrote for the majority that defendants have the right to live testimony at trial from the witnesses against them , even if the accusations could be presented in other forms dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with a jury trial because the defendant is obviously guilty , justice scalia wrote that is not what the sixth amendment prescribes writing for the majority in a 2009 decision that barred the introduction at trial of crime lab reports without testimony from the analysts involved in their preparation , justice scalia said the issue was one of constitutional principle the confrontation clause may make the prosecution of criminals more burdensome , but that is equally true of the right to trial by jury and the privilege against selfincrimination , he wrote the confrontation clause like those other constitutional provisions is binding , and we may not disregard it at our convenience justice scalia s opinions were also helpful to criminal defendants charged under vague laws in 2009 , he objected to the court s decision not to hear an appeal concerning a federal law that made it a crime to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services the law was so vague , he wrote , that it would seemingly cover a salaried employee s phoning in sick to go to a ballgame the supreme court soon agreed to hear three separate cases on the law and substantially cut back its scope when justice scalia joined the court , congressional committee reports and similar legislative history were routinely used as aids in determining the meanings of federal statutes in a campaign that he maintained throughout his tenure on the court , justice scalia insisted that such use of legislative history was illegitimate reports and floor statements were not the law , he said the words of the law itself were the law the campaign was largely successful advocates and other justices rely on legislative history sparingly these days justice scalia was also dismissive of unhelpful supreme court opinions concurring in a 2010 privacy decision that gave lower courts only vague guidance , he wrote the court s implication that where electronic privacy is concerned we should decide less than we otherwise would \( that is , less than the principle of law necessary to resolve the case and guide private action \) or that we should hedge our bets by concocting casespecific standards or issuing opaque opinions is in my view indefensible thetimestheyareachangin' is a feeble excuse for disregard of duty his colleagues did not always welcome his writing style , which could verge on the insulting dissenting in a 2002 decision prohibiting the execution of the mentally retarded , he wrote , seldom has an opinion of this court rested so obviously upon nothing but the personal views of its members an argument made by justice sandra day o'connor , he wrote in a 1989 abortion case , cannot be taken seriously in a 2011 dissent , justice scalia called justice sonia sotomayor s account of the facts of a case in her majority opinion so transparently false that professing to believe it demeans this institution dissenting in june from the court s decision establishing a right to samesex marriage , justice scalia mocked the soaring language of justice anthony m kennedy s majority opinion , saying it was couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic he was not shy about making dire predictions about a 2008 decision giving people held at guant namo bay the right to challenge their detentions it will almost certainly cause more americans to be killed about a 2011 decision ordering california to ease prison overcrowding it affirmed the most radical injunction issued by a court in our nation s history and was itself a judicial travesty citing long judicial tradition , justice scalia occasionally spoke about his desire to stay out of the public eye it is not clear that he meant it , and he was certainly not always successful in 2004 , for instance , he went on a duckhunting trip with dick cheney , who was then vice president and a litigant in a case before the court over whether mr cheney would have to reveal who had appeared before his energy task force when the trip came to light , justice scalia issued a 21page defense of the trip and refused to disqualify himself from the case while the political branches can perhaps survive the constant baseless allegations of impropriety that have become the staple of washington reportage , this court cannot , he wrote the people must have confidence in the integrity of the justices , and that cannot exist in a system that assumes them to be corruptible by the slightest friendship or favor , and in an atmosphere where the press will be eager to find footfaults justice scalia later joined the sevenjustice majority in declining to force mr cheney to disclose secret documents from an energy task force he did step aside from a case concerning the pledge of allegiance in 2003 after saying in public that the federal appeals court in san francisco had decided the case incorrectly a gregarious man , justice scalia accepted many speaking and teaching engagements from both conservative and liberal groups he was occasionally criticized for his choices in 2007 , for instance , justice scalia spoke on international law at a dinner in palm springs , calif , organized by charles g koch , a conservative activist justice scalia s expenses , a court spokeswoman said , were paid for by the federalist society , a conservative legal group in 2011 , he spoke at a forum organized by the congressional tea party caucus at the invitation of representative michele bachmann , republican of minnesota the session was attended by members of both parties justice scalia s subject was the separation of powers justice scalia did not make it easy for journalists to cover his public appearances and generally did not allow them to be broadcast for years , he did not allow his remarks to be taped even by print reporters seeking to ensure the accuracy of their notes he changed that policy in 2004 after a federal marshal ordered two reporters to erase recordings of his remarks at a high school in hattiesburg , miss justice scalia apologized to the reporters , saying the marshal had not been following his instructions i abhor as much as any american the prospect of a law enforcement officer s seizing a reporter s notes or recording , he wrote to one of the reporters , antoinette konz of the hattiesburg american in 2006 , justice scalia responded to a reporter s question after attending a red mass at the cathedral of the holy cross in boston with a chin flick that some interpreted to be an obscene gesture the reporter had wanted to know whether justice scalia had taken a lot of flak for publicly celebrating his religious beliefs in a letter to the boston herald , justice scalia explained that the gesture was sicilian in origin and meant only , i could n't care less it s no business of yours count me out he often made clear that he had little use for facultylounge orthodoxies in 2003 , for instance , dissenting from a decision striking down a texas law that made gay sex a crime , justice scalia bemoaned the influence of elite culture on the law today s opinion , he wrote , is the product of a court , which is the product of a lawprofession culture , that has largely signed on to the socalled homosexual agenda , by which i mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct he predicted , too , that the decision , lawrence v texas , had laid the foundation for the recognition of a constitutional right to samesex marriage justice scalia insisted that his religious beliefs played no role in his jurisprudence , and he was deeply offended by contrary suggestions in 2007 , geoffrey r stone , a law professor at the university of chicago , where he was a colleague of justice scalia , made what he called a painfully awkward observation in the chicago tribune after the supreme court upheld the federal partialbirth abortion ban act in gonzales v carhart all five justices in the majority in gonzales are roman catholic , professor stone wrote the four justices who are not all followed clear and settled precedent justice scalia was furious , telling ms biskupic that it got me so mad that i will not appear at the university of chicago until he is no longer on the faculty withdrawing from a debate was not typical of justice scalia , who usually welcomed discussion with enthusiasm and confidence standing up for one s opinions , he said in a 2010 opinion , is a mark of laudable civil courage indeed , justice scalia s appetite for the sort of discussion and debate he enjoyed as a law professor was not sated by the brisk conferences the justices held after oral arguments under chief justice rehnquist and to a lesser extent under chief justice roberts , they can consist of little more than a tally of votes i do n't like that , '' justice scalia said after a speech at george washington university in 1988 maybe it s just because i'm new maybe it s because i'm an exacademic maybe it s because i'm right in a cspan interview in 2009 , justice scalia reflected on his role and legacy , sketching out a modest conception of the role of a supreme court justice we do n't sit here to make the law , to decide who ought to win , justice scalia said we decide who wins under the law that the people have adopted and very often , if you 're a good judge , you do n't really like the result you 're reaching
palm beach , fla sought to move past the primary fight and toward the republican nomination on friday , saying that there had been enough debates and that the party needed to come together behind him but as he cast his eye forward , he raised fresh questions about his porous understanding of intricate policy matters that all presidents face at a morning news conference at his maralago complex in florida , mr trump collected the endorsement of , his former rival , and said that republicans must begin to unite to reclaim the white house in the fall we 've had enough debates , mr trump said how many times do you have to give the same answer to the same question \? but those looking to halt mr trump s march toward the nomination had other ideas a top aide to senator of florida , who is fighting for his political life in the primary there on tuesday , urged voters to back the candidate best positioned to stop mr trump , even if it meant that rubio supporters in certain states should vote for a rival candidate to prevent a trump victory there the republican contests on tuesday are seen as potentially climactic a loss by mr rubio in florida or gov of ohio in his home state would probably force either man to exit the race a trump victory in one of those states would dramatically accelerate his march toward the nomination , and a victory in both could all but end the primary race , even as senator of texas battles on at mr trump s news conference making the case for the party to unite behind him , he said he would win states in a general election that would otherwise be unthinkable for the he allowed that there might be two donald trumps , suggesting that there was a private , more palatable version that did not align with the showier public version , before he reversed the statement a few minutes later he defended violence against some of the protesters at his increasingly tense rallies , suggesting that they have often instigated the problemson friday night , clashes among protesters and trump fans at his rally at the university of illinois at chicago grew so intense that the campaign canceled the event out of security concerns the televised scenes of people scuffling inside the arena were the most vivid images yet of the way mr trump has polarized the campaign at a debate the night before , the new york businessman sought to appear more presidential than he had been in other recent debates he was pressed at length on details of his foreign policy views , exposing surprising and , to some , alarming positions on issues such as how to handle the quagmire in the middle east military experts raised eyebrows at his statement that he would consider deploying 20 , 000 to 30 , 000 american ground troops in syria and iraq those experts said it did not reflect any current thinking among military experts , even by the most hawkish analysts i know of no activeduty or recently retired military officers who fought in iraq or syria who would say this was a good idea , said mark p hertling , a retired threestar general who commanded 30 , 000 american troops in northern iraq i'm not sure where any of those numbers are coming from none of them are based on what we call trooptotask analysis general hertling said the united states might have to deploy additional resources to iraq when the iraqi military prepared to retake the country s secondlargest city , mosul , from the islamic state but under the plans being prepared by the pentagon , that would consist of advisers to help collect and analyze intelligence or to pilot drones , not ground troops we ca n't put ground forces in to fight this , he said , or we 're going to get bogged down mr trump has repeatedly failed to make good on promises to release a list of foreign policy advisers , and his spokeswoman , hope hicks , did not respond to an email about how he had arrived at the troops estimate looking to defeat mr trump , a top aide to mr rubio said that the best way to do so on march 15 , when voters in a number of midwest states as well as florida and north carolina will head to the polls , was for the senator s supporters in ohio to vote for mr kasich in the primary i'm just stating the obvious , said alex conant , a spokesman for mr rubio if you are a republican primary voter in ohio and you want to defeat donald trump , your best chance in ohio is john kasich , because john kasich is the sitting governor he s very close to donald trump in some of the polls there the remarks dovetail with a strategy proposed by mitt romney , the party s 2012 nominee , who urged republicans opposing mr trump to coalesce around the leading nontrump candidate in coming nominating contests to deny him the nomination mr rubio and mr cruz have been the most vocal about stopping mr trump but mr rubio s rivals were not on board with the idea speaking in orlando on friday , mr cruz dismissed the rubio campaign s gambit mr kasich also was not thrilled with the suggestion , saying that his supporters should vote for him if he s on the ballot what kind of a deal would it be if i told my people , do n't vote for me \? ' he told reporters in moraine , ohio , on friday evening highlighting the stakes , mr trump began airing new ads in florida and ohio , one of which attacked mr rubio as corrupt and another of which flayed mr kasich for his ties to wall street because of his work for lehman brothers in miami beach , dozens of leading donors to the republican national committee gathered on friday morning at the ritzcarlton in south beach to hear about the party s progress on data collection and voter outreach at one session , two committee officials , including the party s chief counsel , john phillippe , also delivered a briefing on the delegate math in the nominating fight and the mechanics of a contested convention the briefing drew so many questions that reince priebus , the party chairman , reconvened the session again after lunch asked by one donor how close the nomination was to being decided , republican national committee officials indicated that any candidate , including mr trump , would need more than half the remaining delegates to win the nomination outright at the july convention some donors concluded from the presentation that mr trump , for all his dominance so far , could still be beaten mr trump s campaign also announced a team of four advisers , three of whom worked for mr carson s campaign , to track and maintain commitments from delegates leading up to the mr trump s previous lack of such staff had been of deep concern to some of his allies , given the potential ability of rival campaigns to pick off delegates
storrs , conn spent a couple of hours at the s practice center on sunday overseeing drills , teaching halfcourt sets , encouraging players and pointing out mistakes he was in his element at one point during a scrimmage , he noticed a defensive error switch those ! auriemma screamed switch those screens throughout his tenure of nearly 31 years as uconn s women s basketball coach , auriemma has probably said those words thousands of times but instead of yelling at the huskies , he was making sure the usa basketball women s national team was on top of its game sixteen of the best female players in the united states had convened at uconn for a final , threeday training camp before the rio de janeiro olympics in august usa basketball is considering 25 players for the 12person roster , including 10 who were members of the 2012 olympic gold medal team for auriemma and uconn forward breanna stewart , the timing of the camp was not perfect the topranked huskies \( 260 \) have three regularseason games remaining and are aiming to win a fourth consecutive ncaa tournament championship , which would give them sole possession of a division i record on saturday evening , uconn defeated east carolina , 8441 , on the road for its 63rd consecutive victory auriemma arrived home shortly after 1 am sunday , while stewart did not arrive on campus until around 2 am less than nine hours later , she was on the court competing for a chance at her first olympic appearance it was n't terrible , but not the most ideal thing , said stewart , the youngest player on the 2014 fiba world championship united states squad i have all day to recover and get ready for tomorrow auriemma , who has coached the women s national team since 2009 and has never lost a game in international competition , scheduled practices with his uconn team on monday and tuesday after the usa basketball practices stewart , the only college player among the final 25 olympic hopefuls , said she would practice with usa basketball but would most likely sit out the uconn practices the huskies did not practice on sunday with the ncaa tournament starting next month and wnba training camps opening in april , auriemma said this was the best time to get enough players together before the olympics because several were on break from their professional teams overseas and uconn would not play again until wednesday auriemma said he had no trouble juggling his uconn and usa basketball duties it s not like during the season i'm torn or i'm distracted , auriemma said it s been really good for me , because for five months , i 've got uconn , and then during the summer , i 've got usa basketball coaching the national team also provides auriemma with an opportunity to reunite with former huskies the former uconn stars sue bird , stefanie dolson , maya moore and diana taurasi are competing in this week s training camp the former uconn forward tina charles , a member of the 2012 olympic team , could not participate because she was playing in china , but she is likely to be on this year s olympic team uconn s practice center , which opened in 2014 , is a monument to the huskies' dominance over the past two decades the walls feature banners from uconn s 10 national championships \( all of which have come since 1995 \) , eight national players of the year \( including bird , taurasi , charles , moore and stewart \) , 10 other firstteam allamericans \( including dolson \) and eight players \( including bird , taurasi , charles and moore \) who have won olympic gold medals stewart and the five former huskies still in contention for the olympic roster each played on undefeated national collegiate championship teams asked if they liked to give each other a hard time about which team was the best in program history , taurasi said the players respected one another but she added that none of the teams had topped the squad that went 314 and won the national title in 2004 , her senior season there s really no argument , she said , laughing we do n't really talk about it we can talk about second taurasi and bird , teammates on the unbeaten 2002 national championship squad , said they enjoyed being back on campus and seeing each other for the first time since last summer the two have played on the last three olympic teams and are good friends whether it s deaths in the families or winning championships and then , of course , heartbreaking losses as well we 've experienced it together , bird said when it s all said and done , the majority of my fond basketball memories will involve her , absolutely since the formation of the usa basketball women s national team in 1995 , the united states has won five consecutive olympic gold medals and 86 of 87 games in olympic and fiba competitions its only loss was to russia , 7568 , in the 2006 fiba world championship semifinals the united states will be heavily favored to win another gold medal this summer first , though , auriemma is concerned with winning his 11th ncaa tournament , which would break the record set by the former ucla men s coach john wooden for the most national titles for a division i coach uconn is leading division i this season in scoring offense \( 886 points per game \) and defense \( 483 points per game \) and has victories over four of the top six teams in the country \( notre dame , south carolina , ohio state and maryland \) , each of them by at least 10 points on sunday , auriemma took a brief break from the allconsuming march for the record it was a welcome respite getting together with these guys , it s never difficult , he said it s never a chore it s always fun to look forward to it s fun to watch them play , let s put it that way
hiroshima , japan laid a wreath at the hiroshima peace memorial on friday , telling an audience that included survivors of that technology as devastating as nuclear arms demands a moral revolution thousands of japanese lined the route of the presidential motorcade to the memorial in the hopes of glimpsing mr obama , the first sitting american president to visit the most potent symbol of the dawning of the nuclear age many watched the ceremony on their cellphones seventyone years ago , on a bright cloudless morning , death fell from the sky and the world was changed , mr obama said in opening his speech at the memorial technological progress without an equivalent progress in human institutions can doom us , , adding that such technology requires a moral revolution as well in an emotional moment afterward , mr obama embraced and shook hands with survivors of the attack , which exposed humanity to risks the president has repeatedly said the world must do far more to resolve the first of those survivors , sunao tsuboi , a chairman of the hiroshima branch of the , gripped mr obama s hand and did not let go until he had spoken to him for some time i held his hand , and we did n't need an interpreter , mr tsuboi , 91 , said later i could understand what he wanted to say by his expression in another poignant moment , mr obama with shigeaki mori , 79 , who was 8 years old when the bomb fell mr mori spent decades researching the fates of american prisoners of war who were killed in the bombing for weeks , the white house had refused to say whether mr obama , would meet survivors many survivors long for an apology for an event that destroyed just about everyone and everything they knew , and there were small demonstrations near the ceremony on friday by protesters demanding an apology but mr obama said before his trip that he would not apologize for the attack still , mr obama s homage to the victims and his speech were welcomed by many japanese i am simply grateful for his visit , said tomoko miyoshi , 50 , who lost 10 relatives in the hiroshima attack and wept as she watched mr obama on her cellphone in his speech , mr obama , using the slow and deliberate cadence that he uses on only the most formal and consequential occasions , said that the bombing of hiroshima demonstrated that mankind possessed the means to destroy itself but he said that in the 71 years since the bombing , world institutions had grown up to help prevent a recurrence still , nations like the united states continue to possess thousands of and that is something that must change , he said in a striking example of the gap between mr obama s vision of a nuclear weaponsfree world and the realities of purging them , a new of the american nuclear arsenal shows his administration has reduced the stockpile less than any other postcold war presidency we must have the courage to escape the logic of fear and pursue a world without them , he said , although he quickly added we may not realize this goal in my lifetime , but persistent effort can roll back the possibility of catastrophe still , he said , more was needed noting that far more primitive weapons than nuclear arms are causing widespread destruction today , mr obama called for humanity to change its mindset about war the world was forever changed here , but today the children of this city will go through their day in peace , mr obama said what a precious thing that is it is worth protecting , and then extending to every child that is a future we can choose , a future in which hiroshima and nagasaki are known not as the dawn of atomic warfare but as the start of our own moral awakening people in asian countries that were brutalized by imperial had warned that a presidential apology at hiroshima would be inappropriate mr obama not only did not apologize , he made clear that japan , despite a highly advanced culture , was to blame for the war , which grew out of the same base instinct for domination or conquest that had caused conflicts among the simplest tribes in his speech , the japanese prime minister , , said , this tragedy must not be allowed to occur again we are determined to realize a world free of nuclear weapons , he said american veterans groups had a mostly muted response , neither criticizing nor endorsing mr obama s visit and remarks joe davis , a spokesman in washington for the , the oldest veterans organization in the united states , issued a brief statement saying a world without conflict is a vision we should all share mr obama s visit to hiroshima peace memorial park had all the pomp , ceremony and planned choreography of a state visit or a leader s funeral with thousands in attendance and much of japan watching on tv , mr obama walked forward alone at the park and laid a wreath on a white pyramid he paused before the memorial s cenotaph , his head bowed a moment later , mr abe approached with his own wreath , which he laid beside mr obama s on another pyramid after a moment s reflection , the two leaders shook hands a clear signal of the extraordinary alliance their two nations had forged out of the ashes of war mr obama s decision to visit hiroshima was in part intended to reward mr abe for his efforts to improve ties and forge a closer military relationship between the two countries the recent of a young woman on okinawa , and the arrest of an american marine veteran in the crime , has once again strained those ties , but coordination between the two nations' militaries continues to intensify mr obama also saw the visit as a testament to mankind s ability to forge beyond even the most intense of enmities before arriving in japan , mr obama visited vietnam ,  the hiroshima visit , under consideration since the first days of mr obama s presidency , could send ripples across asia , a region still grappling with the echoes of seven decades after it ended leaders in both china and south korea worry that mr obama s visit to japan s deepest wound could be taken by the japanese as an endpoint to their country s fitful efforts to come to grips with their own wartime atrocities but with a reclusive regime in north korea furiously and trying to perfect the missiles to deliver them , mr obama decided that reminding the world why the north koreans must be stopped was worth any hurt feelings among other countries many historians believe the bombings on hiroshima and , which together took the lives of more than 200 , 000 people , saved lives on balance , since an invasion of the islands would have led to far greater bloodshed but the 30acre peace memorial park that mr obama visited reflects none of that background the park offers a victim s narrative , illustrating in gutwrenching detail how more than 100 , 000 people in the city perished and thousands more were injured it provides few of the historical reasons for the bombing , such as descriptions of the attack on pearl harbor , the savagery of japan s occupation of china , or the extraordinary death toll of soldiers and civilians in the invasion of okinawa a short inscription on the park s memorial arch reads , in part , we shall not repeat the evil which evil the bombing or the conflict itself and who is to blame are left unsaid such failures by the japanese to acknowledge their own role in the bombings has long bothered the chinese , koreans and others who suffered under the empire s rule and with mr abe as mr obama s host , those wounded feelings could fester mr abe has promoted a version of history that plays down japan s wartime transgressions , and he has moved to give the military limited powers to fight in foreign conflicts , in place since world war ii the chinese government suggested on friday that the wartime atrocities committed by japan on chinese soil , notably in the city of , deserved more attention than the bombing of hiroshima president park geunhye of south korea has not commented on mr obama s visit and is on a tour of several african countries
of the many ways in which is disrupting american politics , one of the most compelling is his disregard for the established rules of communicating with voters more than any other candidate , mr trump embodies the evolving norms of communication that are being enabled and encouraged by technology and the matrix of connectivity that defines modern life authenticity over authority , surprise over consistency , celebrity over experience his approach is jarring to a political establishment that has taken very different lessons from its experiences over decades of modern campaigning riskaverse above all , candidates and those who advise them have long prized message discipline , shied away from anything spontaneous and looked for opportunities to attack opponents who stray from talking points to those portions of the electorate fed up with politics as usual , mr trump s willingness to say just about anything and to improvise as he goes seems more refreshing and trustworthy than disqualifying politicians are by nature cautious and riskaverse , '' said mark mckinnon , a veteran political image maker who served in george w bush s white house they like to make people happy , so their reflex is to check off strategies and tactics that have worked in the past but this approach is n't working today , mr mckinnon said just as we like novel and movie plots that surprise us , so are we attracted to candidates who do the unconventional , he said hence the success of donald trump as a teenager growing up in the suburbs of washington , i ritually watched the sundaymorning political talk shows with my family we parsed and argued and jeered at the screen as national figures delivered careful , polltested talking points now the national conversation is shifting to a far more fragmented array of platforms where the rules and rewards are very different and that tend to reward the kinds of unpolished , unfiltered messaging that mr trump produces he is a candidate for the age of the homebrewed youtube channel , the reddit ask me anything , the snapchat story or the buzzfeed listicle like beyonc , who cuts out the marketers and drops songs and albums online with no warning , mr trump ignores political convention and instead uses nonstop media appearances and rampant tweeting to communicate almost directly with his audience that what he says is often dismissed by his many critics as unconstitutional , unpresidential , offensive and untrue only draws larger audiences and more attention by contrast , when was the last time any of mr trump s rivals did something truly fresh and bold \? faced with an attention magnet of a frontrunner , why have none of his rivals gone beyond the occasional zinger to try genuinely surprising things whether naming a popular running mate ahead of time or livetweeting a night spent on the streets among the homeless that some of them pledge to lift up through their policies \? to take mr mckinnon s point to its logical conclusion , it may be that many voters today are willing to reward being surprised by overlooking the content of those surprises there is clearly a risk in cutting out from a presidential campaign the role that the traditional media play in truthtesting the pronouncements of a candidate like mr trump , and it is possible that standard political techniques like negative television advertising could slow or derail his quest for the republican nomination but there is a very different set of values emerging from the fertile worlds of technology and new media those values are captured in on reddit among the supposed secrets you have to be unique or popular , do not limit the discussion or attempt to make topics offlimits , and be completely transparent whether or not you like a presidential candidate who discusses the size of his body parts , mr trump has exploited the patterns of a directtoconsumer relationship that so many in the worlds of business , the arts and civil society are scrambling to figure out a relationship , unmediated by gatekeepers , that rewards authenticity , rawness and surprise
melbourne , australia s compatriots at melbourne park chanted his name and waved canadian flags and handmade signs decorated with the country s symbol , the maple leaf if raonic won his thirdround match against viktor troicki , he decided , he would return the nationalistic show of support the australian open is tennis s largest snow globe , with foreign participants insulated from the world they left behind by several time zones in addition to the usual force field of focus that envelops players during the two weeks of a major tournament but on saturday morning in a cafe on the tournament grounds , a breaking news story penetrated raonic s bubble informed that there had been a school shooting in saskatchewan , a canadian province , raonic pulled out his smartphone and performed a quick google search that was how he found out that , a town with roughly onethird the population of margaret court arena when all 7 , 500 seats are occupied raonic , 25 , was shaken by the news but firm in his resolve to advance to the tournament s second week , for the fourth time in six appearances here after dispatching troicki , 62 , 63 , 64 , to set up a meeting with fourthranked stan wawrinka , the 13thseeded raonic eschewed the usual highlight rehash during his oncourt interview fighting back tears , he said there was a shooting in saskatchewan at a high school , so my thoughts go out to that community and the school and families and everyone affected we wish you the best , and today s victory was for that community and a quick recovery raonic was born in montenegro and immigrated to with his family at age 3 to seek refuge from a regional conflict he said in an interview later that he wanted to show solidarity with other grieving canadians stuff like this does n't happen much back home , he said i'm sure not just in that small community but throughout canada , it was a lot of people that were sort of heartbroken over it the tragedy provided the dose of perspective that has eluded raonic on occasion since he advanced to the 2011 tournament s fourth round as a 20yearold qualifier every year since , he has returned and confidently stated his intentions to win a major in the next 12 months , only to have his progress slowed by a succession of injuries to his right hip , right foot and lower back raonic reached a careerhigh no 4 in the association of tennis professionals rankings in may he marked the milestone by having surgery to repair a pinched nerve in his foot as soon as the foot healed , his back began bothering him raonic , who stands 6 feet 5 inches and weighs 216 pounds , perceived the injuries as obstacles randomly dropped in his path to test his will then a chiropractor helped him connect the neuromusculoskeletal dots raonic has a slight curvature in the spine , which he knew about he only recently discovered that he has a misaligned jaw for the past two months , he has worn a bite splint , removing it only to eat he wears it during matches , he said , so he does not grind his teeth it corrects the way your jaw aligns to alleviate small muscle tension from constantly clenching , said raonic , who identified only one drawback to wearing the bite splint while playing tennis i fiddle around with it too much , he said , adding i 've been told the real results you start to feel after six months it is something that has allowed me to really feel good , especially considering the back issues that i 've had raonic was introduced to tennis at a club near his family s home in thornhill , ontario he was 8 years old , and the sport quickly became his allconsuming passion i sort of stopped doing everything else , he said i used to ski i still play basketball a little bit i 'll play soccer but more in a safe environment , never on a fullgrass pitch did a childhood devoted to the repetitive movements in tennis contribute to the spate of injuries he has experienced in his 20s \? raonic does not doubt it knowing what i know now about physical preparation , he said , i 'd put a kid into gymnastics from a very young age , i 'd put a kid into swimming , just to develop all these stability muscles and body awareness and balance over time i guess i did n't do that , so i'm sort of playing a little bit of catchup raonic can win a 17stroke rally without displacing a hair on his head or uncork a 134mileperhour serve with the ease of someone decanting a bottle of wine he betrays few signs of the strains that would lead him to grind his teeth raonic did provide a hint of the turbulence behind his calm expression in his explanation of why he recently hired , to be his coach i have an inability after matches are over to sort of switch off and relax completely , raonic said i think he can bring that calm to me with the vast knowledge that he has , and he has great sort of sense of how to approach , how to talk to people , i think he can help me in those kind of different situations raonic s partnership with moya began auspiciously , with a victory over the 17time major winner roger federer in the final of a warmup tournament in brisbane raonic faced four break points , none of which were converted , in his first two matches in melbourne , both straightsets victories , against lucas pouille and tommy robredo troicki , who won a warmup event in sydney , broke raonic in the third set on the way to a 41 lead an unruffled raonic lost only seven points in the last five games five years ago , raonic became the first canadian in the open era to be seeded in the men s singles in a major will this be the year he finally breaks through for a title \? i feel like i'm finding answers , said raonic , who recognized that his compatriots back home were confronting deeply unsettling questions maybe to me today s match really sort of mattered heavily , and i would do everything i can to find a way to win , raonic said but at the end of the day , to be in that situation where there are people that will never go back to school again , that s just far bigger than whatever thing i could have done on court today
re , by paul krugman \( column , april 8 \) what does senator bernie sanders think he s doing \? he s trying to raise legitimate questions and have a meaningful , authentic debate centered on issues that deeply affect our country a vibrant civil society is foundational to the functioning of our democracy and the legitimacy of our elections as someone who cares deeply about electing democrats to public office , i understand the pragmatism of not weakening the eventual democratic nominee before the general election , but this should not come at the cost of forgoing opportunities to nurture an informed , engaged electorate mr krugman appears to be asking mr sanders to capitulate and not raise questions about hillary clinton s policy positions , past and present , simply because she s in the lead elizabeth a seaberry portland , ore paul krugman paints an accurate picture of bernie sanders his attitude and demeanor are boorish and petulant like a whining child , he keeps repeating the same tired old slogans but once you get behind the words and the passion , no concrete how to s are articulated , which is not surprising , as he has been an ineffective senator what significant policy change or law can he point to as his legacy after all those years in congress \? none i rest my case it is understood why the idealistic young flock to his message maybe if i were decades younger , i would , too however , the attraction for others is puzzling do n't they realize that the message does not translate into action \? please , no more missteps for hillary clinton she is our only hope against the scary and scarier donald trump and ted cruz sherrie matza san francisco i am a longtime admirer of paul krugman but in his denigration of bernie sanders he ignores the senator s enormous gift to the democratic party despite president obama s many strengths , america has grown ever more unequal under his presidency hillary clinton promised more of the same now even she has picked up on mr sanders s rhetoric there s a burning need to be addressed , and mr sanders s passion has given it a powerful , muchneeded voice ruth gallagher portland , ore i could n't agree more with paul krugman rather than speak out against the bernie bros and those on his staff who are insulting hillary clinton and her supporters , senator bernie sanders seems to have chosen the same route this is deeply disappointing in a candidate who has stood for integrity throughout his career in the senate in addition , his she started it rationale is what you would expect of donald trump , or your average 5yearold thankfully , mrs clinton did not respond in kind barbara cohn schlachet new york
miami the united states government has been paying to feed and shelter thousands of trying to migrate to the united states , in what critics consider another sign of the lopsided treatment provided to cubans under american law the obama administration has tried hard to deter the crush of migrants arriving from central america in recent years it has pressed to crack down on migrants passing through its territory , while women and children who managed to cross the american border have been held in detention facilities but american law gives cubans to live in the united states and apply for a green card , provided they make it here that has set off who have taken advantage of changes inside that make it easier to leave , and who are worried that the obama administration s improved relations with their government will soon erase their privileged status in january , the united states pledged 1 million to help provide temporary shelter , potable water , food , sanitation and hygiene kits to thousands of cubans who were stranded in while trying to make their way to the american border tens of thousands of cubans have been arriving each year to the southwestern united states border after making an arduous journey by land through eight nations but nicaragua put a stop to the exodus by refusing them passage in november , causing a bottleneck of about 8 , 000 cubans in and 3 , 000 in panama the costa rican government was forced to open 29 shelters in schools , fire stations and other locations around the country where the cubans are fed and sleep on mats on the floor some 2 , 000 cubans remain the united states contributed to the effort through the international organization for migration , eliciting criticism that it was helping cubans on their journey north at the same time it was blocking other migrants we expect this particular contribution to be a onetime contribution , and the final amount that will actually be provided to iom will depend upon needs on the ground , given that the number of vulnerable migrants in need of immediate humanitarian aid in costa rica fluctuates , the state department said in a statement the international organization for migration declined to discuss the donation , referring questions about it to the american government i do n't think that the ambassador wants to talk about exact amounts , said roeland de wilde , who heads the organization s mission in costa rica he wants to talk about the role , the impact and the fact there is support the state department said the donation was consistent with other american efforts to help vulnerable migrants throughout central america the united states has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in central america in aid programs for law enforcement and other areas , largely to stem the tide of migration it s a double standard for sure , said kevin appleby , the international migration policy director at the center for migration studies in new york we are not doing that for the central american children who are more vulnerable we are not paying for their shelters in mexico the american government , he noted , has paid mexico to step up deportations they are handling even more vulnerable populations by using tax dollars to interdict them , versus housing others , he said that s the inconsistency they are embarrassed about aracy matus s nchez , who runs a refuge for migrants in southern mexico , said that as far as she knew , none of the shelters in mexico received american funding it seems a little strange , she said here in mexico , support has not been seen in any way i suppose it makes sense they would receive the cubans with open arms , because they are more educated david north , a fellow at the center for immigration studies , said any debate that arises over the donation boils down to questions about the cuban adjustment act , the 1966 law that gives cubans the right to enter the united states , even if they paid illegal smugglers to make the journey the cuban government has consistently pressured washington to do away with the law , which many people feel encourages illegal and dangerous journeys by land and sea i just do n't think we should be encouraging people by funding even this rudimentary shelter in costa rica , mr north said representative carlos curbelo , a republican in south florida who has introduced legislation to eliminate welfare aid for cuban migrants , said was to blame for the migration crisis because he had normalized relations with , but mr curbelo said the donation was important anyway to support a major partner in the region costa rica has always been a key ally in the region and offered assistance to these cubans after the marxist government of nicaragua shut its border in a geopolitical dispute , mr curbelo said in an email the following crisis exasperated costa rican resources as the migrants piled up in that country throughout , the costa rican people demonstrated great humanity and hospitality to these migrants manuel gonz lez , the costa rican foreign minister , said his country had spent up to 3 million housing the cubans at one point , 29 shelters were open , although 15 have since closed as thousands of the migrants have left for routes to the united states in a deal brokered by central american nations and mexico at one point , it was costing 35 , 000 to 40 , 000 daily , mr gonz lez said in a telephone interview it s complicated logistics security , medicine , food , electricity it s quite an important daily expenditure
let s talk about the republican presidential candidates and women not the fight about who has the prettiest wife , which truly tops this week s list of things we never thought we 'd see in a presidential election that was the dustup in which donald trump tweeted an image of his wife , melania , a former model , next to a rather unflattering picture of ted cruz s wife , heidi cruz called trump a sniveling coward and delivered a stirring tribute to his spouse that would have been even more moving if it had not been lifted from the 1995 film the american president he also said , trump may be a rat , but i have no desire to copulate with him there was no indication what the hell that meant , but it definitely did not come from an old michael douglas movie this was also the week in which cruz accused trump of having his henchmen plant a national enquirer story alleging that cruz might have had five secret mistresses stories suggesting that conservative politicians have had affairs do not come under the heading of things we thought we 'd never see , so we will let that one go and move on to the issues one thing that all these guys have in common is a desire to put themselves in charge of the reproductive rights of the entire female half of the country trump used to be prochoice , but he evolved at some undisclosed point in the 21st century ted cruz opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest john kasich is willing to allow a troubled teenager to get an abortion if she s seduced by her father , but not if the seducer is the nextdoor neighbor this is why kasich s the moderate everybody knows you ca n't believe in abortion rights and win the republican nomination but then the candidates ought to be eager to make family planning services accessible , right \? the best way to reduce abortion is to limit unwanted pregnancies ted cruz made his position on contraception clear while campaigning in iowa it s so charming that i am going to quote it in full last i checked , we do n't have a rubber shortage in america look , when i was in college , we had a machine in the bathroom you put 50 cents in and voil so , yes , anyone who wants contraceptives can access them , but it s an utterly madeup nonsense issue women whose family planning needs go beyond a vending machine will have to fend for themselves cruz is opposed to requiring employers to include contraception in their health care plans he hates planned parenthood so much that he to end its funding said government funding pays for contraceptives as well as myriad other health services , none involving abortion except for the part where the contraceptives help avoid unwanted pregnancies john kasich is n't much different his state has been in a war against planned parenthood that has closed down health clinics , cutting off everything from family planning to programs for atrisk expectant mothers kasich has said that there are many different entities that can take care of the women who were cut adrift last year , legislators who supported the defunding put together a list of those entities they turned out , on second glance , to include senior centers , dentist offices and a food bank this is a crisis situation states around the country have been stripping planned parenthood of medicaid funds , leaving lowincome women to fend for themselves in texas , women who used to have access to efficient methods of birth control like injectable contraceptives are showing huge jumps in pregnancy rates on friday , gov rick scott signed a bill effectively defunding the clinics in florida the only republican presidential candidate who has acknowledged the invaluable role planned parenthood plays is donald trump \( millions and millions of women cervical cancer , breast cancer are helped by planned parenthood \) of course , he s also said that it should be defunded \( i mean if you look at what s going on with that , it s terrible \) and when asked if he would be willing to shut down the government in pursuit of the cause , trump declined to answer because i want to show unpredictability this is exactly where we wind up on so many issues , people two republican candidates take clear , consistent , terrible positions neither cruz nor kasich has made any effort to come to grips with the health care services poor women would need if planned parenthood closed up shop and they 're doing everything they can to make sure that the unwanted pregnancies that follow ca n't be terminated trump seems more open , sort of except it s the openness of a large , vacant pit with an issuespendulum careening wildly , smashing from one side to the other on the subject of women , all we know for sure is that he thinks his wife is a real looker and the campaign is a man s world
miami when struggled to choose an engagement ring for his wife , his closest friend and unwavering political ally , david rivera , was by his side when all four of mr rubio s children were born , mr rivera kept vigil in the waiting room and when mr rubio was introduced as the next speaker of the florida house in 2005 , there was no doubt that mr rivera would celebrate his elevation there are no words to express or describe how i feel making this nomination for , so i wo n't even try to find them , mr rivera said on the house floor besides , i do n't think i can do it without getting all choked up anyway a decade later , the two men s paths have radically diverged mr rubio is a senator running for president , facing a doordie moment in tuesday s florida republican primary mr rivera is in political exile , trying to resuscitate a tarnished career after losing his bid in 2012 for a second term in congress he has been the subject of state and federal investigations , including one into his campaign expenses and another in which two associates pleaded guilty to a scheme to funnel money to a sham candidate in an effort to weaken a political opponent of mr rivera s but he has not been indicted on any charge and denies wrongdoing for mr rubio , 44 , the cloud over mr rivera has raised questions about their relationship , even serving as a target for in florida and it has forced the senator to distance himself , at least publicly , from his political alter ego their relationship casts light on the roughandtumble nature of miamidade county cuban politics , where tempers run hot , insults are traded in both spanish and english and local corruption runs deep for years , the pair s friendship unfolded like a political buddy movie , with mr rubio the charismatic , ambitious upandcomer , and mr rivera , six years his senior , the sharpelbowed operative i would say without equivocation that without david rivera it would have been difficult to envision marco rubio s rapid rise to the speakership , said al cardenas , a republican power broker in florida who knows both men and hired mr rubio into his law firm fresh out of law school \( mr cardenas supported former gov jeb bush , once a mentor to mr rubio , in the presidential contest \) as a result , mr rivera has been unable to entirely resist mr rubio s venture into presidential politics zeliglike , he has popped up and at some , cameos that mr rivera shrugs off i 've been attending gop debates long before marco got into politics , and i 'll be attending them for a long time to come , he said mr rubio s spokesman , alex conant , said mr rivera has no role in the campaign he does not advise marco on foreign affairs or any other issue , he added the campaign did not provide him tickets to the debate but a republican official close to the rubio campaign said that mr rivera had served as a trusted , though unofficial , adviser , with a direct line to mr rubio he has provided early reconnaissance in at least one state , iowa , and has offered advice on overall strategy a close confidant of , mr rivera also provides moral support and advice to her among mr rubio s supporters , mr rivera s legal troubles and their impact on mr rubio elicit shrugs many have praised mr rubio for not abandoning his friend they point out that mr rivera has not been charged and that mr rubio has never been tied to any of the accusations marco wishes him well , said nelson diaz , who was once mr rivera s roommate and a top aide to mr rubio and is now executive director of the miamidade county republican party he s not going to throw david under the bus but others said mr rivera always tapdanced around ethical lines and took chances that others would not have , something that mr rubio used to his advantage questions about their relationship , as close as u a y carne a spanish expression that means as close as a fingernail on flesh are fair game , they said dime con qui n andas y te digo qui n eres , said j c planas , a republican lawyer in miami who served with mr rubio in the state house and said he suffered retribution from mr rivera and mr rubio tell me who your friends are and i 'll tell you who you are on the face of it , the two men have little in common mr rubio has a family he dotes on , loves football and popcorn movies , and is known for his ambition and skill as an orator mr rivera has never married , adores baseball , enjoys art house movies and is known for his legal pads scrawled with political minutiae what they share is a strong cuban heritage and a profound love for politics mr rubio saw the presidency writ large years ago mr rivera helped shove the boulders out of the way i was willing to do what was needed to be done to help marco be successful , mr rivera said they met in 1992 , while mr rubio was still in college , when the two served as volunteers for lincoln diazbalart s campaign for congress their friendship blossomed in 1996 , when mr rivera hired mr rubio to help run bob dole s presidential campaign in miamidade , a big job that gave him political entree with republican power brokers , like mr cardenas in 1998 , mr rubio , two years out of law school , won a seat on the city commission in his neighborhood of west miami voters responded to his charm , warmth and energy two years later , mr rubio was catapulted to the florida house in a special election he soon eyed his next , more audacious goal first cubanamerican speaker of the florida house but first he had to line up the votes , and it was his good fortune that mr rivera , adept at ontheground strategy , was elected to the house in 2002 and served as chairman of the powerful rules committee over the next few years , mr rivera would help for mr rubio and serve as his gobetween , earning the nickname the enforcer house republicans who wavered in their support of mr rubio s speakership or strayed from the republican leadership s agenda on taxes and education found themselves yanked from committee chairmanships , being criticized on spanish radio or suddenly facing primary opponents people always feared what david rivera would do , said christian ulvert , who was a top aide to dan gelber , the house democratic leader at the time when someone became a vulnerability in marco world , they were expendable but mr rivera said that he was not alone in playing hardball politics in tallahassee there were a lot of interests beyond david rivera and marco rubio that were involved in those events , he said as the pair rose to power , their lives became increasingly intertwined they bought a house in tallahassee in 2005 , giving mrs rubio a place to stay with the children during session the house became a problem , though , at one point , when it briefly faced foreclosure they last year mr rivera was also instrumental in persuading mr rubio to enter a longshot bid for the united states senate in 2009 traveling the state for his own campaign for the state senate , and later congress , mr rivera methodically gauged republican support for mr rubio against charlie crist , then the governor encouraged , he counseled mr rubio to run later , when the campaign turned vicious , mr rivera and a cadre of friends persuaded him to hold tight the two campaigned together in the final weeks before their elections and two years later , during mr rivera s failed reelection bid , when allegations swirled , mr rubio to support his friend mr rivera has not fared as well as his onetime roommate instead , he has become entangled in a series of scandals in his single term as a congressman , of the most corrupt members of congress published by citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington , a nonpartisan group , which cited claims he ran afoul of campaign finance laws and failed to report certain income sources mr rivera has been eyed by state and federal investigators in one case , federal prosecutors investigated mr rivera s role in a secret plot to finance a sham candidate , justin lamar sternad , in which tens of thousands of dollars were spent to pay for mr sternad s mailers , robocalls and other expenses with the goal of undercutting mr rivera s democratic opponent , joe garcia , in the 2012 congressional race instead , mr rivera s friend , ana alliegro , who helped facilitate the plan , as well as mr sternad , testified before a grand jury and pleaded guilty to felonies in the case mr rivera was named in open court by federal prosecutors as a coconspirator in an interview , ms alliegro said mr rivera supplied the money to her to use for the candidate , helped her flee to nicaragua twice , visited her there and orchestrated the coverup mr rivera said none of that was true nearly four years later , he has not been charged and maintains his innocence when you know you have n't done anything wrong , you sleep well at night , mr rivera said , adding he had never been contacted by a federal investigator still , his troubles continue on feb 26 , ms alliegro , who was jailed for six months in the election case , sought a temporary order of protection against him , accusing him of stalking her and hacking into her cellphone the court turned down the request mr rivera called her accusation a complete fabrication , adding that he was in tallahassee on the day she says he stalked her in miami and has witnesses who can verify the fact in 2012 , the florida ethics commission cited him with 11 potential ethics violations , including misusing campaign funds and not disclosing a 1 million consulting contract with a miami gambling business while he served in the state house several violations were dismissed , but an administrative law judge determined that mr rivera had broken rules pertaining to travel expenses and disclosing income he recommended a fine of 58 , 000 , which mr rivera is appealing after an investigation of similar evidence , the miamidade state attorney s office decided in 2012 not to bring criminal charges against mr rivera but in a memo closing out the case , prosecutors wrote that they were confronted with the fact that an elected official over a period of many years was essentially able to live off political money while avoiding penal sanction his friends say that mr rivera has weathered the controversy and that mr rubio , facing his own political problems , is far removed from the scandal it s a nonissue , said mr diaz , mr rubio s former aide who works at southern strategy group , a lobbying organization you ca n't say this is guilt by association still , the public distance between mr rubio and mr rivera is palpable when miami s republican members of congress , past and present , held a news conference last month , after mr bush dropped out of the race , to endorse mr rubio for president , mr rivera was nowhere to be found rivera has been relegated to a footnote , said mr planas , a former state house member and rivera critic far from the spotlight of the presidential campaign , mr rivera said he was weighing a run for a local florida house seat he is also keeping close tabs on mr rubio s future marco is as inspirational to me and the cubanamerican

eight justices heard oral arguments in of the supreme court s term on wednesday when will the court return to full strength \? that question is as urgent today as it was immediately after the death two and a half months ago of justice antonin scalia but the initial wave of outrage at the senate republicans' hardline refusal to consider replacing justice scalia has ebbed , making it that much easier for republicans to keep the seat empty through the presidential election if they succeed , the court will go nearly two terms , and possibly longer , without a ninth member the consequences of the impasse have been growing graver by the day already the justices have split 4 to 4 in two cases , leaving important legal issues unresolved in one , the court failed to decide a involving the longstanding right of publicsector unions , which represent millions of american workers , to charge collective bargaining fees to nonmembers by the term s end in late june , it s likely that several more cases will have ended in tie votes , including possibly the fights over in texas , and president obama s  it could get worse from here so far , the justices' docket for the term beginning in october is , and the eightmember court may hesitate before taking on highprofile cases on controversial topics that are more likely to result in split votes already , major cases involving restrictive voting laws in and , who want the right to refuse to fill contraceptive prescriptions for religious reasons , and to reduce pollution from coalfired power plants are before the court or could be soon all could languish in legal limbo republicans have n't been satisfied simply to hobble the court s ability to function in recent weeks , they have gone to remarkable lengths to impugn the integrity of the justices and thus the legitimacy of the court charles grassley , chairman of the senate judiciary committee , has attacked chief justice john roberts jr , who delighted conservatives at his own confirmation hearings by calling balls and strikes but last month , mr grassley , who should be spending his time scheduling confirmation hearings , instead at the chief justice , claiming that a number of his votes have reflected political considerations , not legal ones presumably referring to chief justice roberts s two votes upholding aspects of the affordable care act gov greg abbott of texas , who is challenging mr obama s immigration actions , also complained about the court , that because it has shed its clothing as being guardians of the law , it deserves to be swept up into the political process none of this has anything to do with the qualifications of mr obama s nominee , , the chief judge of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit , whom conservatives as someone they would happily confirm the battle is purely about ideological control of the court , which has had a conservative majority for decades how does the insanity end \? if the senate majority leader , mitch mcconnell , and mr grassley hold to their promise not to give judge garland a hearing or a vote , it will probably take a president and senate of the same party to nominate and confirm a new justice after inauguration day in january but if the president and the senate are of different parties , there is every reason to believe that the current blockade will continue indefinitely if donald trump wins the white house , even mr grassley that his supreme court nominee would be a gamble mr grassley and his fellow republicans gambled that anger over their inaction would fade as the news cycle rolled on and the public s attention turned to the presidential campaign maybe republicans are willing to take such gambles because they believe they do n't have anything to lose but the american people do
mexico city it has been a tumultuous final week for the five foreign legal and human rights experts who have spent more than a year examining the case of 43 missing college students it began last sunday when the independent panel , which raised further questions about the government s handling of the matter and challenged the authorities' conclusions what followed were a series of dueling news conferences by the panelists and by government officials , each accusing the other of playing with the truth and bringing the relationship between the government and the experts to a low ebb but by friday , with the panel s mandate about to end and the experts preparing to leave the country , the tone had shifted again now that we leave , it seems like everybody likes us , said francisco cox , a chilean lawyer and panel member they express gratefulness he added , perhaps mindful of the frustrations accompanying the panel s work in recent months , we have to see if that s real many in question the sincerity of the government s gratitude , and they fear that with the panel s departure , the country is losing its best chance of finding out the truth about the students' disappearance the 43 students , undergraduates from a teachers college in ayotzinapa , in the violent pacific coast state of guerrero , one night in september 2014 amid violent confrontations with mexican security forces in the city of iguala the remains of only one student have been found the mexican government , under pressure from the students' relatives , invited the foreign experts to examine the case the panel five lawyers and human rights experts from chile , colombia , guatemala and spain began its work in march 2015 the relationship between the panel and the government , which started well , and tense in september when the investigators issued their first report , which with the government s investigation but the relationship took a bitter turn last week the dispute focused on the events that unfolded on oct 28 and 29 , 2014 , along the banks of the san juan river near the town of cocula the government has maintained that the students were and that their remains were dumped in the river but the foreign experts have said the available evidence does not support those conclusions in the panel s and in an accompanying news conference last sunday , the experts questioned the propriety of a visit by investigators to the riverbank in october 2014 , saying they apparently violated international investigative protocols the experts screened video clips at the news conference showing tom s zer n , the chief of criminal investigations for mexico s attorney general , accompanying a detained suspect to the scene on oct 28 , 2014 the videos showed an investigator handling a bone fragment that was discarded after officials determined it was from a bird the videos also showed plastic bags that resembled one recovered from the river the next day by investigators and contained incinerated bones , including one that provided the only known dna link to one of the missing students yet none of that day s investigative activities were recorded in the case file , the foreign panelists said , suggesting , at best , poor detective work and , at worst , the manipulation or planting of evidence the news conference seemed to be the experts' parting shot before their mandate expired on saturday and it might well have been had mr zer n not held his own news conference on wednesday night to say his riverside visit was legal and transparent , conducted in view of journalists and representatives of the united nations human rights office he did not explain , however , why the visit had not been recorded in the case file the angered experts responded with another news conference , on thursday morning they called mr zer n s assertions a distortion of reality and said his actions on oct 28 violated minimum international standards they also said no united nations representatives had accompanied mr zer n to the riverbank that day the week looked as if it might get even stormier , but by thursday evening the attorney general s office had issued a statement saying it had opened an internal affairs inquiry into the actions of the government investigators on friday , the expert panel formally presented its second report to mexico s attorney general , arely g mez gonz lez ms g mez told the panel that the case was still open and that she would take into consideration each and every one of the panel s recommendations , mr cox said even though the experts will be gone by the end of the weekend , mr cox added , they will keep an eye on the investigation we 're going to call it as we see it , he said
washington hours after announced in a 2014 speech that he was escalating his campaign against islamic extremists , a number of prominent columnists suggested they knew exactly what he was thinking michael tomasky , a correspondent for the daily beast , that obama clearly feels he has the constitutional authority to go after isis anywhere and everywhere gerald f seib , the washington bureau chief for the wall street journal , about what the president calculated the next day , fred kaplan in a slate column that obama is loath to bring iran or assad s syria both shiite regimes into the alliance and asserted with confidence that obama is allergic to mission creep' what none of the journalists told readers , because they had promised the white house that they would not , was that their attempts to portray the president s intentions had followed a lengthy and with mr obama the day he delivered the speech technically off the record , the president s extended conversation in the roosevelt room that afternoon with 18 prominent columnists was part of a white house tradition aimed at influencing washington thought leaders without leaving fingerprints and without fear that an offhand comment from the commander in chief would spark the latest social media firestorm these presidential briefings are a way for people to be able to set aside the urgency of supplying the latest quote from the president of the united states and sit back and listen to the broader argument , said josh earnest , the white house press secretary he declined to comment on the participants or the content of the discussions mr earnest said the unannounced sessions with the president allowed mr obama to speak more candidly than he can in public , especially about issues that defy easy answers columnists who have attended one of the more than a dozen private meetings with the president in the last seven years are directed not to quote him , disclose what was discussed or use the information they gleaned in further reporting the attendees are not allowed to even acknowledge that the discussion took place but those restrictions , if followed literally , would serve little purpose for the president and his aides , who are eager to make sure his views are written about with what they consider the proper depth and context and so the most washington of games goes on columnists , including several who write for the new york times , get to describe the president s thinking with confidence and authority , while mr obama can hold forth at length with deniability the white house holds far fewer private presidential briefings for news reporters who cover the white house in recent years , times beat reporters have generally declined invitations to private sessions with the president , although they have at times been present when mr obama has visited with reporters at the back of for offtherecord conversations what we are hoping is that people will incorporate the president s perspective into how he s approaching these situations , mr earnest said the latest example took place in december when mr obama met with about a dozen columnists before delivering a speech from the oval office to defend his strategy in combating the islamic state , also known as isis or isil the next day , one of those columnists , david ignatius of the washington post , pushed the offtherecord boundaries throughout his , mr ignatius used phrases like obama does n't think and obama appears to recognize and obama clearly regards to describe the president s thinking without betraying that the meeting took place in an email , mr ignatius said the job of foreign affairs columnists was to learn as much as we can about how government leaders , here and elsewhere , think about issues and share that information with readers , consistent with the ground rules after a times disclosed the existence of the presidential briefing that mr ignatius attended , mr earnest wrote to the columnists , reminding them of the ground rules but mr earnest said in an interview that the president regarded both the column and the times story as helpful in helping people understand exactly what he s dealing with anita dunn , who served as communications director for mr obama early in his first term , said putting such sessions on the record would ruin them once it s attributed , it becomes an official policy , she said you ca n't really think out loud at that point the current white house is not unique in using secret presidential face time to try to influence coverage previous presidents of both parties regularly invited columnists to the white house for offtherecord sessions but mr obama is the first president to publish white house visitor logs that document who attends the discussions it is now possible to match up the columnist briefings with the columns that result in june 2010 , mr obama invited five washington columnists to an offtherecord discussion in the old family dining room three days later , david wessel , then a columnist for the wall street journal , that mr obama appears less convinced of the virtues of free trade per se he loves exports , easily sold as creating jobs , mr wessel continued but he seems to view world trade like a basketball game ezra klein , then a washington post columnist , attended a similar meeting in july 2011 in his columns on july 14 and july 15 , he about what many in the white house also believe and the white house s telling about budget negotiations later that year , mr obama invited 10 columnists , including albert r hunt of bloomberg news , to a briefing in the roosevelt room on sept 6 ahead of a jobs speech he planned to give to congress on sept 11 , after mr obama delivered the speech , mr hunt that the president believes that pushing for more jobcreating infrastructure projects also is a political winner and that the basic view from the white house is that obama inherited a horrible economic hand he noted that obamaites also think they get unfair raps and that what really infuriates the white house from obama on down is what it views as the equivalency' that the press makes between democrats and republicans on the current deficit debates liberalleaning columnists from newspapers tend to dominate at mr obama s secret sessions , but the white house has invited some , and prominent conservatives have attended as well in 2013 , mr obama invited five conservatives to a roosevelt room discussion two days later , charles krauthammer in his washington post column that mr obama insists he wo n't negotiate on the as a matter of principle paul gigot , the editor of the wall street journal editorial page , talked knowingly on fox news about the white house strategy to put maximum pressure on congress ms dunn said the sessions with the columnists many of them fixtures of the washington press corps had been especially helpful for mr obama , who came into office without knowing many of them the sessions help the columnists understand his thought process , she said they walk away from them with a better sense of him as a person and a policy maker , she said that s very valuable
washington never minced words as house speaker , but he usually leveled his insults behind closed doors now a private citizen , mr boehner is going public , and the results can be spectacular on wednesday , the former speaker gleefully unloaded on senator before a crowd at stanford university , colorfully describing the republican presidential contender from texas as  i have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life , said mr boehner , who has made previous disparaging remarks about mr cruz in both public and private , though without comparing him directly to satan an affronted mr cruz , fighting in indiana to keep his presidential bid alive , that he barely knew mr boehner if i have said 50 words in my life to john boehner , i 'd be surprised , and every one of them has consisted of pleasantries , mr cruz told reporters , noting that he had never really worked with mr boehner and therein lies the problem mr boehner , who suffered as mr cruz wooed rebellious house conservatives into a punishing government shutdown in 2013 , saw mr cruz as a selfaggrandizer who put himself above the institution of congress and even the good of his party to an institutionalist like mr boehner , there is no greater offense mr cruz , on the other hand , saw mr boehner as a handy symbol of washington dealmaking and the standardbearer for what mr cruz deplores as the washington cartel , a much more ominous way of describing the political establishment it was destined to be a nonrelationship forged where lucifer resides while mr boehner no doubt enjoyed the attention accorded his biting remark on mr cruz , it worked out for mr cruz as well he got the opportunity to again burnish his antiwashington credentials and position himself as a warrior against mr boehner and donald j trump , who mr boehner said in the stanford talk was a texting buddy mr boehner said that they had golfed together , and that he would vote for mr trump if it came to that , but not for mr cruz to anyone who knew mr boehner in washington , the comments , , were no surprise with a glass of wine in one hand and a cigarette in the other , mr boehner would often hold forth , offering his rather spirited views of individuals and ideas , though not always for publication and when he was in exile from the leadership from 1998 to 2006 , he was a goto quote for commentary on the poor conduct of those who were in charge but when he took over as speaker , mr boehner clammed up a bit , so the surprise is how freely flowing the comments are these days earlier this year , mr boehner , who favored jeb bush in the presidential race and later endorsed his homestate governor , john kasich , essentially singlehandedly touched off the while speaking to a trade association in march if we do n't have a nominee who can win on the first ballot , i'm for none of the above , mr boehner said they all had a chance to win none of them won so i'm for none of the above i'm for paul ryan to be our nominee mr ryan , mr boehner s successor as speaker , has been trying to dial back that talk ever since , another victim of john boehner unplugged to his aides , this is all just boehner being boehner you know he generally says what he thinks anyway , and being out of office has certainly not made him any less inclined to be that way , said david schnittger , a spokesman for the former speaker the stanford speech was a good example encouraged to be candid , he was downright loquacious in offering his views on everything from hillary clinton oh , i'm a woman , vote for me to senator bernie sanders s being a good guy to the possibility of vice president joseph r biden jr emerging as a lastminute presidential nominee he pronounced the conservative republicans in the freedom caucus who bedeviled him on capitol hill as knuckleheads and goofballs , a sentiment he has also expressed on prior occasions mr boehner had little patience for conservatives he believed did not understand how the house worked and how compromise was a necessity , not a sin , with a democrat in the white house and democrats empowered in the senate mr ryan , by contrast , has been more willing to reach out to the same conservatives and while the results may be similar a continuing budget standoff for instance the conservatives do not have their sights set on mr ryan , as they did mr boehner at least not yet mr boehner seems eminently comfortable in retirement , buying a new car after years of being driven around by a security team and traveling the country without the trappings of his congressional position i think my proudest accomplishment is walking out of there the same jackass i was 25 years before , mr boehner said , according to the stanford newspaper now that he is out of office , the speaker speaks
while packing for a trip to toronto in 1978 , irwin weinberg sent his teenage son jack to a military surplus store with instructions to buy a pair of handcuffs on the plane , mr weinberg quietly chained one of his own wrists to his briefcase the handcuffs were a prop , a gimmick to get the attention of news photographers who had been alerted to his arrival and to the arrival of the tiny item in the briefcase the world s most expensive postage stamp , the 1cent magenta from british guiana , issued in 1856 it was to be displayed at a stamp show in toronto mr weinberg , a stamp dealer and collector who died at 88 on may 2 , for a group of investors for 280 , 000 , a record at the time it is the only such stamp known to exist he went from the airport to a news conference for the stamp show , the canadian philatelic exhibition no one noticed that when he slipped the key into the handcuffs , it broke i thought , just keep talking and worry about it later , mr weinberg recalled in an interview in 2015 after the news conference ended and the reporters dispersed , mr weinberg told one of the stampshow organizers that they had to find a way to free him security guards borrowed hairpins and tried paper clips a firefighter who arrived produced a saw and was starting to cut into the handcuffs when the door opened and one of the reporters returned mr weinberg , who liked to pull stunts to promote the stamp , said he remembered thinking , this is exactly what i would want if i could dream up a thing like this the story of the stamp , the handcuffs stunt and the struggle to shed the shackles was picked up around the world and in people magazine , which wrote that the steel was too thick for the firefighter s hacksaw and that mr weinberg was finally liberated with the help of a police officer s key mr weinberg died at his home in kingston , pa , said his daughter , jan , who survives him along with his sons , john \( who is known as jack \) and robert mr weinberg had collected stamps since he was a boy even before he bought a rugcleaning operation in wilkesbarre , pa , in the 1950s , he ran a stamp business there for more than 70 years he published miner s stamp news , a weekly newsletter that listed the stamps in his inventory in the late 1960s , mr weinberg was sure that inflation would follow the end of the vietnam war , and he concluded that nothing would be a better hedge against it than stamps he considered luxury investments like gold or diamonds too risky so he formed a stamppurchasing partnership with several investors from the wilkesbarre area one was a lawyer , another owned hotels , another was a furniture manufacturer who each put up 50 , 000 he was so confident in the inverted jenny , the united states stamp from 1918 featuring a biplane mistakenly printed upsidedown , that he bought two one for 29 , 000 , and the other for 33 , 000 in 1970 , at the auction at which he bought the 1cent magenta , for 34 , 000 in 1971 , for 31 , 000 only 100 inverted jennys exist but none of the purchases brought the attention that the 1cent magenta did , from the moment he bought it in a standingroomonly auction at the waldorf astoria mr weinberg went on to take the stamp to philadelphia in 1976 for the nation s bicentennial , and also to japan , india and australia he appeared on the game show to tell the truth and on mike douglas s television talk show i was trying to introduce it to the world , he said , and maybe find a buyer he did , in 1980 john e du pont , an heir to the du pont chemical fortune , paid 935 , 000 for the 1cent magenta at auction mr du pont s estate for 95 million mr du pont was convicted of thirddegree murder but was declared mentally ill in the 1996 shooting of the olympic wrestler david schultz , a case fictionalized in the 2014 movie foxcatcher mr du pont died in prison in 2010 mr weinberg s stunt with the handcuffs was not the only one he orchestrated , though it did not pay off in the way he planned on one occasion , he arranged for an armored car to meet him at a manhattan bank where he kept the stamp in a safedeposit box he intended to slip the magenta into his briefcase , climb into the armored car , ride to kennedy international airport and fly off with the briefcase on his lap he drummed up news coverage by telephoning a television station , which sent a camera crew to the bank it was uneventful , mr weinberg recalled in 2015 , excepting that the armored car got lost on the way to the airport he rushed onto the plane with the stamp in his briefcase everything else he had packed for the trip in the luggage he checked at the gate was lost
beirut , lebanon noor , who is a commander in a progovernment militia near damascus , thinks that president will prevail in s civil war but even so , he thinks it will take his country a generation to recover after we finish this war , we 'll spend another 10 years cleaning up the thugs and warlords on our own side , he told me when i met him in the damascus suburb of jaramana , in an apartment overlooking a highway where rebels and government forces clash nightly that was last fall , shortly after russia began bombing in support of the government this infusion of firepower changed the course of the conflict after years of stalemate , syria s civil war became unstuck but that has n't made it ready for settlement negotiations restarted in geneva last week amid cautious optimism that the regime and the opposition may finally be ready to discuss a deal russian and american diplomats are talking about shared goals , and both countries finally seem willing to strongarm their clients to the table opposition groups and their sponsors say they have achieved levels of unity that will enable them to force concessions from the government , and for the first time they have admitted in public that they 're willing to work with some regime figures but all of this misses the central point syria , one of the most important states in the arab world , has cracked up , and no peace settlement can put it back together despite talk of a regime and opposition , syria today is a mosaic of tiny fiefs the government has ceded control of stretches of land to iran , russia and hezbollah its opponents range from the apocalyptic islamic state to a coterie of tiny insurgent groups led by local warlords reliant on foreign donors on all sides of the conflict , warlords mark territory with armed checkpoints these lowlevel bosses have tasted power it s hard to imagine they will readily submit to any national government the collapse of syria poses a huge threat to middle eastern stability for good and for ill , syria has been a major player in the arab world since world war ii it often acted as spoiler , stringpuller or savior in the conflicts that ravaged its neighbors it was a major player among the dizzying cast of foreign powers that intervened in lebanon s , and brought that conflict to an end with an outright occupation blessed by the united states without damascus , a rogue s gallery of militant movements might never have survived hezbollah grew into a powerful regional actor with sustained aid from syria hamas s leaders weathered lean years in exile in damascus many groups labeled terrorists by western governments found refuge in syria the assad government s patronage of iraqi rebels helped fuel the uprising against the american occupation , and provided crucial early support to radicals who today lead the islamic state and yet , for all these destabilizing moves , syria was a coherent focal point in a region short on leaders who could deal and deliver on occasion , even the united states and israel enjoyed close collaboration with damascus now , syria seems destined to influence the region not as a puppetmaster but as a black hole syria s war already has spawned chaos , from the millions of refugees seeking safety beyond the country s borders to the rise of the islamic state and the tremendous traffic in weapons and cash to militants the next chapter could be even worse even if some fraction of the opposition can reach an accord with the government , the area they could try to rule would amount to a rump state the nation s industrial heartland and most populous city , aleppo , has been almost completely destroyed before the war , syria s manufacturing economy , education and health systems all functioned well by regional standards they are unlikely to recover the postwar landscape will probably play host to extremists , entrepreneurs of violence and widespread graft so why does anyone have hope for the talks in geneva \? one reason is superpower politics russia and the united states are looking for ways to calm tensions , and diplomats from both countries believe an accord could lead to progress on issues they consider more important , like ukraine another critical factor is exhaustion iran and hezbollah backed the regime for years but , without russia s assistance , were unable to help it hold ground , much less win turkey , saudi arabia and the united states , the main sponsors of the opposition , have pulled back support whenever their proxies have surged , perhaps unsure that they 'll behave responsibly if they win power syria s civilians are desperate the ranks of fighters are dwindling , especially on the government side none of the parties have given up hope of outright victory , but an increasing number of rebels and midlevel government supporters acknowledge that they will either have to settle for a divided country or join forces with their sworn enemies some of the rebel commanders i interviewed in march said they believed the war had entered an endgame , but that it would take at least a few more years of fighting before serious negotiating would begin until now , none of the players have taken peace talks seriously russia and america s renewed engagement has drawn the notice of negotiators , but that means only that they believe they might be embarking on a real process not that they expect a result soon that rivals like iran and saudi arabia , as well as russia and the united states , will see eye to eye on a brokered deal to end the war is a long shot but the idea that they would work together to prevent syria s continued decay into a zone of violence is an even longer one for now , mr assad s negotiators still consider the rebels terrorists , while the opposition insists that mr assad , the disease that struck syria , must step aside immediately the state over whose fate they 're haggling , however , appears beyond salvaging
lyin ted feels almost tame donald trump is usually the most insulting person in any room , but his nickname for ted cruz is nowhere near the worst thing the senator s been called the creativity with which people have expressed their hatred for him stands out even in this particularly nasty campaign season below are a few of the most inventive ways those who know mr cruz have characterized him , or their feelings about his candidacy lucifer in the flesh this is how john boehner described mr cruz in an appearance at stanford on wednesday he added , i get along with almost everyone , but i have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life like being poisoned on the daily show in march , lindsey graham said choosing between donald trump and ted cruz was like deciding whether to be shot or poisoned by way of clarification , he added , donald is like being shot in the head you might find an antidote to poisoning , i don t know , but maybe there s time the lovechild of joe mccarthy and dracula it s less surprising when democrats insult mr cruz than when republicans do it , but al franken still gets points for originality he offered this description at a minnpost event earlier this month creepy several fellow classmates who asked that their names not be used described the young cruz with words like abrasive , intense , strident , crank , and arrogant , wrote patricia murphy at the daily beast in 2013 four independently offered the word creepy , with some pointing to cruz s habit of donning a paisley bathrobe and walking to the opposite end of their dorm s hallway where the female students lived a nightmare of a human being  craig mazin , mr cruz s freshman roommate at princeton , has many thoughts about the senator , none of them good in addition to calling him a nightmare , he has said , i have plenty of problems with his politics , but truthfully , his personality is so awful that 99 percent of why i hate him is just his personality if he agreed with me on every issue , i would hate him only 1 percent less i hate ted cruz , and i think i ll take cyanide if he ever got the nomination this needs little explanation representative peter king made his feelings clear on morning joe earlier this month
bratislava , slovakia s prime minister , , will remain in office even though his centerleft party lost its majority in parliament on march 5 , in an in which farright extremists made strong gains mr fico on thursday cobbled together a coalition with three other parties a centerright party , a slovak nationalist party and a party representing the country s hungarian minority the coalition will have a slim majority , 81 of the 150 seats in parliament the tenure of mr fico , who led the country from 2006 to 2010 and has led it again since 2012 , has been marred by several corruption scandals , but he managed to cling to office by persuading two parties that had sharply criticized him to join him in governing the alternative would have been a sixparty rightwing coalition led by the centerright freedom and solidarity party , which came in second to mr fico s smersocial democracy party , but leaders of those parties deemed that unlikely because the coalition would be unstable the biggest surprise in the election was the success of the extremeright people s partyour slovakia , led by marian kotleba , a regional governor who has spoken favorably of , who led a nazibacked puppet government during , helped send the country s jews to their deaths and was eventually hanged for treason the party picked up 14 seats in parliament , but none of the other parties would work with its members during the negotiations over forming a new government mr fico had been harshly critical of the europe s handling of the migration crisis last year , he defied a germanbacked plan to require countries in the european union to accept migrants in proportion to their size and wealth the slovak elections were watched closely , because the country will assume the rotating presidency of the council of the european union for six months , starting on july 1 , giving it a prominent say on european affairs
it was somewhere during this penultimate episode of the fifth season of american horror story that i finally realized what the season is actually about stagnation for all the creepiness that a hotel s transience lends to a story , what about the people who never leave \? the liz taylors , the irises , stuck watching as their lives pass them by , or sally and march , stuck as the living pass them by this season has dabbled at substance with the disinterest of a dilettante vampirism as a metaphor for aids , fame as a sort of death , motherhood as infection yet none of these have survived more than one or two episodes , whereas all of the characters have been haunting , either literally or figuratively , the cortez liz and iris are of an age of not much interest to the outside world , john has spent five years under march s tutelage in an absinthe haze , while sally has lurked in corners the countess , with her entourage of lovers and husbands , has been around longer than is probably chic , and let s not forget valentino , imprisoned in a secret chamber for decades what keeps us from moving forward \? shame , sure selfsabotage , too fear of the future , too dear a love of the past how have we made it through 11 episodes with nary a single reference to the warm smell of colitas , \? john made his escape with alex and holden , only to be called by march , who insists john finish his ten commandments work with the remaining sin thou shalt not murder until the work is done , march and sally keep silent as to where alex , holden and the poor forgotten daughter scarlet have been stowed away after iris and elizabeth taylor s gun battle only succeeds in killing iris s son donovan , the ladies free ramona royale from the hidden room \( where she s conveniently finished off the horde of infected children alex spawned \) and dispatch her to finish off the countess i'm sure audience members were supposed to be devastated to see the countess die , but the most emotionally involved i have been all season long was when the actress gabourey sidibe not only returned , but did so as her season 3 character , queenie , the human voodoo doll and witch who can trace her ancestry back to tituba of salem i was so happy to see a character i felt a real connection to that i could ignore the fact she was supposedly in town for a taping of the price is right , with an enchanted ticket from her supreme coven , like ahs s other strongest season , murder house , was populated by human beings with emotions and character arcs queenie s story her dissatisfaction with the overwhelming whiteness of her coven , her complex relationship with a resurrected slave owner was cogent , humane , complex and compelling but , alas , queenie did little more than end up as a blood bag for ramona after march stabs her it was good while it lasted if you were hoping for a knockdown , dragout fight between two queen vampires , there was only disappointment in store the cortez made me feel safe , the countess tells ramona as they , but i see now that it was just because i was so comfortable living in heartbreak rather than duke it out , the countess offers ramona the hotel , and they decide instead to shack up in an oddly unclimatic scene , we see john gun down the countess as she leaves the cortez \( after all the fuss of marrying will drake to inherit it \) her head mounted with the other ten commandments trophies , she s yet another ghost haunting the halls for eternity at least donovan had enough smarts to demand to be dragged off the premises when he croaked , so he would n't be stuck in purgatory there are more things in heaven and earth , horatio , than are dreamt of in your philosophy , admonished hamlet the danish prince would feel right at home in the cortez , where meddling ghosts are par for the course evers , with her love of stains and march , has done her fair share she called the police on march , putting an end to his homicidal spree , in the hope he would grow to love her as the ages passed them by in the cortez march s joy at his permanent reunion with his wife pushes evers too far spurned , evers swears she 'll never serve march or the countess again when she sneers at evers s finally laying down her apron , the maid replies there are more stains in heaven and earth , than are dreamed of in your philosophy were we supposed to be invested in who turned march in \? was march even that concerned \? hamlet was warning horatio that he lacked imagination are we supposed to gather that evers , who has never shown interest in anything other than march and his messes , has some sort of similar warning for the countess \? with one more episode to go , we shall see who makes it out of the cortez personally , i'm rooting for liz taylor ending up as a wildly popular youtube makeup guru , reading my struggle on a beach somewhere , the warm smell of colitas far , far behind her
istanbul about five years ago , everyone was talking about the turkish model people in the west and in the muslim world held up turkey as a shining example of the compatibility of islam and democracy recep tayyip erdogan , who was then prime minister and is now president , was praised as a reformist who was making his country freer , wealthier and more peaceful these days , i think back on those times with nostalgia and regret the rhetoric of liberal opening has given way to authoritarianism , the peace process with the kurdish nationalists has fallen apart , press freedoms are diminishing and terrorist attacks are on the rise what went wrong \? erdoganists yes , some of them call themselves that have a simple answer a conspiracy when mr erdogan made turkey too powerful and independent , nefarious cabals in the west and their treacherous agents at home started a campaign to tarnish turkey s democracy little do they realize , of course , that this conspiracyobsessed propaganda , the selfrighteousness it reflects and the hatred it fuels are part of the problem to understand why the turkish model has let us all down , we have to go back to the 2001 founding of mr erdogan s justice and development party , or akp at that time , turkey was under the thumb of secularist generals who would overthrow any government they could n't control in 1997 they ousted the akp s islamist predecessor , so the founders of the new party put forward a postislamist vision they had abandoned their old ideology , they declared their only priorities now were bringing turkey into the european union and moving the country toward liberal democracy this not only sounded nice , it actually worked nicely for a while in its first eight years in power , the akp enacted liberal reforms and adopted liberal rhetoric turkey s fundamental problem , the party said , was an overbearing state that trampled on citizens' rights opposition to the state , such as the kurdish nationalist movement , had to be understood as reactions to authoritarianism , not as plots by traitors or imperialists stability would come from more rights and freedoms , not fewer as a result , the akp became the darling of western capitals and turkish liberals myself among them but the story was n't over after the akp won major victories in a constitutional referendum in 2010 and in elections in 2011 and subdued the military the party s liberal rhetoric waned and its social conservatism came to the fore then it got worse when the akp felt its power challenged in 2013 , first by and then by a that many , myself included , believe was politically motivated , the party adopted the very authoritarian habits it used to oppose opponents turned into enemies to be crushed the akp s vision of democracy proved to be nothing more than the tyranny of the majority those who tried to stay loyal to the more liberal founding principles , including its founder abdullah gul , were pushed aside turkey s secularists see an islamist conspiracy behind this the akp had hidden its true colors until the right time but i think that the party s changes involved less planning and fewer principles the akp adopted a liberal discourse out of mere necessity , without giving it much thought or going through a real ideological transformation once the party grabbed power , its members were tempted , intoxicated and corrupted by it the cadres and classes that now rally behind mr erdogan have found wealth , prestige and glory for the first time in their lives they seem determined not to lose them regardless of what that means for turkish democracy but just because the akp failed as a model of liberal islamism does n't necessarily mean that all islamists threaten liberal democracy tunisia s experience shows this there , the islamist ennahda party has proved not only popular and triumphant but also reconciliatory consequently , tunisians have been able to accept an admirably liberal constitution with broad national consensus something that looks like a distant dream for us turks one of their secrets , perhaps , is that rachid ghannouchi , a founder of ennahda and its intellectual leader , is less a machiavellian politician and more a principled scholar none of this means that turkey should be pushed away from the west nor should anger at mr erdogan and his party lead to the assumption that turkey is always wrong or its foes are always right under the erdogan government , turkey has helped syrian refugees more than any other country western countries should acknowledge this and offer support and turkey s worries about kurdish separatists are not unfounded , as proved by two recent in ankara claimed by secular kurdish militants moreover , turkey s core problem is not merely the akp s latterday authoritarianism , but the country s combative , divisive , cynical political culture in which mr erdogan s party has thrived we are a that has not achieved its peace yet , and i am afraid we will not heal soon and while mr erdogan might be the latest manipulator of this drama , all other political actors share responsibility to ever become a genuine model , let alone to ensure peace in our country , we turks need to agree on the liberal values that the akp once promoted there are no enemies within our nation , just citizens with diverse views and all of them deserve equal rights and freedoms , under a modest state whose job is not to dictate but to serve
neil cavuto it is 9 00 pm here at the north charleston coliseum and performing arts center in south carolina welcome to the sixth republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign , here on the fox business networki'm neil cavuto , alongside my friend and comoderator maria bartiromo maria bartiromo tonight we are working with facebook to ask the candidates the questions voters want answered and according to facebook , the us election has dominated the global conversation , with 131 million people talking about the 2016 race that makes it the number one issue talked about on facebook last year worldwide cavuto now , the seven candidates on the stage tonight were selected based on their standing in six national polls , as well as polls in the earlyvoting states of iowa and new hampshire , those standings determining the position on the stage of the candidates tonight and here they are businessman donald trump \( applause \) texas senator ted cruz \( applause \) florida senator marco rubio \( applause \) neurosurgeon ben carson \( applause \) new jersey governor chris christie \( applause \) former florida governor jeb bush and ohio governor john kasich \( applause \) bartiromo tonight s rules are simple up to 90 seconds for each answer , one minute for each followup response and if a candidate goes over the allotted time , you 'll hear this \( bell rings \) so let s get started candidates , jobs and growth two of the biggest issues facing the country right now in his state of the union address earlier this week , the president said , quote , we have the strongest , most durable economy in the world and according to our facebook research , jobs is one of the biggest issues resonating across the country , including here in south carolina the president is touting 14 million new jobs and an unemployment rate cut in half the president said that anyone who claims america s economy is in decline is peddling fiction senator cruz , what do you see that he does n't \? cruz well , maria , thank you for that question , and let me say thank you to the state of south carolina for welcoming us let me start i want to get to the substance of the question on jobs , but i want to start with something today , many of us picked up our newspapers , and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 american sailors on their knees , with their hands on their heads in that state of the union , president obama did n't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by iran president obama s preparing to send 100 billion or more to the ayatollah khamenei and i 'll tell you , it was heartbreaking but the good news is the next commanderinchief is standing on this stage \( applause \) and i give you my word , if i am elected president , no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees , and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the united states of america \( applause \) now , on to your substantive question the president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs and you know , he s right if you 're a washington lobbyist , if you make your money in and around washington , things are doing great the millionaires and billionaires are doing great under obama but we have the lowest percentage of americans working today of any year since 1977 median wages have stagnated and the obamaclinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country the reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country , and not washington , dc bartiromo thank you , sir \( applause \) cavuto governor kasich , we are not even two weeks into this stock trading year , but \( inaudible \) investors already lost 16 trillion in market value that makes it the worst start to a new year ever many worry that things will get even worse , and that banks and financial stocks are particularly vulnerable now , if this escalates , like it did back when barack obama first assumed the presidency , what actions would you take if this same thing happens all over again just as , in this example , you are taking over the presidency \? kasich look , it takes three things basically to grow jobs and i 've done it when i was in washington when we had a balanced budget had four years of balanced budgets paid down a halftrillion of debt and our economy was growing like crazy it s the same thing that i did in ohio it s a simple formula common sense regulations , which is why i think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year , except for health and safety it requires tax cuts , because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way and if you tax cuts if you cut taxes for corporations , and you cut taxes for individuals , you 're going to make things move , particularly the corporate tax , which is the highest , of course , in the in the world but in addition to that , we have to have fiscal discipline we have to show that we can march to a balanced budget and when you do that , when you 're in a position of managing regulations when you reduce taxes and when you have fiscal discipline , you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest right now , you do n't have the you have taxes that are too high you have regulations i mean , come on , they 're affecting everybody here , particularly our small businesses they are they 're in a position where they 're smothering people and i mean , are you kidding me \? we 're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise you will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy and how do i know it \? because i 've done it i did it as the chairman of the budget committee , working with senator domenici and i 've done it in the state of ohio as the chief executive our wages are growing faster than the national average we 're running surpluses and we can take that message and that formula to washington to lift every single american to a better life \( applause \) bartiromo we know that recent global events have many people worried iran detaining american sailors , forcing them to apologize north korea and its nuclear ambitions an aggressive china and a middle east that continues to deteriorate , not to mention isis is getting stronger governor christie , sometimes it seems the world is on fire where and when should a president use military action to restore order \? christie well , maria , i'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what s going on in the world because tuesday night , i watched story time with barack obama and i 've got to tell you , it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing , you know \? \( applause \) the fact is , there s a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess the first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world and the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others , but the one thing they 've never said about me is that i'm misunderstood and so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word , in a christie administration , they know we 're going to keep it next , we have to talk to our adversaries , and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience and this president , given what ted said right at the beginning , he s absolutely right it s a it s absolutely disgraceful that secretary kerry and others said in their response to what s going on in iran that this was a good thing it showed how the relationship was getting better the president does n't understand and by the way , neither does secretary clinton and here s my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight if you 're worried about the world being on fire , you 're worried about how we 're going to use our military , you 're worried about strengthening our military and you 're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure , you cannot give hillary clinton a third term of barack obama s leadership i will not do that if i'm the nominee , she wo n't get within 10 miles of the white house \( applause \) bartiromo just to be clear governor , where and when would you use military action \? christie military action , maria , would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect american lives and protect american interests around the world we are not the world s policeman , but we need to stand up and be ready and the problem , maria , is that the military is not ready , either we need to rebuild our military , and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in iran are taking our navy ships it is disgraceful , and in a christie administration , they would know much , much better than to do that \( applause \) cavuto governor bush , the president just told the nation two nights ago that america is back and that the idea that our enemies are getting stronger or that this country is getting weaker , well , it s just rhetoric and hot air now other democrats go even further , sir , saying republicans even suggesting such comments actually embolden our enemies i guess they would include you what do you say \? bush well first of all , the idea that somehow we 're better off today than the day that barack obama was inaugurated president of the united states is totally an alternative universe the simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder think about it with grandiose language , the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up talks about isis being the jv team , they form a caliphate the size of indiana with 35 \( thousand \) to 40 , 000 battletested terrorists he s missing the whole point , that america s leadership in the world is required for peace and stability in the crowd today is major general james livingston , who s the cochairman of my campaign here in south carolina , a medal of honor recipient \( applause \) i 've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength , which means we need to rebuild the military in this administration , every weapon system has been gutted , in this administration , the force levels are going down to a level where we ca n't even project force our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us , and we 're in a much difficult we 're in a much different position than we should be and for the life of me , i have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well terrorism is on the run , china , russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed , and we pull back as president of the united states , i will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military we will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force , not to be the world s policeman , but to make sure that in a peaceful world , people know that the united states is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies \( applause \) cavuto so i take it from that you do not agree with the president bush no and worse worse yet , to be honest with you , hillary clinton would be a national security disaster think about it she wants to continue down the path of iran , benghazi , the russian reset , doddfrank , all the things that have that have gone wrong in this country , she would be a national security mess and that is wrong and you know what \? here s the problem if she gets elected , she s under investigation with the fbi right now if she gets elected , her first 100 days , instead of setting an agenda , she might be going back and forth between the white house and the courthouse we need to stop that \( laughter \) \( applause \) cavuto senator rubio , the president says that isis does n't threaten our national existence like a germany or a japan back in world war ii , that the terror group is nothing more than twisted souls plotting attacks in their garages but house homeland security committee recently said that over 1 , 000 ongoing investigations of homegrown extremism in 50 states so how do you define the threat \? germany then or dangerous nut cases now \? rubio yeah , i would go , first of all , one step further in this description of hillary clinton she would n't just be a disaster , hillary clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the united states \( applause \) someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in benghazi can never be president of the united states ever \( applause \) on the issue of barack obama , barack obama does not believe that america is a great global power barack obama believes that america is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size and that s how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like iran and we betray our allies like israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for america he does n't understand the threat in isis he consistently underestimates it but i do not there is a war against isis , not just against isis but against radical jihadists terrorists , and it is a war that they win or we win when i'm president of the united states , we are going to win this war on isis the most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are , the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them and if we capture any of them alive , they are getting a oneway ticket to guantanamo bay , cuba , and we are going to find out everything they know \( applause \) cavuto thank you , senator bartiromo dr carson , the president says he does not want to treat isis as a foreign army , but isis is neither a country nor a government how do you attack a network that does not respect national borders \? carson well , i'm very happy to get a question this early on i was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came \( laughter \) you know , i find it really quite fascinating some of the president s proclamations the fact of the matter is he does n't realize that we now live in the 21st century , and that war is very different than it used to be before not armies massively marching on each other and air forces , but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid and , you know , we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously and we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid i mean , just think about a scenario like that they explode the bomb , we have an electromagnetic pulse they hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point \? he needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us but here s the real key we have the world s best military , even though he s done everything he can to diminish it and the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we do n't tie their hands behind their back , they can get it accomplished \( applause \) cavuto mr trump , at the state of the union , the president pointed to a guest who was a syrian refugee you might recall whose wife and daughter and other family members were killed in an air attack now he fled that country seeking asylum here , ultimately ended up in detroit where he s now trying to start a new life the president says that that doctor is the real face of these refugees and not the one that you and some of your colleagues on this stage are painting that you prefer the face of fear and terror and that you would refuse to let in anyone into this country seeking legitimate asylum how do you answer that \? trump it s not fear and terror , it s reality you just have to look today at indonesia , bombings all over \( applause \) you look at california , you look , frankly , at paris where there s a the strictest nogun policy of any city anywhere in the world , and you see what happens 130 people dead with many to follow they 're very , very badly wounded they will some will follow and you look around , and you see what s happening , and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor very nice , everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration that could be the great trojan horse it could be people that are going to do great , great destruction when i look at the migration , i looked at the line , i said it actually on your show recently , where are the women \? it looked like very few women very few children strong , powerful men , young and people are looking at that and they 're saying what s going on \? you look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married , they were radicalized they got married , they killed 15 people in actually 15 going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look a good strong look and that s what we have we are nineteen trillion dollars our country s a mess and we ca n't let all these people come into our country and break our borders we ca n't do it \( applause \) bartiromo senator cruz , the new york times is reporting that you failed to properly disclose a million dollars in loans from goldman sachs and citibank during your senate race , your campaign said , it was inadvertent a million dollars is inadvertent \? cruz well maria , thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the new york times you know the nice thing about the mainstream media , they do n't hide their views the new york times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying , anybody but cruz had that actually that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move , it follows that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people so you know the new york times and i do n't have exactly have the warmest of relationships now in terms of their really stunning hit piece , what they mentioned is when i was running for senate unlike hillary clinton , i do n't have masses of money in the bank , hundreds of millions of dollars when i was running for senate just about every lobbyist , just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars he put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife heidi and i , we ended up investing everything we owned we took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks and the entire new york times attack is that i disclosed that loan on one filing with the united states senate , that was a public filing but it was not on a second filing with fdic and yes , i made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other but if that s the best the new york times has got , they better go back to the well bartiromo thank you \( commercial break \) cavuto all right welcome back to the republican presidential debate , right here in north charleston , south carolina let s get right back to the questions and i 'll start with you , senator cruz now you are , of course , a strict constitutionalist no one would doubt that and as you know , the us constitution says only naturalborn citizens are eligible for the office of president of the united states stop me if you 've heard this before now , you were born \( laughter \) you were born in canada to an american mother so you were and are considered an american citizen but that fellow next to you , donald trump and others have said that being born in canada means you are not naturalborn , and that has raised questions about your eligibility do you want to try to close this topic once and for all tonight \? cruz well , neil , i'm glad we 're focusing on the important topics of the evening \( laughter \) \( applause \) you know , back in september , my friend donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way , and there was no issue there there was nothing to this birther issue \( laughter \) now , since september , the constitution has n't changed \( laughter \) but the poll numbers have \( applause \) and i recognize i recognize that donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in iowa but the facts and the law here are really quite clear under longstanding us law , the child of a us citizen born abroad is a naturalborn citizen if a soldier has a child abroad , that child is a naturalborn citizen that s why john mccain , even though he was born in panama , was eligible to run for president if an american missionary has a child abroad , that child is a naturalborn citizen that s why george romney , mitt s dad , was eligible to run for president , even though he was born in mexico at the end of the day , the legal issue is quite straightforward , but i would note that the birther theories that donald has been relying on some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on us soil , but have two parents born on us soil under that theory , not only would i be disqualified , marco rubio would be disqualified , bobby jindal would be disqualified and , interestingly enough , donald j trump would be disqualified \( applause \) \( unknown \) not me cruz because because donald s mother was born in scotland she was naturalized now , donald trump but i was born here cruz on the issue on the issue of citizenship , donald trump \( inaudible \) big difference cruz on the issue of citizenship , donald , i'm not going to use your mother s birth against you trump ok , good because it would n't work cruz you 're an american , as is everybody else on this stage , and i would suggest we focus on who s best prepared to be commander inchief , because that s the most important question facing the country \( applause \) cavuto mr trump \( crosstalk \) cavuto that you raised it because of his rising poll numbers trump first of all , let me just tell you something and you know , because you just saw the numbers yourself nbc wall street journal just came out with a poll headline trump way up , cruz going down i mean , so do n't so you ca n't you ca n't \( booing \) they do n't like the wall street journal they do n't like nbc , but i like the poll \( laughter \) and frankly , it just came out , and in iowa now , as you know , ted , in the last three polls , i'm beating you so you know , you should n't misrepresent how well you 're doing with the polls \( applause \) you do n't have to say that in fact , i was all for you until you started doing that , because that s a misrepresentation , number one number two , this is n't me saying it i do n't care i think i'm going to win fair and square \( inaudible \) to win this way thank you lawrence tribe and \( inaudible \) from harvard of harvard , said that there is a serious question as to whether or not ted can do this ok \? there are other attorneys that feel , and very , very fine constitutional attorneys , that feel that because he was not born on the land , he cannot run for office here s the problem we 're running we 're running he does great i win i choose him as my vice presidential candidate , and the democrats sue because we ca n't take him along for the ride i do n't like that ok \? \( laughter \) the fact is and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field , he beats the rest of the field \( inaudible \) see , they do n't like that they do n't like that \( audience booing \) no , they do n't like he beats the rest of the field , because they want me \( laughter \) but if for some reason , neil , he beats the rest of the field , i already know the democrats are going to be bringing a suit you have a big lawsuit over your head while you 're running and if you become the nominee , who the hell knows if you can even serve in office \? so you should go out , get a declaratory judgment , let the courts decide and you should n't have mentioned the polls because i would have been much \( crosstalk \) cavuto why are you saying this now right now \? why are you raising this issue now \? trump because now he s going a little bit better no , i did n't care \( inaudible \) it s true no , it s true hey look , he never had a chance now , he s doing better he s got probably a four or five percent chance \( laughter \) \( crosstalk \) cruz neil \( crosstalk \) trump the fact is , there is a big overhang there s a big question mark on your head and you ca n't do that to the party you really ca n't you ca n't do that to the party you have to have certainty even if it was a one percent chance , and it s far greater than one percent because \( inaudible \) i mean , you have great constitutional lawyers that say you ca n't run if there was a and you know i'm not bringing a suit i promise but the democrats are going to bring a lawsuit , and you have to have certainty you ca n't have a question i can agree with you or not , but you ca n't have a question over your head cavuto senator , do you want to respond \? cruz well , listen , i 've spent my entire life defending the constitution before the us supreme court and i 'll tell you , i'm not going to be taking legal advice from donald trump trump you do n't have to take it from lawrence tribe \( applause \) \( crosstalk \) trump take it from your professors \( crosstalk \) cruz the chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero and mr trump is very focused trump he s wrong he s wrong cruz on larry tribe let me tell you who larry tribe is he s a leftwing judicial activist , harvard law professor who was al gore s lawyer in bush versus gore he s a major hillary clinton supporter and there s a reason why hillary s supporters are echoing donald s attacks on me , because hillary trump he is not the only one cruz wants to face donald trump in the general election trump there are many lawyers cruz and i 'll tell you what , donald , you you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the vp slot \( laughter \) i 'll tell you what if this all works out , i'm happy to consider naming you as vp so if you happen to be right , you could get the top job at the end of the day trump no no \( laughter \) i think if it does n't \( applause \) i like that i like it i 'd consider it but i think i 'll go back to building buildings if it does n't work out cruz actually , i 'd love to get you to build a wall \( crosstalk \) trump i have a feeling it s going to work out , actually \( crosstalk \) rubio let me \( inaudible \) i was invoked in that question , so let me just say in that answer let me say , the real question here , i hate to interrupt this episode of court tv \( laughter \) but the real but i think we have to get back to what this election has to be about ok \? listen , we this is the greatest country in the history of mankind but in 2008 , we elected a president that did n't want to fix america he wants to change america we elected a president that does n't believe in the constitution he undermines it we elected a president that is weakening america on the global stage we elected a president that does n't believe in the free enterprise system this election has to be about reversing all of that damage that s why i'm running for office because when i become president of the united states , on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders when i'm president of the united states we are getting rid of obamacare and we are rebuilding our military and when i'm president , we 're not just going to have a president that gives a state of the union and says america is the greatest country in the world when i'm president , we 're going to have a president that acts like it bartiromo thank you , senator bartiromo mr trump , south carolina governor nikki haley in her response to the state of the union address \( applause \) baritromo appeared to choose sides within the party , saying republicans should resist , quote , the siren call of the angriest voices she confirmed , she was referring to you among others was she out of line \? and , how would a president trump unite the party \? trump okay first of all , nikki this afternoon said i'm a friend of hers actually a close friend and wherever you are sitting nikki , i'm a friend we 're friends that s good \( laughter \) but she did say there was anger and i could say , oh , i'm not angry i'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and i will gladly accept the mantle of anger our military is a disaster \( applause \) trump our healthcare is a horror show obamacare , we 're going to repeal it and replace it we have no borders our vets are being treated horribly illegal immigration is beyond belief our country is being run by incompetent people and yes , i am angry \( applause \) trump and i wo n't be angry when we fix it , but until we fix it , i'm very , very angry and i say that to nikki so when nikki said that , i was n't offended she said the truth one of your colleagues interviewed me and said , well , she said you were angry and i said to myself , huh , she s right i'm not fighting that i did n't find it offensive at all i'm angry because our country is a mess \( applause \) baritromo but what are you going to do about it \? cavuto marco rubio i'm sorry , it s the time constraints you and governor christie have been exchanging some fairly nasty words of late , and i will allow the governor to respond as well the governor went so far to say , you wo n't be able to slime your way to the white house he s referring to a series of ads done by a pac , speaking on your behalf , that say quote , one high tax , common core , liberal , energyloving , obamacare , medicaidexpanding president is enough you think you went too far on that and do you want to apologize to the governor \? rubio you know , as i said already twice in this debate , we have a very serious problem in this country \( applause \) rubio we have a president of the united states that is undermining this country s security and expanding the role of cavuto that is not my question rubio well , i am going to answer your question , neil he is this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government this president is undermining our military he is undermining our standing in the world i like chris christie , but we can not afford to have a president of the united states that supports common core \( applause \) rubio we can not afford to have a president of the united states that supports gun control this president , this president is more interested in funding less interested in funding the military , than he is in funding planned he s more interested in funding planned parenthood than he is in funding the military chris christie wrote a check to planned parenthood all i'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage barack obama has done to this country it can not be someone that agrees with his agenda because the damage he has done to america is extraordinary let me tell you , if we do n't get this election right , there may be no turning back for america we 're on the verge of being the first generation of americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves so i just truly , with all my heart belief , i like everybody on the stage no one is a socialist no one here is under fbi investigation so we have a good group of people cavuto is he a liberal \? rubio our next president cavuto is he a liberal \? rubio unfortunately , governor christie has endorsed many of the ideas that barack obama supports , whether it is common core or gun control or the appointment of sonia sotomayor or the donation he made to planned parenthood our next president , and our republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions cavuto governor \? \( applause \) christie i stood on the stage and watched marco in rather indignantly , look at governor bush and say , someone told you that because we 're running for the same office , that criticizing me will get you to that office it appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old marco s ear too \( laughter \) so the indignation that you carry on , some of the stuff , you have to also own then so let s set the facts straight first of all , i did n't support sonia sotomayor secondly , i never wrote a check to planned parenthood third , if you look at my record as governor of new jersey , i have vetoed a 50caliber rifle ban i have vetoed a reduction this clip size i vetoed a statewide id system for gun owners and i pardoned , six outofstate folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges and on common core , common core has been eliminated in new jersey so listen , this is the difference between being a governor and a senator see when you 're a senator , what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk and you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you 're saying is accurate or not when you 're a governor , you 're held accountable for everything you do and the people of new jersey , i 've seen it \( applause \) and the last piece is this i like marco too , and two years ago , he called me a conservative reformer that new jersey needed that was before he was running against me now that he is , he s changed his tune i'm never going to change my tune i like marco rubio he s a good guy , a smart guy , and he would be a heck of a lot better president than hillary rodham clinton would ever be \( applause \) bush neil , my name was mentioned here neil , my name was mentioned as well here s the deal , chris is totally right he s been a good governor , and he s a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted new jersey everybody on this stage is better than hillary clinton and i think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process , as wild and woolly as it s going to be this is not being bad these attack ads are going to be part of life everybody just needs to get used to it everybody s record s going to be scrutinized , and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat hillary clinton , because she is a disaster \( applause \) our country rise up again , but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the american people in a way that does n't disparage people , that unites us around our common purpose and so everybody needs to discount some of the things you 're going to hear in these ads , and discount the the backandforth here , because every person here is better than hillary clinton carson neil , i was mentioned too cavuto you were \? carson yeah , he said everybody \( laughter \) and and i just want to take this opportunity to say , you know , in the 2012 election , you know , we and when i say we , republicans tore themselves apart you know , we have to stop this because , you know , if we manage to damage ourselves , and we lose the next election , and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three supreme court picks , this nation is over as we know it and we got to look at the big picture here bartiromo governor kasich \( applause \) governor kasich , hillary clinton is getting some serious competition from senator bernie sanders he s now at 41 percent in the latest cbs new york times poll vice president biden sang his praises , saying bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real , and he has credibility on it so what does it say about our country that a candidate who is a selfavowed socialist and who does n't think a 90 percent tax rate is too high could be the democratic nominee \? kasich well , if that s the case , we 're going to win every state , if bernie sanders is the nominee that s not even an issue but look \( applause \) and i know bernie , and i can promise you he s not going to be president of the united states so here s this the situation , i think , maria and this is what we have to i i 've got to tell you , when wages do n't rise and they have n't for a lot of families for a number of years it s very , very difficult for them part of the reason why it has n't risen because sometimes we 're not giving people the skills they need sometimes it s because the federal reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind people are upset about it i 'll tell you what else they 're upset about you 're 50 or 51 years old , and some kid walks in and tells you you 're out of work , and you do n't know where to go and where to turn do we have answer for that \? we do there are ways to retrain the 50 and 51yearolds , because they 've got great value i 'll tell you what else people are concerned about their kids come out of college , they have high debt and they ca n't get a good job we got to do a lot about the high cost of high higher education , but we 've got to make sure we 're training people for jobs that exist , that are good jobs that can pay \( applause \) let me tell you that , in this country in this country , people are concerned about their economic future they 're very concerned about it and they wonder whether somebody is getting something to keeping them from getting it that s not the america that i 've ever known my father used to say , johnny , we never we do n't hate the rich we just want to be the rich and we just got to make sure that every american has the tools , in kthrough12 and in vocational education , in higher education and we got to fight like crazy so people can think the american dream still exists , because it does , with rising wages , with full employment and with everybody in america and i mean everybody in america having an opportunity to realize the american dream of having a better life than their mother and their father i'm president look , i 've done it once i 've done it once in washington , with great jobs and lower taxes the economy was really booming and now in ohio , with the same formula , wages higher than the than the national average a growth of 385 , 000 jobs \( bell rings \) it s not that hard just know where you want to go , stick to your guts get it done , because our our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done and , folks , we will you count on it bartiromo dr carson , one of the other candidates on this stage has brought bill clinton s past indiscretions is that a legitimate topic in this election \? and what do you think of the notion that hillary clinton is an enabler of sexual misconduct \? carson well , there s not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they 're married to somebody who s running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means but you know , here s the real issue , is this america anymore \? do we still have standards \? do we still have values and principles \? you know , you look at what s going on , you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society you know , we have a war on virtual everything race wars , gender wars , income wars , religious wars , age wars every war you can imaging , we have people at each other s throat and our strength is actually in our unity you know , you go to the internet , you start reading an article and you go to the comments section you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names where did that spirit come from in america \? it did not come from our judeochristian roots , i can tell you that and wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong and let s not let the secular progressives drive that out of us the majority of people in american actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made america great they 've been beaten into submission it s time for us to stand up for what we believe in \( applause \) cavuto well , we are not done coming up , one of the top things people are talking about on facebook , guns and you can join us live us on this stage in the conversation during this commercial break right from home you can go to facebookcom \( inaudible \) we will be streaming live and talking about how we think the debate is going so far we 're back in a moment in charleston , south carolina \( commercial break \) \( applause \) bartiromo welcome back to the republican presidential debates , right here in north charleston let s get right back to the questions governor bush , gun rights , one of the top issues seen on facebook with close to 3 million people talking about it in the past month right here in charleston , dylann roof , who has been accused of killing nine people in a nearby church , reportedly had not passed his background check when he got his gun what is the harm in tightening standards for not only who buys guns , but those who sell them \? bush first of all , i 'd like to recognize governor haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the \( applause \) bush the emanuel ame church killings and i also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of god and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed \( applause \) bush i do n't know if any of us could have done what they did , one after another , within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place look , here s the deal , in this particular case , the fbi made a mistake the law itself requires a background check , but that did n't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do we do n't need to add new rules , we need to make sure the fbi does its job because that person should not have gotten a gun , should not would not have passed a background check the first impulse of barack obama and hillary clinton is to take rights away from law abiding citizens that s what they do , whether it s the san bernardino attack or if it s these tragedies that take place , i think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is it is n't lawabiding gun owners look , i have an a plus rating in the nra and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in florida , if you commit a crime with a gun , you 're going away you 're going away for a long , long while and that s what we should focus on is the violence in our communities target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns , and if you do that , and get it right , you 're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there s a big divide the other issue is mental health that s a serious issue that we could work on republicans and democrats alike believe this \( applause \) bush the president s first impulse is do this by executive order , power he does n't have why not go to congress and in a bipartisan way , begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges do n't have access to guns \( applause \) bartiromo thank you , sir mr trump , are there any circumstances that you think we should be limiting gun sales of any kind in america \? trump no i am a 2nd amendment person if we had guns in california on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction , you would n't have 14 or 15 people dead right now if even in paris , if they had guns on the other side , going in the opposite direction , you would n't have 130 people plus dead so the answer is no and what jeb said is absolutely correct we have a huge mental health problem in this country we 're closing hospitals , we 're closing wards , we 're closing so many because the states want to save money we have to get back into looking at what s causing it the guns do n't pull the trigger it s the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on \( applause \) trump we have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what barack obama was doing with the executive order he does n't want to get people together , the oldfashioned way , where you get congress you get the congress , you get the senate , you get together , you do legislation he just writes out an executive order not supposed to happen that way \( applause \) bartiromo thank you sir xxx where you get congress trump you get the congress you get the senate you get together you do legislation he just writes out an order , executive order it s not supposed to happen that way \( applause \) bartiromo thank you , sir \( applause \) cavuto senator rubio , you said that president obama wants to take people s guns away yet under his presidency , gun sales have more than doubled that does n't sound like a white house unfriendly to gun owners rubio that sounds like people are afraid the president s going to take their guns away \( applause \) look , the second amendment is not an option it is not a suggestion it is a constitutional right of every american to be able to protect themselves and their families i am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in america , he would i am convinced that this president , if he could get rid of the second amendment , he would i am convinced because i see how he works with his attorney general , not to defend the second amendment , but to figure out ways to undermine it i have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the second amendment , but to figure out ways to undermine it here s my second problem none of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he s doing these things would have been preventive you know why \? because criminals do n't buy their guns from a gun show they do n't buy their guns from a collector and they do n't buy their guns from a gun store they get they steal them they get them on the black market and let me tell you , isis and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show these \( laughter \) \( applause \) his answer you name it if there s an act of violence in america , his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control here s a fact we are in a war against isis they are trying to attack us here in america they attacked us in philadelphia last week they attacked us in san bernardino two weeks ago and the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun when i'm president of the united states , we are defending the second amendment , not undermining it the way barack obama does \( applause \) cavuto but what fact can you point to , senator what fact can you point to that the president would take away everyone s gun \? you do n't think that s \( inaudible \) \? rubio about every two weeks , he holds a press conference talking about how he ca n't wait to restrict people s access to guns he has never defended \( crosstalk \) rubio i 'll give you a fact well , let me tell you this do you remember when he ran for president of the united states , and he was a candidate , and he went and said , these americans with traditional values , they are bitter people , and they cling to their guns and to their religion that tells you right away where he was headed on all of this this president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the second amendment \( applause \) he does n't meet here s the difference when he meets with the attorney general in the white house , it s not how can we protect the second amendment rights of americans it s give me options on how i can make it harder for lawabiding people to buy guns that will never happen when i am president of the united states \( applause \) cavuto governor christie , you , too , have criticized the president s recent executive action on gun control , saying it s unconstitutional , another step to bypass congress but has n't your own position on guns evolved , sir \? the new jersey starledger reports that you signed several laws to regulate the possession of firearms , and that you argued back in august 2013 , and i quote , these common sense measures will strengthen new jersey s already tough gun laws so is n't that kind of what the president wants to do now \? christie no , absolutely not the president wants to do things without working with his congress , without working with the legislature , and without getting the consent of the american people and the fact is that that s not a democracy that s a dictatorship and we need to very , very concerned about that see , here s the thing i do n't think the founders put the second amendment as number two by accident i do n't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat i think they made the second amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important the fact is in new jersey , what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit we have made it easier to do that , not harder and the way we 've done it properly through regulatory action , not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders this guy is a petulant child that s what he is i mean , you know \( applause \) the fact is , neil , let s think about let s think about and i want to maybe i hope the president is watching tonight , because here s what i 'd like to tell him mr president , we 're not against you we 're against your policies when you became president , you had a democratic congress and a filibusterproof democratic senate you had only 21 republican governors in this country and now after seven years of your policies , we have the biggest majority we 've had since the 1920s in the house a republican majority in the senate and 31 out of 50 republican governors the american people have rejected your agenda and now you 're trying to go around it that s not right it s not constitutional and we are going to kick your rear end out of the white house come this fall \( applause \) bartiromo so what is the answer , senator cruz , to stop mass shootings and violent crime , up in 30 cities across the country \? cruz the answer is simple your prosecute criminals you target the bad guys you know , a minute ago , neil asked what has president obama do done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns \? well , he appointed eric holder as attorney general eric holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the american people against guns he appointed sonia sotomayor to the supreme court , someone who has been a radical against the second amendment right to keep and bear arms he launched fast and furious , illegally selling guns to mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials and i 'll tell you what hillary clinton has said hillary clinton says she agrees with the dissenters the supreme court dissenters in the heller case there were four dissenters , and they said that they believe the second amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever , which means , if their view prevailed and the next president s going to get one , two , three , maybe four supreme court justices , the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the second amendment and the government could confiscate your guns and i 'll note that california senator democratic senator dianne feinstein said , if she could say to mr america and mrs america , give me your guns , i'm rounding them up , she would and let me make a final point on this listen , in any republican primary , everyone is going to say they support the second amendment unless you are clinically insane \( laughter \) that s what you say in a primary but the voters are savvier than that they recognize that people s actions do n't always match their words i 've got a proven record fighting to defend the second amendment there s a reason gun owners of america has endorsed me in this race there s a reason the nra gave me their carter knight freedom fund award \( bell rings \) and there s a reason , when barack obama and chuck schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms , that i led the opposition , along with millions of americans we defeated that gun control legislation and i would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight bartiromo senator \( applause \) let me follow up and switch gears senator cruz , you suggested mr trump , quote , embodies new york values could you explain what you mean by that \? cruz you know , i think most people know exactly what new york values are \( laughter \) bartiromo i am from new york i do n't cruz what what you 're from new york \? so you might not \( laughter \) but i promise you , in the state of south carolina , they do \( applause \) and listen , there are many , many wonderful , wonderful working men and women in the state of new york but everyone understands that the values in new york city are socially liberal or proabortion or pro gaymarriage , focus around money and the media and and i would note indeed , the reason i said that is i was asked my friend donald has taken to it as \( ph \) advance playing bruce springsteen s born in the usa , and i was asked what i thought of that and i said , well , if he wanted to play a song , maybe he could play , new york , new york' \? and and you know , the concept of new york values is not that complicated to figure out not too many years ago , donald did a long interview with tim russert and in that interview , he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very , very different from the views he s describing now and his explanation he said , look , i'm from new york , that s what we believe in new york those are n't iowa values , but this is what we believe in new york and so that was his explanation and and i guess i can can frame it another way not a lot of conservatives come out of manhattan i'm just saying \( laughter \) bartiromo are you sure about that \? cavuto maria trump so conservatives actually do come out of manhattan , including william f buckley and others , just so you understand \( applause \) and just so if i could , because he insulted a lot of people i 've had more calls on that statement that ted made new york is a great place it s got great people , it s got loving people , wonderful people when the world trade center came down , i saw something that no place on earth could have handled more beautifully , more humanely than new york you had two one hundred \( applause \) you had two 110story buildings come crashing down i saw them come down thousands of people killed , and the cleanup started the next day , and it was the most horrific cleanup , probably in the history of doing this , and in construction i was down there , and i 've never seen anything like it and the people in new york fought and fought and fought , and we saw more death , and even the smell of death nobody understood it and it was with us for months , the smell , the air and we rebuilt downtown manhattan , and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved new york and loved new yorkers and i have to tell you , that was a very insulting statement that ted made \( applause \) cavuto governor bush , for the third time in as many months , the iranians have provoked us , detaining us , as we 've been discussing , with these 10 navy sailors tehran had said strayed into their waters the sailors were released , but only after shown on video apologizing for the incident this occurring only weeks after iran fired multiple rockets within 1 , 500 yards of a us aircraft carrier and then continued to test medium range missiles now you 've claimed that such actions indicate tehran has little to fear from a president obama i wonder , sir , what would change if they continued doing this sort of thing under a president jeb bush \? bush well , first of all , under president jeb bush , we would restore the strength of the military last week , secretary carter announced that the navy s going to be cut again it s now half the size of what it was prior to operation desert storm the deployments are too high for the military personnel we do n't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment the b52 is still operational as the long range bomber it was inaugurated in the age of harry truman the planes are older than the pilots we 're gutting our military , and so the iranians and the chinese and the russians and many other countries look at the united states not as serious as we once were we have to eliminate the sequester , rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we 're back in the game secondly , as it relates to iran , we need to confront their ambitions across the board we should reimpose sanctions , they 've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing mediumrange missiles thirdly , we need to move our embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem to send a serious signal that we 're back in the game with israel \( applause \) and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority we need to get back in the game as it relates to our arab nations the rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak this president and john kerry and hillary clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act , but he must act to confront the ambitions of iran we can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country \( applause \) cavuto thank you , governor governor kasich , while everyone has been focusing on iran s provocations , i'm wondering what you make of what saudi arabia has been doing and its recent moves in the region , including its execution of a wellknown shi'ite cleric and its move to dramatically increase oil production , some say in an effort to drive down oil prices and force a lot of us oil producers out of business sure enough , oil prices have tumbled one brokerage house is predicting a third or more of american oil producers and those heavily invested in fracking will go bankrupt , and soon saudi arabia and opec will be back in the driver s seat us energy player harold hamrie similarly told me with friends like these , who needs enemies \? do you agree \? kasich well , let me let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience i served on the defense committee for 18 years , and by the way , one of the members of that committee was senator strom thurmond from south carolina let em also tell you \( applause \) that after the 9 11 attacks , secretary rumsfeld invited me to the pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of defense and in that meeting , i suggested we had a problem with technology , and that i wanted to take people from silicon valley into the pentagon to solve our most significant problems so i not only had the opportunity to go through the cold war struggles in central america , and even after 9 11 to be involved with saudi arabia and oil production , first of all , it s so critical for us to be energy independent , and we 're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because , see , energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility , and secondly , if you want to bring jobs back to the united states of america in industry , low prices make the difference we 're seeing it in my state and we 'll see it in this country and that s why we must make sure we continue to frack in terms of saudi arabia , look , my biggest problem with them is they 're funding radical clerics through their madrasses that is a bad deal and an evil situation , and presidents have looked the other way and i was going to tell you , whether i'm president or not , we better make it clear to the saudis that we 're going to support you , we 're in relation with you just like we were in the first gulf war , but you 've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them \( applause \) so look , in foreign policy in foreign policy , it s strength , but you 've got to be cool you 've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go and i'm going to tell you , that it i'm going to suggest to you here tonight , that you ca n't do on the job training i 've seen so much of it a soviet union , the coming down of a wall , the issues that we saw around the world in central america , the potential spread of communism , and 9 11 and gulf war you see what the saudi s deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they 're going right with us and they must be part of our coalition to destroy isis and i believe we can get that done thank you cavuto thank you john bartiromo there s much more ahead including the fight against isis more from charleston , south carolina when we come right back \( commercial break \) bartiromo we welcome back to the republican presidential debate , right back to the questions candidates , the man who made fighting isis the cornerstone of his campaign , south carolina senator , lindsey graham is out the race but he joins us tonight in the audience \( applause \) he says , the airstrike now in their 16th month have been ineffective dr carson carson wait a minute , who in their 16th month \? bartiromo the airstrikes carson ok bartiromo now in their 16th month are ineffective dr carson , do you think senator graham is right in wanting to send 20 , 000 troops ground troops to iraq and syria to take out isis \? carson well , there s no question that isis is a very serious problem , and i do n't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is i think we need to do a lot more than we 're doing recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission , so we need to take that away from them the way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them , what do you need in order to accomplish this goal \? our decision is , then , do we give them what we need i say , yes , not only do we give them what they need , but we do n't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done in addition to that \( applause \) in addition to that , we go ahead and we take the oil from them , their source of revenue you know , some of these these engagement rules that the administration has we 're not going to bomb a tanker that s coming out of there because there might be a person in it give me a break just tell them that , you put people in there , we 're going to bomb them so do n't put people in there if you do n't want them bombed you know , that s so simple \( applause \) and then we need to shut down we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their commandandcontrol centers why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars , sitting in their comfortable chairs in raqqa \? we know \( ph \) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes , and send in our special ops at 2 00 am and attack them everywhere they go they should be running all the time , then they wo n't have time to plan attacks against us \( applause \) bartiromo thank you , sir senator graham has also said that the us will find arab support for its coalition if it removes syrian president bashar alassad and i quote , the now king of saudi arabia told us , you can have our army , you just got to deal with assad' the emir of qatar said , i 'll pay for the operation , but they are not going to fight isis and let damascus fall into the hands of the iranians assad has to go' governor christie , how important is it to remove assad from power and how would you do it \? christie maria , you look at what this president and his secretary of state , secretary of state clinton , has done to get us in this spot you think about it this is the president who said , along with his secretary of state drew a red line in syria , said , if assad uses chemical weapons against his people , that we 're going to attack he used chemical weapons , he s killed , now , over a quarter of a million of his own people , and this president has done nothing in fact , he s done worse than nothing this president and , by the way , secretary clinton , who called assad a reformer she called assad a reformer now , the fact is , what this president has done is invited russia to play an even bigger role , bring in vladimir putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from assad , yet what do we have today \? we have the russians and the iranians working together , not to fight isis , but to prop up assad the fact of the matter is we 're not going to have peace we are not going to have peace in syria we 're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a nofly zone there , make it safe for those folks so we do n't have to be talking about syrian refugees anymore the syrians should stay in syria they should n't be going to europe and here s the last piece \( applause \) you 're not going to have peace in syria with assad in charge you 're simply not and so senator graham is right about this and if we want to try to rebuild the coalition , as governor kasich was saying before , then what we better do is to get to the arab countries that believe that isis is a threat , not only to them , but to us and to world peace , and bring them together and believe me , assad is not worth it and if you 're going to leave this to hillary clinton , the person who gave us this foreign policy , the architect of it , and you 're going to give her another four years , that s why i'm speaking out as strongly as i am about that hillary clinton cannot be president it will lead to even greater war in this world and remember this , after hillary clinton and barack obama have had nearly 8 years , we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started that makes the world less peaceful , less safe in my administration , we will help to make sure we bring people together in the middle east , and we will fight isis and defeat them bartiromo thank you , sir \( applause \) mr trump mr trump , your comments about banning muslims from entering the country created a firestorm according to facebook , it was the mosttalkedabout moment online of your entire campaign , with more than 10 million people talking about the issue is there anything you 've heard that makes you want to rethink this position \? trump no \( laughter \) no \( applause \) look , we have to stop with political correctness we have to get down to creating a country that s not going to have the kind of problems that we 've had with people flying planes into the world trade centers , with the with the shootings in california , with all the problems all over the world i just left indonesia bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb we have to find out what s going on i said temporarily i did n't say permanently i said temporarily and i have many great muslim friends and some of them , i will say , not all , have called me and said , donald , thank you very much you 're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it and unlike president obama , where he refuses even to use the term of what s going on , he ca n't use the term for whatever reason and if you ca n't use the term , you 're never going to solve the problem my muslim friends , some , said , thank you very much we 'll get to the bottom of it but we have a serious problem and we ca n't be the stupid country any more we 're laughed at all over the world \( applause \) bush donald , donald can i i hope you reconsider this , because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out isis the kurds are our strongest allies they 're muslim you 're not going to even allow them to come to our country \? the other arab countries have a role to play in this we cannot be the world s policeman we ca n't do this unilaterally we have to do this in unison with the arab world and sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out isis and restoring democracy in syria \( applause \) so i hope you 'll reconsider i hope you 'll reconsider the better way of dealing with this the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in , you know , the islamic terrorists inside , embedded in refugee populations what we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from europe , it s harder if they 've been traveling to syria or traveling to these other places where there is islamic terrorism , make it harder make the screening take place we do n't have to have refugees come to our country , but all muslims , seriously \? what kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the united states is a serious player in creating peace and security \? cavuto but you said you said that he made those comments and they represented him being unhinged after he made them bush yeah , they are unhinged cavuto well well , after he made them \( applause \) his poll numbers went up eight points in south carolina now now , wait trump eleven points , to be exact cavuto are you are you saying are you saying that all those people who agree with mr trump are unhinged \? bush no , not at all , absolutely not i can see why people are angry and scared , because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically i totally get that but we 're running for the presidency of the united states here this is n't this is n't , you know , a different kind of job you have to lead you cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though , well , it s just politics every time we send signals like this , we send a signal of weakness , not strength and so it was \( inaudible \) his statement , which is why i'm asking him to consider changing his views \( applause \) trump i want security for this country ok \? \( applause \) i want security i'm tired of seeing what s going on , between the border where the people flow over people come in they live they shoot i want security for this country we have a serious problem with , as you know , with radical islam we have a tremendous problem it s not only a problem here it s a problem all over the world i want to find out why those two young people those two horrible young people in california when they shot the 14 people , killed them people they knew , people that held the wedding reception for them i want to find out many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment why were n't they vigilant \? why did n't they call \? why did n't they call the police \? and by the way , the police are the most mistreated people in this country i will tell you that \( applause \) the most mistreated people in fact , we need to wait a minute we need vigilance we have to find out many people knew about what was going on why did n't they turn those two people in so that you would n't have had all the death \? there s something going on and it s bad and i'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it that s all i'm saying we need security bartiromo we we want to hear from all of you on this according to pew research , the us admits more than 100 , 000 muslim immigrants every single year on a permanent lifetime basis i want to ask the rest of you to comment on this do you agree that we should pause muslim immigration until we get a better handle on our homeland security situation , as mr trump has said \? beginning with you , governor kasich kasich i i 've been for pausing on admitting the syrian refugees and the reasons why i 've done is i do n't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them but you know , we do n't want to put everybody in the same category and i 'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago if we 're going to have a coalition , we 're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world , our european allies , but we need the saudis , we need the egyptians , we need the jordanians , we need the gulf states we need jordan we need all of them to be part of exactly what the first george bush put together in the first gulf war \( bell rings \) it was a coalition made up of arabs and americans and westerners and we 're going to need it again and if we try to put everybody in the same call everybody the same thing , we ca n't do it and that s just not acceptable but i think a pause on syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it , and also , of course , for me as the governor of ohio bartiromo thank you , sir , we want to hear from the rest of you , governor christie , your take christie now maria , listen i said right from the beginning that we should take no syrian refugees of any kind and the reason i said that is because the fbi director told the american people , told congress , that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe that s the end of the conversation i can tell you , after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor , right after 9 11 , dealing with this issue here s the way you need to deal with it you ca n't just ban all muslims you have to ban radical islamic jihadists you have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us the only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep america safe \( bell rings \) and this summer , we did n't do that we took it away from the nsa , it was a bad decision by the president bad by those in the senate who voted for it and if i'm president , we 'll make our intelligence community strong , and wo n't have to keep everybody out , we 're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they do n't harm us bartiromo senator rubio , where do you stand \? rubio well , first of all , let s understand why we are even having this debate and why donald tapped in to some of that anger that s out there about this whole issue because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of isis if you listen to the state of the union the other night , he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck they are much more than that this is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them , sells them as brides this is a group of people that burns people in cages , that is conducting genocide against christians and yazidis and others in the region this is not some small scale group they are radicalizing people in the united states , they are conducting attacks around the world so you know what needs to happen , it s a very simple equation , and it s going to happen when i'm president if we do not know who you are , and we do not know why you are coming when i am president , you are not getting into the united states of america \( applause \) bartiromo senator cruz , where do you stand \? senator cruz \? cruz you know i understand why donald made the comments he did and i understand why americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse , who acts as an apologist for radical islamic terrorism i think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical islamic terrorism what should we do \? first , we should pass the expatriate terrorist act , legislation i 've introduced that says if an american goes and joins isis and wages jihad against america , that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport \( applause \) cruz and secondly , we should pass the legislation that i 've introduced \( bell rings \) that suspends all refugees from nations that isis or al qaida controls significant territory just last week , we see saw two iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work , that were arrested for being alleged isis terrorists if i'm elected president , we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by isis or al qaida when it comes to isis , we will not weaken them , we will not degrade them , we will utterly and completely destroy isis \( applause \) bartiromo dr carson , where do you stand \? do you agree with mr trump \? carson well , first of all , recognize it is a substantial problem but like all of our problems , there is n't a single one that ca n't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics and clearly , what we need to do is get a group of experts together , including people from other countries , some of our friends from israel , who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration , and for visas , for people who are coming into this country that is the thing that obviously makes sense , we can do that and as far as the syrians are concerned , alhasakah province , perfect place they have infrastructure all we need to do is protect them , they will be in their own country and that is what they told me when i was in jordan in november let s listen to them and let s not listen to our politicians bartiromo so , to be clear , the both of you do not agree with mr trump \? bush so , are we going to ban muslims from india , from indonesia , from countries that are strong allies that we need to build better relationships with \? of course not what we need to do is destroy isis i laid out a plan at the citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a no fly zone and safe zones to make sure refugees are there we need to lead a force , a sunni led force inside of syria we need to embed with with the iraqi military we need to arm the kurds the directly we need to reestablish the relationships with the sunnis we need the lawyers \( ph \) off the back of the war fighters that s how you solve the problem you do n't solve it by big talk where you 're banning all muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful bartiromo thank you governor cavuto mr trump , sometimes maybe in the heat of the campaign , you say things and you have to dial them back last week , the new york times editorial board quoted as saying that you would oppose , up to 45 percent tariff on chinese goods trump that s wrong they were wrong it s the new york times , they are always wrong cavuto well trump they were wrong cavuto you never said because they provided that trump no , i said , i would use they were asking me what to do about north korea china , they do n't like to tell us but they have total control just about , of north korea they can solve the problem of north korea if they wanted to but they taunt us they say , well , we do n't really have control without china , north korea does n't even eat china is ripping us on trade they 're devaluing their currency and they 're killing our companies thousands of thousands you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we 've lost 50 , 000 because of china \( crosstalk \) cavuto so they 've never said to put a tariff on their trump we 've lost anywhere between four and seven million jobs because of china what i said then was , we have very unfair trade with china we 're going to have a trade deficit of 505 billion dollars this year with china a lot of that is because they devalue their currency what i said to the new york times , is that , we have great power , economic power over china and if we wanted to use that and the amount where the 45 percent comes in , that would be the amount they saw their devaluations that we should get that we should get what i'm saying is this , i'm saying that we do it but if they do n't start treating us fairly and stop devaluing and let their currency rise so that our companies can compete and we do n't lose all of these millions of jobs that we 're losing , i would certainly start taxing goods that come in from china who the hell has to lose 505 billion dollars a year \? cavuto i'm sorry , you lost me trump it s not that complicated actually cavuto then i apologize then i want to understand , if you do n't want a 45 percent tariff , say that was n't the figure , would you be open are you open to slapping a higher tariff on chinese goods of any sort to go back at them \? trump ok , just so you understand i know so much about trading about with china carl icahn today as you know endorsed many businessmen want to endorse me cavuto i know trump carl said , no , no but he s somebody these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the china people that we have who are political hacks who do n't know what they 're doing and we have problems like this if these are the kinds of people we should use our best and our finest now , on that tariff here s what i'm saying , china they send their goods and we do n't tax it they do whatever they want to do they do whatever what they do , ok when we do business with china , they tax us you do n't know it , they tax us i have many friends that deal with china they ca n't when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed if you looking at what happened with boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal so we do n't have an equal playing field i'm saying , absolutely , we do n't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with china i'm a free trader i believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate i have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine i sell tens' of millions of \( inaudible \) i love china i love the chinese people but they laugh themselves , they ca n't believe how stupid the american leadership is cavuto so you 're open to a tariff \? trump i'm totally open to a tariff if they do n't treat us fairly , hey , their whole trade is tariffed you ca n't deal in china without tariffs they do it to us , we do n't it it s not fair trade kasich neil , neil can i say one thing about this i'm a free trader i support nafta i believe in the ptt because it s important those countries in asia are interfacing against china and we do need china donald s right about north korea i mean the fact is , is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of north korea so they do n't proliferate all these dangerous materials but what he s touching talking about , i think has got merit and i 'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he s saying here trump i'm happy to have him tonight \( laughter \) kasich for too long no , for too long , what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people s jobs , and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us and guess what \? the worker s out of a job so when they be found against that country that s selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them , then what do we tell the worker \? oh , well , you know , it just did n't work out for you i think we should be for free trade but i think fair trade and when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country , we need we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy and i want to just suggest to you how do i know this \? because so many people in my family worked in steel mills , and they did n't work with a white collar , they worked in a blue collar and the fact is those jobs are critical , they 're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they 're americans and they carry the load so let s demand open trade but fair trade in this country that s what i think we need to do \( applause \) cavuto all right rubio but on this point , if i may add something on this point we are all frustrated with what china is doing i think we need to be very careful with tariffs , and here s why china does n't pay the tariff , the buyer pays the tariff if you send a tie or a shirt made in china into the united states and an american goes to buy it at the store and there s a tariff on it , it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer so i think the better approach , the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against china economically is to make our economy stronger , which means reversing course from all the damage barack obama is doing to this economy it begins with tax reform let s not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world let s allow companies to immediately expense \( applause \) it continues with regulatory reform regulations in this country are out of control , especially the employment prevention agency , the epa , and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us how about obamacare , a certified job killer \? it needs to be repealed and replaced and we need to bring our debt under control , make our economy stronger that is the way to deal with china at the end of the day trump neil , the problem bartiromo we 're getting trump with what marco is saying is that it takes too long , they 're sucking us dry and it takes too long it would just you absolutely have to get involved with china , they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money we just ca n't do it any longer cavuto he is right if you put a tariff on a good , it s americans who pay bush absolutely trump you looking at me \? bush yeah bartiromo prices go higher for trump can i tell you what \? it will never happen because they 'll let their currency go up they 're never going to let it happen japan , the same thing they are devaluing it s so impossible for you look at caterpillar tractor and what s happening with caterpillar and kamatsu \( ph \) kamatsu \( ph \) is a tractor company in japan friends of mine are ordering kamatsu \( ph \) tractors now because they 've devalued the yen to such an extent that you ca n't buy a caterpillar tractor and we 're letting them get away with it and we ca n't let them get away with it and that s why we have to use carl \( ph \) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys \( applause \) bush here s apart from the apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck , apart from that , there will be retaliation bartiromo yeah bush so they soybean sales from iowa , entire soybean production goes the equivalent of it goes to china or how about boeing right here within a mile \? do you think that the chinese , if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports would n't retaliate and start buying airbus \? of course , they would this would be devastating for the economy we need someone with a steady hand being president of the united states bartiromo real quick , senator go ahead , senator cruz \( applause \) and then we have to get to tax reform trump and we do n't need a weak person being president of the united state , ok \? because that s what we 'd get if it were jeb i tell you what , we do n't need that audience boo trump we do n't need that that s essentially what we have now , and we do n't need that and that s why we 're in the trouble that we 're in now and by the way , jeb you mentioned boeing , take a look they order planes , they make boeing build their plant in china they do n't want them made here they want those planes made in china bush they 're a mile away from here trump that s not the way the game is supposed to be played bartiromo thank you , governor bush thank you , mr trump very briefly bush my name was mentioned my name was mentioned here the simple fact is that the plane that s being build here is being sold to china you can if you you flew in with your 767 , did n't you \? right there , right next to the plant trump no , the new planes i'm not talking about now , i'm talking about in the future they 're building massive plants in china because china does not want boeing building their planes here , they want them built in china , because china happens to be smart the way they do it , not the way we do it bartiromo thank you , mr trump bush when you head back to airport tonight , go check and see what the bartiromo thank you , mr trmup thank you , governor trump i 'll check for you bush check it out \( laughter \) bartiromo senator briefly cruz thanks for coming back to me , maria both donald and jeb have good points , and there is a middle ground donald is right that china is running over president obama like he is a child , president obama is not protecting american workers and we are getting hammered you know , i sat down with the senior leadership of john deere they discussed how how hard it is to sell tractors in china , because all the regulatory barriers they 're protectionist but jeb is also right that , if we just impose a tariff , they 'll put reciprocal tariffs , which will hurt iowa farmers and south carolina producers and 20 percent of the american jobs that depend on exports so the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan i 've introduced a simple flat tax , 10 percent for individuals , and a 16 percent business flat tax , you abolish the irs \( applause \) and here s the critical point , maria the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax , the death tax , the obamacare taxes , the payroll taxes , and they 're borderadjustable , so every export pays no taxes whatsoever it s taxfree a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax it s like a tariff , but here s the difference if we impose a tariff , china responds the business flat tax , they already impose their taxes on us , so there s no reciprocal \( bell rings \) tariffs that come against us it puts us on a level , even playing field , which brings jobs here at home \( unknown \) maria cruz and as president , i'm going to fight for the working men and women \( crosstalk \) bartiromo we 've got to get to tax reform , gentlemen we 've got to get to tax reform , and we 've got to get to the \( unknown \) yeah , but i want to talk about taxes bartiromo we 've got to get to the national debt as well coming up next , the growing national debt , the war on crime , tax reform more from north charleston , south carolina , when we come right back \( commercial break \) bartiromo welcome back to the republican presidential debate here in north charleston right back to the questions \( applause \) governor christie , we have spoken much about cutting spending , given the 19 trillion debt but according to one report , america needs 36 trillion in infrastructure spending by 2020 here in south carolina , 11 percent of bridges are considered structurally deficient , costing drivers a billion dollars a year in auto repairs what is your plan to fix the ailing roads and bridges without breaking the bank \? christie well , i'm glad you asked that , maria here s here s our plan we 've all been talking about tax reforms tonight , and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform if you reform the corporate tax system in this country , which , as was mentioned before , is the highest rate in the world and we double tax , as you know and what that s led to over 2 trillion of american companies' monies that are being kept offshore , because they do n't want to pay the second tax and who can blame them \? they pay tax once overseas they do n't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back so beside reforming that tax code , bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those specialinterest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given bring that rate down to 25 percent , but also , a onetime repatriation of that money bring the money the 2 trillion back to the united states we 'll tax it , that one time , at 875 percent , because 35 percent of zero is zero , but 875 percent of 2 trillion is a lot of money and i would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country it would not necessitate us raising any taxes it would bring the money back into the united states to help build jobs by american companies and get our economy moving again , and growing as a higher rate , and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about and and and the last piece of this , maria , is this you know , the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in america he s penalized and does n't understand in fact , what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers you 've seen middleclass wages go backwards 3 , 700 during the obama administration that s wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country we 'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country , and we 'd work with the states to do it the right way , to do it more efficiently and more effectively and remember this i'm credible on this for this reason americans for tax reform says that i 've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in american history we do n't need to raise taxes to get this done we need to make the government run smarter and better , and reform this corporate tax system , bring that money back to the united states to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure , and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists all of those things are important , and all those things would happen in a christie administration bartiromo thank you , sir dr carson \( applause \) it is true us companies have 2 trillion in cash sitting overseas right now that could be used for investment and jobs in america also , several companies right now are pursuing mergers to move their corporate headquarters abroad , and take advantage of much lower taxes what will you do to stop the flow of companies building cash away from america , and those leaving america altogether \? carson well , i would suggest a fair tax system , and that s what we have proposed a flat tax for everybody no exemptions , no deductions , no shelters , because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others you know , and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money you know , i my my mother taught me this you know , she only had a thirdgrade education , but you know , she knew how to stretch a dollar i mean , she would drive a car until it would n't make a sound , and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car in fact , if my mother were secretary of treasury , we would not be in a deficit situation but \( laughter \) you know , the the the fact of the matter is you know , if we fix the taxation system , make it absolutely fair , and get rid of the incredible regulations because every regulation is a tax , it s a on goods and services and it s the most regressive tax there is you know , when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent , and the price has up you know , 50 cents because of regulations , a poor person notices that a rich person does not middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register and everything is costing more money , and we are killing our our our people like this and bernie sanders and hillary clinton will say it s those evil rich people it s not the evil rich people it s the evil government that is that is putting all these regulations on us so that we ca n't survive \( applause \) bartiromo thank you , sir senator rubio trump maria maria , what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion it s one of the biggest problems our country has right now , corporations , by the thousands , are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs leave them behind they 're leaving because of taxes , but they are also leaving because they ca n't get their money back and everybody agrees , democrats and republicans , that is should come back in but they ca n't get along they ca n't even make a deal here is the case , they both agree , they ca n't make a deal we have to do something corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have so many companies are going to leave our country bartiromo which is why we raised it senator rubio \? thank you , mr trump trump thank you bartiromo one of the biggest fiscal challenges is our entitlement programs , particularly social security and medicare what policies will you put forward to make sure these programs are more financially secure \? rubio well , first let me address the tax issue because it s related to the entitlement issue and i want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes \( applause \) rubio here is the one thing i'm not going to do i'm not going to have something that ted described in his tax plan it s called the value added tax and it s a tax you find in many companies in europe where basically , businesses now will have to pay a tax , both on the money they make , but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees and that s why they have it in europe , because it is a way to blindfolded the people , that s what ronald reagan said ronald regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people , so the true cost of government was not there there for them now , you can support one now that s very low but what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax , but also raising that vat tax , and that vat tax is really bad for seniors because seniors , if they are retired , are no longer earning an income from a job and therefore , they do n't get the income tax break , but their prices are going to be higher , because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees when i am president of the united states , i'm going to side with ronald regan on this and not nancy pelosi and we are not having a vat tax \( applause \) bartiromo thank you senator cruz maria , i assume that i can respond to that bartiromo senator cruz , yes you were meant to yes , of course cruz well , marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now , but the problem is , the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat a vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good this is a business flat tax it is imposed on business and a critical piece that marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax it goes away it enables us to eliminate the death tax if you 're a farmer , if you 're a rancher , if you are small business owner , the death tax is gone we eliminate the payroll tax , we eliminate the obamacare taxes and listen , there is a real difference between marco s tax plan and mine mine gives every american a simple , flat tax of 10 percent marco s top tax rate is 35 percent my tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the irs marco leaves the irs code in with all of the complexity we need to break the washington cartel , and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all \( bell rings \) the mandates and have a simple flat tax the final observation , invoked ronald reagan i would note that art laffer , ronald reagan s chief economic adviser , has written publicly , that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth , it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest bartiromo thank you senator \( applause \) rubio but that s not an accurate description of the plan because , first of all , you may rename the irs but you are not going to abolishes the irs , because there has to be some agency that s going to collect your vat tax someone s going to be collecting this tax in fact , ronald reagan s treasury , when ronald reagan s treasury looked at the vat tax , you know what they found \? that they were going to have to hire 20 , 000 new irs agencies to collect it the second point , it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make they will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees so there are people watching tonight in business if you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees , where are you going to get that money from \? you 're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more , that is a tax , the difference is , you do n't see it on the bill and that s why ronald reagan said that it was a blindfold you blindfold the american people so that they cannot see the true cost of government now 16 percent is what the rate ted wants it at but what happens if , god forbid , the next barack obama takes over , and the next nancy pelosi , and the next harry reid \( bell rings \) and they decide , we 're going to raise it to 30 percent , plus we 're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent now , you 've got europe \( crosstalk \) bartiromo thank you senator i have to get to a question for mr trump cruz maria bartiromo yes cruz maria , i 'd just like to say \( crosstalk \) christie maria , i 'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the senate to actually answer the question you asked , which was on entitlements do you remember that , everybody \? this was a question on entitlements and the reason and the reason \( crosstalk \) christie no , you already had your chance , marco , and you blew it here s the thing \( crosstalk \) christie the fact is , the reason why rubio if you 'll answer the \( inaudible \) core question christie the fact is the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it s hard it s a hard problem and i'm the only one up on this stage who back in april put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over 1 trillion , save social security , save medicare , and avoid this avoid what hillary rodham clinton will do to you because what she will do is come in and she will raise social security taxes bernie sanders has already said it and she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she s moved already to get to the left of bernie on this we have seniors out there who are scared to death because this congress this one that we have right now , just stole 150 billion from the social security retirement fund to give it to the social security disability fund a republican congress did that and the fact is it was wrong and they consorted with barack obama to steal from social security we need to reform social security mine is the only plan that saves over 1 trillion and that s why i'm answering your question bartiromo thank you , governor thank you , governor \( applause \) carson can i just add one very quick thing \? and i just want to say , you know , last week we released our tax plan and multiple reputable journals , including the wall street journal , said ours is the best just want to get that out there , just saying bartiromo thank you , dr carson coming up , how would the candidates protect america , and another terror attack , if we were to see it but first , you can join us live on stage during the commercial break right from home go to facebookcom foxbusiness we 'll be streaming live and answering your questions during this break next more from south carolina coming up stay with us \( commercial break \) bartiromo mr trump , your net worth is in the multibillions of dollars and have an ongoing thriving hotel and real estate business are you planning on putting your assets in a blind trust should you become president \? with such vast wealth , how difficult will it be for you to disentangle yourself from your business and your money and prioritize america s interest first \? trump well , it s an interesting question because i'm very proud of my company as you too know , i know i built a very great company but if i become president , i could n't care less about my company it s peanuts i want to use that same up here , whatever it may be to make america rich again and to make america great again i have ivanka , and eric and don sitting there run the company kids , have a good time i'm going to do it for america so i would i would be willing to do that bartiromo so you 'll put your assets in a blind trust \? trump i would put it in a blind trust well , i do n't know if it s a blind trust if ivanka , don and eric run it if that s a blind trust , i do n't know but i would probably have my children run it with my executives and i would n't ever be involved because i would n't care about anything but our country , anything bartiromo thank you sir trump thank you cavuto governor christie , going back to your us attorney days , you had been praised by both parties as certainly a tough law and order guy so i wonder what you make of recent statistics that showed violent crimes that have been spiking sometimes by double digit ratings in 30 cities across the country milwaukee police chief ed flynn said , most local law enforcement officials feel abandoned by washington former nyc police chief ray kelly , says that , police are being less proactive because they 're being overly scrutinized and second guessed and they 're afraid of being sued or thrown in jail what would you do as president to address this \? christie well , first off , let s face it , the fbi director james comey was a friend of mine who i worked with as us attorney of new jersey he was the us attorney in manhattan he said , there s a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country here s why , the president of the united states and both his attorney s general , they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal , not to the police officers that s the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president every time he s got a chance , going all the way back to remember that great beer summit he had after he messed up that time this is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys now , i for seven years was the us attorney of new jersey i worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here s the problem , sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country that s where crime is happening in these cities where they do n't enforce the immigration laws and this president turns his back this president does n't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he does n't agree with them and he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that s illegal this president allows lawlessness throughout this country here s what i would do neil , i would appoint an attorney general and i would have one very brief conversation with that attorney general i 'd say , general , enforce the law against everyone justly , fairly , and aggressively make our streets safe again make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that , let them know how proud we are of them we do that , this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well i'm the only person on this stage who s done that and we will get it done as president of the united states cavuto thank you governor governor kasich , as someone has to deal with controversial police shootings in your own state , what do you make of chicago s move recently to sort of retrain police \? maybe make them not so quick to use their guns \? kasich well , i created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement , community people , clergy and the person that i named as one of the cochair was a lady by the name of nina turner , a former state senator , a liberal democrat she actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety kasich and they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police kasich and they came back with 23 recommendations one of them is a statewide use of deadly force and it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of ohio secondly , a policy on recruiting and hiring , and then more resources for for training but let me also tell you , one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night , and not not to lose their life their family is waiting for them at the same time , law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system does n't work for them , but works against them see , in ohio , we 've had some controversial decisions but the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine , but violence is wrong and it has been a remarkable situation in our state and as president of the united states , it s all about communication , folks it s all about getting people to listen to one another s problems and when you do that , you will be amazed at how much progress you can make , and how much healing we can have because , folks , at the end of the day , the country needs healed i 've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight , but i 've got to tell you , as somebody that actually passed a budget that paid down a halfatrillion dollars of our national debt , you ca n't do it alone you 've got to bring people together you 've got to give people hope and together , we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal america and that is what s so critical for our neighborhoods , our families , our children , and our grandchildren \( applause \) cavuto thank you , governor bartiromo senator rubio \? \( applause \) under current law , the us is on track to issue more new permanent immigrants on green cards over the next five years than the entire population of south carolina the cbo says your 2013 immigration bill would have increased green cardholders by another 10 million over 10 years why are you so interested in opening up borders to foreigners when american workers have a hard enough time finding work \? rubio well , first of all , this is an issue that s been debated now for 30 years and for 30 years , the issue of immigration has been about someone who s in this country , maybe they 're here illegally , but they 're looking for a job this issue is not about that anymore first and foremost , this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping america safe and here s why there is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system and not just green cards they 're looking they 're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances they understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border they 're looking they 're looking to manipulate our the visa waiver countries to get people into the united states so our number one priority must now become ensuring that isis cannot get killers into the united states so whether it s green cards or any other form of entry into america , when i'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming , you are not going to get into the united states of america bartiromo so your thinking has changed \? rubio the issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago twentyfour months ago , 36 months ago , you did not have a group of radical crazies named isis who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally they have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us the entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost , with an eye on isis because they 're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers , posing as doctors , posing as refugees we know this for a fact they 've contacted the trafficking networks in the western hemisphere to get people in through the southern border and they got a killer in san bernardino in posing as a fiance this issue now has to be about stopping isis entering the united states , and when i'm president we will bartiromo thank you , senator \( applause \) cruz but maria , radical islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago 24 months ago , we had al qaida we had boko haram we had hamas we had hezbollah we had iran putting operatives in south america and central america it s the reason why i stood with jeff sessions and steve king and led the fight to stop the gang of eight amnesty bill , because it was clear then , like it s clear now , that border security is national security \( applause \) bartiromo thank you , senator cruz it is also the case that that rubioschumer amnesty bill , one of the things it did is it expanded barack obama s power to let in syrian refugees it enabled him the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks i think that s a mistake that s why i 've been leading the fight to stop it and i would note the senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from middle eastern countries i voted yes to suspend that marco voted on the other side so you do n't get to say we need to secure the borders , and at the same time try to give barack obama more authority to allow middle eastern refugees coming in , when the head of the fbi tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are isis terrorists rubio maria , let me clear something up here this is an interesting point when you talk about immigration rubio ted cruz , you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards , now you say that you 're against it you used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers , now you say that you 're against it you used to support legalizing people that were here illegally , now you say you 're against it you used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship , now you say that you are against it and by the way , it s not just on immigration , you used to support tpa , now you say you 're against it i saw you on the senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in iowa , and last week , we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in iowa for the same reason \( applause \) that is not consistent conservatism , that is political calculation when i am president , i will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe , not call edward snowden , as you did , a great public servant edward snowden is a traitor and if i am president and we get our hands on him , he is standing trial for treason \( applause \) and one more point , one more point every single time that there has been a defense bill in the senate , three people team up to vote against it bernie sanders , rand paul and ted cruz in fact , the only budget you have ever voted for , ted , in your entire time in the senate is a budget from rand paul that brags about how it cuts defense here s the bottom line , and i 'll close with this if i'm president of the united states and congress tries to cut the military , i will veto that in a millisecond \( applause \) bush there s look , there s cavuto gentlemen , gentlemen cruz i'm going to get a response to that , neil there s no way he launches 11 attack cavuto very quick , very quick cruz i'm going to he had no fewer than 11 attacks there i appreciate your dumping your \( inaudible \) research folder on the debate stage rubio no , it s your record cruzl but i will say cavuto do you think they like each other \? cruz at least half of the things marco said are flatout false they 're absolutely false audience boo cruz so let s start let s start with immigration let s start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity marco stood with chuck schumer and barack obama on amnesty i stood with jeff sessions and steve king marco stood today , standing on this stage marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals i opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship and by the way , the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget , marco knows full well i voted for his amendment to increase military spending to 697 billion what he said , and he said it in the last debate , it s simply not true and as president , i will rebuild the military and keep this country safe cavuto all right , gentlemen , we 've got to stop i know you are very passionate about that \( applause \) governor bush , fears have gripped this country obviously , and you touched on it earlier since the san bernardino attacks since our last debate , the national conversation has changed , according to facebook data as well now this first graphic shows the issues that were most talked about right before those attacks and now after the issues of islam , homeland security and isis now loom very large the fbi says islamic radicals are using social media to communicate and that it needs better access to communication now the ceo of apple , governor , tim cook said unless served with a warrant private communication is private , period do you agree , or would you try to convince him otherwise \? bush i would try to convince him otherwise , but this last back and forth between two senators back bench senators , you know , explains why we have the mess in washington , dc we need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it , not bend with the wind the simple fact is one of the ways , maria , to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country we need to control the border , we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way , not just going back and forth and talking about stuff cavuto would you answer this question \? bush oh , i 'll talk about that , too but you have n't asked me a question in a while , neil , so i thought i 'd get that off my chest if you do n't mind \( laughter \) cavuto fair enough so tim cook so tim cook says he s going to keep it private bush i got that and the problem today is there s no confidence in washington , dc there needs to be more than one meeting , there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies they understand that there s a national security risk we ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government , they 're not fearful of a lawsuit we need to make sure that we keep the country safe this is the first priority the cybersecurity challenges that we face , this administration failed us completely , completely not just the hacking of opm , but that is that is just shameful 23 million files in the hands of the chinese \? so it s not just the government the private sector companies , it s also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game we should put the nsa in charge of the civilian side of this as well that expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector cavuto but if tim cook is telling you no , mr president bush you 've got to keep asking you 've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue if you can encrypt messages , isis can , over these platforms , and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship cavuto do you ask or do you order \? bush well , if the law would change , yeah but i think there has to be recognition that if we if we are too punitive , then you 'll go to other other technology companies outside the united states and what we want to do is to control this we also want to dominate this from a commercial side so there s a lot of balanced interests but the president leads in this regard that s what we need we need leadership , someone who has a backbone and sticks with things , rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you 're talking about amendments that do n't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed cavuto governor , thank you \( applause \) bartiromo when we come right back , closing statements stay with us \( commercial break \) bartiromo welcome back candidates , it is time for your closing statements you get 60 seconds each governor john kasich , we begin with you kasich you know , in our country , there are a lot of people who feel as though they just do n't have the power you know , they feel like if they do n't have a lobbyist , if they 're not wealthy , that somehow they do n't get to play but all of my career , you know , having been raised in by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner , who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight or a mother whose mother could barely speak english you see , all of my career , i 've fought about giving voice to the people that i grew up with and voice to the people that elected me whether it s welfare reform and getting something back for the hardearned taxpayers whether it s engaging in pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off or whether it s taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in ohio , so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home , rather than being forced into a nursing home look , that s who i stand up for that s who s in my mind \( bell rings \) and if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back , i will tell you , as i have all my career , i will continue to fight for you , because you 're the ones that built this country , and will carry it into the future thank you \( applause \) cavuto governor bush \? bush who can you count on to keep us safer , stronger and freer \? results count , and as governor , i pushed florida up to the top in terms of jobs , income and small business growth detailed plans count , and i believe that the plan i 've laid out to destroy isis before the tragedies of san bernardino and paris are the right ones credibility counts there 'll be people here that will talk about what they 're going to do i 've done it i ask for your support to build , together , a safer and stronger america \( applause \) bartiromo governor chris christie \? christie maria , neil , thank you for a great debate tonight when i think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching , and i think about what they had to watch this week the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the house of representatives , with the president of the united states , who talked a fantasy land about the way they 're feeling they know that this country is not respected around the world anymore they know that this country is pushing the middle class , the hardworking taxpayers , backwards , and they saw a president who does n't understand their pain , and does n't have any plan for getting away from it i love this country it s the most exceptional country the world has ever known we need someone to fight for the people we need a fighter for this country again i 've lived my whole life fighting fighting for things that i believe in , fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism , fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more , and to stand up and fight against the special interests but here s the best way that we 're going to make america much more exceptional it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in september who will fight hillary clinton and make sure she never , ever gets in the white house again i am the man who can bring us together to do that , and i ask for your vote \( applause \) cavuto dr ben carson \? carson you know , in recent travels around this country , i 've encountered so many americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom , our security and the american dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups we 're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics the only way we 're going to solve this problem is with we , the people and i ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity bencarsoncom we will heal , inspire and revive america for our children \( applause \) bartiromo senator marco rubio \? rubio you know , 200 years ago , america was founded on this powerful principle that our rights do n't come from government our rights come from god that s why we embraced free enterprise , and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world that s why we embraced individual liberty , and we became the freest people ever , and the result was the american miracle but now as i travel the country , people say what i feel this country is changing it feels different we feel like we 're being left behind and left out and the reason is simple because in 2008 , we elected as president someone who was n't interested in fixing america we elected someone as president who wants to change america , who wants to make it more like the rest of the world and so he undermines the constitution , and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government , and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military and that s why 2016 is a turning point in our history if we elect hillary clinton , the next four years will be worse than the last eight , and our children will be the first americans ever to inherit a diminished country but if we elect the right person if you elect me we will turn this country around , we will reclaim the american dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been \( applause \) cavuto senator ted cruz \? cruz 13 hours tomorrow morning , a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them i want to speak to all our fighting men and women i want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country , and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commanderinchief who will not even speak the name of our enemy , radical islamic terrorism , when you have a commanderin chief who sends 150 billion to the ayatollah khamenei , who s responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women i want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness , where hillary clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter this will end it will end on january 2017 and if i am elected president , to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine , and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe , i will have your back \( applause \) bartiromo mr donald trump \? trump i stood yesterday with 75 construction workers they 're tough , they 're strong , they 're great people half of them had tears pouring down their face they were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors , sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position , their hands up and iranian wise guys having guns to their heads it was a terrible sight a terrible sight and the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal , 150 billion if i'm president , there wo n't be stupid deals anymore we will make america great again we will win on everything we do thank you \( applause \) bartiromo candidates , thank you cavuto gentlemen , thank you all all of you that wraps up our debate we went a little bit over here but we wanted to make sure everyone was able to say their due he s upset all right thank you for joining us much more to come in the spin room ahead
the weather did on monday what the were unable to do all of last season leave dallas keuchel disappointed when keuchel , a lefthander who shackled the yankees each of the three times he faced them last year , woke up to a cold rain , he had a sense that the seasonopening game at yankee stadium would be postponed and so it was , around the time many players arrived at the ballpark the game was rescheduled for tuesday , which had been a scheduled day off the weather is expected to be brisk , with a high of 42 degrees , but the skies clear for a 1 09 pm first pitch it s kind of like you wake up and you 're ready to go get the season started and then kind of have a swift kick to the face , keuchel said we 'll just have to wait until tomorrow mother nature ca n't be stopped we know that the yankees , of course , can be stopped by keuchel he threw 22 scoreless innings against them last season , including six in the american league wildcard playoff , a 30 astros victory it was their struggles against lefthanded pitchers , especially late in the season , that prompted the yankees to trade for outfielder aaron hicks and second baseman starlin castro , who will both be in the order on tuesday to help balance a lineup whose only real pop against lefthanders comes from the 40yearold alex rodriguez castro , as the everyday second baseman , was a given hicks , a switchhitter , was something of a surprise only because it would be opening day an event rife with pomp , circumstance and optimism for what the season can be manager joe girardi s decision to start hicks meant having to find a place on the bench for either left fielder brett gardner or center fielder jacoby ellsbury , both lefthanded hitters girardi had the same decision to make when he chose to start chris young in left field during the wildcard playoff he sat ellsbury and his 153 million contract then he will sit gardner on tuesday we did n't have a lot of success against him last year , so i thought i 'd try something different , is really what it came down to , girardi said , adding that the decision would not have raised an eyebrow if it were not opening day gardner was not pleased to be benched but he also had a hard time mustering an argument , as he struck out in all three atbats against keuchel last october it s definitely disappointing , gardner said i'm not going to sit here and tell you i do n't want to start opening day , because obviously i do but i understand where joe is coming from and respect his decision if i looked a little bit better against him , we would n't be sitting here talking about that i can handle that it s kind of on me hicks , who will bat second behind ellsbury , had two hits in five atbats while playing for minnesota against keuchel , including a home run that equals as many extrabase hits as the yankees managed against keuchel last season , when he faced 79 yankees batters and allowed 11 singles and a double by carlos beltran keuchel walked two and struck out 28 against the yankees keuchel , with his distinctive , bushy , chestlength beard , relies on precision control of four pitches , none of which are overpowering but all of which have late , darting movement after the playoff loss , rodriguez called keuchel a lefthanded greg maddux he s not a guy that s real overpowering , that s real intimidating , that s a very uncomfortable atbat , gardner said he just finds ways to beat you and get you out girardi said no , i do n't think there s an intimidation factor i think there s a recognition that he s very good at what he does when you face a guy like dallas keuchel , you hope he s off his game that day and he makes some mistakes and you take advantage while several yankees expressed disappointment about having to wait another day to start their season , the rainout was not entirely unwelcome for all of them third baseman chase headley , who missed the final two exhibition games in miami with a stomach illness , has another day to regain his strength and with masahiro tanaka s start delayed a day , it could give the yankees the option of using ivan nova on sunday night at detroit rather than bringing tanaka back on four days' rest tanaka could then pitch against toronto , against whom he allowed three runs over three starts in august and september but that was a contingency that might be determined by how much nova is needed out of the bullpen too many hypotheticals for girardi to consider at the moment the yankees tried to make the most out of monday , with hitters taking swings in the indoor cages , pitchers michael pineda and chasen shreve throwing to catchers , and brian mccann , headley , hicks and gardner playing catch on the field during a latemorning break in the rain they were to reconvene later in the evening for a homecoming dinner , a traditional team event held after the home opener with the yankees having lost four consecutive season openers and facing the prospect of keuchel on the mound , perhaps the rain did them a favor on monday , leaving them with an appetite
with 102 points through 80 games , patrick kane of the chicago blackhawks is poised to win the art ross trophy as the nhl s top point scorer his superlative season has evoked achievements from an earlier era he is the first americanborn player with a 100point season in 20 years his 26game point streak earlier in the season was the longest since 199293 but his leagueleading numbers also reflect how far removed hockey is from its offensive heyday thirty years ago , wayne gretzky set a singleseason nhl record with a mindboggling 215 points in 80 games for the edmonton oilers , completing the feat with an assist on a marty mcsorley goal in the season finale against the vancouver canucks on april 6 , 1986 that season , nhl teams averaged 397 goals apiece per game it was the secondhighest average since the league s 196768 expansion to 12 teams from six the peak was 401 in 198182 at the 30th anniversary of gretzky s seemingly unbreakable record , another statistic stands out nhl scoring has continued to decline since the 198586 season , never topping the 397 mark the roots of that decline are clear in the mind of gretzky , the nhl s career leading scorer with 2 , 857 points when i was 10 years old , they 'd throw a puck on the ice and say , go score , ' he said now , at 10 years old , the kids are taught to play in their lanes defensemen stay back everybody blocks shots i mean , my goodness , i do n't think i ever blocked a shot , and i killed penalties every single game i thought goaltenders were paid to block shots , not forwards it s changed completely i think the biggest thing we 've lost is a little bit of our creativity and imagination in general this season , goals per team per game \( 271 \) are lower than at any time since the socalled dead puck era of 1995 to 2004 , when interference tactics and the neutral zone trap were rampant while gretzky cited players like kane , jonathan toews , sidney crosby , alex ovechkin and steven stamkos as having imagination and creativity , today s hockey is far from his runandgun prime all in all , it s sort of a grinding game now , he said you 're taught from day 1 that your role and responsibility is to keep the puck out of your net many factors enabled gretzky to set his 215point record , which surpassed his previous high of 212 from 198182 at 25 , gretzky was at his physical peak and a playmaking genius surrounded by other superstars those oilers had six future hockey hall of famers gretzky , mark messier , jari kurri , glenn anderson , paul coffey and grant fuhr in 198586 , coffey was third in the league in points , with 138 , and kurri was fourth , with 131 gretzky said that glen sather , who coached the oilers to four of their five stanley cups , was the true architect of this offensive juggernaut sather , 72 , is currently the president of the rangers he had a vision , gretzky said he idolized what the winnipeg jets did in the wha with anders hedberg , ulf nilsson , larserik sjoberg and bobby hull he wanted to create an nhl team that was on par with that so he did n't try to change what we did as a positive he gave us the ability to go out there and be ourselves , and yet he pushed us and made us better athletes no question about it the last time teams averaged more than three goals apiece per game was 20056 \( 308 \) after the lockout that wiped out the 20045 season , the nhl introduced rules to encourage more scoring the center red line was disregarded to allow for twoline passes that could beat the neutral zone trap a trapezoid was put behind the net to limit the area in which goaltenders could play the puck teams icing the puck were no longer permitted to substitute fresh players for the ensuing faceoff in the defensive zone the nhl also moved toward a zero tolerance officiating standard power plays gained a big role the average number of power plays per team in 20056 was 480 , compared with 348 in 20034 but none of these changes have had a lasting impact for example , the average number of power plays per team this season is 249 daniel sedin , who won the art ross trophy as the nhl s leading scorer with 104 points for the canucks in 201011 , acknowledged that the ultratight officiating had gradually diminished but he said there had also been benefits to limiting the speed of the game and the number of violent collisions , which surged after the 20045 lockout it s obviously not being called the way it was 10 years ago , sedin said but i think also head shots , those bad hits , are gone , too it s a fine line between calling the game the way it was 10 years ago and also protecting the players i do n't think there s much you can do there i think it s more about how teams are coached , how good and how patient every player is now ken holland , the general manager of the detroit red wings , attributed the reduced scoring to greater competitive balance , more data about opponents and similar coaching strategies leaguewide if the scores were 65 , you could afford mistakes because you can outscore your mistakes , holland said but when the scores are 21 or 32 , mistakes are critical if scoring is to rise again , significant changes to the way hockey is played and coached will be needed last season , jamie benn of the dallas stars was the league s top scorer , with 87 points in 82 games the last time an art ross trophy winner had fewer points than that in a full season was 196263 , when gordie howe had 86 points in 70 games for the red wings the last art ross trophy winner to get the same number of points as gretzky had assists in 198586 \( 163 \) was none other than gretzky , in 199091 that was also the last season any player had more than 100 assists erik karlsson of the ottawa senators was leading the league this season , with 64 through wednesday goalies , at least , enjoy the current climate pekka rinne of the nashville predators epitomizes the modern nhl goalie with his 6foot5 , 217pound frame and elite technical skills the vezina trophy winner in 198586 was john vanbiesbrouck , who was listed at 58 and 176 pounds at the general managers' meetings last month in boca raton , fla , the league set out proposals , particularly pants and chest protectors the objective is to increase scoring opportunities and to compensate for a lack of skill or size , while also keeping them safe in recent years , the nhl also changed the rules about the length of goalie pads ,  new equipment prototypes are expected to be ready by june making them standard issue next season would require the approval of the nhl s competition committee and board of governors rinne , a 33yearold finn who is a threetime vezina finalist , said he had little appetite for drastic action to ramp up scoring it s good to have these conversations , rinne said i'm sure something is going to happen hopefully nothing radical i do n't want to change this great game if it s goalie equipment , then it is , but hopefully it s not bigger nets
arthur , do you remember that old musical number , \? here we are at super tuesday ! voters are dancing across the stage and donald trump is lurking in the wings what do you think \? hi , gail if we 're starting with a lavish musical metaphor , i think that in terms of weirdness it s maybe a little less kiss me , kate and more the rocky horror picture show wow , now that i think of it , did n't rocky horror feature \? that s right actually , let s start with the notweird part hillary clinton s crushing win in south carolina was expected and seems to be putting that race back on the rails for her the democrats are definitely the notheartstopping part of the story there are times when it s smart to be unexciting but the republicans \? with considerable trepidation i 'll offer a little premortem on the race so far last summer , when there were n't any juicy celebrity scandals and only reruns on tv , trump created a huge stir with controversial populist rhetoric much of the media figured out that covering him to the exclusion of almost everything else would ring the cash register like crazy this built a modest plurality of republican support , roughly 30 percent of the 30 percent of voters who are official republicans meanwhile , approximately one million mainstream republicans got into the race , meaning that even though together they outpolled trump individually none could match him so here s the formula a plurality of voters plus an absolute majority of earned media plus a fragmented opposition equals victory i applaud your continued determination to embrace the fragmentation theory , which posits that there are tons of good candidates and sane republican voters out there , they 've just yet to come out and get together i sense you are mildly dubious of my hypothesis but remember , despair is a sin for catholics i do think that there have been some very good republican presidential candidates this year , and that conservatives could have a bright future in congress and in the states , however this election turns out yes , and my next tune will be where have you gone , joe dimaggio \? but substituting jeb bush or george pataki hehehehe simon and garfunkel would be so proud ok , so i gave you my field theory of the republican race what s yours \? what s making this season different \? one thing is social media donald trump was made for a world of twitter and youtube i have a theory that whenever we move on to a new , more open form of communication , there s a period of hysteria in which everybody who s come onstage competes for attention we 'll adjust eventually we always do but in the meantime there are a lot of outrageous claims and personal assaults , made in the loudest voice possible i could tell you stories about the coming of cheaper printing presses and what it did to grover cleveland s sex life although nobody ever really takes me up on that offer well , this is a family newspaper , so you probably should n't go into details although it s hard to pass up a bodiceripper featuring grover cleveland meanwhile , i have to admit that while the republicans are imploding with rage , the democrats are short on juice i appreciate what bernie sanders has brought to the race , but the party s thin on a next generation of national voices it goes deeper than one presidential contest when young liberals think about how they want to change the world , the last thing they think about is running for congress they 're probably more likely to imagine doing a latenight comedy show jon stewart is more of a role model for young liberals than harry reid \? that s crazy talk and hey before we get back to politics , your mention of jon stewart calls up a question i 've always wanted to ask the republican party has been roiled and transformed by angry talk radio there is no equivalent on the democratic side liberals have tried and tried , but they do n't seem to have any talent for yelling into a radio mic it s true , liberals are generally better at murmuring into the mic in dulcet tones all paid for with philanthropy and government subsidy on the other hand , republicans seem to have no aptitude for comedy late night is packed , , with liberals making fun of conservatives nothing on the other side you can argue that this is discrimination of some sort , but i 've always wondered if it speaks to some fundamental difference what do you think \? actually , when you guys are n't watching , we are hilarious interestingly , there is an academic literature hypothesizing that conservatives are humorless stiffs while liberals are superfun here s how one scholar his findings conservatives seek emotional control and cognitive closure compared with liberals , who are comfortable with more abandoned selfexpression and thought processes sounds like a real pageturner , i know no , i think i may be in total agreement my colleague jonah goldberg who is an extremely funny conservative points out that on the subject of latenight comedy , it s true that there are a lot of liberals making fun of conservatives and god knows there s a lot of material to work with but it s notable that there s not so much making fun of liberals which raises the question is there really nothing to mock on the left \? or is that just not quite as safe and fun \? well , i will acknowledge that it s not as much fun one thing we would probably agree on is that people on the extremes of both sides are pretty humorless after all , chris rock who was pretty hard on the hollywood left at the oscars says he does n't like to do campus gigs anymore because students and faculty members are so easily offended by the jokes the three words most often uttered on campus these days that s not funny ! you 're leading us into a much longer topic of discussion i 've always been bemused by the subjects that some people find funny i am thinking now of rape jokes but also the ones sometimes deemed too sensitive for humor at my very first newspaper , a weekly in connecticut , we once ran a picture that had a puppy in a silly pose , and we got tons of complaints a month later we had a similarly dumbbutnotmean picture featuring a baby , and nobody said a word two topics for future weeks , then campus culture and puppy exploitation but back to politics did you watch the republican debate last thursday \? it was like a car accident , where you ca n't stand it but you ca n't look away after months giving him a pass , marco rubio and ted cruz took turns going after trump , mocking and insulting him just like he has been doing to everyone else for months about time probably too late , actually , to change trump s public image while my times colleagues did just break the story on , some of the other stories he was beaten up with the polish workers , trump university have been out there forever you know a lot of republicans answer me this they spend weeks and weeks wringing their hands about donald trump sometimes financing ads against donald trump sometimes begging the remaining candidates to unite behind one guy but never just sending off their minions to do the basic opposition research how come \? simple have you ever been on a subway car where a belligerent guy is screaming at everyone \? the commuters all want something to be done , but no one wants to be the one to make eye contact with him because then they 'll become the focus of his terrible abuse social scientists call this a collective action problem i guarantee you that the clinton campaign wo n't make that mistake no doubt they are already preparing ads featuring working poor people who were laid off from their jobs due to trump s bankruptcies , interspersed with clips of him saying , you 're fired ! and then chris christie pops up and says no , you 're not ! ' that endorsement surprised a lot of people , but jon ward over at yahoo news actually called it a few days earlier , he published that looked back on christie s campaign and wondered whether an endorsement for trump might be brewing apparently the answer was yes i'm betting that if things keep going trump s way you 'll see a lot of establishment republicans wanting to get on board it 'll look like the box office for hamilton or maybe a midnight showing of rocky horror well , it s about time for the final curtain on this conversation super tuesday results , here we come by the way , gail , how many democrats does it take to screw in a light bulb \? that s not funny !
a zookeeper performing a routine procedure in palm beach , fla , was killed friday by a malayan tiger , a zoo official said the tiger did not escape from its enclosure but had to be subdued so that officials could reach the woman , a zoo spokeswoman , naki carter , the zookeeper was taken by helicopter to a hospital , where she later died no guests or visitors were ever in jeopardy , ms carter guests were , nonetheless , told to barricade themselves at a gift shop none were present during the attack ,  in an email , ms carter identified the zookeeper as stacey konwiser it was not immediately clear what she was doing at the time of the attack there are as few as 250 malayan tigers in the world , four of the tigers , which come from the southern tip of thailand , live at the palm beach zoo last year , the zoo s staff members a new male tiger , , that they planned to breed with a female tiger named berapi ms konwiser , a lead keeper , in july about hati s arrival ms konwiser s husband is also a keeper at the zoo , ms carter said ms konwiser s was of a tiger s face
derry , nh tennis boating summers at walker s point life among the white anglosaxon protestant elite \( or wasps , in sociological shorthand \) was good for a young john ellis bush james bruner , whose father was the bush family pastor at st ann s episcopal church in kennebunkport , me , remembers mr bush , known as jeb , as a largerthanlife presence at the kennebunk river club his enduring image is of a youthful mr bush playing tennis in tennis whites a white lacoste shirt , white shorts and canvas sneakers i 'll never forget jeb kind of stepping back to take a high popper a kind of lob and doing an overheard smash that was so loud that it sent the ball down and then up onto the roof behind his opponents , mr bruner said for me , mr bruner concluded , he was like the big cheese on the court but that era of polite and high society on the courts and playing fields of new england , in the halls of boarding schools and in the corridors of government is fast fading and in many ways , the travails of mr bush s presidential campaign can be seen as perhaps the last , wheezing gasp of the wasp power structure against a frustrated , profoundly unwasplike republican electorate that craves the visceral pugnaciousness of donald j trump or the outsider anger of senator ted cruz , mr bush s family values of cordial restraint , of civil discourse , of earnest public service can seem almost quaint mr bush tells voters who wonder why he cannot summon mr trump s tvfriendly fury that he was n't brought up that way he struggles with a basic task in politics bragging conceding that , when he does , he feels the looming presence of barbara bush , his boastaverse mother and in an age of topicchanging sound bites , he is oddly determined to respond to every inquiry i 've had 62 years of life that s been jammed into my dna that when someone asks you a question , you answer it , he said recently longtime friends still speak with admiration of mr bush s anachronistic outlook , sounding a bit like miss manners tsktsking the political world for leaving its elbows on the table c boyden gray , who served as white house counsel under the elder bush , ticked through the code of conduct the bush dynasty has long embodied civility and good manners were kind of assumed , he said you would be generous to a loser , you would not boast about your victory , you would be civil during an engagement , but you 'd use every trick you had , every skill you had to win , mr gray continued they represented a whole generation of people , and i think a whole way of looking at things has been lost many voters , however , are eager for something less , well , dignified mr bush has struggled to gain traction with his party s base , and sits at single digits in the polls also showed his net favorability numbers among republicans falling to 44 percent , from 54 percent in july recently , tom emanuel of laconia , nh , stood at a bush event here to say he was leaning toward supporting mr trump , whose dynamism and contrarian nature he admired mr bush , channeling his respectful roots , responded by first saying about mr trump after the event , mr emanuel said mr bush had not yet won him over , but even he sounded a nostalgic note for what mr bush represented he obviously has manners , he s restrained , he s not going to go out and nail somebody because he does n't like them , he does n't come across a dirty politician , mr emanuel said so if i say i'm leaning toward trump , i also have a sentimental place in my voting heart for , as well it was n't always this way for decades , the blueblooded bush dynasty occupied an elevated position in the nation s social and civic fabric prescott bush , the family patriarch , was a republican senator from connecticut his son george worked his way through the ranks of government congressman , ambassador , director of the central intelligence agency , vice president before becoming the 41st president and his oldest son , george w bush , became the 43rd i would use the word oldschool , ' said gregory w slayton , whom george w bush appointed chief of mission to bermuda , and who is now supporting senator marco rubio humility is something i love about the bush family that s an admirable leadership trait that has been completely lost , at least for many of our candidates during earlier eras , the dirty work of politics , when necessary , was handled behind the scenes , compromise , or at least coalition building , was encouraged campaigning and governing were , largely , separate pursuits tom rath , who worked for the first president bush s reelection campaign and then for his son , but is now supporting gov john r kasich of ohio , pointed to the elder mr bush s decision to break his campaign pledge and raise taxes , which helped doom his chances at a second term he made a choice that he felt had to be made , said mr rath , a fixture in new hampshire politics at the end of the day , they were going to be responsible jeb bush , like many in the family orbit , seems slightly bewildered by the current political moment , uncomfortable with the demands for an angry passion he does not easily summon his toughest broadside against mr trump was still remarkably restrained , and he stumbled when he against mr rubio in an early debate the sadness for me is watching jeb try to come back to trump s crudities , said joseph epstein , an essayist and the author of snobbery the american version if he has to go down , i hope he 'll go down with his character intact government by wasp rule has long been waning bill clinton s victory over the elder mr bush in 1992 was viewed by many as the triumph of the meritocratic elite over the elitebybirth crowd , and the 2012 election featured an africanamerican president and his irishcatholic vicepresident running against a mormon and another catholic justice john paul stevens s retirement from the supreme court in 2010 left it with no white anglosaxon protestants even jeb bush himself , like his brother who moved to texas and adopted a swagger has at times seemed eager to escape his familial roots he married a mexican woman he met on a trip there , and the two lived briefly in venezuela before making their home in florida , immersing themselves in miami s cubanamerican diaspora by faith , he is officially no longer a wasp he converted to his wife s religion , becoming a practicing roman catholic who and rosary beads in his pocket at a recent event in coralville , iowa , mr bush pointedly rejected the notion that he was part of the socalled republican establishment i got married when i was 21 years old , my bride was 20 , she s from mexico that s not part of the establishment , he said i'm bilingual , i'm bicultural apparently , that s not part of the establishment yet , at an elemental level , john ellis bush very much remains prescott bush s grandson , george bush s son and george w bush s brother , vying to take his place in the family profession and to become , he hopes , bush 45 but history , which long buoyed families like his , may now be working against him politics has never been totally

i don t want to lay my case against conservative support for donald trump on too thick too soon , since there will be plenty of time to go around and around on the question between here and november but one issue seems worth highlighting now , because it s come up repeatedly in conversations with what you might call the trumpcurious among my friends and family and peers basically , when you make an argument like the one i made in my sunday column , to the effect that a president trump s likely governing style would raise the risks of national and global instability to an extent that trumps \( if you will \) many normal ideological concerns , they tend to raise an eyebrow and say , compared to what \? compared to george w bush , who led us into a bloody quagmire in the middle east and presided over the worst financial crisis since the great depression \? compared to barack obama , who s basically stood by and watched while that same middle east has gone up in flames , plus russia s nearabroad and oh , maybe europe too \? oh , and since you re worried about trump s character compared to bill clinton , who possibly bombed foreign countries in order to distract from his sex scandal with an intern \? here s a rod dreher reader email that gets at a version of this argument and here s a tweet from a writer i admire \( i highly recommend his essay on the state of science in the latest first things \) that distills it to its essence will wilson \( wawilsoniv \) may 7 , 2016 and this one as well , from a writer whose latest piece on waugh is just great matthew walther \( matthewwalther \) may 10 , 2016 now i am rarely accused of pollyannism \( an obscure 8thcentury christian heresy , i believe \) , and i don t usually think of myself as someone who holds our ruling class in particularly high regard but the trump phenomenon has exposed an important dividing line within what you might call the pessimismbased community pessimists all look at the governance of the west and think , well , this is pretty bad , but we don t all agree on how and whether and how easily it could get much , much worse in my own case , because i tend to see western society as stuck in a decadent loop rather than on the skids toward total calamity , i also tend to give our elites some credit for not being total calamities themselves , and i tend to see movements like trumpism that promise total disruption as offering a cure worse than the disease whereas some of my more declinist friends \( perhaps including this trump delegate \? \) are more trumpcurious because they think the disease is further advanced , that calamity looms no matter what , or that see above under bush and obama it has already come upon us this is not a disagreement that can be adjudicated perfectly , since it requires comparing our existing politicians , many of whom are indeed venal and incompetent , to an entirely hypothetical trump era but provisionally i would invite the trumpcurious to think about the two signal crises of the bush years , 9 11 and the financial crisis , and imagine each one with donald trump installed as president of the united states in the first instance , you can imagine a better outcome than the one we had perhaps trump s \( alleged \) skepticism about the iraq war and zeal for winning would have manifested itself in a more restrained and tightlyfocused post9 11 response , perhaps we would have caught or killed bin laden sooner and brought our troops home in a victory parade , perhaps phrases like abu ghraib and waterboarding would have never entered our national lexicon but remembering the post9 11 atmosphere \( and , indeed , my own psychic state at the time \) , it also seems very easy to imagine a response that was much , much worse more reckless , more bloodthirsty , more extraconstitutional , and ultimately more disastrous for our military , the innocent , the world recall , especially , that for all the talk at the time and after about bush s fascism , etc , the bush administration spent a lot of time trying to tamp down backlash at home \( mosque visits , yes internment camps , no \) and working within institutional frameworks that imposed some limits on its actions both of its wars \( unlike our obamaera adventures \) were debated and approved by congress , a great deal of time was spent trying to work through the united nations , the invasion of iraq was a coalition effort even if it was only of the willing , high cheneyism was pressed by one faction of the executive branch but resisted by others , and so on none of this prevented the war from being a mistake and then a debacle , and if you re preparing an indictment of the american governing class the fact that so many centrists and reasonable liberals went along with the bush administration s case for war can be invoked in a case for disruption , a case for trumpnow \( as can the fact that many nevertrump voices on the right seem not to have reckoned fully with what bushism wrought \) but it s also pretty easy , especially given some of the precedents created by president obama s foreign forays and drone wars , to imagine how a future american president might respond to a 9 11style attack by ignoring institutional restraints entirely , and simply lashing out with blood and fire especially if that american president had , i dunno , explicitly campaigned on promises to kill them and take the oil , to murder terrorist families , to disfavor and discriminate against muslims as a class during a time of terror , etc which is why , in the end , a rigorous case for trump needs to be very comfortable with that possibility \( as some of his supporters are ! \) , comfortable with fire and blood as an alternative to george w bush s fartootimid crawl to war and overlawyered enhanced interrogations , rather than assuming because bush s foreign policy went bad a far higher degree of recklessness and folly isn t possible then regarding the financial crisis well , there my take is a lot shorter no doubt the bush administration \( and the clinton administration before it \) made mistakes that made the crisis worse when it came no doubt the washingtonnew york response was imperfect and created all kinds of problems down the road but to believe that the aftermath of lehman s collapse couldn t have been much bleaker with a more feckless and volatile president at the helm and a more hackish cast around him , that the bush administration s response was the worst of all possible options rather than among the leastbad , requires ignoring a lot of very dark economic history that we were lucky not to actually revisit there is some chance that america and the world would have been better off had donald trump been president on 9 11 rather than bush but the chances that we would have been better off in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 \( and into the present \) drop very low indeed i ll leave off there , while noting that i ve made an earlier version of this argument that touches on the immigration issue as well again , we ll have plenty of time to wrestle with these questions over the next six months but in the pessimist community generally , and the world of dissident , antibush conservatives especially , this strikes me as the core problem that need to be reckoned with by anyone who wants to make a strong case for supporting donald trump for the sake of disrupting our decadent elite it s not enough to note that things are bad now , that our bipartisan leaders and especially the republican party s leaders have often marched with folly you need to address headon the ways in which a president trump seems like a man whose instincts , inclinations and explicit promises could make that march of folly ever so much swifter , ever so much worse
washington for the final time , will mount the rostrum in the house chamber on tuesday to deliver a but this time , aides said , he will not bring with him a long list of proposals that will languish in congress after all these years , a victory of experience over hope instead , mr obama plans a thematic message that effectively will be as much a campaign agenda as a governing document while not on the ballot himself , mr obama hopes to use what may be the largest television audience left in his presidency to frame the debate about who should replace him and where the country should go from here this is a decisive moment for the twoterm president , the pivot point where he goes from priority setter to celebrity spectator in the contest for the future his speech and the days that follow offer a last chance to bolster his lagging poll ratings , define his legacy , rebut negative narratives emerging from the campaign trail and challenge his wouldbe successors to address the issues he deems most vital aides say mr obama wants to present an upbeat , optimistic view of america after seven years that will contrast with the gloomy portrayals offered by republican candidates , a task aided by but complicated by continuing turmoil in the middle east and elsewhere at the same time , while mr obama will introduce a few policy proposals , more broadly he hopes to generate support for his approach to issues like climate change , gun control , immigration and income inequality that can boost hillary clinton , the frontrunner for the democratic nomination , even if it does not result in further action during his tenure last year , he spoke to congress , said jennifer psaki , the white house communications director this year , he 'll be speaking more to the american public but it is a public that does not share his sunny assessment of the state of the union in a survey conducted by the new york times and cbs news in december , 68 percent of americans said the country was on the wrong track , the highest such figure in more than two years with the president s performance on critical issues like the fight against the islamic state , also known as isis or isil that sour public mood has challenged mr obama throughout his presidency since he took office , the proportion of americans who consider the country heading in the right direction in timescbs polls has never outnumbered those who think it is on the wrong track that was true for most of his predecessor s tenure , too republican presidential candidates have tapped that sentiment the state of our union is a mess , donald j trump said sunday on meet the press on nbc news we ca n't beat isis our military is falling back it s not being properly taken care of our vets are n't being properly taken care of obamacare , as you know , is going to fail very soon and probably in '17 , our health care we do n't have borders we do n't have anything senator mitch mcconnell , the republican majority leader , said the whole middle east is in terrible shape under mr obama so i 'd like to see the president step up here in his last year and lay out a plan for the defeat of isil , he said on this week on abc it s a good starting place that sort of talk has gotten under mr obama s skin and he wants to use the nation s biggest platform to push back as a preview , he sent his white house chief of staff , denis mcdonough , to most of the sunday talk shows to counter the republicans , citing the 292 , 000 new jobs created in december and the 265 million in all of 2015 the republicans are seeming to run down america , mr mcdonough said on nbc i do n't really get it what i see is an america that s surging we feel very optimistic about the future , he added that s a big difference between us and what s going on in this public debate right now and that s what you 'll hear about on tuesday night the speech comes less than three weeks before the iowa caucuses kick off the voting for his successor , and one unspoken goal for mr obama is to set the table for mrs clinton aides said they did not directly coordinate the president s speech with her campaign , but did not need to because they knew her positions on the issues his focus on gun control last week is one area where they are in sync , and mr obama said he would be a oneissue voter this year , who oppose common sense measures but mr mcdonough insisted sunday that the president would not endorse in the democratic primary regardless of senator bernie sanders s past support for immunity from liability for gun manufacturers and dealers , legislation he now supports revising jeff shesol , a white house speechwriter for president bill clinton , said a president in his eighth year no longer has the same commanding voice he once did he does n't get to pick the terms of the debate precisely he gets to influence them broadly that was something that was on our minds at this stage in the clinton white house , mr shesol said we did n't get to dictate the terms but we did actually help shape the debate the decision to not focus on a string of sweeping new proposals reflects the recognition that mr obama has little chance of securing major legislation from a republican congress two areas both sides see as likeliest for agreement are an overhaul of the criminal justice system and approval of mr obama s asianpacific free trade agreement it may also reflect the normal exhaustion of new ideas in the eighth year of an eventful presidency the white house went through the usual policy development process in preparation for a more conventional , but after mr obama saw the ideas laid out , none was so compelling that he wanted to make it the centerpiece of his last annual speech among the ideas being discussed was a new moon shot to cure cancer , sought by vice president joseph r biden jr , whose son beau died of brain cancer last year mr biden at one point hoped to include a major new initiative in the state of the union , but it has taken time to sort through the options and create a plan , so while it will be referred to in the speech , the vice president will wait to make a major rollout in the next few weeks white house officials said other ideas generated by the process would still be presented over the course of the year but they said mr obama decided to talk more broadly about the progress the country has made and the steps needed not just this year but for the next five to 10 years aides said he would talk about democracy and the importance of everyone participating he will follow up with a twoday trip to nebraska and louisiana , two republican states where he will urge governors to expand coverage as part of his health care program regardless of what s happening on the campaign trail , the president still has an impactful bully pulpit , ms psaki said what people have noticed over the last year despite their skepticism is that he s been willing to raise issues that have n't been in the public domain and they 've made their way onto the campaign trail
on the night of his resounding victory in the new hampshire primary , bernie sanders , the first jew ever to win a presidential nominating contest in american history , got uncharacteristically personal in his victory speech i am the son of a polish immigrant , he his frenzied crowd polish \? at one level , of course , it would be a redundancy of sorts for mr sanders to assert that he is a jew what else could bernie be \? every time i hear his voice , i am returned to passover seders where i 've often been cornered by one of my uncles pointing a finger at my chest and yelling about something very important i must listen to right now and i know i'm not alone even if mr sanders s jewishness is accepted as a given , the breakthrough aspect of his candidacy has been met with silence no talk of broken glass ceilings or firsts certainly , there has been none of the fanfare that greeted al gore s announcement in 2000 that he had an orthodox jew , joseph i lieberman , as his running mate \( chutzpah ! the cover of time magazine \) , let alone the thrill among africanamericans about the first black president this silence has to do with mr sanders and the kind of american jew that he represents one who privileges the universal over the particular , society over tribe when asked at last week s in milwaukee if he was worried about thwarting history by blocking hillary clinton s path to the white house , mr sanders mused that it would still be historic for somebody with my background to become president but the background he had in mind was probably his unwavering identification as a socialist it s an identity that derives from the jewish socialists at the turn of the last century whose embrace of a politics that strove for equality was also a way to escape from poverty and antisemitism in some ways , mr sanders is a bundist , one of those jewish but universalminded socialists who valued their own culture but were fiercely secular , rejecting zionism in favor of making a more equitable and just home for themselves whether in poland or america through solidarity with the rest of the working class if mr sanders s candidacy is a test of whether a purely economic argument pitched against the billionaire class can win out over identity politics and the culture wars , then it s also a test of his ability to promote this uniquely jewish invention , an ethnic identity that transcends its particularity despite briefly on a kibbutz in israel in the early 1960s , mr sanders has barely the jewish state during his political career you him stepping into a synagogue even on the requisite one day in a year he last rosh hashana campaigning , at jerry falwell s liberty university , no less making his life and career in vermont , a state with a very small jewish population , also meant that no one ever gave him a hard time for this detachment when the cnn host anderson cooper mr sanders about his jewishness at a recent town hall , the candidate s answer was telling my spirituality is that we are all in this together , he said when children go hungry , when veterans sleep out on the street , it impacts me that s my very strong spiritual feeling this does n't sound jewish , but it is it s an attitude born in eastern europe in the late 19th century and then brought to the slums of the lower east side , not long before mr sanders s father , eli , in this country in 1921 and settled in brooklyn jewish immigrants actively sloughed off the religion and traditional values of their parents and adopted socialism as a new kind of faith by the 1930s , most of this community transferred its loyalty into devoted support for president roosevelt and the new deal , championing a liberal ethos that still characterizes american jews today \( about 70 percent of whom reliably in general elections \) a purer socialism also lived on in this community longer than it did anywhere else , with the yiddish newspaper the forward , a mainstay of for america s socialist party through the 1920s and into the '30s \( the paper s radio station , wevd , was after eugene v debs , the perpetual socialist candidate for president \) leftwing intellectuals like irving howe carried on this thinking into midcentury , and howe himself was flummoxed by the identity politics that emerged on the left in the late '60s a distraction , he , from the essential problems of capitalism for many , mr sanders appears a throwback to this radical past , one that seems to leapfrog the generations my twitter feed during his victory speech in new hampshire lit up with people saying that they felt like they were listening to someone railing from a soapbox on delancey street in 1928 in other ways , though , even if he looks like a grandfather to his millennial supporters , he is actually representative of the direction the american jewish community is headed in those intervening generations , a majority of american jews have tried hard to balance their liberalism with an identity that was also connected to tradition and religion , through reform and conservative judaism , and an allegiance to israel but a by the pew research center suggests that the socialist worldview is winning out when asked what it means to be jewish , 69 percent of respondents answered leading an ethical life , and 56 percent chose working for justice and equality only 19 percent said it had to do with observing jewish law reflexive support for israel has also declined these trends , which include increasing intermarriage , might eventually mean that the attempt to create a specifically american jewish identity has largely been abandoned this could be one more reason the jewish establishment did n't greet mr sanders s historic win in new hampshire by hoisting him up in a chair like a joyous bar mitzvah boy they see in him a reflection of these dismal statistics but will mr sanders s radical universalism help his candidacy \? as the primaries head toward states with larger black and hispanic populations , his strategy against mrs clinton s longer relationships with those communities is to counter an appeal to group allegiance with his focus on income inequality there are some signs that this is working national polls a majority of young women are rejecting calls from clinton supporters to vote according to gender solidarity if mr sanders does becomes the nominee , however , his dream of realigning the electorate by regaining the white workingclass vote would require pushing past deeprooted historical grievances and cultural identities he would have to persuade american voters toward the universal over the particular , and the primacy of class over all other identities if anyone can do this , maybe a bundist can

mike huckabee \( rak \) , former governor , presidential candidate let me put that in context when i went to afghanistan , i saw a land that looked like the land of the flintstones it was desolate it was barren it was primitive and it s been that way for thousands of years they want to take the world back to be just like that we do n't we need to make a clear goal as to why we want to be anywhere in the middle east , and i 'll tell you why we want to be and need to be , is to destroy radical islam and everything that threatens civilization it s not just a threat \( applause \) huckabee to israel or to america , it s a threat to every civilized person on this earth and we need to be equipping not only the kurds in iraq , we need to be making sure that those who are willing to fight radical muslims will do it , but we need to never ever spend a drop of american blood unless there is a clearly defined goal and we ca n't make sure we win unless we have a military that s the strongest in the history of mankind we 've got to rebuild our navy it s the smallest navy we 've had since 1915 , when my grandfather got on a destroyer in world war i when he was in the us navy we 've got young men in air force b52s , one in particular , he s flying a b52 that his father flew in the '80s and his grandfather flew in the '50s those planes are older than me we 've got to have a military that the world is afraid of , use it sparingly , but when we do , the whole world will know that america is on their tail and they will be on their tail on the ground , never ever to rise up again \( applause \) regan governor huckabee , if i could just followup with that do we need to be in afghanistan \? huckabee only if there is a concerted effort to destroy the advance of radical islamists who are against us as far as what are we going to make it look like frankly , i do n't know what we can make it look like you ca n't create for other people a desire for freedom and democracy and frankly , that is not the role of the united states the role of the united states military is not to build schools , it is not to build bridges , it is not to go around and pass out food packets it is to kill and destroy our enemy and make america safe and that is the purpose we should be there if we 're going to be there regan thank you governor huckabee \( applause \) regan ms fiorina , nearly 600 women say they were attacked in a german city on new year s eve by men of arab or north african descent and 45 percent of those alleged attacks were sexual assaults twentytwo of those 32 men arrested so far are asylumseekers are you worried about similar problems in the united states \? fiorina of course i'm worried about similar problems in the united states we can not allow refugees to enter this country unless we can adequately vet them and we know we ca n't therefore we should stop allowing refugees into this country \( applause \) fiorina and by the way , we do not need to be lectured about why we 're angry and frustrated and fearful because we 've had an illegal immigration problem in this country for 25 years \( applause \) fiorina and we have every right to be frustrated about the fact that politicians stand up in election after election after election and promise us to fix the problem and yet , it has never been fixed i offer leadership that understands that actions speak louder than words , that results count we must secure our border we must fix our broken immigration system we must enforce a proamerican immigration system that serves our interests , not the rest of the world i understand what it takes to translate goals into results and that is what i will do as president of the united states of course , we should be worried , for heavens sakes this administration has now told us they do n't know who has overstayed a visa this administration has told us they do n't even bother to check facebook or twitter to find out who s pledging allegiance to jihadis we can do better than this , citizens we need to take our country back \( applause \) regan i want to stay with you on this the world shares a common enemy right now in the way of isis russia , the european union , saudi arabia , iran , china , we all agree isis is a threat and it must be stopped during world war ii , the world partnered with joseph stalin , who was arguably one of the most formidable despicable figures of the 20th century but they partnered with him to fight the nazis today , everyone seems to agree we need some kind of coalition to fight isis do you agree with that \? and if so , would your coalition include possibly , russia and iran \? fiorina we need to be very cleareyed now about who are our allies and who are our adversaries in the fight against isis , saudi arabia is our ally iran is our adversary and despite donald trump s bromance with vladmir putin , vladmir putin and russia are our adversary we can not \( applause \) fiorina we can not outsource leadership in the middle east to iran and russia we must stand and lead the kuwaitis , the jordanians , the saudis , egyptians , bahrainis \( sic \) , the emirates , the kurds i know virtually all of these nations and their leaders and they have asked us for very specific kinds of support bombs , material , arms , intelligence we are not providing any of it today i will provide all of it we have allies who will stand up and help us deny isis territory , which is what we must do to defeat them we must deny them territory they will help us do this and yes , we need a coalition but only in the united states of america can lead such a coalition i will lead it but we must be cleareyed through this fight iran is our adversary russia is our adversary we can never outsource our leadership only the united states of america can lead to defeat isis i will \( applause \) regan ms fiorina , thank you smith all right , thank you , candidates we 're just getting started jobs , homeland security , gun rights , all those issues are coming up straight ahead we 're live from north charleston and the republican presidential debate we 'll be right back \( commercial break \) \( applause \) regan welcome back , everyone , to the republican presidential debate on to the next round of questions sandra smith all right , let s get started senator santorum , to you first president obama has urged technology leaders to make it hard for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice hillary clinton says social media companies can help by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts the companies say that they 're already working with law enforcement and any proposed legislation would do more harm than good should companies like facebook and twitter be required by law to more actively be more actively engaged in fighting terror \? santorum i would just say that if we were doing a better job within the government , we would n't need the private sector to do the things that we 're asking them to do \( applause \) santorum i 've had a little experience in this in the private sector myself and what i found was a government with layers and layers of bureaucracy , of people who had some technical expertise but they had no authority , number one and one of the things i found out about in the bureaucracy is if a lot of people have authority , nobody has authority , number one and number two , that if you do n't do anything , you do n't get fired it s only when you do something and something goes wrong , you get fired so they do nothing and that s what is happening in our defense department right now we have a capability that they 're trying to develop to play defense we have a lot of technologists that are very skilled and they 're trying to figure out how to play defense but what we do n't have is we do n't have folks who are thinking about offense we do n't have warfighters we have technologists technologists are not warfighters technologists are thinking , how do i protect cybersecurity , how do i secure , how do i protect \? santorum and we need to have a much more dynamic , how do we how do we go after them \? how do we respond \? and we need leadership that s willing to make sure that when someone attacks us and ladies and gentlemen , they 're attacking us as we speak they 're attacking us all day every day , not just the government , but they 're attacking private sector companies all day every day they have to learn that we 're going to pay they 're going to pay a price when they do so and then right now , just like in every other aspect of our national security , people who attack us are not paying a price we need a leader who will make sure that they know when they mess with america , they 're going to pay a price smith senator , would you would you require anything of those companies like facebook and twitter if you were president \? santorum look , facebook and twitter can teach us things we can cooperate with them we can share ideas and information but this is a and this is a very dicey area for the government to go in and require the industry to do its job it needs to develop that capability we need to be have responsible dialogue , but i do n't think requirements are the order of the day smith thank you , senator \( applause \) regan ms fiorina , the president has just issued an executive order to expand the gun laws and background checks and none of you on stage agree with this but recent polls show the majority of americans are in favor of universal background checks \( boos \) unidentified male not in this room regan it s the poll data \( crosstalk \) fiorina and we all believe the polling data all the time , do n't we \? regan so tell me \( applause \) regan why , in your view , is the president s proposal a problem \? fiorina oh , it s a problem for so many reasons first of all , it is yet another lawless executive order you see , he does n't like the fact that congress has rejected his ideas twice on a bipartisan basis , so he s decided he just gets to override them sorry , mr president , not the way the constitution works secondly \( applause \) fiorina secondly , he basically admitted in that speech that he has n't been paying much attention to enforcing the laws we have he said , gee , we need a few more fbi agents that would have helped , perhaps , stop a tragedy here in south carolina with dylann roof , a guy who clearly never should have been sold a gun in other words , mr president , you 're right , we need to enforce the laws we have let s enforce the laws we have there are criminals running around with guns who should n't have them we do n't prosecute any of them less than 1 percent but i want to go back to the technology issue for a moment , if i may , as well , because in this regard , i disagree with senator santorum look , i come from the technology industry and i can tell you there is one thing that bureaucracies do n't know how to do they do not know how to innovate we have come seven generations of technology since 2011 we have bureaucracies that are incapable of bringing in that innovation so , yes , there are some very specific things that we should ask the private sector to help us with , including making sure we have the latest and greatest in algorithms to search through all these databases so that we find terrorists before they attack us , not after it s too late and , finally , when a president who understands technology in the oval office mrs clinton , actually , you cannot wipe a server with a towel \( applause \) regan ms fiorina , you 've said that was when you were ceo of hp , you actually worked with the government fiorina yes , and see regan to try and combat some of these terrorist threats fiorina as ceo of hewlett packard regan what did you do \? fiorina as ceo of hewlett packard , i was asked very specifically for some very real help the help i was asked to provide , this is now public information so i am not revealing what something that was was classified we had a very large shipment of equipment , software and hardware , headed to a retail outlet and i was called by the head of the nsa , who had an urgent need for that capability , to begin laying out a program to track terrorists we turned that truck around on a highway and it was escorted to the headquarters in san jose in world war ii , our government went to the private sector and said , help us do things that we cannot do the private sector has capabilities that the government does not have there are some legal authorities that are required the sony attack could have been detected and repelled , had legal authorities been passed in congress allowing private networks and public networks to work together those legal authorities have not yet been passed yes , i was asked to help \( rings bell \) fiorina i know the technology industry they will help again but they must be asked by a president who understands what they have regan ms fiorina , thank you \( applause \) smith all right , governor huckabee , you called president obama s executive orders on gun control unconstitutional and completely insane \( laughter \) \( applause \) huckabee \( laughing \) yes , i did smith you even told gun store owners to ignore the president s orders \( applause \) smith yet , innocent people are dying from gun violence in cities like detroit , chicago , and charleston everyday is there anything that can be done at the federal level to prevent guns from falling into the hands of criminals \? huckabee well , why do n't we start by making sure the justice department never does an idiotic program like fast and furious where the us government put guns \( cheering \) huckabee in the hands of mexican drug lords \( applause \) huckabee and end up killing one of our border agents you know , they want to talk about law abiding citizens , i just find it amazing the president keeps saying the gun show loophole there is no gun show loophole i promise you i 've been to more gun shows than president obama smith \( laughing \) huckabee and , i 've bought more weapons at them , and you fill out forms the president also says things that it s easier to get a gun now than it is to grow trees again , i purchase guns , and i can assure you that it is much more difficult to purchase a firearm than it is to get the ingredients of a salad at the supermarket what the president keeps pushing are ideas that have never worked ideas that would not have stopped san bernadino , sandy hook , aurora , and at some point you wonder if you keep retrying things that do n't work , maybe we should just see if we could resell all those used lottery tickets that did n't work real well because that s the logic of just keep doing the same thing , but something that has failed of course , we want to stop gun violence , but the one common thing that has happened in most mass shootings is that they happened in gun free zones where people who would have been law abiding citizens , who could have stood up and at least tried to stop it and we 're not allowed to under the law \( applause \) smith thank you , governor huckabee regan governor huckabee , an american in san bernardino murdered 14 people while terrorists with belgian and french passports murdered 130 people were facing a threat within our borders , and from outside the united states those european terrorists , they could have come here at any time given that we have a visa waiver program that enables people to travel back and forth it exists within those countries , and 36 others in countries around the world , including many in europe , cannot ensure that their citizens are not jihadists , why are we waiving the visa requirement at all \? huckabee well , we should n't be and that s one of the reasons that i think there a lot of voices in our country who are saying it s time to relook \( ph \) at the visa program the european union is a failure , it s not allowed for even the economic goals that they were trying to achieve but , what we 're not seeing is that it s making europe less safe , and it s proven not to be exactly what they all thought it was going to be our first and foremost responsibility in this country , and the first responsibility of the president of the united states is protect america , and protect americans we have a president who seems to be more interested in protecting the reputation and image of islam than he is protecting us and , i want to be very clear \( applause \) huckabee that this president \( cheering \) huckabee makes comments like he did the other night , that we have to be so careful because we do n't want to offend muslims he needs to read his own fbi crime stats from last year which would show him that of the hate crimes in the country , over 5 , 500 , about 1 , 100 were religious hate crimes and , of those , 58 were directed toward jews only 16 directed toward muslims maybe what the president should have talked about the other night is how we ought to be more careful in the antisemitic comments that are going toward american jews than toward muslims because by three times as many \( applause \) huckabee they 're being targeted for religious hate crime regan if you get the visa waiver program , does that shut down international commerce \? huckabee it does not shut down international commerce , but it may slow it down and , you do n't want to slowdown commerce that is making us safer it s worth it this lady who came and joined with the san bernardino killer had passed three background checks , and that s why a lot of americans did n't buy it when the president said we 'll bring in syrian refugees , but do n't worry we 'll check them out we have a lot of confidence in a president who told us that we could keep our doctor , we could keep our health insurance , and cost us less , and now the latest is if you like your gun you can keep it too , and frankly , we do n't buy it we do n't believe it he s lost his credibility , and his inept \( applause \) huckabee inability to work with congress and pass legislation has led him to do what i never even imagined doing as a governor , and that s just going and doing it my own way more huckabee that s why we elect a president , is to lead , is to be able to shepherd things through and if i can do it with a 90 percent democrat legislature in arkansas , there is no excuse for any president not being able to lead in washington if he knows what the heck he is doing when he gets there \( applause \) regan thank you , governor huckabee smith senator santorum , many of our military leaders believe america s critical infrastructure is vulnerable to a terrorist attack this is the power in our homes , the water we drink , the internet and phone systems by which we stay connected if attacked , these essential services that underpin american society could come to a grinding halt do you have a specific plan to protect us from this type of attack \? santorum well , the most devastating attack that could occur is an electromagnetic pulse attack , and that would be an attack that would be triggered by a nuclear explosion in the upper atmosphere of our country the best way to stop that from happening is to make sure that those who contemplating and actually wargaming and talking about using it , iran , does n't get a nuclear weapon so they ca n't explode that device \( applause \) santorum and the president of the united states has put iran on a path to a nuclear weapon and we have done nothing to do anything to harden our grid there is actually a bill in congress that would put money forward to try to put redundancy and harden our electric grid so it could actually survive an emp an emp is a devastating explosion that sends a pulse that knocks out all electric , everything , everything that is connected to any kind that is wired , that has a circuit board gets fried out everything is gone cars stop planes fall out of the sky this is a devastating attack and this president has done nothing , number one , to take the most probable person to probable country to launch an attack and stop them , and has done nothing to try to defend us , particularly our electric grid the bottom line is , i put the original sanctions on the iranian nuclear program when i was in the united states senate i 've been fighting for 12 years with one thing in mind , that we must stop iran from getting a nuclear weapon and \( applause \) santorum because they 're different than every other country they do not want a nuclear weapon to defend themselves they want a nuclear weapon to have theological ends to bring about their mahdi so they can control the world and that is the most serious threat facing this country right now \( applause \) smith senator santorum , i want to stay with you on this , moving to jobs and the economy in his state of the union address the other night , president obama touted his record on jobs , citing more than 14 million new jobs and boasted of nearly 900 , 000 manufacturing jobs added in the past six years do you dispute his track record of creating jobs \? santorum well , the numbers just do n't add up i mean , they have not added manufacturing jobs manufacturing jobs have been lost in this country , 2 million of them the bottom line is that this president has done more to take jobs away from the hardworking people who are struggling the most and that s folks who are , as i said , the 74 percent of americans who do n't have a college degree and they 're out there talking about , well , we 're going to provide free college for everybody well , who is going to pay for it \? the 74 percent that do n't have a college degree they 're not nobody is focused let s just be honest , nobody is focused on the people who are struggling the most in america today we talk about immigration talk about the president s immigration plan he wants to bring in more and more people into this country let people who are here illegally stay in this country almost all of the people who are here illegally , and most of the people who came here legally over the last 20 years , they 're working in wageearning jobs that is why wages have flatlined and we have unfortunately two political parties with most of the candidates in this field for some form of amnesty , some form of allowing people to stay here even though they 're here illegally and for increasing levels of legal immigration i'm someone who believes that we need to be the party that stands for the american worker and when we say we need to send people back , i mean we send people back and let me just make one point i was in storm lake , iowa , the other day , near a tyson s plant , 91 percent of the kids that go to the elementary school there are minority kids and they said , well , what are you going to do with all of these people , their families , they 've lived here for a long time \? i said , i'm going to give them a gift i'm going to give them a gift of being able to help the country they were born in merge adds xxx were born in santorum and i'm going to export america , the education they were able to see they learned english language they learned about capitalism they learned about democracy you want to stop flow of immigrants \? let s send six million mexicans , hondurans , guatemalans , el savadorians \( bell rings \) back into their country , so they can start a renaissance in their country so they wo n't be coming over here anymore \( applause \) regan senator santorum , thank you smith governor huckabee , former chairman of the joint chiefs , admiral mike mullen , has said the greatest threat to our security is our national debt our national debt is now on pace to top 19 trillion yet , you as well as ms fiorina have laid forward no plan to reform entitlements how can you say you 're going to pay down our country s debt without cutting social security or medicare \? huckabee well , first of all , let s just remember that social security is not the government s money , it belongs to the people who had it taken out of their checks involuntarily their entire working lives \( applause \) huckabee for the government to say , well it is fault of working people that we have a social security problem , no it is the fault of a government that used those people s money for something other than protecting those people s accounts so let s not blame them and punish them \( applause \) huckabee but here is a fact , and i sometimes hear republicans say well , we 're going to have to cut this and extend the age you know what i think a lot of times when i hear people say , well , let s make people work to their 70 that sounds great for whitecollar people who sat at a desk most of their lives you ever talk to somebody that stood on concrete floor for the first 40 years of their working life \? do you think they can stand another five years or 10 years , many of them will retired virtually crippled because they worked hard and we 're going to punish them some more \? i do n't think so here s the fact \( applause \) hucakbee four percent economic growth , we fully fund social security and medicare our problem is not that social security is just too generous to seniors it is n't our problem is that our politicians have not created the kind of policies that would bring economic growth and i still support strongly that we get rid of the 77 , 000 pages of the monstrous tax code \( applause \) huckabee pass the fair tax , supercharge this economy with the rocket fuel that happens with the consumption tax and we do n't have to cut social security to any senior who has worked their lifetime for it \( applause \) regan thank you , governor huckabee smith ok we 're going to continue this conversation we 're taking a quick break and then coming up , the candidates' plans for strengthening the middle class we 're live in north charleston with the republican presidential debate we 'll be right back more \( applause \) \( commerical break \) regan welcome back to the republican presidential debate live from north charleston we want to jump right back in sandra is kicking it off smith all right , thanks , trish well , let s get started with ms fiorina today , the middle class represents about 50 percent of the us population , down from about 61 percent back in 1971 that s according to pew research the same research revealed a widening income gap in america the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer what will you do to strengthen a middle class that is no longer the majority \? fiorina for decades , the professional political class in both parties has been talking about the middle class for decades , republicans in particular have been talking about reducing the size and scope of government , spending less money , reducing the complexity and yet , for 40 years , the government has gotten bigger and more expensive we now have a 75 , 000 plus page tax code , although politicians have run for office for decades promising reform and all the while , middle class incomes have stagnated you see , when government gets bigger and bigger , more powerful , the rich get richer , the poor get poorer and the middle class gets squeezed we need to understand who the job creators are in this country , because we need more jobs to grow the middle class and to grow the wages of the middle class who creates jobs \? small businesses , new businesses , familyowned businesses \( applause \) fiorina they create two thirds of the new jobs in this country and they employ half the people i started out typing for a nine person real estate firm my husband frank started out driving a tow truck for a familyowned auto body shop and we are crushing small businesses and destroying the middle class so here s my blueprint to take back america let us first actually reform the tax code from 73 , 000 pages down to three there s a 20yearold plan to do exactly that and then let us begin piece by piece to focus on every single dollar the government spends , so that we will spend less overall and still have enough for our priorities and that requires the government to budget the way you do at home examine every dollar , cut any dollar , move any dollar the fancy term for that is zero based budgeting , but i call it common sense citizens , we 've got to take our country back \( applause \) smith thank you , ms fiorina \( applause \) regan governor huckabee , you know it used to be you could graduate from high school and get a pretty good job at the local factory , enough to take care of your family and yourself those days seem to be gone it s pretty hard to do that nowadays businesses are increasingly turning to automation to increase their productivity levels it s happening right here , in fact , at the boeing factory in north charleston the president says automation threatens workers' ability to get higher wages do you agree with that \? and if so , do you have a solution \? huckabee let me go back to the reason so many people are having a hard time getting ahead the tax system punishes them think about this if you work really hard and you start moving up the economic ladder , you get bumped into a different tax bracket so the government thinks it deserves more of your hard work than you do and it s one of the reasons that no matter how many different reforms you have to a tax on people s productivity , you 're still taxing their work , their savings you 're taxing their capital gains , inheritance , dividends , you 're taxing everything that produces something and it s way i really believe it s time to do something bold , not something minute this is no time for a tap of the hammer , a twist of the screwdriver it s time for something big that s why the fair tax transforms our economy \( applause \) huckabee and we do n't punish workers it s the only way we 're going to get middle class people moving ahead again , because the harder they work , the more they keep no payroll tax deducted from their checks they get their entire paycheck \( applause \) huckabee and , one of the most important parts , it s built on the common sense with which we raised our kids , and trained dogs you reward behavior you want more of and , you punish behavior you want less of that s how i raise kids , it s how i trained our dogs , and folks , it s not that difficult we now punish the behavior we say we want more of by taxing it , and we reward the behavior that we say we want less of , so if you make a good investment , we punish you with a tax if you make a bad investment you can write that off and the rest of the taxpayers will help subsidize you , and bail you out \( applause \) regan thank you very much , governor huckabee senator santorum , 40 of babies born today are born to single moms that s twice as high as reported back in 1980 , and it s 11 times as high as in 1940 studies show that children are always better off economically , most often and emotionally , with two parents in a household from a policy perspective , should the government be doing anything to encourage family formation \? santorum you know , we 've had this debate about the economy , and we have n't talked the one issue now increasingly even the right , and even the are coming to agreement i 've run around doing 300 town hall meetings talking about a book written by a liberal harvard sociologist , not a normal thing for me to be talking about , but i now name robert putnam who wrote a book called , our kids and , he wrote this book , i think , ostensibly to support the democratic argument that the middle of america s hollowing out , and income gap is widening , and rich are getting richer when he studied all the information as to what was going on , he realized that the biggest reason that we 're seeing the hollowing out of the middle of america is the breakdown of the american family the reality is that if you 're a single parent a child of a single parent , and you grew up in a single parent family neighborhood , you went to that single parent family school , the chance of you ever , ever reaching the top 20 of income earners is 3 in america at least i do n't know about you , but that s not good enough and , we have been too politically correct in this country because we do n't want to offend anybody to fight for the lives of our children \( applause \) you want you want to be shocked \? you read the first few chapters of mr dr putnam' book he talks about port clinton , ohio and growing up there in the 1950 s , and how poor kids actually survived and did well , even though they were poor and disadvantaged but , then he goes to the towns today and these kids are failing , and failing miserably they do n't even have a shot , and we wo n't even have the courage to have leadership at the federal level not with legislation , but the most powerful tool a president have , the bully pulpit to encourage each and everyone of you , churches and businesses , and educators , and community leaders to let s have a national campaign to rebuild the american family , and give every child its birthright which is a mom and a dad who loves them that will change this economy \( cheering applause \) regan thank you smith thank you , senator we 're not finished yet more republican presidential debate in north charleston after this \( commercial break \) smith welcome back , it s time for the closing statements candidates will each get one minute , starting with senator santorum thank you very much , i want to thank the people of charleston , which has become a little bit of a second home to me , because i am very privileged to have two young men who go to the citadel here and they 're here tonight , my son john and my son daniel \( applause \) santorum ladies and gentlemen , america is frustrated and angry and looking for someone who s a fighter , but i also think they 're looking for someone who s a winner somebody who can go out there and take on the establishment and make a difference and take on someone who s going to be the person who s going to be between a republican holding the presidency and that s hillary clinton and there s one person on this stage , one person in the race who s done it and done it repeatedly i 've taken on hillary clinton on the issues you care about partialbirth abortion go and google rick santorum and hillary clinton and there you 'll see a fiveminute debate i 'll let you decide who won the debate i 'll tell you who won , because we passed the bill and i know i'm out of time but i'm going to take some of rand paul s time here for a second \( applause \) santorum if you 're looking for someone who fought hillary clinton on iran s sanctions , she was one of four who voted who s deciding vote who voted against iran s sanctions , so we did n't get it in place as earlier as we should have i 've fought battles against her in 1994 , i ran against the clinton machine james carville and paul begala , ran the race against me when i took on the author of hillary care and each one of those battles , i won you want a fighter , you want a winner , i 'd appreciate your vote thank you \( applause \) smith thank you , senator santorum governor mike huckabee hucakbee well , rick , i'm pretty sure i did also fight the clinton machine because every election i was ever in in arkansas , i assure you , they were behind it , helping finance and campaign for every opponent and i share with you the understanding that it s going to be a tough battle but i spent the first half of my adult life in the private and nonprofit sector , raising a family , understanding how tough it is for people to make it and that first half of my life is what led me to believe that america needs a different kind of leadership , not people who spent their whole life running from one office to the next , and living off the government dime and i got involved because i got sick of what i saw i also believe that there s got to be some leadership that not only addresses the monetary and military issues of this country , but the moral issues of this country at the end of every political speech , most of us say , god bless america but how can he do that when we continue to slaughter 4 , 000 babies a day \?

kiev , ukraine when she moved into her office as deputy speaker of parliament a little over a year ago , oksana i syroyid hung a large oil painting called the edge of the sky is glowing it shows a man turning his back on the viewer while flames burn on the horizon this , she said , is every oligarch and every russian agent who is still in  with her own fast burn of ambition , ferocity and style , ms syroyid of the centerright selfreliance party , a former law professor , has shot to the top of ukrainian politics a political insurgent , she has made a signature issue of derailing a peace agreement with and , in the process , may have eclipsed the former prime minister , , as the most powerful female politician in  a 39yearold native of the lviv region in the country s nationalist west , ms syroyid talks boldly about ukraine acting in its own interests , not those of outside powers we need to stop thinking of how to counter putin , or how to please all our partners , she said in a recent interview the question many here ask is whether ms syroyid , a relative newcomer , can somehow master the byzantine structure of ukrainian politics and emerge as the one to lead the country out of the morass of corruption and government dysfunction that threatens its future or , is she just another in a line of ambitious upstarts causing western governments their latest headache in ukraine and , possibly , taking the country down with her \? one thing is certain she is not afraid to take a stand to the dismay of western diplomats , ms syroyid \( pronounced seeroeed \) has blocked parliament from passing a constitutional amendment granting virtual autonomy to the separatist regions in eastern ukraine a central element of the that ended the hot war in ukraine a year ago last month , she pulled the selfreliance party out of the ruling coalition , inviting new parliamentary elections despite strong feelings in brussels and washington that ukraine is too unstable to go through another round of voting we have to be ourselves , she said in a recent interview and only if we are good at that will we have partners and friends a bookish , bespectacled expert on the ukrainian constitution , ms syroyid put away her professorial turtlenecks when she entered politics and now dresses to the nines , saying she is taking a cue from ms tymoshenko , the braided , crusading pioneer of female politicians in this patriarchal country she definitely is the brightest person in ukrainian politics , and not only among women , said ms syroyid , who earned a law degree in canada she is very stylish , and has a very feminine look at the same time she is known for her tough decisions none have been tougher than parliament s de facto rejection of minsk ii , which takes its name from the capital of belarus where president petro o poroshenko and russia s president , vladimir v putin , signed it , with french and german mediation ms syroyid , who entered parliament in 2014 , has emerged as the face of this rejection , unabashedly rallying her fellow members of parliament to stand fast against western pressure while politicians in russia and ukraine have taken turns blaming one another for stalling the implementation of minsk ii , ms syroyid has proudly taken credit after visiting ms syroyid last month , and again hearing she would not budge , germany s foreign minister , frankwalter steinmeier , said this week that the credibility of the minsk process was threatened both sides need to perform , he said under paragraph 11 of the accord , ukraine was supposed to adopt the constitutional amendment by the end of last year , but did not , as ms syroyid worked tirelessly to dissuade her colleagues from voting for it the change , ms syroyid said , would allow the kremlin to regain a foothold in ukrainian politics by requiring the central government to recognize , and integrate , the russianbacked leadership in the east it would , for example , allow the rebel leadership , with a track record of holding sham elections , to fill 14 vacant parliamentary seats in kiev until russian soldiers leave the donbas region , she says , ukraine should refuse any integration and call it an occupied territory russia wants to destabilize ukraine , she said this paragraph 11 of the minsk agreement is an instrument just like the war this is not for the sake of resolution of the conflict it is for the sake of destabilizing ukraine passage of the amendment requires a supermajority of 300 of parliament s 450 members , an allbutimpossible vote now that ms syroyid has unified the country s nationalist parties against the measure to her critics , the obstinacy of ms syroyid and her likeminded supporters in parliament is mindbogglingly irresponsible , the tantrum at the children s table after the adults of european statesmanship had prepared a healthy settlement this position stems from pure populism , oleh voloshyn , a consultant for the opposition bloc political party , said of her tactics he said ukraine had to face the reality that it was in the weakest possible position , having lost the war to russia and surviving on a financial lifeline from the international monetary fund there are two options you win the war , or you lose the war and when you lose the war , you have to negotiate that is the problem you do n't have any other alternative supporters say ms syroyid has the backing of ukrainian voters , whose anger at mr putin is often evident any rejection of his demands is likely to win the voters' favor besides , they say , mr putin needs a peace agreement now more than ever , to get the west to lift economic sanctions that are hurting his energydependent economy it s a difficult process not because of syroyid per se , but because the ukrainian public does n't accept it , said tymofiy s mylovanov , the president of the kiev school of economics the price is too high mr poroshenko agreed to the terms as russian army units and russianbacked rebels were closing in on a ukrainian force of about 5 , 000 soldiers cut off from resupply in debaltseve , a town in eastern ukraine in the talks mediated by chancellor angela merkel of germany and president fran ois hollande of france , the soldiers' lives were weighed against the cost of longerterm political concessions , some of which required passage in parliament but ms syroyid said that the russians never observed the ceasefire in debaltseve , and that under fire three days after it was to have taken effect the government has said 179 soldiers died in the battle , 81 went missing and 110 were captured , and ms syroyid says ukraine is on the moral high ground today in stalling on the political demands ms syroyid advocates abandoning the minsk deal and declaring rebel zones occupied territory , for russia to finance and feed , without a chance for integration until the russian army leaves this is not a victory it is just common sense , she said it was not easy , she said , finding a voice as a woman in europe s gravest military crisis in a decade the ambassadors of the united states , germany and france all pleaded for her to carry out the accord , lest war begin again men by definition are treated as the appropriate specialists , but a woman has to prove herself as a superspecialist , just to be treated as a normal specialist , she said but i knew all that before i came to parliament

givatayim , israel during a boisterous seder with her extended family , sabiha ziluf , 75 , paused and said softly that she could still see the baghdad streets of her childhood i would love to visit bab alsharji , she said , referring to an old neighborhood near where her aunt lived ms ziluf , whose first name translates roughly to morning in arabic , is one of countless iraqi jews in taking fresh interest in a heritage once considered unseemly , even shameful with tens of thousands of followers debate the fine points of iraqi jewish dialect , music and cuisine a near tel aviv has drawn daily crowds of more than 1 , 300 people during passover , and its number of yearly visitors has increased by more than 50 percent since 2011 among those viewing the center s reconstructions of the shops and crooked alleys of baghdad s old jewish quarter were swarms of children , generations removed from those who experienced babylon s allure firsthand they are heroes , liel ovadya , 13 , said of the jews of baghdad , who included his grandmother oshrat berko , who immigrated to israel at 15 as of 2014 , there were 227 , 900 jews of iraqi descent living in israel , according to government data families with ties to are among several communities of israelis from arabic and north african countries newly embracing their origins after struggling to be accepted by the ashkenazi jews of europe , who founded israel and for decades dominated its political , military and academic elites the resurgent interest comes as the number of jews in iraq has dwindled to nearly none , and as the islamic state and other hostile groups are sowing chaos in the streets , shrines and graveyards where jews lived , died and celebrated their faith for nearly three millenniums in recent interviews , many israelis pointed to two unlikely cultural icons dudu tassa , a 39yearold rock star , and eli amir , a 78yearold novelist as forces that have accelerated iraqi jews' efforts to preserve their past before it vanishes forever the dove flyer , a novel by mr amir , and the 2014 film based on it , culminate in the 1951 israeli airlift that brought nearly 110 , 000 jews to israel from iraq with little more than the clothes on their backs arriving shortly after the 1948 arabisraeli war , the newcomers largely suppressed their culture , mr amir said in an interview , because their language was the enemy language and their music was the music of the enemy this was a kind of a terrible wound that each and every one of us tried to handle differently , mr amir said his work , he said , was meant to put my visiting card on the table of every ashkenazi to let them know we did n't come from the desert and caves and trees that we came from a civilized country mr tassa , who was born in tel aviv , began an artistic journey that after discovering that his grandfather daoud alkuwaiti had been one of the most important composers in the arab world a 2011 film chronicling that journey had a catchy title  iraq s jewish history dates about 4 , 000 years to the birth of the biblical patriarch abraham in ur , where there is a shrine and archaeological digs long after abraham left for what was then called canaan , generations of jews were sent to exile in babylon , between the tigris and euphrates rivers in what is now iraq an ottoman census in 1917 counted 80 , 000 jews in baghdad out of 202 , 000 residents , a community that nissim rejwan , the author of the jews of iraq 3 , 000 years of history and culture , described as perhaps the wealthiest , and certainly the best educated in that era ali adeeb , who once worked for the new york times in baghdad and who now teaches at new york university , said that in the first half of the 20th century , jews were not only major forces in iraq s financial institutions , but also produced the nation s most renowned historian , most famous singer and most influential composers including mr tassa s grandfather and greatuncle iraqi jews had always been the targets of sporadic attacks but the danger soared with the rise of the nazis' influence in the 1930s as well as unhappiness around the arab world with zionism s push for a jewish state a pogrom in june 1941 , the farhud , killed nearly 200 jews in baghdad sammy smooha , 74 , a sociology professor at haifa university , said his father was stabbed repeatedly during the pogrom but survived by pretending to be dead , stirring only after he had been loaded onto a truck with other bodies this is the point where they realized there is no future in iraq , said lily shor , a guide and events manager at the babylonian jewry heritage center in or yehuda , outside tel aviv still , as mr amir describes in his work , there was disagreement among jews on whether to take the airlift to israel in 1951 thousands remained behind for those who left , a new challenge awaited , said dina zvi riklis , 66 , a tel aviv filmmaker starting over with nothing as a mizrahi the israeli term for jews from the middle east and north africa in a young country dominated by ashkenazis from eastern europe i told my mother not to speak to me in arabic , ms riklis said i denied that i came

iraq by the 1970s in 2008 , the new york times reported that emad levy , 51 , who came to israel in 2010 after a threat to his life , said he knew of just five jews in the city they are well , he said , protected by muslim friends but dealing with endless violence and an absence of any civic activity with jewish life all but extinguished in baghdad , ronit azouri , the general manager of the heritage center , said the institution was the only place you can see what it was like for jews in iraq one of the center s exhibits shows the iraqi version of charoset , a staple of the passover seder plate , using date honey and nuts , and a haggadah , the text guide to the seder itself , in iraqi jewish dialect largely drawn from arabic but written in hebrew letters professor smooha , who came to israel on the airlift when he was 9 , said some rapprochement between iraqi jews and their heritage had been occurring for more than a decade but he said he saw new changes in december , israel began offering a stipend of about 950 a year , as well as assistance with prescription medication , to those who were affected by the farhud \( along with those from algeria and morocco who suffered under the vichy government \) as for mr tassa , he said that in merging his grandfather s work with his own , he was forced to confront not only technical challenges but also his very identity at concerts , he said , he has been surprised to see three generations of audience , adding , the grandparents , the parents and the children all related to the show
since last weekend , armed men have been in control of the malheur national wildlife refuge in oregon incensed by the sentencing of local ranchers to jail time for burning public lands , the protesters want the federal government out of the land business their stated goal is to return the refuge to the locals so that people can reclaim their resources but this raises an important question why does justice demand that the land and resources belong to the locals instead of the commons \? what makes property private \? this is not a question germane only to a standoff in oregon it s a question that applies to each and every one of us if you re reading this , you probably own a smartphone you think you justly own your phone and that it s wrong for the government or anyone else to take it from you but why is your phone your private property \? you might say that you are entitled to it because the law says that you are entitled to it but that s a bad answer there are lots of cases where legal ownership and just ownership come apart you know full well that slave ownership was once legal , but you probably don t think it was just and if the law changed tomorrow to outlaw smartphones , you probably don t think that your entitlement to your phone would vanish you d think the government had made a mistake and that it would be ok to resist so what explains why some property is your private property \? an idea common among conservatives and surely an assumption of the protesters in oregon is that the past fully explains private property for example , perhaps you paid for your phone or were given it as a gift that s why you are entitled to it so in general we might say that if you paid for something or were given something , then you are entitled to it but is that true \? suppose i steal your car and sell it to my friend dugald is dugald entitled to the car because he paid for it \? you probably want to say no buying something doesn t give you entitlement unless the seller was entitled to the thing first so a transfer of property from one person to another is rendered illegitimate if the seller got the property through unjust means but now think back to your smartphone what are the chances that the money you used to buy your phone can be traced backward through your employer , your employer s customers , and so on back through history without passing through the hands of a serious injustice \? slim to none the same can be said for the seller s side of the transaction chances are excellent that your phone arrived in your hand only after the exploitation of workers , abuse of the environment , theft , fraud , human trafficking , or any number of dealbreaking injustices and , as the situation in oregon makes clear , deciphering the boundaries of private property for real estate is even more troubled eastern oregon was once populated by the northern paiute tribe like the history of your smartphone , the shift of property from the paiutes to the white settlers is surely marred with various injustices and if injustices render a transfer of private property illegitimate , then the protesters in oregon have little to complain about so far we ve only entertained an historical explanation of how private property gets transferred from one person to another but this raises a deeper question if history explains private property , how does anyone come to be entitled to previously unowned stuff in the first place \? this is a very hard question to answer we probably don t want to say that the first person to see or find something is thereby entitled to it that s the finderskeepers model of private property the united states certainly didn t want to say this a few years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the arctic seafloor and declared the oil reserves therein the property of the russian government and , again , the protesters in oregon should be handing the refuge over to the descendants of the first humans to find that land \( probably not members of the northern paiute tribe but some earlier group \) john locke one of the main philosophers to set out a theory of property entitlement agrees that the finderskeepers rule is too loose however , he claims that if a person finds an unowned resource , mixes his labor with that resource , and leaves enough and as good \( as good meaning enough of the same quality \) of the resource for others , then the person is entitled to that resource locke s theory informs much of the property law here in the united states take , for instance , water rights in the western part of the country the laws currently allocate water rights to people according to historical firstuse if a rancher pumped a certain amount of water out of the river back in 1875 , made good use of it , and left enough water in the river for downstream users at the time , then he gained a right to that same amount of water year after year but does allocating rights to resources in this way make sense \? locke s historical theory of initial ownership seems to raise more questions than it answers what does it mean to say that someone mixes his labor with something \? when i find an unowned field and fence it in , did i mix my labor with it \? that s how most of the land in the west was carved up and do i just get rights to the surface pasture or the mineral rights deep within the ground , too \? or suppose i find a beach and build a house on it did i mix my labor with the land \? how much of it \? just what is under the house \? and why is it that mixing my labor is a way of gaining property instead of simply losing my labor \? consider locke s second requirement on initial acquisition , namely that the appropriator leave enough and as good of that resource for others who want it the intuitive idea is something like this you can t take something out of the commons for your own private use unless you leave everyone else the same opportunity to appropriate a similar amount and quality of the resources for their own private use this is a sensible requirement but difficult to meet which others should count \? when british settlers first landed on north american shores , did they leave enough for everyone else in europe \? so despite its appeal to conservatives , the idea that history alone explains private property is hard to make good on on this theory , the mere fact that we were given things or paid for things won t determine whether we are entitled to those things at worst the historical theory implies that no one is entitled to any private property and if our property isn t legitimately private , it s hard to see how it s unjust for the government or anyone else to take it from us this is not to say that liberal views of private property don t face their own share of challenges they do but we should be honest about the intellectual bankruptcy of a prominent explanation for private property we need a theory of private property that makes sense if we are to make any progress on answering fundamental political questions about the disparity of wealth , taxation and the government control of land it takes more than a gun to make property private is an associate professor of philosophy at fort lewis college in durango , colo he works in ethics and philosophy of religion follow the new york times opinion section on and on , and sign up for the
houston if i were a pregnant woman living on the gulf coast or in florida , in an impoverished neighborhood in a city like houston , new orleans , miami , biloxi , miss , or mobile , ala , i would be nervous right now if mosquitoes carrying the zika virus reach the united states later this spring or summer , these are the major urban areas where the sickness will spread if we do n't intervene now , we could begin seeing newborns with and stunted brain development on the obstetrics wards in one or more of these places there are many theories for zika s rapid rise , but the most plausible is that the virus mutated from an african to a pandemic strain a decade or more ago and then spread east across the pacific from micronesia and french polynesia , until it struck brazil there , it infected more than a million people over the last one to two years today , the extremely poor cities of brazil s northeastern states make up the epicenter of the epidemic there are three reasons that zika has slammed this particular part of brazil the presence of the main mosquito species that carries the virus and transmits it to humans , aedes aegypti overcrowding and extreme poverty in crowded places , mosquitoes have lots of access to lots of people poor people often live in proximity to garbage , including old tires , plastic containers and drainage ditches filled with stagnant water , where this species of mosquito lives and breeds and they often have homes with torn screens on their windows the combination creates ideal conditions for the zika virus to spread the same factors are present in the poorest urban areas of coastal texas , louisiana , mississippi and alabama , in addition to south florida , and an area around tucson in the fifth ward of houston \( a historically africanamerican neighborhood that was populated by freed slaves after the civil war \) , just a few miles from the medical center where i work , there is an astonishing level of extreme poverty a brief tour reveals waterfilled drainage ditches in place of gutters , as well as evidence of dumping a common practice in which people toss old tires and other garbage into residential areas rather than designated landfill sites right next to shabby and crumbling housing these are also the major areas in the continental united states where aedes aegypti is found this mosquito has transmitted viruses such as and dengue throughout the gulf coast for centuries most recently , in 2003 , it transmitted an outbreak of dengue here in houston that was associated with at least two deaths it s only april , but temperatures are hitting the 80s in the afternoons , and aedes mosquitoes are already here by may or june we will start seeing those mosquitoes in much larger numbers i develop vaccines for neglected tropical diseases several zika vaccines are being created , but none will be ready in time for this year s epidemic in place of a vaccine we need a robust program of mosquito control and environmental cleanup in the poorest neighborhoods of our gulf coast cities and in florida this should include removing garbage and debris , and installing gutters to replace drainage ditches we need to improve access to , and provide pregnant women with proper window screens for their homes and information about the risk of zika finally , we will need to train teams to visit homes in poor neighborhoods and instruct occupants on how to empty water containers and spray for mosquitoes , just as we are doing now in puerto rico at the federal level this effort would need to bring in the environmental protection agency , the centers for disease control and prevention and the department of housing and urban development but we 'll also need parallel approaches at the state , county and city levels this coordination is labor intensive and will not be easy , but if we do n't start working now , by the end of the year , i am afraid we will see microcephaly cases in houston and elsewhere on the gulf coast this could be a catastrophe to rival or other recent miseries that disproportionately affect the poor zika is a potentially devastating health crisis headed for our region , and we might have only a few weeks to stop it before pregnant women become infected
waverly , iowa people might have gotten the wrong impression lately that is some kind of pointytoedbootwearing fancypants stop thinking that right now he owns a handgun on christmas eve , in fact , because he was just itching to buy one , he told new hampshire voters last week he played football in college and obsesses about it as a fan , as he makes abundantly clear in a he even married a miami dolphins cheerleader and no one would be harder on terrorists he would give them a oneway ticket to guant namo , where we 're going to find out everything they know mr rubio is radiating machismo on the campaign trail lately , lending lockerroom locutions to his pronouncements denigrating president obama s military strategy \( this is not a real war on terror this is a joke \) , or sizing up adversaries like vladimir v putin \( he smells weakness \) , or his dream choices for cabinet posts \( topflight talent from the new england patriots \) in fairness , mr rubio s conspicuously manly talk comes as rivals have tried to infantilize or even feminize him none more than gov of new jersey , who speculated recently that mr rubio would get creamed by hillary clinton in a general election she 'll pat him on the head and then cut his heart out on monday , mr christie again spoke of the 44yearold mr rubio as if he were a child , telling fox news , this is a firstterm senator who still is learning where the men s room is in the senate , let alone figuring out how to lead a country and then there was the hyperventilation online over mr rubio s sleek new boots a 135 , highheeled , black leather pair of florsheims given to him by his wife for christmas senator rand paul mocked them as cute jeb bush s  showing someone prancing around in a pair similar to mr rubio s to the tune of the nancy sinatra recording these boots are made for walkin' one of these days , young marco s going to flipflopflip on you , the singer says , ignoring the fact that the fuss was about boots , not flipflops the machoization of mr rubio seems aimed not just at blunting the emasculating broadsides from his republican rivals , who are uniformly older \( if only by a few months , in senator ted cruz s case \) it projects a toughmindedness intended to answer a nagging question among the party s voters can a babyfaced firstterm senator handle the challenges of the presidency in a gritty political moment \? the answer from the heatpacking , waterboarding , footballtossing florida senator \? yes , he can in claremont , nh , on friday night , mr rubio expounded in elaborate detail on how he could exercise the powers of the presidency to undermine the new england patriots , a longtime nemesis of his beloved but lately muchlamented hometown team , the dolphins his mischievous plan sideline tom brady , the star patriots quarterback , by recruiting him to a rubio white house i am appointing that dude to the cabinet , he said , to loud laughter he was not finished he would deport rob gronkowski , the patriots' formidable tight end the crowd gasped in mock horror belichick , he added , referring to the patriots' head coach , would be defense secretary or something he 'll be blitzing isis it will be awesome occasionally , his sharper message is landing flat with some fans did you hear him say he wanted to torture people \? asked jon lubecky , 39 , an army veteran who heard the senator speak last week in mount pleasant , sc mr lubecky said he largely liked what he heard until the line about sending captured terrorists to guant namo bay , which has become standard in mr rubio s speeches you 've got cruz saying he s going to carpet bomb the middle east rubio saying he 'd torture people , mr lubecky added and trump who wants to nuke everybody the pumpedup guy talk including increasingly addressing his listeners with the familiar guys calls to mind the ways candidates in both parties have sought to project virility or toughness in recent years mitt romney , like john kerry before him , tossed a football on the tarmac , alloying his patrician bearing with regularguy athleticism \( though mr kerry also harmed himself by being photographed windsurfing off nantucket and snowshoeing in sun valley , neither exactly a lunchpail pursuit \) sarah palin forever extolled her expertise at hunting and fishing and mr cruz has donned face paint and full camouflage this year to go hunting with the star of duck dynasty , phil robertson , who explained his criteria for supporting a candidate would they kill a duck and put him in a pot and make him a good duck gumbo \? he asked i 've looked at the candidates , mr robertson said ted cruz is my man if mr rubio seems especially eager to display his masculinity , he is also having fun speaking to voters here on monday , where 150 people braved subzero temperatures to see him , the senator was ready with a joke when someone in the audience goodnaturedly brought up the boots they sold out of those boots online , he said proudly they 're made in wisconsin florsheim ! you know what that means \? that means i did more for american business in one week than barack obama did in seven years ! \( the boots are on backorder in most sizes until next month \) in truth , there is nothing especially effete about mr rubio he has always embraced his workingclass , immigrant roots he often recalls his financial struggles to repay his , and to raise four children though more recently he has earned enough to fulfill lifelong dreams like buying a boat while he has yet to shoot anything during this campaign , unlike mr cruz , it is probably also unlikely that mr rubio will be shot on film doing anything really fancypants , like windsurfing or snowshoeing , anytime soon
cairo since king salman of saudi arabia arrived in cairo on thursday for a fiveday visit , the leader of the oilrich kingdom has lavished his egyptian allies with promises of aid and investment but this time , instead of writing a blank check with little more than a polite thank you to show for it , king salman will return home monday with something more substantial in return two islands in a strategic corner of the red sea s cabinet announced on saturday that it was transferring sovereignty of tiran and sanafir , arid and uninhabited islands at the mouth of the gulf of aqaba , to the cabinet tried to suggest that the transfer , pending approval from parliament , merely returned saudi arabia s own territory saudi arabia tiran and sanafir to egyptian control in 1950 amid concerns that israel might seize them the announcement elicited vivid protests from egyptians who have for decades considered the islands to be egyptian land and it set off a debate over whether president abdel fattah elsisi had made a humiliating concession to a wealthy ally in , critics called mr sisi awaad , referring to a character in an old egyptian song who had sold his land a shameful act in the eyes of rural egyptians the island is for a billion , the pyramids are for two , and they come with two gift statues on top ,  a small demonstration erupted in tahrir square , the site of the 2011 protests that led to the ouster of president hosni mubarak at least five people were arrested there on sunday , an interior ministry official said whatever the legal situation , the optics of this move are terrible , said samer shehata , an associate professor of middle east studies at the university of oklahoma , referring to the transfer of the two islands here you have salman coming to egypt , pledging billions of dollars in aid and investment , and in exchange these islands are handed over , professor shehata said it seems to many egyptians that the president is selling land for saudi riyals mr sisi has faced unusually sharp criticism recently for his and the death of an italian graduate student , as censure of the islands deal grew , supporters of mr sisi came to the president s defense , chiding egyptians for lamenting the fate of islands few had ever visited all of a sudden , everyone is acting as if they were vacationing there , when none had gone anywhere near it , the television presenter amr adeeb said in an impatient outburst on his show , al qahera al youm king salman s visit has dominated life in cairo for days , exacerbating the city s notoriously snarled traffic as he attended meetings at the presidential palace and visited the ancient al azhar mosque egyptian and saudi officials signed at least 15 agreements during the king s visit , including a development package for sinai and an oil deal worth 22 billion to egypt over five years , state news media reported the transfer of the two islands , which are less than five miles from the coastlines of both countries , was the product of a sixyear negotiation over maritime boundaries , officials said the islands' value is mostly strategic , and they have been unoccupied except for a handful of soldiers , usually american , stationed on tiran as part of the 1979 peace agreement between israel and egypt political analysts said it was surprising that mr sisi had agreed to transfer the islands , given sensitivities in egypt to surrendering land to foreigners critics accused president in 2013 of plotting to give part of sinai to the group hamas after mr sisi came to power that year in a military takeover , he introduced a clause in the constitution that explicitly prohibited ceding egyptian territory the irony of the post2013 regime ceding tiran to saudi arabia after having inserted this clause will not be lost on those with any political memory of the controversies of morsi s year in office , nathan brown , a scholar at george washington university , said in an email for mr sisi , losing the islands might be worth it for the potential diplomatic gains since 2013 , saudi arabia has propped up egypt s ailing economy by injecting at least 12 billion into egyptian coffers tensions between the countries have grown in recent months , with saudi arabia angered by egypt s reluctance to follow its aggressive military policies in yemen and syria at the end of the day , this is not a hugely important concession for egypt , said michael wahid hanna , a senior fellow at the century foundation in new york but it does show that sisi sees the saudi relationship as a fence that needs mending
if you took every nightmare anyone ever had , multiplied it by every propaganda trope ever invented and made it into a horror movie , you would end up with something like what happened in moscow last week sometime between 10 00 and 11 00 last monday morning firemen who had put out a blaze in an apartment in a large building discovered the body of a toddler among the debris the child had been beheaded a short time later , a woman dressed in black was seen at a nearby subway station she was screaming , allahu akbar ! i am a terrorist ! i hate democracy ! i will blow all of you up ! she was brandishing the severed head of a child according to various news accounts , the grisly scene stretched out for a while , perhaps as long as 40 minutes police finally apprehended the woman she was identified as gulchekhra bobokulova , a 38yearold woman from the central asian country uzbekistan , a former soviet republic in the afternoon and evening , scant details emerged , breaking the heart further the dead child was a fouryearold girl she had been injured at birth and was developmentally delayed her parents had struggled to give her the best available care and education russia is a society where specialneeds children are often ignored the couple had one other child they also had a chihuahua , and it was now missing the girl apparently was beheaded before the apartment was set on fire the parents had left their home just a short time earlier , leaving their daughter in the care of ms bobokulova , who had been working for the family for 18 months how does one tell a story like this , one that brings together every worst fear and can reinforce every worst prejudice \? a few people made early attempts several russian bloggers pointed out that hundreds of russian children die of abuse every year these cases include a oneyearold thrown out a ninthfloor window in moscow in january , apparently by parents who wanted to drink without distraction in february , a sevenyearold was killed by his mother in tomsk , ostensibly because he was not doing his homework russia has a children s rights ombudsman , and he looked at things from a different angle he hinted that the parents were to blame , tweeting when hiring a nanny for your child , you should at least make sure that she is mentally healthy , demand a note from a psychiatrist and a medical exam ! there was also the perspective of the president s civic council , the kremlin s overseer of all ostensibly unofficial activity , which suggested honoring the police officers who had apprehended the nanny even as bloggers raged about how long it took them the story seemed to offer so many possibilities for russian television , which has raised hatred and fearmongering to an art form it was a unique chance to play up the fear of migrants , whom russians , and muscovites especially , love to blame for all their ills you could also tap the fear of terrorism , specifically the fear of blackclad women wearing hijabs threatening to blow themselves up , as the woman had been such women have figured or have been said to figure in several terrifying terrorist attacks in moscow then the murder raised the need to protect children , the central unifying theme of all russian propaganda all three motifs could even be combined , as russian television has sometimes done with gusto , for example when reporting a recent story of a russiangerman girl who said she had been kidnapped and raped by migrants in berlin the story turned out to be fabricated what would russian tv do with this story \? which of the many narratives would it choose \? which political message would it bring to the forefront \? none none of the russian broadcast channels said a word about the gruesome murder or the woman who had terrorized a neighborhood walking around with the severed head of a child , or the pilgrimage that followed to the place where she was detained , where people came to lay hundreds of flowers and stuffed animals the russian news site rbk reported that the channels had been instructed to omit the story the only possible source of such instructions the kremlin denied those reports president vladimir v putin s press secretary , dmitry s peskov , claimed that each television channel had made the decision independently the kremlin just happened to think it was the right decision some stories are just too terrible to tell when you have perfectly obedient media willing to speak with a single voice , you have the luxury of eliding such stories moscow s most experienced propagandist is vladimir posner western television viewers may remember him as the talking head who defended the soviet union in perfect english back in the 1980s mr posner issued a statement in support of the decision not to report the severedhead story why show it \? what s the point \? what for \? these are telling questions russian journalists loyal to the kremlin , like the russian government , view the media as a propaganda vehicle when they consider running a story , they think primarily about the impact it would have what was the impact of those copious reports on the rape that never happened in berlin \? in the mind of propagandists , it served to inflame antiwestern sentiment in russia and antirefugee sentiment in germany in their imagination and perhaps only there those kinds of stories wreak havoc in european societies propagandists do n't want to wreak havoc in russia , and that s enough to keep the severedhead story off tv screens it does n't occur to russian television executives that their job is to report what happens
houston after more than two decades , the has found its way back to los angeles the will move to the los angeles area , where they intend to build a new , nearly 3 billion stadium in an entertainment complex in inglewood , calif , just over 10 miles from downtown the will have the option to join them as soon as next season , and if they decline , the oakland raiders could make the move the rams , who played in the los angeles area for decades , will give the area its first nfl team since 1995 , when they moved to st louis , followed by the raiders , who left los angeles a few months later that year for oakland owners for both teams could not agree with civic leaders on new or refurbished stadiums the announcement came on tuesday after a series of private meetings spread over 12 hours here among some of the biggest titans of industry , including robert a iger , the chairman of disney paul allen , the microsoft cofounder and now owner of the seattle seahawks and e stanley kroenke , the owner of the rams , whose fortune derives in part from the walton family of walmart fame , hashed out the move that had eluded the league for two decades we have the return of the los angeles rams to their home , the nfl commissioner , roger goodell , said in a news conference , looking tired after a day of marathon meetings and deliberations we have a facility that is going to be absolutely extraordinary , and that is going to set a new bar flanked by the chairmen of the los angeles opportunities committee , bob mcnair of the houston texans and art rooney of the pittsburgh steelers , goodell said that the facility in inglewood was more than just a stadium and would be a signature product moving two nfl teams at once to the same city is unprecedented , and if the chargers join the rams , they will be the second current pair to share a stadium , after the jets and the giants , who moved to metlife stadium in east rutherford , nj , in 2010 the return to los angeles fills a void for the nation s most popular sport , which has enjoyed explosive growth over the past two decades even without a team there over the years , some of los angeles s biggest power brokers , including the entertainment mogul michael ovitz , the philanthropist and developer eli broad and the supermarket magnate ron burkle , had made overtures to the league for a team , to no avail the decision , in a 302 vote among the league s 32 team owners , comes after more than a year of often acrimonious lobbying by the chargers , the raiders and the rams , who each applied to move to the los angeles area last month because , they said , they were unable to get enough public support to build new stadiums in their markets at least 24 owners had to vote in favor of the move for it to gain approval st louis fans reacted with anger , and civic leaders said the nfl disregarded their efforts to keep the team it is troubling that the league would allow for the relocation of a team when a home market has worked in good faith and presented a strong and viable proposal , gov jay nixon of missouri said in a statement this sets a terrible precedent not only for st louis , but for all communities that have loyally supported their nfl franchises los angeles leaders exulted the water drought is still with us , but the los angeles football drought is over , mayor eric garcetti said in an interview he added , i think there is tremendous excitement in la i can feel it in the streets that remains to be seen with los angeles the nation s secondlargest television market , the nfl has longed for a return to the area , where several super bowls have been played but taxpayers' apprehension on financing stadiums or difficulties acquiring suitable sites have stymied previous efforts to put a team there los angeles football fans also have a reputation for being among the most blas about following their teams although civic leaders have chafed at the absence of a team , there has never been a strong outcry from the populace , in part because games from every other nfl city are readily available on television some owners favored letting only one team move to los angeles because they did not believe two teams could be successful there right away still , three teams were willing to bet the attraction was strong and applied to move to los angeles , with the teams' owners planning to foot all or most of the bill for stadiums the rams will build a glassroofed stadium that could cost nearly 3 billion , easily the most expensive building in sports if an agreement is reached between the rams and the chargers , the rams will play temporarily at the los angeles memorial coliseum previously the home to the rams , the chargers and the raiders and the site of two super bowls , including the first , in 1967 starting in august 2016 where the chargers would play temporarily is unclear my goal from the start of this process was to create the options necessary to safeguard the future of the chargers franchise while respecting the will of my fellow nfl owners , dean spanos , the chairman of the chargers , said in a statement i will be working over the next several weeks to explore the options that we have now created for ourselves to determine the best path forward for the chargers kroenke who also owns the colorado avalanche of the nhl , the denver nuggets of the nba and arsenal of the english premier league has already acquired the land and rights to build in inglewood the rams are expected to pay the league a relocation fee of 650 million , stretched out over about 20 years the chargers originally teamed with the raiders , but that partnership fell apart when the rams' proposal won 20 votes at a ballot earlier tuesday at that point , the other owners pressured the chargers to work out a deal with the rams in inglewood in 2014 , kroenke bought a 60acre tract in inglewood , and he later added land where the old hollywood park racetrack stood last january , he announced plans to build a domed stadium surrounded by an entertainment district weeks later , the chargers , who say that a quarter of their fans come from los angeles and orange county , said they would build an outdoor stadium in carson with the raiders the chargers and the raiders also recruited iger , the chairman of disney , to serve as an honorary executive and help plan the stadium in the end , iger s expertise and connections in the entertainment business were not enough to reassure other owners that the stadium in carson could outdo the proposal in inglewood the raiders will presumably begin fresh negotiations with the city of oakland over a new stadium libby schaaf , the mayor , has said the city cannot afford to help build a stadium , but it could provide the land and infrastructure improvements needed for one on tuesday , she welcomed the chance to restart talks with the team los angeles has had professional teams for decades , and the chargers , the raiders and the rams have all played in the city at some point the chargers , a charter member of the afl , left los angeles for san diego after one season los angeles has long been a favorite of the league , and the league has been eager to have such a marquee city again on its map in 1996 , the seahawks toyed with moving to southern california , but the team was sold to allen , who helped build a new stadium for the team in seattle three years later , the league wanted to add a 32nd team , but when los angeles and the nfl could not agree on a stadium site , the owners awarded the franchise to houston in the years afterward , proposals were offered to build stadiums in downtown los angeles , in nearby city of industry and elsewhere but none of the investors were able to persuade an nfl team to move into a stadium that it did not control nevertheless , the absence of a team in los angeles was used as a bargaining chip by teams trying to build stadiums in their home markets the minnesota vikings , among other teams , have floated the idea of moving to los angeles as a way to win public funding for a stadium although the nfl has not had a team in los angeles in recent years , it has kept a foothold in that region nfl network is headquartered in culver city , the owners have held meetings in the area , and the dallas cowboys hold their training camp in oxnard television ratings for nfl games are also strong in the region the nfl has expanded rapidly in the two decades since the raiders and the rams left , which has led some to posit that the league did not need to return to los angeles the city has two big college teams , and fans from all over the country have moved to the region and root for an array of teams from elsewhere some sports business experts have suggested that placing a team in los angeles does not guarantee success los angeles is merely the latest return destination for the nfl the league has put a team back in every city it has left in the past few decades , including baltimore , cleveland , houston , oakland and st louis , and generally succeeded

carson well , you know , when i was n't introduced no 2 , as was the plan , i thought maybe he thought i already had dropped out but \( applause \) but you know , today is the 105th anniversary , or 105th birthday of ronald reagan his 11 commandment was not to speak ill of another republican so , i'm not going to use this opportunity to savage the reputation of senator cruz \( applause \) but i will say i will say i will say that i was very disappointed that members of his team thought so little of me that they thought that after having hundreds , if not thousands of volunteers and college students who sacrificed their time and were dedicated to the cause one even died to think that i would just walk away ten minutes before the caucus and say , forget about you guyscarson i mean , who would do something like that \? now , i do n't think anyone on this stage would do something like that and to assume that someone would , what does that tell you \? so , unfortunately , it did happen it gives us a very good example of certain types of washington ethics washington ethics washington ethics basically says , if it s legal , you do what you need to do in order to win that s not my ethics my ethics is , you do what s right muir senator cruz \( applause \) muir dr carson , thank you senator cruz , you have said that dr carson and his wife have become friends of yours i'm curious as why you did n't call ahead of time to either the doctor or his wife or have your campaign check in with the other campaign before sending out those messages cruz ben is a good and honorable man and ben and candy have become friends he has an amazing life story that has inspired millions , including me when this transpired , i apologized to him then and i do so now ben , i'm sorry let me tell you the facts of what occurred for those who are interested in knowing on monday night , about 6 30 pm , cnn reported that ben was not going from iowa to new hampshire or south carolina rather , he was , quote , taking a break from campaigning they reported that on television , cnn s political anchors , jake tapper and dana bash and wolf blitzer , said it was highly unusual and highly significant my political team saw cnn s report breaking news and they forwarded that news to our volunteers , it was being covered on live television now , at the time , i was at the caucuses , i was getting ready to speak at the caucuses just like ben was , just like everyone else was i knew nothing about this a couple hours later , i found out about it i was told that ben was unhappy i called him that evening because i respect him very , very highly i did n't reach him that evening \( bell rings \) i reached him the next day and apologized he asked me then , he said , ted , would you make this apologize in public \? i said , yes , i will and i did so i regret that subsequently , cnn reported on that they did n't correct that story until 9 15 that night so from 6 30 pm to 9 15 , that s what cnn was reporting subsequent to that initial report , ben s campaign put out a statement saying that he was not suspending his campaign i wish that our campaign staff had forwarded that statement they were unaware of it , i wish that they had , that s why i apologized muir senator cruz , thank you we 're going to move on here back to the issues carson since i was mentioned muir dr carson , please carson this is great you guys i want you all to mention me when you say something \( laughter \) in fact , the time line indicates that initial tweet from cnn was followed by another one within one minute that clarified that i was not dropping out so , what happened to that one , it is unclear but the bottom line is , we can see what happened , everybody can see what happened and you can make your own judgment muir dr carson , thank you thank you , doctor senator rubio i want to stay on the issue of readiness to be president and experience and questions about you being a firstterm senator governor christie warning voters here in new hampshire against voting for another firstterm senator as america did with barack obama in 2008 arguing that you are , quote , not ready to be president of the united states and senator santorum , who we all know , dropped out of the race and endorsed you , had a hard time when asked on national television , listing your accomplishments as senator tonight , what are your accomplishments in the senate that demonstrate you are ready to be president of the united states \? rubio well , let me say , from protecting the people of florida from imminent domain abuse , to bringing accountability to the va , to the girls count act , to sanctioning groups , i'm proud of my service in the united states senate and before that , in the florida legislature i will say , if politics becomes and the presidency becomes about electing people who have been congress or in the senate the longest , we should all rally around joe biden he s been around 1 , 000 years he s passed hundreds of bills and i do n't think any of us believe joe biden should be president of the united states and let s dispel once and for all with this fiction that barack obama does n't know what he s doing he knows exactly what he s doing barack obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country , to make america more like the rest of the world that s why he passed obamacare and the stimulus and doddfrank and the deal with iran it is a systematic effort to change america when i'm president of the united states , we are going to reembrace all the things that made america the greatest nation in the world and we are going to leave our children with what they deserve the single greatest nation in the history of the world muir senator rubio , thank you \( applause \) muir i do want to ask governor christie , governor christie , you said fool me once , shame on you fool me twice , shame on me when it comes to electing a firstterm senator you heard senator rubio make the case that he does have the experience your response \? christie sure first , let s remember something every morning when a united states senator wakes up , they think about what kind of speech can i give or what kind of bill can i drop \? every morning , when i wake up , i think about what kind of problem do i need to solve for the people who actually elected me \? it s a different experience , it s a much different experience and the fact is , marco , you should n't compare yourself to joe biden and you should n't say that that s what we 're doing here is exactly what we 're doing you have not be involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable you just simply have n't \( applause \) and the fact is the fact when you talk about the hezbollah sanctions act that you list as one of your accomplishments you just did , you were n't even there to vote for it that s not leadership , that s truancy \( applause \) and the fact is that what we need to do what we need to have in this country is not to make the same mistake we made eight years ago the fact is it does matter when you have to make decisions and be held accountable for them it does matter when the challenges do n't come on a list of a piece of paper of what to vote yes or no every day , but when the problems come in from the people that you serve i like marco rubio , and he s a smart person and a good guy , but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the united states and make these decisions we 've watched it happen , everybody for the last seven years , the people of new hampshire are smart do not make the same mistake again rubio if i may respond to that \( applause \) muir governor , thank you senator rubio \? rubio well , i think the experience is not just what you did , but how it worked out under chris christie s governorship of new jersey , they 've been downgraded nine times in their credit rating this country already has a debt problem , we do n't need to add to it by electing someone who has experience at running up and destroying the credit rating of his state but i would add this let s dispel with this fiction that barack obama does n't know what he s doing he knows exactly what he s doing he is trying to change this country he wants america to become more like the rest of the world we do n't want to be like the rest of the world , we want to be the united states of america and when i'm elected president , this will become once again , the single greatest nation in the history of the world , not the disaster barack obama has imposed upon us muir senator rubio , thank you i want to bring in governor bush on this , because you christie hold on one second muir have made this christie excuse me muir if you 'd like to respond to economic christie i think he mentioned me and my record in there , so i think i get a chance to respond you see , everybody , i want the people at home to think about this that s what washington , dc does the driveby shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him \( applause \) see marco marco , the thing is this when you 're president of the united states , when you 're a governor of a state , the memorized 30second speech where you talk about how great america is at the end of it does n't solve one problem for one person they expect you to plow the snow they expect you to get the schools open and when the worst natural disaster in your state s history hits you , they expect you to rebuild their state , which is what i 've done none of that stuff happens on the floor of the united states senate it s a fine job , i'm glad you ran for it , but it does not prepare you for president of the united states \( applause \) muir senator rubio \? rubio chris chris , your state got hit by a massive snowstorm two weeks ago you did n't even want to go back they had to shame you into going back and then you stayed there for 36 hours and then he left and came back to campaign those are the facts here s the bottom line this notion that barack obama does n't know what he s doing is just not true he knows exactly what he s doing christie there it is there it is the memorized 25second speech there it is , everybody rubio well , that s the that s the reason why this campaign is so important because i think this notion i think this is an important point we have to understand what we 're going through here we are not facing a president that does n't know what he s doing he knows what he is doing that s why he s done the things he s done that s why we have a president that passed obamacare and the stimulus all this damage that he s done to america is deliberate this is a president that s trying to redefine this country that s why this election is truly a referendum on our identity as a nation , as a people our future is at stake this election is not about the past it is about what kind of country this is going to be in the 21st century , and if we elect someone like barack obama , a hillary clinton , a bernie sanders or anyone like that , our children are going to be the first americans to inherit a diminishes country that will not happen if i'm elected muir governor christie , we will we will bush chris , why do n't you mention my name so i can get into this christie you know what the shame is you know what the shame is , marco \? the shame is that you would actually criticize somebody for showing up to work , plowing the streets , getting the trains running back on time when you 've never been responsible for that in your entire life rubio chris , you did n't want to go back you did n't want to go back \( applause \) christie and the fact is , i went back , it got done and here s rubio you did n't want to go back , chris christie oh , so wait a second is that one of the skills you get as a united states senator esp also \? because i do n't think it is rubio chris , everybody you said you were n't going to go back he told everyone he was n't going to go back they had to shame him into going back and when he decided to go back , he criticized the young lady , saying , what am i supposed to do , go back with a mop and clean up the flooding \? christie it gets very unruly when he gets off his talking points muir governor christie thank you , governor i will mention listen rubio it s your record , it s not a talking point muir listen , people \( applause \) muir governor bush , i 'll mention your name so that you can come in on this bush i appreciate that , i really do , thank you muir i want to bring you in on this because you 've made this central to your campaign right here in new hampshire in the last couple of days four years ago you said of senator rubio , he was ready to be vice president you spoke of his experience as well you said he has the fortitude to be a good president , but just this week you said senator rubio accomplished , quote , nothing in the senate how do you square the two \? bush well , first of all he said the exact same thing about me , that i would make a great vice presidential nominee when mitt romney was considering i said the same thing about marco i think we were both right at the time , and mitt picked somebody else so , let s move on to the 2016 race who has the leadership skills \( applause \) bush who has the leadership skills to lead \? and , i'm proud of the fact that i have 12 medal of honor recipients , over 30 admirals and generals that believe that i would be a steady hand as commander in chief that i serve as governor of the state of florida where we cut taxes and reduced government i took on very powerful interests , forged consensus , fought for my beliefs , implemented them and the state was better off we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months the whole state was turned upside down it required a steady hand leadership you learn this , you learn it by doing it it s not something that you just go up , and on the job do it \( applause \) bush it s not the same look , let s be clear marco rubio is a gifted , gifted politician , and he may have the skills to be a president of the united states , but we 've tried it the old way with barack obama , with soaring eloquence and we got we did n't get a leader we got someone who wants to divide the country up the next president \( bell ringing \) bush going to have to forge consensus to bring about a set of common purposes so that we can move forward again in this country muir we 're going to continue with leadership now martha \? raddatz senator cruz , you are a first term senator as well your opponents say you , like senator rubio , are not prepared to be commander in chief you have talked tough about threats we face in the mideast it was reported just moments ago that the north koreans test launched an intercontinental ballistic missile north korea has nuclear weapons , and conducted another nuclear test just last month the missile that was launched is the kind the north koreans hope could someday carry a nuclear weapon capable of reaching the united states how would you respond if commander in chief to that launch \? cruz well , i would note , initially the fact that we 're seeing the launch , and we 're seeing the launch from a nuclear north korea is the direct result of the failures of the first clinton administration the clinton administration led the world in relaxing sanctions against north korea billions of dollars flowed into north korea in exchange for promises not to build nuclear weapons they took those billions and built nuclear weapons and , i would note also the lead negotiator in that failed north korea sanctions deal was a woman named wendy sherman who barack obama and hillary clinton promptly recruited to come back to be the lead negotiator with iran so , what we are seeing with north korea is foreshadowing of where we will be with iran with respect to north korea and what we should do now , one of the first things we should do is expand our missile defense capacity we ought to put missile defense interceptors in south korea south korea wants them one of the real risks of this launch , north korea wants to launch a satellite , and one of the greatest risks of the satellite is they would place a nuclear device in the satellite as it would orbit around the earth , and as it got over the united states they would detonate that nuclear weapon and set of what s called an emp , and electromagnetic pulse which could take down the entire electrical grid on the eastern seaboard , potentially killing millions we need to harden the grid to defend ourselves , and we need missile defense to protect ourselves against north korea raddatz well , let me ask you this , if you were commander in chief tonight would you have order the us military to destroy that missile preemptively on the launchpad to prevent north korea from becoming an even graver threat \? cruz you know , at this point i'm not going to speculate on that without the intelligence briefing that any commander in chief would have , knowing what exactly is there \( applause \) cruz one of the real problems raddatz senator cruz , let me tell you this , you have talked tough about the mideast , you have n't gotten those intelligence briefings about that why not tell us whether you would preemptively strike a missile on a launchpad that threatens the us cruz actually , with respect , i have gotten the intelligence briefings on the mideast those have been going on for many years i have n't gotten the intelligence briefing tonight on what north korea s doing because i'm here in new hampshire when you 're responding to an immediate incident , you need to know the intelligence of what s occurringcruz but what i was saying look , it is qualitatively different dealing with a country once they have nuclear weapons it s why you prevent them from getting nuclear weapons in the first place because your hands are somewhat tied once they have nukes it s why this iranian nuclear deal is so catastrophic , and it s why i 've pledged , on the very first day in office , to rip to shreds this iranian nuclear deal so we 're not sitting here in five years , wondering what to do about an iranian missile launch when they have nuclear weapons the stakes are too high for that raddatz okay senator cruz , i will say that missile has been sitting there for quite some time , and they have had eyes on it rubio but martha , just martha , just to clarify on that point , because he s right , and one more thing to point it is standard procedure of the united states to shoot down those missiles once launched if they pose a threat to civilians , land and ships \( ph \) raddatz senator rubio , i'm talking about a preemptive strike on the launch pad rubio well no , i understand and not but but i think it s important to note that it is and senator cruz , i think , was alluding to this , as well it is the standard procedure of the united states , if those missiles pose a threat to land , civilians , our allies or any of our assets , to shoot down that missile in midflight i understand your question was about a preemptive strike , but my point is that there is in place now contingencies to avoid any sort of that strike \( ph \) from going errant and destroying any any assets of the united states , or implicating or hurting any of our allies or any of our assets in the region raddatz ok thank you , senator rubio governor kasich , how would you respond to tonight s launch \? kasich well , we 've got to to step up the pressure and by the way , i 've gotta say , after being here , every one of my 100 town hall meetings in new hampshire were a lot more fun than what i saw here today , were so much more positive look , in terms of north korea , martha , we have to make sure that we intercept both the ships and their aircraft , because what they 're trying to do is to proliferate this very dangerous material , along with the with the technology , the instruments that can be used for mass destruction that s what i worry about the most , frankly , is nonstate actors , people who do n't have a uniform , people do n't have a country , who can spread this , who are not subject to the to the mutual assured defense in other words , you strike us , we strike you some of these radicals , they do n't care about that that s what i worry about , for my children , and for their children , going forward so , we have to be very tough and we should tell the chinese , look , if you 're not going to do this ballistic missile defense to the koreans , ballistic missile defense to japan and by the way , we should impose the same kind of sanctions on north korea that we imposed on iran , because they 're able to shift money they 're able to send money and receive money \( bell rings \) kasich we 've gotta to be very tough on this and frankly , i think we could have i think we could have let the japanese know that if you want to take action on that on that missile that s rising , you want to take action you will have our support , if that s what you think is the best thing to do we cannot continue to be weak in the face of the north koreans , or , frankly , in the entire rest of the world martha , this is this is the relates raddatz thank you , governor kasich thank you thank you bush this relates to strategic patience \( applause \) raddatz governor bush , i 'll get to you in a moment bush this relates to the strategic patience of the obama administration they come up with these great marketing terms , and what they do is they pull back , and voids are filled , and they 're now filled by asymmetric threats of terror , as well as nationstates on the run the next president of the united states is gonna have to get the united states back in the game , and if a preemptive strike is necessary to keep us safe , then we should do it \( applause \) raddatz thank you , governor bush mr trump , do you have a red line with north korea \? would you consider military action \? and how far would you let them go \? trump well , let me say a couple of things first of all , marco said earlier on that president obama knows exactly what he s doing , like we have this president that really knows i disagree , respectfully , with marco i think we have a president who , as a president , is totally incompetent , and he does n't know what he s doing \( applause \) i think he has no idea what he s doing and our country is going to hell so , i just want to say , we disagree on that is that okay \? rubio yeah i have a i got mentioned , can i respond \? trump good raddatz and i 'd like him to finish the question , please trump as to north korea \? raddatz specific as to north korea trump we have tremendous has been just sucked out of our country by china china says they do n't have that good of control over north korea they have tremendous control i deal with the chinese all of the time i do tremendous the largest bank in the world is in one of my buildings in manhattan i deal with them they tell me they have total , absolute control , practically , of north korea they are sucking trillions of dollars out of our country they 're rebuilding china with the money they take out of our country i would get on with china , let china solve that problem \( bell rings \) they can do it quickly and surgically that s what we should do with north korea raddatz senator rubio , you were mentioned \( applause \) rubio here s the broader point , as well , and then i think it touches on what donald just mentioned barack obama views america as this arrogant global power that needed to be cut down to size ok \? rubio this is a president that views this country as a country that s been too powerful in the world and we create problems around the world for example , it s one of the reasons why he had betrayed israel , because he believes that if we create separation from israel , it will help our relations in the islamic world the same is happening in the asiapacific region with accommodations to north korea north korean should be back on that list of terrorist nations , as an example and donald s absolutely right china does have a lot of influence over north korea and he should be leveraging our relationship with the chinese to ensure that north korea no longer has access to the resources that have allowed them a country that has no economy to develop long range missiles already capable of reaching the west coast of the united states potentially raddatz thank you very much , senator rubio governor bush , another problem facing the commanderinchief right now is that north korea is currently detaining an american college student what would you do to get that college student back home \? bush well , first of all , it s interesting that that happened literally days when this hostage release took place in iran a day or two days afterwards , north korea took a held an american student hostage i think it s when we send a signal of weakness , when we are negotiating to release people that committed crimes in our country for people that did n't commit crimes that are held hostage in iran we saw the shameful treatment of our sailors , that this creates weakness sends a signal of weakness around the world the next president of the united states is going to have to get back in the game where the united states' word matters where we back up our allies , where we do n't send signals of weakness we need to use every every influence possible to get this student back and i think john is right about this , there are crippling sanctions that are available , as it relates to the two or three banks that north korea uses to to use it illicit trade we ought to reestablish sanctions , not just because of the student , but because of their actions that they 're taking right now , as it relates to building this missile capability raddatz governor christie , i want to go to you on the same question \( applause \) christie let s get something raddatz would you negotiate with north korea to christie no let s make something very clear i learned seven years as a federal prosecutor in dealing with types of situations like we 're talking about in north korea , where criminals take people hostage you never pay ransom to the criminals ever you never pay ransom to the criminals everyone out at home watching tonight understands that principle and so , what you need to do is to engage in a much different way with these folks they do not understand anything but toughness and strength , and we need to engage the chinese to deal with the north koreans , but we also need to make sure that they understand there s a commanderinchief who will not pay ransom for any hostage this president and his former secretary of state are for paying ransom for hostages when do that , you endanger even more americans around the world to be the subject of this type of hostage taking and illegal detention you need a strong commanderinchief who will look these folks in the eye and say , we will not put up with this and we will take whatever actions we need to take , not only to get our people home safely , but to swiftly and surely punish those who believe they can violate the law and violate american s sovereign rights to travel the world freely and safely this is unacceptable and this is why this president is so weak and why the secretary of state , who is embracing a third barack obama term , would be even weaker raddatz thank you very much , governor christie \( applause \) david \? muir martha , we 're going to turn to immigration now and i want to bring in governor kasich because you told us in an abc interview , governor , quote , it is completely ridiculous to think we are going to go into neighborhoods , grab people out of their homes and ship people back to mexico adding , quote , that s not where the party is the party is not for departing 115 million people but mr trump and senator cruz , who have made deportation central to their campaigns , top the national polls so , my question for you , are you not where the voters are \? kasich well , you know , david , i i 've just spent a lot of time here in this state , as i mentioned earlier , and we have to have practical solutions , just like we were just talking about a few minutes ago on north korea look , the situation is , we need to finish the border it has to be completed just like we lock our doors at night , the country has to be able to lock its doors and we can have a guest worker program , where people can come in and out in an orderly way and then for the 115 million that are here , if they have not committed a crime since they 've been here , i believe they ought to pay some back taxes , pay a fine , never get on the path to citizenship , but get legalization it is not i could n't even imagine how we would even begin to think about taking a mom or a dad out of a house when they have not committed a crime since they 've been here , leaving their children in the house i mean , that is not , in my opinion , the kind of values that we believe in kasich and secondly , i think at the end of the day , that americans would support a plan like this i think congress would pass a plan to finish the border , guest worker , pay a fine , a path to legalization , and not citizenship and we 've got to get this done and i will tell you this , within the first 100 days that i am president , i will put that proposal to the congress and i will tell you , as a former congressman , and an executive , in ohio , i can promise you that i believe you 'll get the votes to pass that , and we can move on with that issue and protect our border that s what i think muir governor kasich , thank you \( applause \) i want to bring this next to senator cruz you heard what the governor said he said , we need practical solutions and you 've said , i do n't intend to send jack boots to knock on doors that s not how we enforce the law for any crime so , what is your plan \? how will you deport 115 million undocumented people \? and be specific how would you do it \? cruz so , in terms of a practical solution , i 've laid out the most detailed plan for solving illegal immigration it s 11 pages , singlespaced , chapter and verse it s on our website ,  in short , we 're going to do , we 're going to build a wall we 're going to triple the border patrol we 're going to increase and actually , since donald enjoyed that , i will simply say , i 've got somebody in mind to build it we 're going to increase fourfold , the fixedwing and rotarywing aircraft , so that you have technology monitoring an attempted incursion to direct the boots on the ground where they 're occurring we 're going to put in place a strong everify system in the workplace , so you ca n't get a job without proving you are here legally we 'll put in place a biometric exitentry system on visas , because 40 percent of illegal immigration comes not over the border illegally , but people coming on visas and overstaying we will end sanctuary cities by cutting off taxpayer dollars to any jurisdiction that defies federal immigration law \( applause \) and we will end welfare benefits for those here illegally \( applause \) muir let me just ask you this , though , because governor kasich was talking about the families and what you do with the families that you would have to send home can you tell the american people tonight how you would do that \? cruz what you do is , you enforce the law you know , under the constitution , the president has an obligation to , quote , take care that the laws be faithfully executed federal immigration law provides , if someone is here illegally and is apprehended , they are to be deported we saw just this past week the head of the border patrol union testify before congress that president obama had given the order to the border patrol to stand down , not to enforce the law that is wrong i will enforce the law , and for everyone who says , you ca n't possibly do that , i would note that in eight years , bill clinton deported 12 million people in eight years , george w bush deported 10 million people enforcing the law we can do it what is missing is the political will and when they were deporting the people , the border was n't secure , so they 'd come right back once you secure the border , enforcing the law will solve this problem and that will benefit american workers muir senator cruz , thank you i want to bring in senator rubio this question is about immigration , it is also about leadership you 're aware of the criticism from many candidates on this stage tonight that you coauthored the socalled gang of eight bill that would have created a path to citizenship for people here illegally governor christie has said of you , as soon as you felt the heat , you turned tail and run governor bush has said , i do n't think we need people cutting and running anymore did you fight for your own legislation , senator , or did you run from it \? rubio here s the bottom line we ca n't get that legislation passed the american people will not support doing anything about people that are in this country illegally until the law is enforced first , and you prove it to them this has been abundantly clear every effort over the last ten years to do those comprehensively has failed and it has failed because the american people have zero trust that the federal government will enforce our laws and that s why since then , i have said repeatedly , if you are serious about immigration reform , then the key that unlocks the door to being able to do that is not just to pass a law that says it is going to enforce the law , but to actually do it to hire the 20 , 000 new border agents , to finish the fencing and walls , to put in place mandatory everify , to put in place an entryexit tracking system to prevent visa overstays and once that is in place and that s working , i believe the american people will support a very reasonable , but responsible approach to people that have been here a long time , who are not dangerous criminals , who pay taxes and pay fines for what they did but until then , none of that is going to be possible muir but i'm asking , did you fight for the legislation at the time or did you run from it as you 're rubio well , the legislation passed , but it has no support in essence , it could n't pass in the house , it will never pass in the united states until we secure the border , and it is not the way we 're going to do when i'm president when i'm president , we are going to enforce the law first , prove to people that illegal immigration is under control and then we 'll see what the american people are willing to support when it comes to people that are not criminals , who have been in the this country for a long time and who otherwise would like to stay muir governor christie \? christie yeah , david , i would just like you to listen , again , everybody this is the difference between being a governor who actually has to be responsible for problems and not answering a question the question was , did he fight for his legislation \? \( applause \) it s abundantly clear that he did n't it s abundantly clear that he did n't fight for the legislationchristie when the teachers unions attacked me with 20 million of ads because i wanted to reform teacher tenure , i fought them and fought them and fought them and i won when they did n't want when people wanted to raise taxes in my state at democratic legislature and threatened to close down the government , i told them , fine close down the government i 'll get in my cars , head to the governor s mansion , order a pizza , open a beer and watch the mets you can call me when the government reopens and guess what they did n't do \? they did n't pass a tax increase , because i vetoed it and they never closed the government because they knew i would fight for what i believed in the fact of the matter is , a leader must fight for what they believe in not handicap it and say , well maybe since i ca n't win this one , i 'll run that s not what leadership is \( bell rings \) that s what congress is \( applause \) muir governor thank you senator rubio \? rubio leadership is ultimately about solving the problem and the approach that was tried and has been tried now repeatedly over ten years to do this comprehensively , all at once in a massive piece of legislation has no chance of passage it is not leadership to continue to try something that has no chance of happening i want to make progress on this issue it has been discussed now for 30 years and nothing ever happens and i am telling you that the only way forward on this issue that has any chance of happening , meaning gaining the support of the american people , you cannot do this without the support of the american people , is an approach that begins by proving that once and for all , illegal immigration is under control muir senator rubio , thank you we want to turn to health care in this country , and for that , author and commentator , mary katherine ham tonight ham thanks , david good evening , guys trump good evening rubio good evening christie good evening kasich good evening carson good evening cruz good evening bush good evening ham mr trump trump yes ham in the democratic primary , hillary clinton has criticized bernie sanders' plan for single payer government health care , noting it would require big , across the board tax increases for americans in doing so , she s doubling down on obamacare , despite its persistent unpopularity mr trump , you have said you want to appeal obamacare you have also said , quote , everybody s got to be covered , adding , quote , the government s going to pay for it are you closer to bernie sanders' vision for health care than hillary clinton s \? trump i do n't think i am i think i'm closer to common sense we are going to repeal obamacare \( applause \) trump we 're going to repeal obamacare we are going to replace obamacare with something so much better and there are so many examples of it and i will tell you , part of the reason we have some people laughing , because you have insurance people that take care of everybody up here i am selffunded the only one they 're not taking care of is me we have our lines around each state the insurance companies are getting rich on obamacare the insurance companies are getting rich on health care and health services and everything having to do with health we are going to end that we 're going to take out the artificial boundaries , the artificial lines we 're going to get a plan where people compete , free enterprise they compete so much better \( applause \) trump in addition to that , you have the health care savings plans , which are excellent what i do say is , there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a republican , i do n't want that to happen we 're going to take care of people that are dying on the street because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else and we 're going to take care of those people and i think everybody on this stage would have to agree \( bell rings \) you 're not going to let people die , sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country \( applause \) raddatz senator cruz , to that point , mr trump has said that your position on health care means that maybe you 've got , quote , no heart there is a question here , though , about uncovered folks you suggested repealing and replacing obamacare as we learned with president obama s broken promise that everyone could keep their plan , any major plan change in health care policy carries with it the risk that some people will lose their insurance coverage or have to change it how do you reassure that those people that repealing and replacing obamacare is still in their best interest \? cruz well , let me take two different parts of that let me start with socialized medicine socialized medicine is a disaster it does not work if you look at the countries that have imposed socialized medicine , that have put the government in charge of providing medicine , what inevitably happens is rationing you have a scarcity of doctors you have rationing and that means the elderly are told , we 're going to ration a hip replacement , we 're going to ration a knee replacement we 're going to ration end oflife care we 're right now heading into a medical system with about a 90 , 000doctor shortage in america and socialized medicine whether proposed by the democrats or proposed by a republican would hurt the people of this country what should we do on health care \? if i'm elected president , we will repeal every word of obamacare \( applause \) cruz and once we do that , we will adopt common sense reforms , number one , we 'll allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines that will drive down prices and expand the availability of low cost catastrophic insurancecruz we 'll expand health savings accounts and we will delink health insurance from employment so that you do n't lose your health insurance when you lose your job , and that way health insurance can be personal , portable and affordable and we keep government from getting in between us and our doctors \( applause \) ham dr carson , you have some experience with this matter in the past , you have said that obamacare should be replaced before it s repealed how and why \? carson well , thank you you know , i was hoping to get a chance to talk about north korea i was the only one who did n't get to do that , and i 've got stuff to say about it , let me tell you but at any rate , you have to replace it with something that makes sense it does n't make sense and the reason that i dislike obamacare is because the government comes in and tells the people which the nation is supposed to be centered on that we do n't care what you think , this is what we 're doing and if you do n't like it , too bad that s a problem and we ca n't afford to do that because that will fundamentally change america i have proposed a health empowerment account system everybody gets a health empowerment account the day they are born , they keep it until they die they can pass it on we pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional health care with , recognizing that we spend twice as much as many countries per capita and health care and do n't have as such access we give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account so that each family basically becomes its own insurance company without a middleman that saves you a awful lot of money and that will lower the cost of your catastrophic insurance tremendously , because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic health care and then in terms of taking care of the indigent , we have another whole system , and i can go ahead and explain it , but i do n't have the time , but i 'd be happy to if you give me some more time but go to my website , read about it you can read about everything that s been discussed here in great detail \( applause \) ham thank you , dr carson david , martha , back to you muir mary katherine , thank you we want to turn now to the issue of eminent domain , which is being debated right here in new hampshire and josh mcelveen is the political director and the anchor of wmur tv josh \? mcelveen thank you , david and good evening , candidates mr trump , you have said , quote , i love eminent domain which is the seizure of private property for the sake of the greater good theoretically you tried to use the measure in business endeavors , you 've said you 'd support its use for the keystone pipeline project here in new hampshire , a project , though , known as the northern pass would bring hydroelectric power from canada into the northeastern grid do you see eminent domain as an appropriate tool to get that done \? trump well , let me just tell you about eminent domain because almost all of these people actually criticize it , but so many people have hit me with commercials and other things about eminent domain eminent domain is an absolute necessity for a country , for our country without it , you would n't have roads , you would n't have hospitals , you would n't have anything you would n't have schools , you would n't have bridges you need eminent domain and a lot of the big conservatives that tell me how conservative they are i think i'm more than they are they tell me , oh well , they all want the keystone pipeline the keystone pipeline , without eminent domain , it would n't go 10 feet , ok \? you need eminent domain and eminent domain is a good thing , not a bad thing and what a lot of people do n't know because they were all saying , oh , you 're going to take their property when somebody when eminent domain is used on somebody s property , that person gets a fortune they get at least fair market value , and if they are smart , they 'll get two or three times the value of their property but without eminent domain , you do n't have roads , highways , schools , bridges or anything so eminent domain it s not that i love it , but eminent domain is absolutely it s a necessity for a country and certainly it s a necessity for our country mcelveen so would that be yes on the northern pass project \? \( applause \) trump yes bush the difference the difference between eminent domain for public purpose as donald said , roads and infrastructure , pipelines and all that that s for public purpose but what donald trump did was use eminent domain to try to take the property of an elderly woman on the strip in atlantic city that is not public purpose , that is down right wrong \( applause \) and here s the problem with that the problem was , it was to tear down it was to tear down it was to tear down the house trump jeb wants to be he wants to be a tough guy tonight i did n't take the property bush and the net result was you tried trump i did n't take the property bush and you lost in the court trump the woman ultimately did n't want to do that i walked away bush that is not true and the simple fact is to turn this into a limousine parking lot for his casinos is a not public use \( applause \) and in florida , based on what we did , we made that impossible it is part of our constitution that s the better approach that is the conservative approach mcelveen mr trump , take 30 seconds trump well , let me just you know , he wants to be a tough guy a lot of times , you 'll have you 'll have and it did n't work very well bush how tough it is to take away property from an elderly woman \? trump a lot of time let me talk quiet a lot of times a lot of timesbush how tough it is to take away a property from an elderly woman \? trump you let me talk let me talk quiet a lot of times \( booing \) that s all of his donors and special interests out there \( booing \) so it s what it is that s what and by the way , let me just tell you , we needed tickets you ca n't get them you know who has the tickets for the i'm talking about , to the television audience \? donors , special interests , the people that are putting up the money \( booing \) that s who it is the rnc told us we have all donors in the audience and the reason they 're not loving me \( booing \) the reason they 're not excuse me the reason they 're not loving me is , i do n't want their money i'm going to do the right thing for the american public i do n't want their money i do n't need their money and i'm the only one up here that can say that eminent domain , the keystone pipeline do you consider that a private job \? do you do you consider that bush i consider it a public use trump no no , let me ask you , jeb \( bell rings \) do you consider the keystone pipeline private \? bush it s a public use it s a public use trump is it public or private \? bush it s a public use trump real a public use \? bush yeah trump no , it s a private job bush it s a public use trump it s a private job bush established by the courts federal , state courts trump you would n't have the keystone pipeline that you want so badly without eminent domain mcelveen all right , gentlemen trump you would n't have massive excuse me , josh you would n't have massive factories without eminent domain \( booing \) mcelveen gentlemen , we do have to move forward dave , martha , back to you muir josh , thank you when we come back here tonight , jobs , isis , and what it means to be a conservative \( applause \) muir the republican debate continues right here from new hampshire on abc we 'll be right back \( commercial break \) stephanopoulos candidates taking a quick break i'm here with jon karl right now , and boy , jon marco rubio came into this debate with a head of steam , ran right into chris christie karl i have never seen christie tougher in this race i have never seen marco rubio more rattled he repeated himself three times , precisely when chris christie s criticism was you always repeat yourself with the same canned speech this was a tough moment for marco rubio stephanopoulos donald trump started out more subdued than in the past for most of the debate , right up until the end of that first section when the issue of eminent domain came up , and jeb bush was ready karl it almost makes you wonder where would we be in this race right now if jeb bush had been that energetic , and that forceful in going after donald trump from the start in the previous debates stephanopoulos he has been hitting donald trump , but this karl but not effectively stephanopoulos he did seem to draw some blood , and he seemed to have the crowd on his side , at least for part of that answer tonight ok , we 'll be right back the candidates on the stage in just a minute \( commercial break \) \( unknown \) live from saint anselm college in new hampshire , here again are david muir , and martha raddatz muir and , we welcome you back to the republican debate from new hampshire tonight here on abc we 're going to turn now to what it means to be a conservative , and i want to turn to governor kasich governor , while campaigning here in new hampshire , you were already asked about groans from some conservatives after your endorsements from the new york times , and the boston globe you said , quote , what conservatives have to know is they have to say , look is n't it nice to have a conservative like me liked \? and , maybe the ought to think about it because if i get elected president , the republican party and the definition of conservatism is going to change how would you change conservatism \? kasich well , first of all , look as the new york times said , he s certainly not a moderate , but he can bring people together to solve problems the fact of the matter is i 've cut taxes more than anybody in the country this year i have balanced budgets , the federal budget , the state of ohio budget , we 're running a 2 billion dollar surplus , we 're up 400 , 000 jobs , and in washington we were able to have significant job growth whenever we balanced the budget of which i was the architect but , here s the beauty of it , it s not just balancing a budget , it s about jobs you know , when i was kid growing up in a neighborhood where dad went home at night and said , i lost my job today , it just killed the family it just was a devastating effect we have to have economic growth , but once we have economic growth i believe we have to reach out to people who live in the shadows i believe we need to help the mentally ill , the drug addicted , the working poor we need to help the developmentally disabled to rise , and we need to help our friends in the minority community develop entrepreneurship in other words , in american , conservatism should mean not only that some rise with conservative principles , but everybody has a chance to rise regardless of who they are so they can live their god given purpose that s what conservatism should be \( applause \) muir governor kasich , thank you mr trump , you 've heard the argument from many of the candidates on this stage that you 're not a true conservative tell the voters watching tonight why you aretrump well , i think i am , and to me , i view the word conservative as a derivative i of of the word conserve we want to converse our money we want to conserve our wealth we want to conserve we want to be smart we want to be smart where we go , where we spend , how we spend we want to conserve our country we want to save our country and we have people that have no idea how to do that and they are not doing it , and it s a very important word and it s something i believe in very , very strongly muir mr trump , thank you \( applause \) senator rubio , you have said yourself that you do n't think donald trump is running as a conservative did he convince you \? rubio well , i think conservatism is about three things and donald touched on one of them , but it s about three things the first is conservatism is about limited government , especially at the federal level the federal government is a limited government , limited by the constitution , which delineates its powers if it s not in the constitution , it does not belong to the federal government it belongs to states , local communities and the private sector it s about free enterprise , which is an economic model that allows everyone to rise without pulling anyone down the reason why free enterprise is the greatest economic model in the history of the world is because it s the only economic model where you can make poor people richer without making rich people poor and it s about a strong national defense it s about believing , unlike barack obama , that the world is a safer and a better place when america is the strongest military and the strongest nation on this planet that s conservatism \( applause \) muir senator rubio , thank you i want to turn this discussion to the economy now and mr trump , governor christie has said , i tell everybody who goes to a donald trump event , if you get to ask a question , just ask him how christie said , i do n't care which of the things he talks about , just ask him how you have said that you 'd be the greatest jobs president god ever created tell americans watching tonight how many jobs you would create in the first term and how trump well , before i go there , i will tell you , i will bring jobs back from china i will bring jobs back from japan i will bring jobs back from mexico , where new hampshire , by the way , has been virtually wiped out they 've lost so many businesses going to mexico because of horrible trade deals and now we 're about to sign another trade deal , tpp , which is going to be a disaster for this country because they do n't talk about monetary manipulation it is going to be a disaster i'm going to bring jobs back and i 'll start bringing them back very fast under my tax plan right now , we 're the highest taxed country in the world under my plan , we cut not only taxes for the middle class , but we cut taxes for corporations we will bring back trillions of dollars that s offshore right now , they have 25 trillion , and in my opinion , it s much more than that that s what the government says all of that money is going to come back and we 're not going to lose pfizer , which is now leaving , and other great companies , which is now leaving and they 're all leaving we have many , many companies that are leaving this country we 're not going to lose them anymore because we 're going to have a tax structure that is going to keep them in our country muir mr trump , thank you there are a lot of governors on this stage tonight and governor christie , governor kasich said of you , quote , in ohio , we balanced a budget they do n't have one over in new jersey our credit has been strengthened their credit has been downgraded we 've got more jobs how important are those metrics in choosing the next president \? and is his job is his record on jobs , i should say , actually stronger than yours \? christie well , he deserves credit for his record on jobs he s done a very good job as governor of ohio never said that john has n't he s done a very good job \( applause \) but but unfortunately , john s been so busy doing over stuff , he s using old statistics that s ok new jersey had its best year of job growth in the last 15 years under five different governors this year in new jersey new jersey cut spending over 23 billion and we have 10 , 000 fewer employees than we had when i walked in the door john has a bigger government now and more employees than he had when he walked in the door but all that does n't matter what really matters is this , that executive experience really matters you heard this on the stage tonight we 've heard it said on the stage that president obama knows exactly what he s doing i 'd like to ask all the veterans listening out there tonight , who are waiting in line for healthcare , who are literally dying because the veterans administration does n't work , do you think barack obama knows what he s doing \? i do n't and i 'll tell you something anybody who evaluates him is knowing what he s doing and managing the government does n't know how to manage a government themselves and one last thing , david , which i think is really important i listened to senator rubio s answer on his bill he said his bill could n't pass on the gang of eight he acted as if he was somehow disembodied from the bill it was his bill he said this idea does n't work it was his idea see , when you 're a governor , you have to take responsibility for these things you ca n't just act as if it happened out of nowhere we have to take responsibility as executives i take responsibility for my record in new jersey we 've rebuilt the economy and rebuilt after the secondworst natural disaster in american history i'm proud of my record and by the way , i like kasich s record , too he s a good governor \( applause \) kasich david \? muir thank you , governor governor kasich \? kasich look , i'm i'm not here i like chris muir he did n't say your record was better than hiskasich let but let me let me just tell you first of all , we have the lowest number of state employees in 30 years secondly , we have grown government at the rate of inflation and i went from an 8 billion hole to a 2 billion surplus and we 've grown jobs by 400 , 000 that s one of the fastest growing states in the country our pensions are secure and our credit is rock solid now , i 've learned that , what makes things work , what gets the economy going , not just in ohio , but in washington and it s three things common sense regulations , which we have , lower taxes , which we have , the lowest taxes , tax cuts in the country and thirdly , a fiscal plan to balance the budget when you go from 8 billion in the hole to 2 billion in the black , when you cut taxes by 5 billion and you grow over 400 , 000 jobs , that is a record that i can take to washington , using the same formula that i used in washington when i was part of the effort to balance the budget to give us a surplus and to create jobs muir governor kasich , thank you kasich that s what i did and i 'll do it again in the first 100 days kasich governor kasich , thank you i do want to turn from jobs to taxes rubio now , see , i was mentioned by governor muir if you would like to respond to the governor , you can rubio yeah muir i'm coming to you next with a question , anyway you can respond to that question rubio ok , good , then i 'll get to it \( inaudible \) here s the muir we 're going from jobs to taxes , and here s the rubio well , no , sorry let me respond to that question muir to the gang of eight bill first \? rubio well , here s the response i think anyone who believes that barack obama is n't doing what he s doing on purpose does n't understand what we 're dealing with here , ok \? this is a president this is a president who is trying to change this country when he talked about change , he was n't talking about dealing with our problems obamacare was not an accident the undermining of the second amendment is not an accident the gutting of our military is not an accident the undermining of america on the global stage is not an accident barack obama is , indeed , trying to redefine this country we better understand what we 're dealing with here , because that s what hillary clinton and bernie sanders want to double down on if they are elected muir the governor was n't talking about the president , he was talking about the gang of eight bill \( applause \) rubio no he talked about barack obama muir so , let me ask you about taxes , senator rubio rubio yeah muir a recent poll , 68 percent of americans favor raising taxes on people making more than 1 million a year are they wrong \? rubio i do n't know of any problem in america that s going to be fixed with a tax increase we have an economy today , an economy today that is not creating jobs that pay enough and one of the reasons why is because we have one of the most expensive business tax rates on the planet our combined business rate puts us among the highest in the industrialized world and then on top of that , we are the only one that has a worldwide system of taxation , where an american company who makes money abroad has to pay taxes where they made the money and then taxes a second time when they bring it back the combination of these two things has stranded over 2 trillion , the equivalent of the size of the russian economy , 2 trillion of american corporate money stranded overseas , combined with all of these inversions of companies leaving us the solution to the problems we have today are not a tax increase it is to lower our taxes on both people and on companies , so we can make america globally competitive again \( applause \) muir senator rubio , thank you i want to bring in governor bush and governor , i just want to repeat that number for you 68 percent of americans favor raising taxes on people making more than a million what do you say to the people who believe that tonight \? bush i would like to see more millionaires i think we need to grow more millionaires , we need create a prosperity society where people can rise up \( applause \) this notion that somehow we 're undertaxed as a nation is just fool hearty , when we have entitlements growing far faster than our ability to pay for it a conservative , because that s the point of this , believes in limited government , believes in a entrepreneurial capitalism and a strong national defense but it also has to be , we need to reform things in my town hall meetings , i went to a place where a woman described her neighbor , who has a better economic deal by not working than her struggling to make ends meet we need to be on the side of working people and you know , the problem with the left is , another tax , another regulation , another mandate makes it harder for them to rise up everything that we should do should be focused on high , sustained economic growth , where the middle class gets a raise for the first time , and where people are rewarded for work , rather than nonwork and i know how to do this and if people are interested in the specifics of this , they ought to go to  \( applause \) muir knew that was coming governor , thank you christie david \? hey , david \? david \? hey , david \? i actually have experience with raising taxes on millionaires in my state it was done it was done by my predecessor and i want everybody in the public who is in that 68 percent , i want to tell you the truth you 're wrong and here is why you 're wrong after new jersey raised taxes on millionaires , we lost , in the next four years , 70 billion in wealth left our state it left our state to go where it would be treated more kindly if the united states raised taxes any further , that money will leave the united states , as well we wo n't have better jobs let new jersey be the canary in the coal mine it is a failed idea and a failed policy , it s class warfare it happened in my state i 've stopped it from happening again but we cannot do it the 68 percent of the people are wrong about that , it will hurt the american economy we tried it in new jersey come take a look it did not work \( applause \) muir governor christie , thank you \( applause \) martha \? raddatz senator cruz , you advocate what you call carpet bombing , or saturation bombing , to defeat isis , citing the more than 1 , 100 air attacks that the us carried out during the first gulf war in 1991 explain how a strategy to defeat a standing army would work against an unconventional terrorist group that is now hiding amongst the population cruz well , sure it starts with a commanderinchief that sets the objective and the objective has to be utterly and completely destroying isis obama has n't started with that objective and everything else flows from there once you set that objective , we have the tools to carry that out the first tool is overwhelming air power it is one of the blessings of the united states of america , having the greatest military on the face of the earth , is we have the ability to use that air power as you know , in the first persian gulf war , it was 1 , 100 air attacks a day obama is launching between 15 and 30 now , when i say saturation carpet bombing , that is not indiscriminate that is targeted at oil facilities it s targeted at the oil tankers it s targeted at command and control locations it s targeted at infrastructure it s targeted at communications it s targeted at bombing all of the roads and bridges going in and out of raqqa it s using overwhelming air power you know , couple of weeks ago , it was reported that a facility is open called jihadist university now , the question i wonder , why is that building still standing \? it should be rubble and if you had a president \( bell rings \) \( applause \) cruz all though i will say this i would be willing to wait until freshman orientation before launching those bombs raddatz senator cruz , would you like to expand or loosen the rules of engagement \? i was just over in a command center in erbil and they said they thought the rules of engagement worked because you have so many civilians in those populated areas , they do n't want to hit civilians cruz martha , i will tell you , i have visited with active duty military , with veterans over and over and over again in town halls all over the state of new hampshire what we are doing to our sons and daughters , it is immoral we are sending them into fight with their arms tied behind their back they cannot defend themselves and it is wrong \( applause \) cruz and i will tell you this look america has always been reluctant to use military force it s the last step we take but if and when we use it when it comes to defeating isis , we should use it we should use overwhelming force , kill the enemy and then get the heck out do n't engage in nationbuilding but instead , allow our soldiers to do their jobs instead of risking their lives with politicians making it impossible to accomplish the objective \( applause \) raddatz so , loosen the rules of engagement \? cruz absolutely , yes raddatz senator rubio , you said in the last debate that isis is the most dangerous , jihadist group in the history of mankind and that will it take overwhelming us force to defeat them can you specifically tell us what you mean by overwhelming force \? rubio well , first , we need to understand who they are isis is not just a jihadist group , they 're an apocalyptic group they want to trigger a showdown in a city named tibet between the west and themselves which they believe will trigger the arrival of their messianic figure and i'm not saying that s what s going to happen the reason why it s important to understand that is because these are not groups that are just going to go away on their own they are going to have to be defeated and i believe they need to be defeated on the ground , by a ground force , made up primarily of sunni arabs it will take sunni arabs to reject them ideologically and defeat them militarily that will require a coalition of iraqis and syrians , that are also sunnis , but it will also require the cooperation of jordanians , egyptians we should ask more of the saudis that will need to be backed up with more us special operation forces alongside them and it will have to be backed up with increased air strikes and we are going to have to strike them , not just in iraq and in syria , but in every other part of the world where they have now created hubs of operation they have affiliates in over a dozen countries across this planet they have a sophisticated network of radicalizing people here in the homeland and around the world \( bell rings \) but it all begins by taking away their their safe operating spaces with a ground force that a usled coalition takes on \( applause \) raddatz again , senator rubio , you 've already said isis is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind so , that would make it more dangerous than al qaida , the insurgents we fought in iraq we committed hundreds of thousands of us troops to fight those groups so if isis is the most dangerous group in history , why not commit a large us ground force \? rubio because they currently occupy sunni cities and villages sunni cities and villages can only truly be liberated and held by sunnis themselves if they are held by shias it will trigger sectarian violence the kurds are incredible fighters and they will liberate the kurdish areas , but kurds can not and do not want to liberate and hold sunni villages and townsrubio it will take sunni fighters themselves in that region to take those villages and cities , and then to hold them and avoid the sort of sectarian violence that follows in the past and why that is important is because if sunnis are not able to govern themselves in these areas , you are going to have a successor group to isis isis is a successor group of al qaida in fact , they broke away \( bell rings \) from al qaida , because as horrible as al qaida is , isis thought al qaida was not radical enough this is who we 're dealing with , and they have more money than al qaida ever had bush \( \? \) martha martha , if i raddatz well , what would you do what would you do differently to try to get those sunni forces \? they have not been coming forward rubio well , the problem with the sunni forces in the region is they do n't trust this administration this administration cut a deal with their mortal enemies , the shia , in iran it poisoned the well with these countries it makes it very difficult to cooperate with them as a result they also , by the way , understand what real us air power looks like they saw the iraq war they saw , up close , also afghanistan they know what air power looks like when the united states is committed to the cause and they see the airstrikes that are being conducted now , and they say to themselves , that s not real \( ph \) commitment we know what real commitment looks like the the jordanian king was in washington three weeks ago he told everyone who would listen that they have begged for permission from the coalition to target caravans and the coalition meaning us leadership on the ground \( bell rings \) would not allow them to proceed with those airstrikes raddatz mr trump thank you very much , senator rubio mr trump \( applause \) you have said you will vigorously bomb isis you 've said , we 've got to get rid of isis , quickly , quickly how would you get rid of them so quickly \? and please give us specifics trump well , four years ago , i said , bomb the oil and take the oil and if we did that , they would n't have the wealth they have right now now , i still say the same thing , because we 're doing little pinpricks we 're not even bombing if somebody s driving a truck , they give notice to the person driving the truck , we 're going to bomb if they do n't get out of the truck , the truck sails away with the oil we actually have a case where we do n't want to bomb the oil , because we do n't want to hurt pollute the atmosphere can you imagine general douglas macarthur or general patton saying we ca n't bomb because we 're gonna hurt the atmosphere \? you have to knock the hell out of the oil you have to take the oil and you have also back channels of banking you have people that you think are our great allies , our friends , in the middle east , that are paying tremendous numbers of tremendous amounts of money to isis so we have to stop those circuits nobody knows banking better than i do they have back circuits , back channels tremendous amounts of money is coming in through the banking system so between the oil and the banking , you will dry them up but it should have been done four years ago , not now raddatz and and what would you do in those cities , where there are people who we are trying to help , who isis is essentially holding hostage \? trump you have to go in first of all , when you take away their money , when you take away their wealth , that 'll very much weaken and it will happen fairly fast they 'll last for about a year , based on all of the wealth they 've accumulated but when you stop the banking channels and when you stop the oil and take the oil not just bomb it , take it when you do that , it s going to dry up very quickly they 're going to become a very weakened power , quickly thank you raddatz thank you very much , mr trump \( applause \) let s turn to libya governor bush , it is a country in chaos there is no government this week , defense officials said there are now 5 , 000 isis fighters there , roughly doubling previous estimates we know you and others have been critical of the administration s handling of libya after the initial air strikes that you supported but this is a problem you would stand to inherit if you 're the next president reports this week said the administration is considering new air strikes , possible special operations raids would you support renewed air strikes or any us involvement on the ground \? bush i would and i would do it in concert , again , with our arab allies and with europe , most particularly in this case this is the lesson learned in history , if you bomb something and not do anything as it relates to deal with the aftermath of this , if you do n't have a stable government , you get what we have in libya and this is not leading from behind is not an effective policy we have to lead without the united states , nothing seems to work europe does n't have the ability to to to lead forward lean \( ph \) in this regard and so dealing with the caliphate is important , because it now has spawned other areas there have been 70plus attacks in 17 countries , either inspired by isis or organized by isis , libya being the most important one now we have to deal with the caliphate , with building a sunni army there , but we also have to deal with it in libya and i think the united states , ultimately , is going to play play a significant role in this the problem with the obama administration is that they see this incrementally they 're reluctant they do n't lead no one knows whether we 're serious , and when we do it , we do it in increments you can barely see \( bell rings \) the united states has to lead in a much more aggressive way than we 're doing right now \( applause \) raddatz thank you very much , governor bush dr carson \? carson i want to say something about this , because i'm not here just to add beauty to the stage \( laughter \) you know , i 've been talking about libya for quite a long time i think i was the first one to start talking about it because i say we have to have a proactive foreign policy strategy and of course , the next place that isis is going to attack to is libya if you want to expand your caliphate and increase your influence , then you 're going to go to a place that s strategically located you go north , across the mediterranean you 're into southern europe you go south , you 're into chad and sudan and niger not to mention the fact that you have much more oil than you do in iraq that s the kind of place that they 're going to go to , therefore , we need to be thinking about how do we prevent them from tacking over there they 're already sending their fighters there , we need to be consulting with our military experts and asking them what do they need in order to prevent isis from being able to take over libya that s going to have enormous concede for us raddatz and would you support renewed airstrikes \? carson i would support the possibility of renewed airstrikes if in conjunction with our joint chiefs and our military people they felt that was an appropriate strategy the fact of the matter is none of us up here is a military expert , and we sometimes act like we are , but we 're not and if we actually sit down and talk with them and get them to understand our plan and their impression of what needs to be done , i think we 're going to make a lot more progress bush martha and david , i just raddatz we 're going to move on bush martha and david muir martha , thank you we 're just going to we 're going to stay on isis here and the war on terror , because as you know , there s been a debate in this country about how to deal with the enemy and about enhanced interrogation techniques ever since 9 11 so senator cruz , you have said , quote , torture is wrong , unambiguously , period civilized nations do not engage in torture some of the other candidates say they do n't think waterboarding is torture mr trump has said , i would bring it back senator cruz , is waterboarding torture \? cruz well , under the definition of torture , no , it s not under the law , torture is excruciating pain that is equivalent to losing organs and systems , so under the definition of torture , it is not it is enhanced interrogation , it is vigorous interrogation , but it does not meet the generally recognized definition of torture muir if elected president , would you bring it back \? cruz i would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use and indeed , i joined with senator mccain in legislation that would prohibit line officers from employing it because i think bad things happen when enhanced interrogation is employed at lower levels but when it comes to keeping this country safe , the commander in chief has inherent constitutional authority to keep this country safe and so , if it were necessary to , say , prevent a city from facing an imminent terrorist attack , you can rest assured that as commander in chief , i would use whatever enhanced interrogation methods we could to keep this country safe muir senator cruz , thank you mr trump , you said not only does it work , but that you 'd bring it back trump well , i 'll tell you what in the middle east , we have people chopping the heads off christians , we have people chopping the heads off many other people we have things that we have never seen before as a group , we have never seen before , what s happening right now the medieval times i mean , we studied medieval times not since medieval times have people seen what s going on i would bring back waterboarding and i 'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding \( applause \) muir mr trump , thank you governor bush , you have said that you wo n't rule waterboarding out congress has passed laws banning the use of waterboarding by the military and the cia , as you know would you want congress to change that if you 're elected president \? bush no , no , i would n't no , i would n't and it was used sparingly , congress has changed the laws and i and i think where we stand is the appropriate place but what we need to do is to make sure that we expand our intelligence capabilities the idea that we 're going to solve this fight with predator drones , killing people somehow is a is more acceptable than capturing them , securing the information this is why closing guantanamo is a complete disaster what we need to do is make sure that we are kept safe \( applause \) by having intelligence capabilities , both human and technological intelligence capabilities far superior than what we have today that s how you get a more safe place is by making sure that we 're fully engaged and right now , this administration does n't do that bush governor bush , thank you \( applause \) senator rubio , i do want to ask you , you have said that you do not want to telegraph to the enemy what you would do as commander in chief but for the american people watching tonight who want to know where the next president will stand , do you believe waterboarding is torture \? rubio well , when people talk about interrogating terrorists , they 're acting like this is some sort of law enforcement function law enforcement is about gathering evidence to take someone to trial , and convict them antiterrorism is about finding out information to prevent a future attack so the same tactics do not apply and , it is true , we should not be discussing in a wide spread way the exact tactics that we 're going to use because that allows terrorist to know to practice how to evade us but , here s the bigger problem with all this , we 're not interrogating anybody right now guantanamo s being emptied by this president we should be putting people into guantanamo , not emptying it out , and we should n't be releasing these killers who are rejoining the battlefield against the united states \( applause \) muir senator rubio , thank you we want to turn now to the topic of executive orders , and for that , we 're going to turn back to mary katharine ham mary katharine \? ham thanks , david senator cruz , on the campaign trail you 've promised voters a lot , in fact if you 're elected president you 'd say you end common core immediately , abolish the irs , and do away with sanctuary cities you 've also been a persistent critic of president obama s executive overreach , going it alone , not working with congress how do you intend to implement this aggressive agenda within your constitutional authority , especially given that it would require working with congress and washington players with whom you 're happy to say you have a strained relationship \? cruz well , thank you for that question you know , there are three avenues of presidential authority to change the direction of this country the first is executive power , the second is foreign policy , and the third is legislation executive power , as we all know , has been the preferred vehicle of president obama , abusing his authority , abusing his constitutional authority now , the silver lining of that is everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power , so i have pledged on day one i will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action barack obama has done that means on day one his efforts to restrict the second amendment go away with the strike of a pen that means on day one his illegal executive amnesty goes away with the strike of a pen the reason i can end common core at the federal level is because obama is abusing executive power using race to the top funds in the department of education to force it on the states that s one avenue the second avenue of change is foreign policy , and foreign policy can change the fastest it s worth remembering that iran released our hostages the day reagan \( bell ringing \) cruz was sworn in and , the third is legislation , and that can only be done with the people behind you , which is why the two big legislative initiatives i'm campaigning on are repealing obamacare , and adopting a simple flat tax to abolish the irs \( applause \) ham mr trump , senator cruz is known for opposing deals , you literally wrote the book on making them senator cruz has mentioned that on the trail what would you say to those conservatives that are concerned that a deal maker will just perpetuate the same deals in washington and the way that things run now \( inaudible \) trump no , a good deal maker will make great deals , but we 'll do it the way our founders thought it should be done people get together , they make deals ronald reagan did it with tip o'neil very successfully , you did n't hear so much about executive orders , if you heard about it at all you have to be able to get a consensus now , the real person like it was mentioned about the deal with iran , how bad a deal is that \? it does n't get any more amateurish than that a good deal maker would never make a deal like that with congress , you have to get everybody in a room , and you have to get them to agree but , you have to get them to agree what you want , and that s part of being a deal maker you ca n't leave the white house , go to hawaii and play golf for three weeks and be a real deal maker it does n't work that way you have to get people in , grab them , hug them , kiss them , and get the deal done but , it s got to be the deal that you want \( applause \) ham governor kasich , is the problem with washington that there are too many deals , or too few \? kasich well , right now the deals there s no leadership i mean , a lot of the things that we 're talking about here tonight , on the border , and so many of the things what we should be doing on foreign policy , you know what the problem is , mary katharine \? there s not a leader that gets somebody to rise you have to have a leader that can inspire , and actually some of what donald was saying is true look , do you know how hard it was trump some \? kasich to get the balance the federal budget balanced \? you have to plead with people to do what we 've done in ohio , you have to plead with people , then you go back down to washington and do the same thing see , we have to remind people we 're americans before we 're republicans and democrats , and when we wait , and when we delay what we end up doing , mary katharine , is we make the united states weaker in fact , it s a foreign policy issue because people look at america not solving problems and they say what are they doing over there \? the point is you have to work with peopletrump the problem with executive authority for the president , it s really bad news for this reason since he s given up on working with congress , he thinks he can impose anything he wants he s not a king he s a president an executive order should be used frankly in consolidation and with consulting with the leadership in the in the congress i 've done it in ohio i consult i could use executive orders , but i do n't trump the legislature , because if you do , you aggravate them , you anger them and then the longterm prospects get bleak we have to solve problems in america by coming together , republicans and democrats , americans first , party and ideology second in the second back seat of this country that s what we need to do \( applause \) and we can do it and we can do it bush this is a this is an important subject i agree with everything that s been said here about repealing unconstitutional rules and rules that are creating real burdens for investing that creating jobs but we also ought to get back to being a tenth amendment country , as well , a country that respects the states to be able to make more decisions and in the bush administration , we would shift transportation dollars back to the states i trust kasich and christie to build the roads and the infrastructure of their states than washington , dc epa delegated authority , back to the states education dollars , back to the states i would like to see reform take place all across the country , where there s more vouchers , more freedom \( applause \) if we did that , we would shrink government s power in washington , dc and we would have a much more effective government , where people would begin to trust our government again , because now , no one believes it works kasich mary katherine , let me just say this to you \( applause \) you must have an agenda that you are ready to move on in the first 100 days jeb is right if you delay and you wait , the washington operators will take you down i can tell you this , in the first 100 days , i will have legislation to freeze federal regulations , have them reviewed by the vice president , reduce state taxes on individuals , reduce taxes on corporations , have a fiscal plan to balance the budget , get the border protected and begin to fix social security in the first 100 days so , anybody who is here tonight , if i get elected president , head out tomorrow and buy a seat belt , because there s going to be so much happening in the first 100 days , it s going to make your head spin we 're going to move america forward i promise you we 're going to move us forward \( applause \) bush you mentioned me he mentioned me one other thing that i think we ought to do , along with repealing obamacare , we need to shift all of this power of healthcare , which is the most egregious form of federal power that is suppressing wages and incomes , and allow governors to have the medicaid plans so that they can create 21st century medicaid insurance for people that are stuck in poverty there s so much that can be done , but i do n't trust washington to do it i trust the state capitals to be the place to be the source of innovation and reform in this country \( applause \) ham thank you , governors martha and david , back to you muir mary katherine , thank you we want to turn to something the governor of new hampshire said \( laughter \) kasich jeb mentioned me time for me to go again bush i did n't mention him the second time kasich he says he did n't mention me the second time i thought i heard it , jeb no i'm just kidding thank you all very much for listening and being patient with all of us tonight thank you muir a connection here on the stage we 're going to move on to what the governor of new hampshire said just this week , and that is that heroin overdose is not the secondleading cause of death in this state you do n't need me to tell you that but there s another number , 48 percent of the people here in this state knows someone who has abused heroin josh , who covers this for wmur , has the next question mcelveen you 're all aware , candidates , this is a major problem here in new hampshire it s a very deadly problem as well last month , new hampshire senators kelly ayotte , republican , and jeanne shaheen , democrat , they went down to washington , along with the police chief of the state s largest city to testify before the judiciary committee in dc senator cruz , you 're a member of that committee your campaign schedule did n't allow you to attend this even so , the police chief called your absence outrageous , given the severity of the problem last week , though , you told a personal story of a close family member s struggle with addiction what can you say to law enforcement right now to convince them that you understand the severity of this problem and you 're not just saying what people want to hear days before the primary \? cruz well , josh , as you noted , this is a problem that , for me , i understand firsthand my older sister , myriam , who was my half sister , struggled her whole life with drug and alcohol addiction my father and her mom divorced when she was a little girl and she was angry her whole life , and she ended up marrying a man who had been in and out of jail she then became a single mom and she herself went to jail several times and she ended up spending some time in a crack house cruz i still remember my father and me driving up to get myriam out of that crack house to try to convince her she needed to be a mom to to my nephew joey she was n't willing to listen she was not willing to change the path she was on she was angry i was had just gotten my first job coming out of law school i took a 20 , 000 loan on a credit card to put my nephew , joey , in valley forge military academy he was in sixth grade at the time , to pay his way through that and about five , six years ago , miriam died of an overdose it was the coroner ruled it accidental we do n't know she went to one night , had taken too many pills , and joey walked in and found her dead this is an absolute epidemic we need leadership to solve it solving it has to occur at the state and local level with programs like aa , and counseling , and churches and charities but it also has to be securing the borders , because you have got mexican cartels that are smuggling vast amounts of heroin into this country we know how to secure the borders what is missing is the political will to do it and as president , i will secure the border , we will end this deluge of drugs that is flowing over our southern border and that is killing americans across this country mcelveen and governor christie , you have talked a lot about this issue here in new hampshire \( applause \) mcelveen state reforms , criminal justice reforms , access to treatment to senator cruz s point , let s take it a step further would you be willing to engage in crossborder enforcement into mexico , a place where law enforcement in new hampshire has traced at lot of this supply back to would you engage in crossborder enforcement without the cooperation without the mexican government \? christie of course i would as a former united states attorney who spent seven years of my life fighting this on the streets of my state , i would do that but we need to do more and let me tell you what we 've done in new jersey , josh we are working with the folks in new hampshire in their legislature right now to show them how we 're helping to solve this problem in new jersey not just for this campaign three years ago , i proposed a law that we signed into effect , which said that anyone who was a non violent , nondealing , firsttime drug offender no longer goes to prison in new jersey they go to mandatory , inpatient drug treatment what has happened is , crime has gone down 20 percent in those years the prison population has gone down 10 percent we 've now closed the state prison closed a state prison , and we 're turning it into a drug rehabilitation facility , so people can get the tools they need listen , everyone out there knows this in new hampshire this is a disease it s not a moral failing , it s a disease and we need to get people the treatment they need and let me tell you why because i'm prolife and i'm pro life not just for the nine months in the womb , i'm prolife for when they get out and it s a lot more complicated \( applause \) sixteenyearold , heroinaddicted drug girl on the floor of the county lockup , i'm prolife for her life the 42yearold lawyer who is taking oxycontin and ca n't get out of bed and support his family i'm prolife for his life everyone of those lives is an individual gift from god and the last thing is this these efforts we 've taken over the last three years , 2015 in new jersey , for the first time in four years , drug overdose deaths have gone down , not up i 'll bring the same solutions to the country \( applause \) mcelveen governor christie , thank you very much david , martha , back to you raddatz thank you , governor christie thank you , josh our partner in this debate , the independent journal review , has collected questions from some prominent conservatives around the country here s a videotaped question from radio host larry o'connor \( begin video clip \) o'connor in 2008 , we saw how motivated an electorate can be when they think their vote is making history let s face it if hillary clinton is the nominee for the democrats , you 'll be running against the prospect of the first woman president how will you change that narrative and motivate the electorate behind your candidacy \? \( end video clip \) trump well raddatz mr trump , i'm going to give that question to you you took it you took it away anyway trump yes ok , good it looked like he was looking right at me , right there i think that i look at what s going on , i look at all of the polls , i do very , very well against hillary clinton i can tell you , i'm the last person that she wants to run against and i think you can see what we 've done in terms of galvanizing i 've been all over the country we 're last night , i was in south carolina , we had 12 , 000 people it set up in about four days we have galvanized and we 've created a movement a lot of it has to do with as an example , josh s question on drugs i'm the first person that said , build a wall but i mean , a real wall , not a toy wall like they have right now a real wall and you 'll solve lots of problems but we will galvanize the people of this country , and we will beat hillary clinton because assuming that she runs , by the way , how she gets away with the email stuff is hard to believe so , i do n't know that she s going to be running but on the assumption she runs \( applause \) i mean , look and speaking of that , if she runs , she s running for one reason she s going to be able to run for one reason , and that s because the democrats are protecting her because so many people have done so much less than her , and they were absolutely their lives have been destroyedtrump but on the assumption they do protect her , i will win the election and we will win it by a lot we will win it handily we cannot have another four years of essentially barack obama \( applause \) raddatz thank you , mr trump i'm going to go to senator rubio on this how would you change that narrative \? rubio i think it s already happening look at the turnout in iowa a historic number of people came out and voted in those caucuses there are saying the same thing is going to happen here in new hampshire look at the rallies that every single person on this stage is having much higher numbers than you used to see in the past and here is why because people are starting to understand , very clearly , that this election is going to be a turning point that 2016 is not just a choice between republican or democrat it is a referendum on our identity as a nation and as a people so here is what hillary clinton needs to understand we 're going to have our primary , we 're going to have our debates which by the way , are twice as many as the democrats have been willing to have themselves but we 're going to bring this party together and we are going to defeat hillary clinton , because she is unqualified to be the president of the united states of america she put classified information on her computer because she thinks she s above the law and anyone who lies to the families of people who have lost their loved ones in the service of our country like she did in benghazi , can never be the commanderinchief of the united states of america \( applause \) raddatz thank you , senator rubio dr carson , i want to go to you on larry o' connor s question would you change the narrative \? carson it s the same question \? raddatz yes carson yes well , first of all , i think it would be a pretty easy contrast , quite frankly , between myself and hillary clinton in one case , you have someone who is known as a deceitful individual an individual who at benghazi , which i will never let go , quite frankly , because i think of those two men who went up there on the top of that compound with machine guns , firing away , allowing their colleagues to escape and i'm sure , in the back of their mind , they were just saying , if we can just hold on , help is on the way but help was not on the way when did we in the united states not send people to help our own people \? you know , this is not who we are \( applause \) carson and i would simply make it a referendum on honesty and integrity versus deceit and the washington way muir martha \? raddatz thank you very much dr carson i'm going to go back to david muir governor , well come to you in the next segment when we come back , questions about race , about our veterans and social issues what younger conservative voters are now saying as we continue with new hampshire with the republican debate , right here on abc \( commercial break \) announcer live from st anselm college in new hampshire , here again are david muir and martha raddatz muir welcome back to new hampshire , abc news coverage of the republican debate , and it s great to have you back at the podiums , and we want to turn to race in america and mr trump , there are many who argue cell phones and smartphones are just now exposing what s been happening in this country for years cases of excessive force against minorities as you know , mr trump , on the other side , the fbi director recently said there s a chill wind blowing through law enforcement because of increased scrutiny you have said police are the most mistreated people in america as president , how do you bridge the divide \? trump well , there is a divide , but i have to say that the police are absolutely mistreated and misunderstood , and if there is an incident , whether it s an incident done purposely which is a horror , and you should really take very strong action or if it is a mistake , it s on your news casts all night , all week , all month , and it never ends the police in this country have done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order , and they 're afraid for their jobs , they 're afraid of the mistreatment they get , and i'm telling you that not only , me speaking , minorities all over the country , they respect the police of this country and we have to give them more respect they ca n't act they ca n't act they 're afraid for losing their pension , their job they do n't know what to do and i deal with them all the time we have to give great respect , far greater than we are right now , to our really fantastic police \( applause \) muir great mr trump , i did ask about bridging the divide though as president so what would you say to the american families who say we have lived through this , we have seen excessive force \? what would you say to those people \? trump well , they do and , you know , they sue everybody sues , right \? they see excessive i mean , they go out , they sue we have so much litigation i see the courts , i see what they 're doing they sue , and you know what \? we do n't want excessive force but at what point you know , either you 're going to have a police force that can do its job i was just up in manchester , i met with the police officers yesterday tremendous people they love the area , they love the people , they love all the people they want to do their job and you 're going to have abuse and you 're going to have problems , and you 've got to solve the problems and you have to weed out the problems but the police in this country are absolutely amazing people kasich david , david muir i do want to ask governor kasich \? kasich i wanted i wanted to say , look , this there can be a winwin here i have formed a collaborative between police and community leaders because people have to respect law enforcement a family does n't want dad or mom going home in a box and for our community leaders , many of them think the system not only works not only does n't work for them , but it works against them and i created a big collaborative in ohio made up of law enforcement , community leaders , the head of my public safety and a former democrat , liberal senate senator nina turner , run it they got together , they made recommendations on recruiting , on hiring , on the use of deadly force and what we 're about to do is to bring community and police together so we can have a winwin we need more winwins in america and we do n't have to pick one over another divide we love the police , but we 've got to be responsible to the people in the community we have to do all of that \( applause \) muir governor , thank you senator rubio , i want to ask you next , president obama visited a mosque this week in america for the first time in his presidency president george w bush visited a mosque after september 11th you said of president obama , quote , he s always pitting people against each other so i'm curious , how are the two visits different , and would you visit a mosque as president \? rubio i would but that s not the issue my problem with what he did is he continues to put out this fiction that there s widespread systematic discrimination against muslim americans first of all , let s recognize this if you go to a national cemetery in this country , you will see stars of davids and crosses , but you see crescent moons there are brave men and women who happen to be muslim americans who are serving this country in uniform and who have died in the service of this country and we recognize that and we honor that but by the same token , we face a very significant threat of home grown violent extremism we need to have strong , positive relationships in the islamic communities in this country so they will identify and report this activity , especially mosques , for example , that are participating not just in hate speech , but inciting violence and taking acts against us and i do believe it is important also to recognize , you want to talk about religious discrimination in america well , i do n't think barack obama is being sued by any islamic groups , but he is being sued by the little sisters of the poor we are facing in this country christian groups and groups that hold traditional values who feel and in fact are being discriminated against by the laws of this country that try to force them to vie to violate their conscience \( applause \) muir senator rubio , thank you martha \? raddatz governor christie , earlier this week , the world health organization declared the zika virus a global emergency the same kind of mosquitoes that carry the zika virus in latin america are found here in the united states , and the virus has been linked to severe birth defects governor christie , at the peak of the ebola outbreak in west africa , you ordered an american nurse who landed at newark airport be detained and quarantined as fear spreads now of the zika virus and with the rio olympics just months away , is there a scenario where you would quarantine people traveling back from brazil to prevent the spread in the united states \? christie you bet i would and the fact is that because i took strong action to make sure that anyone who was showing symptoms remember what happened with that nurse she was showing symptoms and coming back from a place that had the ebola virus active and she had been treating patients this was not just some like , we picked up her just for the heck of it , alright \? we did it because she was showing symptoms , and the fact is that s the way we should make these decision you make these decisions based upon the symptoms , the medicine , and the law we quarantined her , she turned out to test negative ultimately after 48 hours , and we released her back to the state of maine but , i want to add something on the issue of mosques now , i'm the only one up here who s had a law enforcement background as a us attorney after september 11th i went to mosques throughout my state to build bridges to build bridges between our community in law enforcement so we can get intelligence and information from these folks i 've had the experience of working with them as governor of new jersey as well we cannot nix \( ph \) the radical islamic jihadist with everyday muslimamericans new jersey is the second largest muslim american population in america , of any state these are good , law abiding , hard working people what they need is our cooperation , and our understanding they do not just need broadsides against them because of the religious faith they practice raddatz governor christie , thank you \( applause \) raddatz i'm going to move to dr carson , and go back to the zika virus , is that going too far , quarantining \? you 're a doctor , what would you do \? carson well , you know , it s not a simple issue , and now , you know , we 've gotten evidence that there can been active viruses in other bodily fluids like saliva and urine so , this is going to be , obviously , a big deal do we quarantine people \? if we have evidence that they are infected , and that there is evidence that that infection can spread by something that they 're doing , yes but , just willynilly going out and quarantining a bunch of people because they 've been to brazil , i do n't believe that that s going to work what we really need to be thinking about is how do we get this disease under control \? and this is where we need rapid response we need a rapid response for ebola , we need rapid response for zika , there will be other things that will come up these are the kinds of things that the nih , the cdc , can be very effective in we need to give the the appropriate support for those kind of things raddatz thanks very much , dr carson i want to move on to the military senator rubio , all restrictions on women in combat as long as they qualify positions including special operations forces , like navy seals just this week military leaders of the army and marine corps said that they believed young women , just as young men are required to do , should sign up for selective service in case the draft is reinstated many of you have young daughters senator rubio , should young women be required to sign up for selective service in case of a national emergency \? rubio first , let me say there are already women today serving in roles that are like combat that , in fact , whose lives are in very serious danger , and so i have no problem whatsoever with people of either gender serving in combat so long as the minimum requirements necessary to do the job are not compromised but , i support that , and obviously now that that is the case i do believe that selective service should be opened up for both men and women in case a draft is ever instituted i think the more fundamental challenge we 're now facing is what s happening to the us military i 've said this many times , and i think it s important to start paying attention to this our air force is about to be the smallest it s been in 100 years i'm sorry , in our history our army is set to be smaller than it s been since the second world war , and our navy is about to be the smallest than it s been in 100 years i think we need to begin to refocus on rebuilding our military because every time we have cut our military in the history of this country we have had to come back later and rebuild it , and it costs more , and it s a lot more chaotic and dangerous when i'm president , we are rebuilding the us military \( applause \) raddatz thank you , senator rubio governor bush , do you believe that young women bush say it again \? raddatz do you believe young women should sign up for selective service , be required to sign up bush i do , and i do think that we should not impose any kind of political agenda on the military there should be if women can meet the requirements , the minimum requirements for combat service they ought to have the right to do it for sure it ought to be focused on the morale as well we got to make sure that we have readiness much higher than we do today we need to eliminate the sequester which is devastating our military we ca n't be focusing on the political side of this , we need to realize that our military force is how we project our word in the world when we 're weak militarily it does n't matter what we say we can talk about red lines , and isis being the jv team , and reset buttons and all this if we do n't have a strong military than no one fears us , and they take actions that are against our national interest raddatz tell me what you 'd say to american people out there \( applause \) raddatz who are sitting at home , who have daughters , who might worry about those answers , and might worry bush why would they worry about it raddatz if the draft is reinstituted \? bush well , the draft s not going to be reinstituted , but why if women are accessing raddatz are you saying you 'd do away with it \? bush no i did n't say that you you asked a question not about the draft , you asked about registering and if women are going to be raddatz you register for the draft bush if but raddatz if it s reinstituted bush we do n't have a draft i'm not suggesting we have a draft what i'm suggesting is that we ought to have readiness being the first priority of our military , and secondly , that we make sure that the morale is high and right now , neither one of those are acceptable because we 've been gutting the military budget we also need to reform our procurement process we need to make sure there are more men and women in uniform than people than civilians in our defense department there s a lot of things that we need to reform to bring our defense capabilities into the 21st century and i'm the guy that could do that that s why i have the support of generals , of admirals , of 12 medal of honor recipients and many other people that know that i would be a steady commanderinchief and rebuild our military \( applause \) christie martha \? raddatz thank you very much christie can i can i be really can i be really clear on this , because i am the father of two daughters one of them is here tonight what my wife and i have taught our daughters right from the beginning , that their sense of selfworth , their sense of value , their sense of what they want to do with their life comes not from the outside , but comes from within and if a young woman in this country wants to go and fight to defend their country , she should be permitted to do so part of that also needs to be part of a greater effort in this country , and so there s no reason why one young women should be discriminated against from registering for the selective service the fact is , we need to be a party and a people that makes sure that our women in this country understand anything they can dream , anything that they want to aspire to , they can do that s the way we raised our daughters and that s what we should aspire to as president for all of the women in our country \( applause \) raddatz thank you very much , governor christie carson can i say something raddatz we just covered wait one second , dr carson carson something about the draft very quickly raddatz very quickly carson you know , 14 percent decrease in the number of people applying for voluntary military service , and i think part of it is because of the way that we treat our veterans you know , we would n't be a free country if it was n't for them , and we have 22 veterans per day committing suicide so , i think what we should do is have an external support system for people once they volunteer and it should follow them throughout their career , should follow them for three years , five years afterwards , a year before they get out , should be working on integrating them back into society , so that they quit on friday and they start their new job they should have health empowerment accounts that are subsidized so they can go to any medical facility and be taken care of they can go to a va if they want to but if we start taking care of our veterans the right way , we wo n't have to ever worry about a draft again \( applause \) raddatz thank you very much for bringing up that subject , dr carson , of our veterans and for another question about our veterans , we go back to josh mcelveen from wmur josh \? mcelveen thank you , martha none of you on stage tonight have ever worn a uniform as a member of the armed services that s the reality of it but as commanderinchief , you 'll also be charged with the care of 23 million active duty service members and veterans in this country some have suggested privatizing the va as a way to enhance care and increase the quality of the care and access others say that veterans should carry id cards that allow them access to any hospital or health care provider governor bush , what specifically would you do to ensure that those who have sacrificed for us are cared for \? bush i totally agree that we need to give veterans more choices a veterans card to be able to go to a private provider will enhance the quality of the service inside the department of veterans affairs we need career civil service reform only three people were fired after waiting lists were dropped where veterans did n't get care and people died it is outrageous and hillary clinton says that that s acceptable \? because she is captive of the public service uniforms career civil service reform would allow the next president to fire people that are that are showing sheer incompetence at a town hall meeting today , someone came told a story of their father who looked like he was 85 he had he got a bill eight years later from an operation he had , eight years it took they could n't resolve the dispute and then he was told that he died literally , the veterans administration sent a death certificate to this guy and it took nine months to clarify the guy i met him he s voting for me and he is likely to be alive \( laughter \) \( applause \) this is this is outrageous it is completely outrageous so , giving veterans more choices , creating centers of excellence , focusing on the true problems that exist dr carson is completely right we need to start focusing on this earlier , before they become veterans so that there s a customized plan so people do n't fall through the cracks we can do this , but it s going to require someone who has proven leadership skills to make it happen \( applause \) kasich josh \? mcelveen governor kasich , do you have a favored approach \? kasich josh , i mean , clearly , when a veteran comes home , they should get health care anywhere they want to go in our state , which is what we should do in the country , you know , if they drive a truck from kabul to kandahar in afghanistan , we say , you can drive a truck from columbus to cleveland , and you do n't have to go get a license we 're going to hand you one and if you 've got expertise in the military , we 're going to give you college credit or community college credit for the things that you did for our country and in addition to that , i 'll tell you , one of the biggest things i think has to be done and i would do it as president the pentagon has got to work with the returning soldier , sailor , along with the family , and we they 're the most valuable employees in the country i call them golden employees everybody wants to hire a veteran but there is a disconnect between the job openings and the veteran when the veteran comes back the veteran is a leader the veteran is strong the veteran is drug free there should be no unemployment among veterans and if the pentagon will work with the veterans' services agencies all across this country , josh , we can get people jobs and we can get them jobs quickly , get them their health care \( bell rings \) get them their college education let s lift them they 're the greatest people defending the united states of america and we need to take care of them , and we will we will \( applause \) mcelveen senator rubio , go ahead \? rubio well , my brother s a veteran we 're very proud of him in our family he served as a green beret in the 7th special forces from 1968 through 1971 and as part of his training , he jumped out of an airplane and he lost his two front teeth and for years , he s had to go to get these dental claims and every times he goes to get one of these dental claims filled , the va asks him , well , how do we know you lost your teeth in the army \? and he says , well , it s the only time i ever jumped out of a plane \( laughter \) but he s had to fight through this process , and i 've watched it firsthand that s why i'm proud that i worked in a bipartisan way we passed the va accountability bill that , for the first time , allows us to fire allows the va secretary to fire someone who s not doing a good job , who s a senior executive and the governor s right they 've only fired three people up to now more people will be fired if i'm president but the portability part of it is incredibly important veterans should be able to take their va benefits to any hospital or any doctor they want to go to when i am president of the united states , veterans will be able to take their benefits to any hospital or doctor that they choose \( applause \) mcelveen senator rubio , thanks very much going to move forward now david , martha , back to you muir josh , thank you i want to turn to a family that new hampshire voters know quite well , and senator cruz , the issue of hostages has been a very real and painful one here in this state as we all know , james foley was killed his mother , diane , said our government should be willing to negotiate , arguing that families should also be allowed to raise money for ransom what would you say to diane foley tonight \? should families be allowed to raise money for ransom for their loved ones \? cruz well , look , i recognize it is an agonizing experience when anyone is facing a loved loved member who s been kidnapped but at the same time , putting in place legal regimes that encourage the payment of ransom has the effect of putting a bounty on other americans there is a reason it has been longstanding us policy that we do n't negotiate with terrorists , we do n't pay ransoms if you look at what president obama has done over and over again , whether it was the james bergdahl deal , which was absolutely shameful , releasing five senior taliban terrorists to bring bergdahl back , or whether it was this recent deal with iran , where , again , up to 21 terrorists or potential terrorists were were released or not prosecuted in order to bring back four americans , what that does does is it effectively puts a bounty on american servicemen and women serving abroad , on american tourists traveling abroad and the proper approach \( bell rings \) is a president and commander in chief that defends this country and that goes after goes after the terrorists , rather than showing them weakness and encouraging them to target more americans muir senator cruz , thank you mr trump , what would you say to diane foley \? should families be allowed to raise money for ransom \? trump well , i i know diane foley very well her husband and these are tremendous people i spoke for them , i raised a lot of money for the foundation i fully understand , james , one of that was really the first that we saw , really visually saw it was so horrible and i will tell you , though , with all of that being said , you can not negotiate this way with terrorists if you do , you are going to have many , many more james foleys james foley was a great young man his parents are incredible people they 've done such a good job , since his since his death but you just cannot negotiate that way with terrorists , or you 're gonna have so many other james foleys and one thing on the vets during the last debate , i raised 6 million for the vets , and i will tell you something \( applause \) muir i will tell you that i think nobody here , nobody on this stage , gets along with the veterans groups in new hampshire better than i do without ball \( ph \) to sarel \( ph \) and all of the people that i deal with and these are great people the one thing that we 're not mentioning , there s tremendous fraud , waste and abuse in the veterans administration and if i'm running things , that s going to disappear \( bell rings \) and it s going to disappear quickly \( applause \) muir mr trump , thank you we want to turn now to social issues and young voters and for the question , from mary katherine ham thank you david senator rubio one of the lazier pieces of political conventional wisdom is that socalled social issues are hurting republicans with young people but on the two most prominent social issues , polling with millennials actually moves in different directions on one hand , it is clear , young people across the political spectrum increasingly favor same sex marriage however young voters have not moved to the left on abortion in fact , large numbers of them favor at least some modest restrictions that conservatives have supported how do you speak to millennials on both these issues , while democrats will inevitable charge intolerance and extremism \? rubio well , first of all , i do n't believe that believing in traditional marriage the way i do makes you a bigot or a hater it means that you believe that this institution that s been around for millenial is an important cornerstone of society i respect people that believe differently but i believe deeply , that marriage should be between one man and one woman \( applause \) rubio on the issue of life , to me , the issue of life is not a political issue it s a human rights issue and it s a difficult issue , because it puts in conflict two competing rights on the one hand is the right of a woman to choose what to do with her body which is a real right and on the other hand is the right of an unborn human child to live and they 're in conflict and as a policy maker , i must choose which one of these two sides takes precedence and i have chosen to err on the side of life here s what i find outrageous there has been five democratic debates the media has not asked them a single question on abortion and on abortion , the democrats are extremists why does n't the media ask hillary clinton why she believes that all abortion should be legal , even on the due date of that unborn child why do n't they ask hillary clinton why she believe that partial birth abortion , which is a gruesome procedure that has been outlawed in this country , she thinks that s a fundamental right they are the extremists \( bell rings \) when it comes to the issue of abortion and i ca n't wait to expose them in a general election \( applause \) ham governor bush \? i want to come to you your allies have recently attacked senator rubio for being too prolife to be elected in november you made a similar charge stating it in an interview this is a prolife party do you stand behind that criticism \? bush look , i'm prolife in fact , on this stage , i'm the most prolife person because i 've acted on it for eight years as governor of the state of florida \( applause \) bush where we abolished partialbirth abortion , where parents have the right to be notified when their teenage child is having an abortion we were the first state to do a choose life license plate to raise money for adoption we were the first state to have state monies go to crisis pregnancy centers , which recently was just increased to 4 million a year we created greater regulation on abortion clinics , where there were horrific procedures so i'm pro life , but i believe there should be exceptions rape , incest and when the life of the mother is in danger and so , that belief , and my consistency on this , makes me , i think , poised to be in the right place , the sweet spot for a republican nominee and others may have a different view and i respect it \( applause \) bush but i think we have to be cognizant of the fact there s a lot of people that are concerned about having a prolife position without any exceptions \( applause \) rubio i do support protection for the life of the mother because i'm prolife i just believe deeply that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws if i'm president and there s a bill that s passed that saves lives but it has exceptions , i 'll sign it but i do believe deeply that all human life is worthy of the protection of laws i 've already said , for me , the issue of life is not a political issue and i want to be frank i would rather lose an election than be wrong on the issue of life \( applause \) ham governor christie you too , have talked about senator rubio s position on the life issue some conservative activists have called this line of attack harmful to the prolife cause christie well , i 've been pretty helpful to the prolife cause in one of the most prochoice states in the union i 've stood up for the first time and now for the last six years we 've defunded planned parenthood , not talked about it like they do in washington dc but for six years as governor , planned parenthood does not receive that funding from the state budget anymore over 50 million worth of money that s been saved now , that is not going to do exactly what hillary clinton wants to have done and has advocated for she believes that organization , which engages in the systematic murder of children in the womb , in order to maximize the value of their body parts for sale on the open market , is an acceptable position let me tell you something , i do n't care if you are a millennial or whether you are in your 90s , no one is for that type of activity , unless you are the most radical type of extremist on this issue , like senator clinton and her party is on this issuechristie i 'll say one other thing the fact is , that i believe that if a woman has been raped , that is a birth and a pregnancy that she should be able to terminate if she is the victim of incest this is not a woman s choice this is a woman being violated and the fact is that we have always has believed , as has ronald reagan , that we have selfdefense for women who have been raped and impregnated because of it , or the subject of incest and been impregnated for it that woman should not have to deliver that child if they believe that violation is now an act of selfdefense by terminating that pregnancy ham thank you , all back to you , david and martha \( applause \) muir mary katherine , thank you we 're going to have closing statements here in just a moment , but before we go , quick lightning round come november , two battleground states , but they face off tomorrow in the super bowl governor kasich , who wins \?

rome in finland , militia groups are patrolling small towns housing asylum seekers in the name of protecting white finnish women in germany , farright protesters rampaged through leipzig on monday , vandalizing buildings in an antiislamization demonstration in italy on tuesday , an antiimmigration regional government approved the text of a law making it difficult to construct new mosques as muslim refugees are settled in the area across europe , the migrant crisis that has engulfed the continent since the summer is provoking new levels of public anxiety after the in cologne , germany , where witnesses and the police described predatory gangs of mostly foreign men , , groping and robbing young women the cologne police are also investigating allegations of rape while the police say the assaults in cologne were carried out by hundreds of men , even that is a narrow sliver of the more than one million asylum seekers who entered europe last year still , the anxieties provoked by the cologne attacks quickly spread as reports emerged of similar new year s eve assaults in other german cities , as well as in finland and austria while the details in some of those reports are sketchy , and none approach what happened in cologne , they have touched an exceptionally raw nerve as european societies face the challenge of integrating and acculturating the asylum seekers , most of them muslims , and a majority of those single men farright political parties , which have long invoked hoary stereotypes of darkskinned foreigners threatening european identity and security , have pounced on the reports , having already capitalized on the inability of the european union to secure its external borders while efficiently managing the movement of migrants inside the bloc this has been the elephant in the room that no one is prepared to acknowledge that the great fear is the fear of islam , said alexander betts , director of the refugee studies center at oxford he argued that most mainstream politicians had failed to directly address these public fears or to provide enough clarity in the migration debate , creating a vacuum that antiimmigrant leaders have rushed to fill mr betts warned that unless political leaders could quickly articulate a nuanced argument for migration one that confronts fears about security and religious differences , especially in the aftermath of the nov 13 public support for granting asylum to refugees could collapse to have attacks in germany that are of a sexual nature perpetuated by men ostensibly of muslim origin is symbolically devastating for a public commitment to asylum , he said the public mood has been shifting for weeks and is already influencing policy european news outlets reported on tuesday that since jan 1 , germany had tightened screening of migrants trying to enter the country from austria many other european countries erected fences or border checkpoints last year to block or divert the flow of migrants moves that threatened to destroy europe s system of open internal borders in denmark , the government is even moving from arriving migrants to defray the cost of accommodating them chancellor angela merkel of germany has been europe s most outspoken advocate of accepting refugees , emphasizing the humanitarian and moral imperative of doing so while seeking to rally ordinary germans with her slogan , we can do it ! but germany is bearing the brunt of the new arrivals , and critics have accused ms merkel of failing to clearly articulate a plan for an integration process that is likely to last many years it seems as though the time has come for a broad debate over germany s future and merkel s mantra of we can do it' is no longer enough to suppress it , wrote der spiegel , the german newsmagazine , which described the police s failure to stop the assaults in cologne as symbolic of the state s powerlessness in the face of chaos and crime at the same time , polls show that farright parties are gaining support in france , germany and elsewhere in austria , herbert kickl , general secretary of the rightwing freedom party , has called for an immediate halt to new asylum applications , while other party members have called for closing austria s borders in the aftermath of the cologne attacks many austrians who are very wary of the freedom party s agenda concede that the influx of refugees has stirred an undercurrent of fear , even though the country has seen little violence there s a split in society in our editorial office , at the lunch table , in circles of friends , said florian klenk , editor in chief of falter , a leftleaning weekly based in vienna it is a polarization , but we have little violence even so , peter hacker , vienna s appointed refugee coordinator , said the city had developed strategies to coordinate waves of migrants last september we decided then that we 'd have a maximum visible presence of police in the places , like train stations , where migrants were , he said mr hacker added here in vienna , we have a clear political stance on refugees and migrants vienna has understood for decades that migrants are to be helped many analysts note that the cologne assaults are especially damaging because antiimmigration critics and rightwing extremists are using them to discredit all migrants as criminals or hooligans , even though the overwhelming majority of migrants , many of them refugees fleeing war in syria , are peaceful and lawabiding but fine distinctions have been blurred amid a climate of anxiety and insecurity in europe that has widened divisions in politics , the news media and society alike in finland , the helsinki police department issued a statement on jan 7 claiming it had prevented a group of young iraqi refugees from molesting women on new year s eve an announcement that startled many finns but other witnesses , as well as an official at finland s national bureau of investigation , later discounted any suggestion of similarities to the cologne attacks yet already , finnish militia groups , including one called the soldiers of odin , are patrolling towns in the name of protecting women many of these groups have ties to farright organizations , and their presence has become a major political issue opposition politicians have criticized the reluctance of finland s rightwing government to condemn the militia patrols the country s justice minister , jari lindstrom , a member of the populist , antiimmigration finns party , caused a furor when he said the patrols did not worry him europe already endured a tumultuous 2015 that included the migrant crisis , the greek debt crisis and two waves of terrorist attacks in paris for the european union , no crisis has been more threatening than the influx of refugees , which has turned nation against nation and exposed the institutional shortcomings of the union s structure to address questions like external and internal security many analysts say the cologne attacks have only intensified the pressure for drastic reforms to the european union system the only way to deal with this problem is through the european union , said sergio fabbrini , director of the school of government at luiss guido carli university in rome yet it is clear that the european union does n't have the institutional tools or political will to deal with it

cologne , germany in early december , the cologne police made their new year s eve preparations drawing on the previous year s experience , they identified their biggest worry as pickpocketing and fireworks among the crowds so they increased their holiday deployment , to 142 from 88 , concentrating on the banks of the rhine river , where revelers traditionally gather for a giant fireworks display as 2016 neared on dec 31 , however , some 1 , 500 men , including some newly arrived asylum seekers and many other immigrants , had instead assembled around cologne s train station drunk and dismissive of the police , they took advantage of an overwhelmed force , according to police reports , shocking germany and stoking  we were just pressed on all sides by people , recalled one victim , johanna , 18 , who agreed to speak by telephone from lake constance , germany , where she lives , only if her last name was not used , fearing hostility , particularly over social media i was grabbed continually i have never experienced such a thing in any german city much is still hazy about that night but the police reports and the testimony of officials and victims suggest that the officers failed to anticipate the new realities of a germany that is now host to up to a million asylum seekers , most from wartorn muslim countries unfamiliar with its culture working from outdated expectations , the police made a series of miscalculations that , officials acknowledge , allowed the situation to deteriorate at the same time , both the police and victims say , it was not a situation any of them had encountered before this was new terrain for all , and just one taste of the challenges facing germany and its leader , chancellor angela merkel , to assimilate a huge new population in an atmosphere of dwindling tolerance and volatile politics lale akgun , 62 , a turkishborn analyst who has lived in cologne and worked on integration issues for decades , said in an interview that the new year s eve incident highlighted the growing tension between those who see the new arrivals as a source of enrichment and those who see them as a burden , or even a danger we need a new common history , a new shared history , she said , particularly in practicalities , like policing that much became evident over the steadily building mayhem of new year s eve visitors to evening mass in cologne cathedral , just across the square from the train station , told reporters in subsequent days that by 7 pm the noise from fireworks outside was so loud that they could not hear the priest , who was using a microphone by 9 pm , as many as 500 youths , some of them very drunk , were growing ever more reckless in hurling fireworks at people and buildings , threatening panic but the commanding officer at the scene declined an offer of more than 80 reinforcements , who could have been in cologne in an hour , according to bernd heinen , a senior police official , who criticized the commander for failing throughout the night to look ahead and anticipate a worsening situation by 10 20 , 10 additional officers were sent to the square about an hour later , as the crowd swelled to nearly 1 , 500 and the police assessed that the mood grew increasingly aggressive , the police commander decided to clear the square and block entrances to the station , but still did not request the extra unit of officers blocking the entrances to the station turned into its own trap shortly after midnight , when the usual city fireworks had lit up the sky over the rhine nearby , thousands of people streamed back toward the station to go home they found the entrances blocked in the ensuing crush , according to complaints lodged with the police , groups of four to 20 young men formed circles around young women , grasping at their clothes and bodies , and stealing their possessions johanna said that she and her friends were among those first trapped outside the railway station , and then inside it after midnight her wallet had been stolen earlier in the evening now , she said , she was grabbed repeatedly by men all around she and two friends a man and a woman hid money and cellphones in internal pockets they eventually boarded a train , she said , but it could not depart the station for 90 minutes because fights erupted completely out of control that was really the worst night of my life , she said i would not want to experience this again another woman who was there , sara , a 25yearold from the bavarian town of aschaffenburg , said the situation was still precarious at 4 am , when she arrived at the station with a girlfriend hundreds of what she described as foreign men began to circle around us , she said , agreeing to speak only if her last name was not used , also for fear of being attacked over social media i grabbed my girlfriend i do social work with women who are affected by violence and told her do n't look any of them in the eyes keep hold of your purse' then i got frightened , told them leave me in peace' with a hand gesture anyone in the world understands that sara said that she and her friend decided to seek safety outside the station with police officers , who were themselves helpless i never experienced that a policeman says , i would love to help you , but i ca n't' that was really the worst , she said who should i turn to as a woman \? what should i do \? sara said she had not yet formally lodged a complaint because she was sick , but intended to do so according to the police reports , the precinct closest to the station received 30 to 50 complaints of sexual assault and theft in the first hour of the new year women who came to the precinct were crying several of them left when the sole female officer available could not quickly note their complaint later that morning , an initial news release from the police described the evening s events as peaceful it is still not clear , as many in the public have since charged , whether the police were covering up their failings , or the fact that migrants were involved , or whether it simply took several days for the full scope of the assaults to come to light while national and international news media focused on the terrorism scare that forced the police to clear two stations in munich on new year s eve , local websites and the local k lner stadtanzeiger newspaper reported women saying that they had been harassed on jan 1 by late jan 2 , the police issued an online appeal for people to come forward if they had experienced or witnessed crime since then , the police have received 653 complaints of robberies and sexual assaults , and several rapes the mother of a 19yearold who said she had been raped called the police by 10 am on jan 1 , and officers went to the teenager s hotel , getting her and two other women to a gynecological exam even the relatively dry language of the police report issued this week summarizing at least 90 complaints of sexual harassment makes the situation graphically clear it refers over and over to victims surrounded by men and groped in intimate area , grabbed by breasts and bottoms , or even fingers inserted in vagina rainer wendt , head of the national police union , conceded in an interview that cologne police commanders committed several errors beginning with scheduling extra police deployment only for 10 pm but he said there was no way to have foreseen the mass drunkenness and the crowds on the square , which is not the traditional center of celebrations in the city you are always wiser after the fact , he said last year , the police deployment in cologne was planned exactly on the same lines , and it was sufficient ralf j ger , the interior minister of north rhine westphalia , germany s most populous state , noted that drink and drugs exacerbated the situation after alcohol and drug excesses came the excesses of violence , peaking with people who carried out fantasies of sexual power , he told state legislators on monday the hope now is that surveillance videos from the police and state railway cameras in the station , from nearby businesses and hotels , and above all from cellphones will help to identify the perpetrators the police have 135 officers sifting 350 hours of video , they say of 19 suspects so far identified by name by the cologne police , 10 were asylum seekers and the other nine were believed to be in germany illegally , according to a report by mr j ger , the interior minister none were registered as living in cologne , and four are now in custody for robberies committed during the new year s events an additional 32 suspects have been identified by the federal police , including 22 asylum seekers but also three germans and an american , among others , the report said fully unraveling the cologne events is expected to take several weeks , however the police are also examining whether similar events reported from other cities hamburg , with over 100 complaints , but also stuttgart , frankfurt and nuremberg are connected , or even organized holger m nch , the head of the federal criminal police , said tuesday that it is not organized crime , but what we see here is perpetrators communicating with each other and making arrangements we must recognize better where they do this , how they do this , mr m nch told rbb inforadio mr wendt , head of the national police union , said that the authorities in cologne and several other cities were hurriedly revising their deployment plans for carnival , which is celebrated with mass parades and revelry , particularly in cities up and down the rhine the main day is rose monday , on feb 8 this year the police and the state government in mainz , a main carnival center , detailed extra plans this week , including creating special passages to allow women to leave raucous crowds , more bodycams for police officers and steps to explain carnival to newcomers who have never seen such celebrations unfortunately , in germany , mr wendt said , political decisions are somehow made only after the house is on fire
