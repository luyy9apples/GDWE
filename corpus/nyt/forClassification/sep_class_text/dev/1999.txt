washington , oct 12 some recent skirmishes in the political culture wars the senate is making plans to create a special panel on american culture , a forum for a handful of senators from both parties to examine , among other matters , violence in popular entertainment the federal trade commission , under orders from president clinton , has begun an exhaustive study of whether the movie , recording and video industries market violent products to children in a sizzling daylong debate in june in the house of representatives , one lawmaker after another denounced the entertainment industry then the house unanimously adopted a hortatory measure calling the industry irresponsible and instructing it do everything in its power to stop these portrayals of pointless acts of brutality by immediately eliminating gratuitous violence in movies , television , music and video games in the last two weeks the senate and house have passed nonbinding resolutions expressing their view \( but setting no policy \) that the brooklyn museum of art should be denied federal funds unless it cancels the sensation exhibition despite all this activity as well as a belief among politicians from both parties and much of the public that violence in the media contributes to some degree to violence in society , it is a safe bet that no law will be passed or regulatory action taken that puts meaningful restraints on movies , television and other forms of entertainment in part , that is a result of intense lobbying and generous campaign contributions from broadcasters , filmmakers and others in the entertainment field after all , nothing in washington politics nowadays is immune from armtwisting and money entertainment industry interests gave over 20 million to parties and candidates in the 1996 presidential and congressional elections , and donations in the first six months of this year far exceed that pace , according to the campaign study group , a nonpartisan research firm but the main reason no concrete action is likely to be taken is neither the money nor the lobbying but the fact that most politicians of all stripes have come to realize that as serious as they feel the situation is , there is little the government can do about it gallup polls last spring found that 81 percent of american adults say they believe that violent entertainment is a cause of increased violence in society and that 73 percent say the government should restrict the access of minors to such material politicians follow such polls as diligently as they follow campaign contributions , and would certainly respond to this sentiment if they could but they say they cannot not in a way that would be effective and constitutional this is a problem that is n't going to be solved in washington , said senator sam brownback , republican of kansas , the chief sponsor of the measure that would create the special senate panel on culture senator charles e schumer , the new york democrat , said he worried deeply about the content of the entertainment available to his 15yearold daughter , jessica he has some influence in this regard as a father , he said , but essentially none as a lawmaker if i could wave a magic wand and stop violence in the media , i would wave it , he said but it is impossible without the heavy hand of government starting to censor , and when the government starts censoring or giving a seal of approval , it has the potential to do more bad than good political focus on violence in popular culture has waxed and waned over the years some senators and representatives said they remembered watching as children the televised hearings conducted in 1954 by senator estes kefauver on whether violence in comic books contributed to juvenile delinquency \( at a memorable moment , senator kefauver held up the cover of a comic book and said to its publisher , this seems to be a man with a bloody ax holding a woman s head up , which has been severed from her body do you think that is in good taste \? yes , the publisher replied , explaining that it would be in bad taste if , for example , the severed head was held higher and blood was shown dripping from it \) the political fervor reached a new pitch this year after the massacre at columbine high school in littleton , colo , and other acts of violence around the country in june , the house debated whether the availability of guns or the prevalence of violence in the media was the primary cause in the end , the house voted to do nothing about either a pivotal vote came on a proposal offered by representative henry j hyde of illinois , the republican who is chairman of the judiciary committee his measure would have made it a crime punishable by up to five years in prison to sell , distribute or lend violent movies , television programs , videos , books and internet material to children applying standards that the supreme court set for defining obscenity , the hyde proposal applied to material that the average person would find was patently offensive with respect to what is suitable to minors the material would have to fail the socalled slaps test , meaning that it had no serious literary , artistic , political or scientific value for minors

it was just a stone thrown at a parked car , an act of vandalism not much different from countless others but with the search for the man who bashed a young woman with a similar paving stone in midtown almost a week old , any promising lead can bring out scores of investigators so yesterday morning , the police responded in force when a 63yearold woman reported seeing a man toss the stone through the window of a compact car on riverside drive on manhattan s upper west side the description of the man loose as it was also appeared to the police to be a close enough approximation of the one given by witnesses who saw a man smash the young woman , nicole barrett , in the head last tuesday on 42nd street but in the end , investigators decided that the man who threw the stone yesterday was not the same one who attacked ms barrett police officials did not know that yesterday morning we 're going to respond to each and every report , said marilyn mode , a police department spokeswoman we take what happened last tuesday very seriously , naturally , and so we 're going to investigate the calls we receive no one was hurt in yesterday s incident , which the police said took place at 8 30 am , when the woman , who was waiting for a city bus , saw the man stare at her and then throw the stone into the car the woman did not hurry to call the police , they said , waiting two hours and doing so only at her husband s urging the police , however , rushed to the scene of the vandalized car , near 86th street , a neighborhood of large apartment buildings bordering riverside park officers from the 20th precinct fanned out into the park and neighborhood to see whether anyone else had seen the man who threw the stone the crime scene unit , normally only active for murders or other serious crimes , arrived to recover the stone and review the trajectory we 're going to take a peek , one top police official said after talking to the witness , the police determined that the description she gave did not match the one given by witnesses to the assault on ms barrett while the man who threw the stone at the car was black and appeared to be homeless like ms barrett s attacker he was in his 30 s and clean shaven , they said ms barrett s assailant was said to be in his 40 s , and some witnesses said he had a short white beard police commissioner howard safir continued to appeal for more information from new yorkers speaking at bellevue hospital center , where ms barrett is recovering , mr safir again noted that the city had posted an 11 , 000 reward the commissioner specifically asked for information from anyone who might have seen the suspect riding the lexington avenue subway line last tuesday from the upper east side , where the police believe the man found the paving stone used in the attack , to 42nd street and madison avenue , where she was hit so far , he said , investigators have looked into hundreds of tips we check them all out , mr safir said so far , none have been successful photo the shattered window of a car on riverside drive near 86th street investigators were seeking a link to last week s attack on a young woman who was hit with a brick at 42nd street and madison avenue \( james estrin the new york times \)
philadelphia , march 12 the presence of stephon marbury on the nets' roster apparently has not solidified the shaky ground on which the beleaguered coach john calipari is standing according to an eastern conference official , the nets have been in contact with phil jackson , the former chicago bulls coach , since the acquisition of marbury became a possibility earlier this week jackson , who retired last season after leading the bulls to six national basketball association championships in eight years , is intrigued by the potential the nets have with marbury , keith van horn , kerry kittles and jayson williams , according to the official lewis katz , the nets' principal owner , could not be reached late tonight for comment on jackson but before the nets' 10093 overtime loss to the philadelphia 76ers which marbury watched from the sideline in street clothes he did not give his coach a vote of confidence when asked about televised reports thursday night that calipari was on the verge of being fired i think it would be inappropriate today to comment on all this speculation about cal and what his future is , katz said i have n't even spoken to cal the last three or four days this thing has totally consumed me katz was referring to the threeteam , nineplayer deal that included minnesota and milwaukee and brought marbury , chris carr and elliot perry to the nets none of those players competed in tonight s game because all of the players involved had not yet reported to their teams that left the nets with just eight players in uniform , and doug overton , whom they signed to a 10day contract hours before the game , as the starting point guard playing with a fire rarely seen of late , the nets led by 2714 after one quarter and by 4432 at the half the nets led by 8067 with nine minutes remaining but in an all too familiar scene , the nets allowed the 76ers to come back and take an 8785 lead on a driving layup by allen iverson with 39 seconds to play kendall gill hit an 18foot jumper 14 seconds later to send the game into overtime iverson , who was nearly suspended from tonight s game because he missed a team practice on wednesday , scored 5 of his gamehigh 28 points in the extra period to lead the 76ers' charge van horn led the nets \( 316 \) with 25 points and 16 rebounds the loss was the nets' 12th in 13 games the defeats and the job speculation have left calipari looking glum asked about his job security , calipari denied being worried it never bothers me , everything that circles around , calipari said we 've just got to win games and get going i came in here with a fiveyear plan i will say this when you look at this place two years ago and what it s like now where we are and what we 're doing i think everything s on the right track rebounds kerry kittles , who had 14 points and 11 rebounds tonight , said he would sign a sixyear contract extension before saturday s 11 59 pm deadline the deal is believed to be worth about 54 million over six years eric murdock was placed on the injured list with cartilage damage in his left knee
teaneck i walked into east japanese restaurant and immediately began relaxing for one thing , i was walking around in my socks for another , i was headed for a low table surrounded by sunken seats , both finished in a dark , soothing polished wood on our way , the host led me past an inviting central kitchen whose focal point was a woodfire grill steaming with the flavors of freshly cooked shrimp and eggplant it felt good to slide under the table and sit on a soft pillow , with the restaurant bustling around me and a stone waterfall bubbling behind me unfortunately , my server immediately brought me out of this comfortable atmosphere into a world less tranquil and more stopandgo unwieldy plastic menus were left carelessly on the table , and we had to request water our appetizers came out from the kitchen one at a time , indicating that the server was not aware of the importance of the whole dining experience , but instead was preoccupied with getting the food to the table this distracted attitude and staggered pace continued throughout the meal , as dirty dishes piled up and soiled dessert menus were delivered , creating an unhappy sense of having to personally maintain order at one s own table once i noticed a few problems with the service , i became preoccupied with looking for more , rather than enjoying the meal and company at hand unfortunately , i found them in general , east could use a little spring cleaning sparkling wood floors would be a start for all those stockinged feet and although the complimentary flip flops positioned near the restrooms provide a kind service , east should house them in a neat set of cubbies rather than haphazardly scattering them about while they 're at it , the managers of east should upgrade the plates and cutlery finally , the servers should care more about table maintenance , with just a little bit of sprucing up , east can come back strong fortunately , east still lures people in for its food while some of the menu , too , could be more finely tuned , for the most part the food is fresh tasting , artfully presented and full of flavor the kinoko soup for two , served in an attractive iron soup pot , is a clear , aromatic and intensely mushroomy soup , studded with broccoli florets and sliced button , shiitake and oyster mushrooms this is an ample portion , which actually serves as a refreshing palate cleanser if you can pace yourself and savor it slowly throughout the rest of the appetizers shrimp shumai has always been a favorite of mine , and east s little steamed packages were somehow more delicate than any i 've tried before they must have been filled with a cube of vegetable stock as each bite flooded my mouth with a burst of flavorful liquid i did not even consider dipping my shumai in soy sauce , as it would certainly have masked the crisp flavor of the ginger , the crunch of the cabbage and the saltiness of the shrimp i 've also eaten a lot of gyoza , but none have compared to the the roasted rootvegetable taste of these halfmoon shaped pockets unlike most gyoza , these spinach dumplings did not get soggy as they cooled instead , they became firm , pleasantly chewy and truly excellent the seaweed salad was very different from those i 've come to love rather than a straight portion of seaweed , the east version was mixed greens with seaweed draped on top the soy and ginger dressing , served on the side , was thick and sweet , but did not singlehandedly rescue the salad from its bland ingredients similarly , the negima , or beef and scallion broiled with teriyaki sauce , was a weak execution of this popular dish the beef had an unappealing gray hue , the scallions inside were raw , and the flavors did not meld together the sushi was very good , although i momentarily hesitated before clipping a piece of tuna between my chopsticks it did not have a wet fresh sheen and i wondered whether it had been cut hours earlier rather than per order the yellowtail and the eel quickly lured me back as each piece of sushi was its own perfect meal large pieces of fish draped over neat pads of rice , artfully displayed , as smooth as butter , and brimming with the taste of the sea i would recommend experimenting with the assortment of original , regular , fashion \( dressed up with a lettuce hat \) and spicy rolls offered at east the aac roll \( asparagus , avocado and cucumber \) was a perfect combination for vegetarian sushi , providing color , flavor , texture and most importantly , substance the spicy tuna roll was creamy , hot and filling often a hard trio to locate when eating sushi finally , the natto roll both surprised and perplexed my group i love soybeans but have never tried them mixed with scallion in a roll they are gummy , bland , salty , satisfying and curious all at the same time skip the ume shiso roll , or plum with mint leaves just as i feel that hot wasabi paste should not cross over as a pizza topping , mint should probably not be associated with sushi as in most japanese restaurants , the dessert is not a primary focus both the green tea and ginger ice cream tasted storebought , which is acceptable but not exciting i would have preferred fresh citrus or a final sip of my kirin beer it s not too early to be thinking about spring cleaning of my own everyone can benefit from taking a step back and taking a fresh look at their surroundings by fixing just a few details , east should have no problem keeping diners at ease throughout their japanese feast east japanese restaurant 1405 teaneck road , teaneck \( 201 \) 8371260

atlantic city , sept 15 as rain pounded the boardwalk today and anticipation of hurricane floyd kept many gamblers away from this seaside resort , striking hotel workers picketed noisily outside casinos more than 10 , 000 workers including maids , waiters , cooks and bellhops walked out last night after their contract expired at midnight without a new agreement with casino operators today , representatives of the casinos and local 54 of the hotel employees and restaurant employees international union continued their talks the union represents 14 , 000 workers at the city s 12 casinos , though 3 of those the claridge , showboat and harrah s settled with the union last night all of the city s casinos remained open for gambling , and patrons continued to clink quarters into slot machines or lay down their tokens at blackjack tables but visitors to the city who were staying at the affected casino s hotels had little if any maid service and no room service , and few restaurants from which to choose managers and security employees were filling in at some jobs many visitors have come to the city not to gamble , but to attend conferences or events like the miss america pageant , which is to be broadcast on national television from here on saturday the pageant will continue because none of the workers at the atlantic city convention center belong to the union that is on strike vicki castro of jacksonville , fla , who is here for the pageant , said she and her friends were having a drink at caesars just before midnight last night when a waitress brought them the drinks they had ordered , plus another round she told us , 'i know you just ordered one , but i brought you an extra one because we 're going on strike now' and then she disappeared , ms castro said , laughing strikers workers say a main issue is a trend among some casino operators to lease space to businesses , like planet hollywood at caesars , that hire nonunion workers for less pay and fewer benefits local 54 workers fear they could lose increasing numbers of jobs to those subcontractors these are not parttime jobs , said bill warren , a waiter at la peazza restaurant at caesars they are our careers they are our livelihoods we are supporting our families on these jobs tim wilmott , divisional president for harrah s atlantic city , which settled with the union last night , said his greatest concern was the approaching hurricane we 're getting a lot of cancellations for the next 36 to 48 hours , he said , adding that he was pleased he would not also have to worry about a strike photo striking workers at bally s park place casino resort yesterday \( laura pedrick for the new york times \)
garden city , ny , may 20 long island s largest business organization issued a withering analysis of nassau county s fiscal morass today and urged officials to cut nearly 1 , 000 jobs , replace nassau s antiquated tax assessment system and outlaw the sale of county assets to plug budget gaps otherwise , the group said , the county should cede control of its finances to an independent agency few of the recommendations seemed likely to be carried out but the statement by the long island association , whose members employ roughly half of the region s work force , was uncharacteristically forceful for a group dominated by republican executives who include some of the largest contributors to the nassau republican machine in recent months , the association s president , matthew t crosson , has sounded increasingly critical of the nassau county executive , thomas s gulotta , under whose leadership the budget deficit has soared to an estimated 300 million , prompting one creditrating agency to lower the county s bond rating and two others to threaten similar action the association s statement carefully avoided what it termed the shortsighted political game of assigning blame but mr crosson said in an interview today that he had waited for some time before releasing today s statement to see if the county executive would put forward a plan that addressed some or all of these issues or put forward a plan , really he has not , mr crosson added among the association s recommendations was a call for a change in the county charter to forbid the use of socalled oneshot revenues to pay for yearly operating expenses , a penchant of mr gulotta s that has infuriated goodgovernment organizations for years revenues from the sale of county land and other assets , as well as from the nationwide settlement of tobacco industry litigation , should be used only to pay down debt , the association said calling the county s debt now 27 billion , and climbing a serious threat to the future financial health of the county , the association objected to a deal last month in which the county agreed to incur nearly 240 million in debt in exchange for 70 million in upfront cash from the metropolitan transportation authority it also urged the immediate replacement of the county s tax assessment system , now based on 1938 construction costs , with one based solely on market value nassau now borrows to pay the tax refunds of those who challenge their assessments last year , that debt service alone cost 130 million the association said that the county had been more generous than the private sector in its recent contract with civil service workers , calling the deal an unfair burden on taxpayers civil servants' healthcare benefits , for example , require no employee contributions , in perpetuity that benefit is exceedingly rare , if not nonexistent , in the private sector , the association said , meaning that virtually none of the taxpayers who will pay for that benefit receive it themselves a spokesman for mr gulotta , david vieser , said that the county executive would review the association s recommendations , but that he would not discuss them today mr vieser took issue with a few points in the association s statement , however , most notably its call for a reduction in the county s fulltime payroll , now at 10 , 984 , to the 1992 level of about 10 , 000 mr vieser attributed most of that increase to the hiring of 600 new police officers since 1994 the county legislature s presiding officer , bruce a blakeman , said he shared many of the association s concerns , would carefully review its proposals and was keeping an open mind about replacing the tax assessment system but he said that some of its ideas were unworkable , like a proposal to have the county s comptroller calculate the revenues that will be available in a given year mr crosson said that proposal is meant to make it more difficult for the county executive to balance budgets by merely overestimating revenues while it s a good idea , in practice the comptroller would err on the side of caution , and underestimate revenues , so as not to be held responsible for any shortfall , mr blakeman said the result , he suggested , would be a logjam , with the executive and comptroller failing to agree as for the creation of an independent financial oversight agency , mr blakeman said it was out of the question we have the ability to fix our own problems , he said in the interview , mr crosson said today that the mounting budget deficits , rich labor contracts and growing debt burden of the county government had begun to imperil nassau s overall prosperity if the county is fiscally unhealthy , it s very difficult for business in the county to be healthy over the long term , he said taxes will go up , services will decline , the ability of county to meet the fundamental infrastructure needs of businesses within its borders declines , and the ability of the county to engage in economic development activities is eliminated all that creates an environment of decline , rather than of growth it s not something that s going to happen this summer , he said it is a wearing down process but once you have worn the fabric down to the point that it s torn , it s too late
hardwick township on the banks of the deceptively lazy delaware river here , it is not hard to imagine how 19yearold david ortiz might have paid little mind to the warning signs before he drowned trying to swim to the pennsylvania side it looks innocuous enough , said judy giddings , 55 , a teacher from bradford woods , pa , who was standing near the water s edge at the depew recreation site one day last week it was the last patch of dry land walked on by mr ortiz of newark , before a friend was unable to save him last month , thus becoming one of seven young men to drown since may 11 in what park officials say is the highest death toll in memory here of the seven fatalities , five people died in the river , one in blue mountain lake on the new jersey side and one at a waterfall on the raymondskill creek in pennsylvania the unusually high number of deaths has prompted park and elected officials to question the number of guards and the level of financing at what is now the ninth most popular of the 378 sites operated by the national park service while there are lifeguards at two beaches on the pennsylvania side , there are none in new jersey stephen b van campen of hackettstown , a member of the park s citizen advisory commission , which held a special hearing on the drownings on aug 12 , said he wants swimming prohibited at the depew site until lifeguards are posted there mr van campen also questioned whether the entire 40 miles of river at the park should be open to swimming if we know that people are going to continue to kill themselves , or drown themselves representative marge roukema , a republican whose district includes the water gap and who introduced the bill six years ago to create the advisory commission , agreed , saying , all safety measures need to be reevaluated the park superintendent , william laitner , said in an interview that he was limited in taking steps because of budget constraints , and cautioned that restricting use of the river was contrary to public sentiment and the very nature of the park he said there were no drownings last summer , and only two the previous year , when the same precautions were in place and while he expressed sympathy for the victims' families , he said this year s deaths mainly involved young men from cities drawn to the water gap for relief from the unusually hot weather who had limited experience swimming in rivers mr ortiz was among three people to drown near the depew recreation site , a clearing with parking , picnic tables and a pebbled beach just off of old mine road on the new jersey side of the river , about 10 miles north of interstate 80 it is named for depew island , which divides the delaware into two channels just upstream from the recreation site one slowmoving and shallow and the other , closer to the pennsylvania side , deeper and with a rapid current barely visible from the bank i can see that it would be tempting to try to swim to the other side , said ed marshall , 53 , of boonton , a computer cable installer who had taken off last wednesday to go fishing with a friend a glass display case posted nearby included the warning please use your life jacket drowning is for real ! another sign listed several warnings no lifeguard on duty fast current slippery bottom steep dropoffs unsupervised beach swim at your own risk a life ring , installed after a drowning on aug 1 stood on a post ms roukema was critical of the fact that there were no guarded beaches on new jersey side and two in pennsylvania in smithfield , about eight miles north of the interstate 80 crossing , and in millford , about 20 miles north she also said the park was probably not getting its share of park service money based on the number of visitors kevin schneider , a spokesman for the park service , said the agency s total operating budget for 1999 was 13 billion , and its 378 sites had a total of 287 million visits in 1998 or about 450 for each visitor by contrast , the water gap s current budget of 7 , 045 , 000 amounts to only about 140 for each of the 5 , 019 , 000 visits last year while the park s budget has increased 29 percent since 1991 , outpacing the 17 percent increase in visits since then , mr laitner said rising operating costs have forced him to scale back staff the number of rangers who enforce park rules , for example , has fallen to 28 from a high of 39 in 1994 moreover , mr schneider said the number of visits was only one of several criteria in determining a park budget there s no set formula , he said finances aside , the director of the national park service , robert stanton , said through his spokesman that he was concerned about the drownings and has requested a memorandum from mr laitner on the situation for his part , mr laitner said depew will not have lifeguards for the rest of the summer but he said he would assess whether depew would be a suitable site for a guarded swimming area next summer , which would be roped off to prevent people from being swept up by the strong current mr laitner said that a guarded swimming area at depew would be instituted only if divers found no dangerous objects that could snare swimmers as a practical concern , mr laitner said he could even find enough lifeguards to staff the two guarded beaches on weekdays this season and , he added , guards at depew would not make a difference over the rest of the 40 miles of river , where there are other passes with similarly varying currents that kind of thing happens all the way up and down the river , he said the chairman of the citizens advisory commission , george morville of stillwater , which plans to meet next month , said that at the special hearing last month , people were overwhelmingly opposed to limiting swimming to designated areas a sentiment he said he shared i just hope they do n't make so many rules and regulations to protect the idiots from themselves , said mr marshall , dressed in camouflage hunting cap and cutoff shorts photos the unusually high number of deaths at the delaware water gap has led officials to examine the shortage of lifeguards and financing at the ninth busiest national park \( frank c doughterty for the new york times \) map of new jersey shows location of the delaware water gap dangerous waters number of drownings in the delaware water gap national recreation area , yeartodate , 1999 raymondskill falls 1 blue mountain lake 1 depew recreation site 2 depew island 1 karamac 1 kittatinny point 1
washington the yeltsin family and its new kgb front man , vladimir putin , came up with a plan to regain popularity in the coming elections use foreign funds to build up the army and under the pretext of antiterrorism exterminate the militant chechens so far , it s working the russian generals , humiliated by the independence forces five years ago , are using new tactics that inflict civilian casualties with missiles and artillery controlled media show victories , not 200 , 000 pitiful chechen refugees or russian body bags the yeltsinputin party s popularity is soaring as hubris takes over , the invading forces are being equipped with gas masks purely defensive , of course gen stanislav petrov told interfax that the bandits are preparing to use highly toxic chemical weapons in the west , conventional wisdom says that this time the russian army will triumph the chechens are divided and impoverished their key cities are being leveled outgunned and disillusioned , facing the terror of fuelair explosives and petrov s troops in gas masks , they have supposedly lost the will to fight certainly the clinton administration has lost the will to discourage this politically inspired war of ethnic extermination the last thing i think we should be doing , says madeleine albright , is trying to turn russia back into an enemy no diplomatic consequences for indiscriminate killing no stoppage of western aid now being used to buy missiles and shells just a few handwringing clinton statements on how terrible it all is but maybe the conventional wisdom is mistaken it could be that the chechens will adapt to the new russian tactics , and instead of defending towns , wage hitandrun guerrilla war afghan allies may infiltrate muslim money may ship in weapons occupying troops may be ambushed and in time , russian casualties will be revealed irrational chechen grit has been underrated by both stalin and yeltsin if the war should drag on , the current tide of hubris would ebb a few voices in russia s press would wonder about the perpetrators of apartmenthouse bombings and other atrocities now conveniently blamed on chechen terrorists nobody knows what the next year in chechnya will bring , other than blood and hatred nor can we tell what russian candidate will be riding high in next summer s election \( a month ago , yevgeny primakov led all the polls a year before , boris nemtsov shot to the top the only consistent winner is none of the above \) but government savagery must have its consequences russia s enemy is its own militarism as thousands are murdered and hundreds of thousands flee , we cannot adopt the albright corollary to the clinton doctrine we are trying very hard to keep our eye on the ball about what is important what is important is to provide disincentives to despotism suspend us exportimport bank lending end the selfdeluding practice of continuing to allow russia not to repay the money it owes the imf make certain the money we give russia to dismantle nuclear weapons is used only for that purpose on the diplomatic front , russia s renewed bloodymindedness should impel us to admit the baltic nations to nato we should redirect our credits propping up russia over to its southern neighbors georgia and azerbaijan most tellingly , we should take up an idea being put forward by zbigniew brzezinski bring back the group of seven because we wanted to encourage russia to embrace democratic capitalism , the world s leading industrial nations invited russia in thereby becoming the group of eight this built up yeltsin s prestige but russia does not rate membership on the basis of its economy only on the basis of its potential as a civilized society by virtue of its savage attack on civilians in chechnya , the yeltsinputin regime does not deserve membership in that informal league of the advanced industrial democracies only when it stops killing innocent people for the purpose of improving poll ratings and remaining in power should that militarist regime be invited to a summit meeting of the group of seven the west cannot intervene militarily but we 're not helpless

following in the footsteps of communications giants , the omnipoint corporation , a small wireless phone carrier that operates mainly in the northeast , is expected to announce new calling plans today that eliminate longdistance and roaming charges , according to executives close to the company omnipoint , which has tried to make its service especially attractive to foreign visitors to the united states and to people who often travel overseas , also intends to offer flatrate calling at low rates to 42 other nations last year the att corporation , the nation s largest communications company , became the first wireless carrier to offer a plan with no longdistance fees and with none of the roaming fees most wireless companies charge when customers use their phone while in an area served by another company the bell atlantic corporation , which provides wireless service in the northeast and middle atlantic states , followed suit but in following the path of these much bigger companies , omnipoint is bound to raise an important question among communications experts and financial analysts how can omnipoint afford it \? when att introduced its plan , it cited its own extensive national network and said that it was willing to lose money when its customers roamed by absorbing the fees demanded when the calls required a transfer to other carriers' networks omnipoint has nowhere near the financial resources of att , and its network is limited to the northeast , southern florida and parts of michigan and indiana executives close to omnipoint , however , said the new plan would be feasible because fewer than 5 percent of the company s wireless traffic comes from roaming customers perhaps more important , they said that omnipoint had probably been able to negotiate lower roaming rates with its wireless partners than att had managed to negotiate with the companies that would pick up att s roamers but that advantage might be offset to some extent by the geographic limits of omnipoint s roaming arrangements omnipoint is one of 15 north american companies that use a wireless technology known as gsm , which is the dominant technical format in europe but has been adopted in this country mostly by smaller companies only 163 million of the roughly 270 million people in the united states live in areas reachable by gsm phones by comparison , att s wireless network and alliances provide almost universal coverage in the united states gsm s popularity in europe , however , may give omnipoint an edge in the cosmopolitan new york market among customers who might want to make calls when they travel overseas within the united states , the new omnipoint plan will require a minimum monthly commitment of 9999 for 700 anytime , anywhere minutes the company also intends to offer a rate of 29 cents a minute for calls to 18 foreign nations , mostly in europe , and a rate of 59 cents a minute for calls to 24 other countries , largely outside europe omnipoint currently charges up to 199 a minute for calls to the nations that will now come under the new international plan

jakarta , indonesia , april 26 indonesia is holding its breath ready or not , it is about to leap into the second phase of its transition from 32 years of dictatorship with an election just six weeks away that will shape the postsuharto era though the election has been planned for months , it is fraught with uncertainties , from unresolved technical questions to the possibility of violent rivalries and attempts to derail the ballot the election , scheduled for june 7 , will be the first step in a complex process of selecting a 700member body that is to choose a president in november none of the parties are expected to win a majority the leading parties will be happy to win 30 percent of the vote intense coalitionbuilding is expected after the election it will be the first democratic vote in this nation of 200 million people since the 1950 s , and the capstone to the uprising that forced president suharto from power last may but with competing interests political and religious rivalries , major economic fiefs , an unsettled military and a plethora of armed groups and with election preparations far behind schedule , many analysts are bracing for confusion , electoral disputes and violence we do n't want to see more dead victims in the process of democratization , president b j habibie said recently we all want to see a smooth , peaceful election otherwise disaster is waiting for us since mr suharto took power in 1965 , no one has ever lost a presidential election in indonesia he was always the only candidate a doordie contest with 48 parties will be a new experience with unpredictable results we are probably heading for a very chaotic election , said david timberman , an american election analyst there is far too much that needs to be done with far too little time and far too few resources one western diplomat said the diplomatic community expects serious violence in may and june , but it has very , very little idea who may be behind it or why or what the consequences might be for the election i am relatively optimistic that the election will take place and that the votes will be distributed relatively fairly i expect we 'll see a lot of violence and in the end see some kind of coalition emerge hari tchan , a political analyst with the center for strategic and international studies , said the greatest threat of instability would come from a possible victory by golkar , the political party that was formed to protect the interests of mr suharto and that still dominates the government if the forces considered to be prostatusquo win , people will just not accept that , mr tchan said there will be prolonged disturbances , prolonged tension though the country s many competing groups have for the most part swapped street demonstrations for electoral politics , the momentum still appears to be with the forces of change an outcome that does not bring a clearcut end to the suharto era will not be widely accepted , mr tchan said for the moment the capital is strikingly calm the disruptive student demonstrations and violence of four months ago have disappeared from the streets the collapse of the economy has become a way of life , with people hunkering down in more frugal and limited lives an outbreak of communal violence that has taken hundreds of lives this year in several remote areas has not , so far , spread to the capital or had a significant political impact here
who was the most popular american artist of the century \? norman rockwell , obviously the saturday evening post already had a circulation of two million readers a week when rockwell first walked through its doors in 1916 you might say that the magazine was akin to what television became in terms of general appeal , and rockwell quickly rose to be its premier draftsman , doing 322 covers during the next 47 years in addition , he illustrated advertisements for jello , crest and a slew of other popular products the new yorker in 1945 estimated that rockwell s boy scout calendars were glanced at 16 billion \( billion ! \) times each day a couple of years before he died in 1978 , at 84 , 10 , 000 people turned out for a rockwell parade in tiny stockbridge , mass , where he lived with his third wife , molly punderson , a retired schoolteacher the parade was an unheardof tribute to an american artist , but it was nothing , in sheer numbers , compared with the 200 , 000 people a year who pass through the rockwell museum in stockbridge naturally this kind of popularity guarantees contempt from the art world , which , for more than half a century , despised rockwell as a cornball sentimentalist so what do you know \? yesterday at the high museum in atlanta began a national tour of works by rockwell that ends up in 2001 at the guggenheim in manhattan let s put aside the cynical observation this is norman rockwell , after all , no cynicism allowed that a rockwell show is cunning box office , even better box office , perhaps , than a show of motorcycles or pictures with elephant dung attached to the virgin mary could it be that art professionals , or a few of them anyway , are coming around to thinking he s a good artist \? well , yes he is a good artist , on his own terms , every good artist being good on some terms or other besides microscopic verisimilitude , rockwell s terms involved squeakyclean pleasure , which , more than anything else , made sophisticated art critics and art historians cringe , because that sort of pleasure , combined with the simple sentimentality of the work , defied the fundamental credo of modernism that good art should be difficult if not \( better yet \) discomforting to the cognoscenti , the almost complete lack of any sorrow or suffering in rockwell s pictures was a clear sign that he was a lightweight one essay in the show s catalog even argues that rockwell s sanitized smalltown vision simplified unmercifully and reassured inappropriately because it belied the noisy , disorderly , crowded , smelly and dynamic realities of urban america this is the no pain , no gain philosophy of art history american art has got itself into a curious pickle at the end of the millennium an artist like rockwell , who gave millions of people pleasure , is discounted because he gave millions of people pleasure pleasure is ok only if it s clearly subordinated to instruction puritanism being embedded in the national psyche , it has led to the idea that art ought to be not just good but good for us a ridiculous presumption , if you think about it , because culture is no more inherently moral than cooking or football , except when it chooses to be rockwell s art was actually weakest when , in his later years , he tried to make himself into a more serious artist by turning out important works like the problem we all live with , of ruby bridges , a young black girl , on her way to her newly integrated school in new orleans the picture is vivid and rightminded but also didactic , and it signaled , as the critic dave hickey has put it , the end of rockwell s instinctive identification with the citizens he painted and the beginning of his tenure as a member of the nation s new , therapeutic , power elite from the beginning rockwell s art had a moral undercurrent , of course , but it was an undercurrent , the work being primarily a comic form of escapism in a sugary oldfogey mode , no more real than poussin s arcadia or the andy griffith show life as i would like it to be , rockwell once explained it helps to recall that he had a crisis of identity in the 1930 s he went to paris to look into becoming an abstract artist until he realized that it was n't for him and returned after seven months to new rochelle , ny i paint ordinary people in everyday situations , and that s about all i do , he concluded he continued to have what his son , peter , called a tortured relationship with his art , and he suffered occasional bouts of depression but he settled on what came naturally to him , in spite of the disdain of an art world he admired , a decision that was admirable on rockwell s part , not to mention a wise business move it was possible , he realized , to be serious about painting and to take pleasure in illustrations for popular magazines , something generally regarded as a contradictory position in a culture that , out of insecurity or mistaken priorities or simple snobbism , continues to divide a taste for high art from a taste for low art as if they were mutually exclusive but who says people ca n't like willem de kooning and norman rockwell \? as a matter of fact , they liked each other
newark , oct 26 when the guards came to his cell on monday night , he held out his arms for the manacles as usual but when he heard the whispered words pack up and was led out of the hudson county correctional center to the cold , empty street , hany kiareldeen realized that his long , dark odyssey through the immigration system was over mr kiareldeen , 31 , a palestinian immigrant , was released monday night after a 19month sojourn in two new jersey jails he had been detained on the basis of secret evidence alleging that he had links to terrorists , including one of the men convicted in the 1993 world trade center bombing a series of immigration court and federal court rulings had found that the evidence was unreliable and that its use was unconstitutional , and on monday the immigration and naturalization service decided to stop fighting judges' orders that mr kiareldeen be freed his release and the court rulings have for now given hope to supporters of some 20 other people of arab descent being held on secret evidence from anonymous sources that the immigration agency will finally have to scrap a practice it has used since the 50 s citing mr kiareldeen s case , advocates and legislators renewed their calls today for reforms in federal laws that allow the government to detain immigrants it is seeking to deport without detailing the evidence against them mr kiareldeen also hopes for such a big change , but today , reeling from the legal ordeal that at first seemed destined to end in his deportation , he was still trying to make sense of the personal and political drama that has left his life in tatters but his faith in justice intact i was n't worried a lot while in prison , because i was almost sure that this was how it should end up , because i was sure justice would win out , he said in an interview in newark he then turned somber when asked about the government s allegations , the evidence for which he was never allowed to see , except for sketchy summaries he and his lawyer have asserted that the charges including accusations that he threatened the life of attorney general janet reno were based on the statements of an embittered former wife who talked to the federal bureau of investigations joint terrorism task force it has damaged me a lot and it has damaged some relationships , said mr kiareldeen , who has lived in the united states since 1990 and who worked in an electronics store before he was jailed i have to reconstruct my life bittersweet was how some immigrant advocates and arabamerican groups described the release of mr kiareldeen , as they took note of the continued detention of others but i'm hoping this case will initiate the government s taking a closer look at what they use as secret evidence , and becoming a lot more judicious in light of the loss in this case at so many administrative and judicial levels , said kit gage , national coordinator of the national coalition to protect political freedom , a coalition of advocacy groups and ethnic and civil rights groups that came together to oppose the use of secret evidence and other immigration law provisions aly r abuzaakouk , the executive director of the american muslim council , while applauding the release of mr kiareldeen , said he believed it would not , on its own , force the immigration agency to rethink its use of the classified evidence to detain , deport , exclude and deny asylum to immigrants he said the only thing that would end those practices and repair the damage they had done to arabamericans and muslims would be the passage of a bill now before congress that would outlaw the use of secret evidence people in our community are aware of secret evidence , and it is having a chilling effect on their expressing themselves on issues , mr abuzaakouk said it has created an intimidating factor , and i do n't think ins will pull back on its own donald mueller , a spokesman for the the immigration service , said the agency s decision to release mr kiareldeen did not mean that it would abandon the use of secret evidence altogether he said the service had concluded , as had other units in the justice department that deal with immigration cases , that the evidence against mr kiareldeen was not credible and had been effectively rebutted by his lawyers a spokesman for senator spencer abraham , republican of michigan , said he was pursuing discussions with the justice department about administrative changes in the use of secret evidence but representative david e bonior , a michigan democrat and the prime sponsor of the secret evidence repeal act of 1999 , said the only effective solution would be to eradicate the practice hany s kiareldeen s release will be a hollow victory unless we permanently discard this law , he said today in an interview , referring to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act as well as the immigration reform act , both of 1996 mr kiareldeen said he had dreamed about being released every night during his incarceration , but he never thought it would come unheralded and almost ignominiously , near midnight i thought it would be in daylight with all my family around and with an apology from the ins , he said , still slightly dazed but he said that he was not so bitter about his experience that he would abandon his plans to

fernando leon , this numbers runner with the nickname benny tattooed on his arm , was getting madder and madder at grace meullins the woman kept bothering him for the 700 that she said he owed her daughter then she hit him over the head with a flashlight he stewed over it and he was drinking , ronald balzan , a homicide detective , remembered later everybody on the street said mr leon had a frightful temper he got a gun , which he hid in a plastic bag , and went looking for grace meullins along park avenue where it runs under the brooklynqueens expressway near the old brooklyn navy yard he ran into the daughter , christina , and got into a shouting match her brother , benjamin , showed up , so mr leon pumped two bullets into him christina ran around the corner and tried to hide behind a garbage bin he shot her three times he shot the guy right off the bat , killed him , detective balzan said she hid behind the dumpster , cowering , begging for her life but he killed her , too this was on july 20 , 1994 then mr leon got on a bus at the port authority , heading south , and disappeared and that , in the normal course of events , would have been that but the case folder , no 96 , 231 , was forwarded to the cold case squad , a threeyearold detective unit of the new york police department that chases down unsolved cases that the regular detective squads lack the time or resources to deal with while crime is down all over the city , these detectives are dealing with the residue of a more violent time the squad caught mr leon , who is now doing 45 1 2 years to life for the double murder not only that , but in reinterviewing witnesses to the crime , detective balzan uncovered evidence that suggested mr leon had stabbed another man to death in the bronx more than 17 years ago , and he is now awaiting trial on that charge through a computer network that traces financial records , detective balzan discovered that someone who might have been mr leon had been paid a few hundred dollars working at a chicken processing plant in jackson , miss it was a lucky break , because mr leon had kept a low profile , below most recordkeeping but it seemed more like the right man when the plant manager told him the man was a scary guy who drank and had a bad temper mr leon , the detective said , was totally surprised when he showed up to arrest him , and the woman he was living with was stunned his wife back in brooklyn she had given him the gun now told detective balzan about another murder up in the bronx , back when their baby boy was just standing up in his crib that would have been 1981 , so the detective sorted through old cases in the bronx until he found the murder of dr victor soto , 29 , whose attacker chased him down , stabbed him and cut his throat detective balzan was able to build a new case tying mr leon to that killing , in which the tattoo was a clue we have the luxury of time , the luxury of being able to concentrate on these cases , said capt raymond ferrari , the squad commander in a regular squad you always have a new rape , a new murder coming through the door or you can have a high profile case and have to use everybody you can make the best plans in the world and something will come through the door since the unit was formed in february 1996 , captain ferrari said , it has cleared 280 old homicide cases , 180 by making arrests on cases his detectives had built , 61 by capturing suspects who had eluded other detectives and 39 by exceptional clearance , usually meaning that the suspect was dead all told , he said , they had arrested or caught 595 suspects cases that are considered closed by the police do not always lead to convictions in court in the 1998 fiscal year , according to figures in mayor rudolph w giuliani s management report issued last september , the cold case squad selected 273 cases to investigate and cleared 122 by arrests homicides accounted for 244 of the 273 cases , and 93 of those were cleared threequarters of the homicides had occurred within the last 8 years , but 20 percent were 9 to 18 years old and one was 28 years old this year , the police department says , there is a 90 percent clearance rate for homicides but andrew karmen , a professor at john jay college of criminal justice , said that figure was artificially high because of the way the federal bureau of investigation keeps statistics when the homicides are counted for a given year , unsolved crimes from earlier years are not included in the total , mr karmen said , but old crimes that have been newly solved are thus new york s figures are improved by its unusual success in solving old murders in theory , mr karmen said , the numerator could be bigger than the denominator he estimated that the department was solving roughly 60 percent of current cases the 36 detectives on the squad all have at least 15 years on the force , and some have as much as 30 some cases are referred to them by other detective squads , who think they are promising but difficult , or from district attorneys the unit s lieutenants regularly visit other detective squads to go through the files looking for possibilities
foxboro , mass , nov 15 it seems that no matter how good new england gets , how much it dominates its division , or how many pro bowl players adorn its roster like christmas ornaments , when bill parcells comes knocking on the door , the patriots run into the basement and hide to them , parcells is the bogyman what else can explain such an inspiring performance by the jets against the patriots tonight , leading to a 2417 victory before a stunned crowd of 59 , 077 at foxboro stadium \? what else can explain drew bledsoe throwing three interceptions and being outplayed by ray lucas \? or curtis martin blistering a good run defense for 149 yards on 31 carries \? new england did mount a furious comeback , scoring two fourthquarter touchdowns and putting a serious scare into the jets but it was too late in the end parcells completely outcoached pete carroll as a result , new england , which had a chance to take the lead in the american football conference east , is fourth in the division at 63 the jets , with a twogame winning streak , are 36 i thought ray did a pretty good job moving the team , parcells said he looked pretty good out there like i told the team , even though we 're 36 , it s too soon to quit lucas , who had replaced rick mirer and was making his second national football league start , completed 18 of 31 passes for 153 yards , with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions bledsoe , meanwhile , was 15 for 36 passing for 170 yards parcells s experiment involving lucas paid off the patriots did not know how to handle his athleticism and seemed shocked how accurately he throws using a short , controlled passing game , lots of runs by martin up the gut and schemes that confused and pounded bledsoe into playing one of his worst games this year , an undermanned jets team scored 21 firsthalf points to new england s 3 the jets had averaged just 157 points a game the jets' scoring drive in the second half was typical of the way they used lucas it went a stunning 19 plays and lasted 11 minutes 23 seconds almost a full quarter lucas handed off to martin , sometimes ran the ball to the outside himself or threw to keyshawn johnson for crucial first downs the drive ended with 26yard field goal by john hall and gave the jets a 243 lead bledsoe , who had only four interceptions all season before tonight , finally led his team on a touchdown drive in the fourth quarter running back kevin faulk caught a 13yard pass to cut the jets' lead to 14 points at this point bledsoe and the patriots woke up when new england got the ball back , bledsoe threw a 31yard touchdown pass to troy brown with just under seven minutes left but bledsoe went back to his earlier form and was 1 of 9 passing in the final minutes the jets did suffer another blow when left tackle jason fabini was lost for the season with a fourthquarter knee injury many of the reasons that parcells made the switch to lucas were obvious lucas provided athleticism to counter a good new england rush parcells also likes the former rutgers star but there is an unspoken but equally powerful reason for the change not only had parcells lost confidence in mirer , but jets players apparently had as well several of them said before the game that they felt there was little chance for the offense to perform well with mirer at quarterback those are harsh words , but not necessarily inaccurate though lucas has been in the league a far shorter time than mirer has , it is lucas who has a sort of quiet cockiness parcells opened the game with an extremely conservative plan on the jets' second offensive series , martin carried the ball seven straight times on thirdand1 , lucas pitched the ball outside to martin for an 11yard gain but parcells went to the well one too many times when , on thirdand19 , martin went over left tackle for just a 5yard gain what kept new york in the game was its defense new england seemed unprepared for the jets' blitzing and coverage schemes as the defensive coordinator bill belichick threw all kinds of mindnumbing attacks at bledsoe the patriots quarterback was sacked twice in the first quarter , once by marvin jones \( it was his first sack of the season and first since 1997 \) and once by roman phifer the patriots are super bowl contenders , but they often go through dead spots in a game when they lose concentration and almost sleepwalk that is what was happening to the team early , and the jets took advantage while new england had only 2 yards passing after one quarter , the jets had 70 yards rushing , mostly on martin s back late in the first half , new england was threatening to score , but the jets held the patriots to a 22yard field goal then martin scored again on a play up the middle from 36 yards out , and the jets were up , 143 they added another score after bledsoe was intercepted and the jets converted that turnover into an 11yard touchdown from lucas to tight end fred baxter the jets had established a tone for the game they were on the road they were outgunned but none of that seemed to matter parcells was back in town , scaring his old team to death photos patriots running back terry allen getting stuffed by the jets' bryan cox , top \( reuters \) , anthony pleasant and jason wiltz on fourthandgoal in the second quarter last night \( photograph by associated press \) \( pg d1 \) jets running back curtis martin celebrating after a 36yard touchdown run in the second quarter last night \( reuters \) \( pg d3 \)

st petersburg , fla they meant well , the people who told jim calhoun to have a great time at the final four so he refrained from biting their heads off i was in a good mood for a couple of days , so i tried to continue the masquerade , calhoun recalled but i got back to normal thursday night he was polite to those wellmeaning souls who saw this little southern road trip as a just reward for all those victories this year and all the other years now he has even a shorter time to enjoy himself , whatever that is after yesterday s 6458 victory over ohio state , calhoun had roughly 48 hours to prepare for the national championship game against duke , which polished off michigan state , 6862 , and he said it did not matter game films are game films long nights are long nights the euphoria in connecticut was partly because of having escaped gonzaga last saturday in the regional final in phoenix nothing against the appealing mighty zags from washington state , but a regional loss to gonzaga would have been the worst thing that ever happened to calhoun that crisis was averted , and never again would anybody question the coaching wisdom of jim calhoun , at least until 5 42 pm yesterday that is to say , tipoff time we 're excited , we are happy to be here , calhoun proclaimed on friday since we left phoenix , there has been a lot of exuberance , a lot of joy , a lot of happiness , and a lot of tapewatching connecticut boosters were in alien territory they have been buying season tickets for decades , have suffered depressing wednesday losses in the big east tournament , and then suffered equally depressing firstround losses in the vagabond national invitation tournament in some empty gym in new england now some fans from connecticut wanted to know how to pass the time at the final four why not go to practice on friday \? somebody suggested in midweek they let you go to practice \? rookies what are you going to do \? duke fans , with their congenital sense of entitlement , know precisely when to strut into the final four practice , last weekend in march , just about every year connecticut was the new kid on the block , making its first appearance in the final four duke , on the other hand , has been here eight times in the past 14 seasons the connecticut fans the longsuffering connecticut fans , i might add could officially afford to just be happy to be here jim calhoun could not the kids are getting ready for this moment , calhoun added they have the chance to do something special he still thinks of himself as a bootstrapper will tomorrow s game now be the biggest of his career \? getting northeastern to the ncaa s in 1981 was the biggest game of my career , calhoun replied he smiled when people told him to have fun , but he said last night , i'm irish , i'm stubborn , i have a good time , but sometime , around thursday night , i returned to character if he had been having a good time , he might not have been able to work it through in his mind not to doubleteam zippy little scoonie penn , but rather to let his best defensive player , ricky moore , try it by himself moore held penn to 11 points calhoun reminded the players to think about business , but they were not about to get giddy on him the huskies have two cocaptains , moore and rashamel jones , who used to be scorers on this team , until the talent overtook them they still run this team , with not much room for springbreak mode this is the first time the school has been to the final four , said jones , with respectful emphasis on the word school then he added if we 're just happy to be here , people will say we did n't achieve we still have not fulfilled our goals connecticut was new to the final four duke , on the other hand , had inexplicably missed four straight final fours , which did not take away from its hauteur , you understand coach mike krzyzewski was asked on friday if he had any friendly collegial advice to give to his three fellow coaches , none of whom had ever been to the final four as a participant i 've never had the advantage of good looks or intelligence , coach k said so if i have an advantage of experience , i wo n't talk about it by his refusal to discuss it , coach k was suggesting that there is indeed some triedandtrue way to approach the final four or maybe he was just messing with our minds khalid elamin , the personification of selfconfidence , did not need advice he admitted he had heard all the praise about ohio state s backcourt , and he said , our pride was threatened but now , he added , i have the opportunity to play in a championship game , and i want to make the most of it calhoun applauded this approach there s always time for fun , like playing golf this summer , he said i 'll miss a 3footer , he predicted , and i 'll be thinking about this his nice little interlude is over connecticut is finding out about heightened expectations in the last game of a landmark season
to the editor i will wait for the metropolitan transportation authority s decision on a sleepfriendly car on long island rail road trains , but i am not hopeful \( news article , sept 15 \) i made a similar suggestion to metronorth a couple years ago i called the idea a quiet car , with reduced lighting and no talking these cars would be available for the ride home only , because in the morning , when people are struggling to get into the train , it would be difficult to find the cars i even suggested that only parts of the car be designated quiet , perhaps one of the small sections between the doors and the end of the car however , i was politely told that the none of this was feasible matthew cohen fairfield , conn , sept 15 , 1999 drawing \( laurent cilluffo \)
annandaleonhudson , ny , aug 15 festivals that are built around single composers usually take a predictably smooth road the composer , almost invariably , is one whose music is widely loved , and however deeply a festival may delve into historical and biographical matters or rarely heard works , its essential function is to celebrate the communion between the composer and an admiring audience there s nothing wrong with that , of course entirely apart from the fact that it is commercially sensible for those who present such events , it can also have the useful effect , when properly done , of getting listeners to think about why they love the composers they love the bard festival here , now in its 10th year , has taken that approach in its festivals devoted to brahms , strauss , dvorak and tchaikovsky with others , like haydn and schumann , it has sought to transform respect , curiosity and cautious familiarity into a real passion for those composers and their works the festival took a greater chance with ives and bartok , although both composers have slipped into the repertory , and their works now meet little resistance but this year , to celebrate the festival s 10th anniversary , bard is turning its spotlight on arnold schoenberg it is a bold move , given schoenberg s position as a devil figure for many music lovers , who blame him for everything they hate about 20thcentury music mainly , those listeners have two complaints one is that schoenberg s rejection of tonality , with its comfortable hierarchical relationships , has meant the replacing of melodic and harmonic beauty with cragginess and dissonance the other is that they find the music incoherent , or at least disorienting , not only because of its atonality but also because schoenberg s vaunted dislike of repetition and his abandonment \( for the most part \) of oldfashioned structural forms removed a few more of music s familiar signposts that music governed by such supreme orderliness as schoenberg s should be perceived as incoherent is a paradox , one of many surrounding schoenberg paradoxes make for lively discussions , of course , and if there was ever a composer whose career seemed made for the kind of expansive exploration the bard festival presents , schoenberg is the one directed by leon botstein , the president of bard and a conductor , and robert martin , the associate dean of bard and a cellist , the festival covers two summer weekends \( next week is the second \) , with a third at lincoln center in the fall during the two weeks at bard there are 10 concerts , each with a preconcert lecture most of the concerts keep the promise of the festival s title , schoenberg and his world , by juxtaposing schoenberg s works with those of his contemporaries the first weekend ended with a concert that had no schoenberg at all , but was made of works performed at the society for private musical performance , the newmusic series he organized and ran in vienna between 1918 and 1921 besides the performances , there are daily panel discussions covering everything from philosophies of modern music to schoenberg s painting career and the ramifications of his selfidentification as a german , a jew and a cosmopolitan there is an amusing video interview with the violinist felix galimir , who know schoenberg and his circle as in past years , a book of essays and documents , schoenberg and his world \( edited by walter frisch and published by the princeton university press \) , was available even if the performances were not as polished and deeply felt as they were , the festival would still have to be regarded as an estimable contribution both to schoenberg scholarship and to the dialogue between schoenberg s proponents and listeners who still harbor doubts interestingly , a lot of those listeners attended the chamber music concerts at the modern , comfortable olin auditorium and a performance of gurrelieder in an outdoor festival tent were either sold out or close , with audience members ranging from teenagers to octogenarians the panel discussions , with musicologists , historians and composers \( among them david del tredici , who abandoned atonality in the 1970 s , and betsy jolas , simon bainbridge and richard wilson , none of them really schoenberg disciples \) , were so crowded that extra rows of seats had to be added along the sides and back of the hall at one , an older man volunteered that he had never listened to schoenberg before but had been won over by what he heard before the gurrelieder concert , i met a dutch tourist who , driving to buffalo from manhattan , saw a poster for the concert and decided to buy a ticket to a great degree , the festival sought to further an argument that schoenberg made himself , to the effect that his music was not revolutionary but a logical extension of the western tradition , and that his own output should be seen as having evolved gradually , rather than having suddenly leaped from the lushness of gurrelieder to the thickets of the 12tone works and to an extent it succeeded the opening concert , on friday , was a selective , chronologically ordered snapshot of schoenberg s chamber and vocal works , from 1896 to 1936
the letters arrive every couple of days , written in loopy script on lined yellow paper , postmarked from the federal penitentiary in florence , colo how you doing , friend \? one begins hi , larry , man , says another the rambling communications are signed , always , luis , and often include tortured artwork of old men in chains and clocks that long ago stopped ticking larry is lawrence k feitell , attorneyatlaw , who answers these letters from his cramped office on lower broadway luis felipe is his client , a murderous gang leader serving a life term in solitary confinement , with the unusual sentencing restriction that he communicate with no one but mr feitell mr feitell , appointed by the court to represent indigent federal defendants , types his replies on embossed letterhead they are crisp messages , never longer than a page , and mainly about legal developments , most recently a ruling that mr felipe can exchange a few words each day with two notorious fellow prisoners , theodore j kaczynski and timothy j mcveigh but mr feitell s letters also include entertaining footnotes about the latest yankee trade , or sketch pads and drawing pencils i would find it difficult and distasteful , he said in an interview , to write a 100 percent business letter with no soft touch , no feeling of compassion mr feitell finds himself in the most unlikely of intimate relationships , unique in his 45year career , with a man he delicately calls a strange bedfellow the 69yearold lawyer has a white mane that he slicks into perfect waves , a passion for 20thcentury american history and a penchant for soaring oratory the 36yearold killer has tattoos from head to toe , is a cubanborn street tough and has uttered barely a word since his 1997 sentencing it was that sentence , by judge john s martin jr in federal district court in manhattan , that forced this odd coupling he has to have someone and i am that someone , mr feitell said of his client , convicted of masterminding three murders from behind bars his every thought has to be expressed to me i handle his requests i take care of his needs i am a link , not even to another world , because there is no other world mr feitell , who is paid 75 an hour for his work as a panel lawyer , vacillates between decency and defensiveness in explaining his interaction with a man who will never again see the sky , except through the mesh ceiling of an exercise cage am i to have no interchange with him \? he asked , bristling at criticism where none was intended that s not me i'm writing to a human being do n't mistake this for a fast and hot friendship i do n't tell him what broadway shows i see or where i recreate in the summer mr feitell worries that his relationship with mr felipe will offend his private clients , be they criminal receivers of stolen merchandise , drunken drivers or money launderers i do n't want to be reviled by people who want to know how i could sympathize with such a killer , he said he explains it in different ways at different moments in a long conversation it is a heritage of his eastern european immigrant parents and their sense of charity it is a lawyer s job to build a relationship of trust with a client it is mr felipe s constitutional right to be represented and mr feitell s duty to do so i put my blinders on , mr feitell said , unconvincingly i am not going to become morally outraged that is not my job his jobs have been varied like a bronco ride since graduation from columbia law school in 1953 first there was military service , in the same basic training unit as g david schine , whose absences from fort dix on behalf of senator joseph r mccarthy subjected everyone in the company to interrogation by army investigators then he spent a year teaching at columbia , was rebuffed by a whiteshoe law firm because he was jewish and landed as an assistant district attorney in manhattan under the legendary frank s hogan next came a tour of duty as law secretary to an appellate court judge , doing legal research and writing , then a partnership with lawrence h bernstein until his appointment to the bench by mayor john v lindsay from there , mr feitell forged another partnership with maurice edelbaum , a noted criminal defense lawyer who had participated in the lindbergh kidnapping trial with mr edelbaum , mr feitell helped defend carmine g desapio , the tammany hall leader , in a bribery case that sent mr desapio and one of mayor lindsay s commissioners to prison mr feitell has been on his own since 1971 , working in an overheated , underdecorated cubbyhole and answering his own phone most of the calls come from jail or from prosecutors who cannot believe that mr feitell s clients , including luis felipe , are unwilling to plead guilty mr felipe is also unwilling to accept judge martin s offer of an hour of conversation each day with the unabomber and the oklahoma city bomber , a rejection that discourages mr feitell he is not cerebrating normally , the lawyer said he has been in isolation for so long it s pushed him into nevernever land but , a life sentence plus 45 years is plenty of time for mr felipe to change his mind my hope is that as the years go by , i can bring him back to a more benign social context in the jail , mr feitell said i would consider that a victory photo lawrence k feitell is the only person luis felipe is allowed to contact \( librado romero the new york times \)
at this time last year it seemed as if the global economy was hanging by a thread russia was defaulting on its debt , the first emerging market to do so since the asian crisis had begun the world s largest hedge fund , longterm capital management , was hemorrhaging badly and would soon require a 35 billion bailout and the federal reserve was preparing to lower interest rates to keep the world financial system from imploding what a difference a year makes or does it \? yes , the american economy is still booming , europe is gaining some steam , and even several emerging markets like south korea and mexico seem to be on the mend it would be easy to conclude that what president clinton , in a speech last fall , called the worst financial crisis in 50 years was vastly overblown it s a short jump from that to believing that whatever big problems existed have been more or less fixed but this line of reasoning would be seriously flawed the fact is that although millions of people in emerging markets have suffered horribly losing their jobs , going bankrupt , sinking into poverty the crisis was n't long enough or deep enough to result in the kinds of corrective measures that would result in a less risky global economy indeed , little of a fundamental nature has changed , and in some respects the environment is more fragile today let s review why this august looks so much better than a year ago the fed s exquisitely timed interest rate reductions last summer and fall were , collectively , the turning point in the crisis but we had a lot of luck , too the asian crisis hit when our economy was in exceptionally good shape , breaking records for price stability and job creation in the midst of a long consumerled boom that was simply too powerful to derail and wall street trusted alan greenspan , robert rubin and lawrence summers , mr rubin s deputy and eventual successor as treasury secretary we were also lucky that foreign money returned to asia with lightning speed this was in marked contrast to the 10 years it took for bankers to resume lending to latin america during the debt crisis of the 1980 s finally , the international monetary fund played a role with its austerity packages , but in reality , soon after most emerging nations agreed to belttightening , they started to return to their old freespending ways none of these developments were accompanied by fundamental reforms the cries for a new financial architecture were forgotten even before there was any echo crony capitalism in emerging nations is alive and well while leaders of these countries understand the need for sound banking regulation the lack of which was a cause of the crisis it will take many years to reach western standards the same goes for bankruptcy laws and other necessary foundations for modern capitalism there have been no big changes on the global level , either , and last year s debates have lost their intensity should shortterm speculations by foreign investors in emerging markets be controlled \? should private lenders be obligated to help bail out the countries to which they lent too much \? last winter , i interviewed 20 top officials on wall street and in washington to get their views on what caused the financial debacle and how to deal with it they did n't agree on much , except on one point we are in for a series of financial crises over the next several years why \? the global system is no stronger than its weakest links and there are plenty of them , from japan , with its skyhigh debts , to the tensionridden emerging countries that are trying to move from closed to open societies the executives pointed to widening regulatory gaps as the movement of money outpaced governments' ability to supervise the system no one i interviewed would even dare guess when and how the next crisis will arise but the most worrisome set of circumstances relates to the united states , which for the last few years has been singlehandedly supporting the world economy perhaps recent tremors in many public internetrelated companies 40 percent of which were trading below their initial offering price earlier this month are telling us something about the sustainability of our soaring market or , could it be that the recent downward pressure on the dollar stemming from our soaring trade deficits , or the fact that american investors are moving big money to europe and elsewhere is a sign that something is amiss \? there is also the bond market , where prices have been dropping and rates moving up most important , a weak dollar and a tightening labor market may cause the fed to increase interest rates for a second time this summer when it meets on tuesday , or perhaps at its next meeting this fall if this trend continues , it could spook the market rather than steady it , and stifle consumer confidence a receding tide could expose many problems that have been camouflaged by our sustained growth , like enormous consumer debt or the continued growth of risky , unregulated hedge funds there are also some glaring weak spots abroad for the past few years china helpfully kept its currency steady , becoming a big island of stability among emerging markets but now it is flirting with devaluation , a move that could jeopardize the fragile recoveries of its neighbors by undercutting the prices of their exports argentina , until recently a pillar of strength in south america , is projecting negative growth of 35 percent this year these are not huge economies but remember that the last crisis began in thailand the point is not to add up everything that could go wrong , but to recognize that globalization implies that everyone and everything is more closely connected than ever before , but on a foundation that is still shaky of course , like last year at this time , our luck may hold but it s like playing russian roulette with some additional bullets loaded in the chamber drawing \( brian cronin \)
my horse , named jorp , was a goodnatured , shaggymaned icelandic mare who liked to trot beside a friend from the stable , a gelding named glofaxi on a dirt road bordering a forest in vermont , jorp stayed toward the head of the pack , but clearly wanted to keep glofaxi a little in front as collected as tin soldiers , we were moving at an exhilarating flying pace , which is an amazingly smooth running gait characteristic of icelandic horses , a rare breed on these shores icelandic horses are renowned for their steadiness and good temperament jorp seemed to be feeling no strain at our comfortable gait , and i decided to test her mettle i got a green light from glofaxi s rider , cheryl eppel , who , with a slight movement on her reins , shifted glofaxi down a gear to what is called a tolt , a fast walk that is another specialty of the icelandic breed go for it ! she told me , dropping back on glofaxi freed from the protocols of stable hierarchy , jorp enthusiastically took the squeeze of my leg and flattened out into a fast canter hooves thumping like a bongo marching band , we flew up to the top of the hill and stopped there within a minute or so the other riders in our group of eight had caught up and were regrouping to continue on down the hill at a walk jorp was n't winded or sweaty in fact , she had taken the opportunity to go to sleep as we set off again , jorp snapped out of her nap without missing a stride this was during the second day of a weekendlong ride that my wife , nancy , and i recently took on icelandic horses along the cool forest trails and flowering hills of the green mountains in the sleepy mad river valley , not far from sugarbush , the northcentral vermont ski resort the daylong treks left each morning from the vermont icelandic horse farm , a modern ranch in waitsfield that occupies the crest of a gently rolling meadow where its prized herd of more than 30 icelandic horses are turned out to graze and romp when they are n't working under the saddle the stable s owner is karen winhold , 34 , one of a handful of united states horse breeders who are working to introduce americans to the icelandic she runs a steady schedule of weeklong , weekend and daily one and twohour rides year round from her stable she and her assistants have good eyes both for matching riders to horses and for making sure that groups on extended rides are n't held back by inexperienced riders unable to handle the faster gaits each day in rides interrupted by lunch back at the ranch , we covered about 20 miles of forest trails and hills that sometimes opened into breathtaking vistas in which armloads of rounded mountain peaks appeared to be piled like pillows against the horizon already , scattered bursts of color were showing in the trees , a harbinger of the early fallfoliage season expected throughout the northeast this year because of the dry summer weather on horseback , even on a one or twohour ride , is considered by enthusiasts to be one of the best ways to experience the fall spectacular the scenery was magnificent , and the ride was well organized , but the horses were the real trip although nancy and i are experienced , frequent riders who plan holidays and vacations to schedule at least some time on horseback , we had never heard of , let alone ridden , icelandics before i chanced upon the vermont icelandic horse farm s web site \( www icelandichorses com \) while browsing for information on horse treks in vermont do you believe these guys \? nancy said of the horses , laughing as she trotted up to join us on her gelding , pjakkur \( pj for short \) , whom she had been keeping to the middle of the pack in order to gauge his pacing it s like riding a couch , declared ms eppel , a psychotherapist from watertown , mass besides my wife and me , our party included a mother and preteenage daughter from massachusetts a couple from connecticut \( she was a regular rider , he had n't ridden since he was thrown by a horse many years ago \) an older woman who travels the world on horse treks two middleaged women from new jersey who own horses a couple from wisconsin , and the eppel sisters , cheryl and lynne , who now live 1 , 000 miles apart in massachusetts and colorado they had come to vermont to celebrate lynne s birthday by reclaiming a part of their teenage years , when they rode horses together on hunts and rambles through new jersey horse country like the rest of us , ms winhold loved the icelandics at first sight when i bought the place seven years ago , there were three icelandics in the stable , she said , running her hands through the dolly partonlike blond mane of the bay she was on the rest were standardbred horses now , all her horses are icelandics , which she also breeds and sells they 're magnificent herding animals , which means they 're good with each other in a pack like this , said ms winhold , who wo n't saddle a young horse until it has been socialized in the herd on her ranch for about four years ms winhold is a careful and observant trailride leader , but not a hyperanxious one she likes to see responsible experienced riders have fun clearly enjoying herself as much as we were , she rode just in front as three or four of us played at jockeying for position while pacing up a steep , open stretch of deserted road like the riders , the horses seemed to like the jockeying for the lark that it was

no particular reason comes to mind , but on film and video there is a resurgent call for the french peasant girl with , in the words of one critic in 1929 , a face supernaturally illumined by faith , with lips parched through excitement and with a pair of eyes that see heaven opening before them the uplifted visage belonged to maria \( sometimes called renee \) falconetti , most famously and perhaps exclusively known for her performance as joan of arc in carl theodor dreyer s silent classic the passion of saint joan released in 1928 , the film is by far the most interesting of three titles about the maid of orleans to be seen this fall accompanied by richard einhorn s oratorio , voices of light , composed mostly in the 1990 s and performed by the netherlands radio choir and philharmonic , the passion is to be released on tape tuesday by home vision and on a fine dvd from the criterion collection on nov 9 for a more standard account , from flaming battlements to palace machinations , there is luc besson s large and long the messenger the story of joan of arc , which will open on nov 12 of similar intent , christian duguay s fourhour miniseries joan of arc , shown on cbs in may and recently released on tape and dvd by artisan , tracks the story from her birth in 1412 to her trial for heresy and burning at the stake in 1431 but for brilliance , there is the passion , among the greatest films ever a dane and a director of singular outlook and ferocious intensity , dreyer \( vampyr , ordet , gertrud \) skipped the battlefield heroics and went straight to the spiritual struggle at the trial one ca n't picture her as a war leader , he said of joan , an encapsulation of history that annoyed the french in any event , what is habitually described as a simple story takes place during a complex period that is explored only sketchily by the besson and duguay films and , despite its ingenuity , hardly at all by the passion obsessed with visions , joan spent her 19 years embroiled in the hundred years war with the english , who controlled much of france in alliance with the burgundians about age 13 , she began to hear voices from god , or so she said , who charged her with a divine mission to unite the country under charles vii the people rallied around her as did the troops at orleans she won a great victory , but soon thereafter she overstepped herself an invasion of paris failed and at compiegne she was captured by the burgundians , sold to the english and put on trial at rouen in the besson and duguay films , the two joans \( milla jovovich and the 16yearold leelee sobieski , respectively \) brim with purpose , but one is ever mindful that here we have two finelooking young women dreyer s joan would stare at them as she stares at everybody , in pain and dumbfounded amazement here is a farm woman whose face , and face alone , carries a film that , in dreyer s words , is a hymn to the triumph of the soul over life here also is where two costume adventures part company with an acknowledged masterpiece of focused , stylized vision in some respects the passion enjoys a certain kinship with the story it relates apparently lost in not one but two fires shortly after it was made , dreyer s original survived in a print that was found in a closet at a norwegian mental hospital in 1981 restored in 1985 , it stands as a paragon of silent film technique at joan s trial , her accusers are the most powerful roman catholic theologians the goal is to discredit her and weaken charles , but at the bottom of the matter lies their extreme fear of a heroine of the people who insists that she interacts directly with god without the need of the church as intermediary an interrogator reminds her that no one can be saved without the church she is asked , are you in a state of grace \? she replies if i am , may god keep me there if i am not , may god grant it to me it s a clever answer , which confounds the interrogators the passion relates the personal contest joan s distraught consternation and resolve against her judges' sarcasm and anger with faces caught in fastmoving closeups dreyer described the interplay as closequarter combat while the videotape is of good quality , the best way to get into the drama is on dvd , which projects the blackandwhite images with particular sharpness at any second one can stop the action for a longer look at the adversaries , who almost come alive all of these faces are shown to us so many times , one ca n't help getting tired of them in the end , one critic wrote hardly , especially falconetti s the disk has a fulllength commentary by the dreyer scholar casper tybjerg , who explains that the script is drawn from the latin text of the trial dreyer called the film a documentary and employed a great deal of camera movement he also liked lowangle shots and trenches were dug for camera positions restricted to the courtroom and joan s cell , the action goes outside only once , to the stake nevertheless , the director insisted that a full castle be constructed to the displeasure of his backers , it is never shown in its entirety music was often played on the sets of silent movies , but dreyer allowed none , nor did he want musical accompaniment to the finished film on videotape , the passion is shown with mr einhorn s voices of light , and on the disk one can watch with or without it the composer stresses that his oratorio , with a text drawn primarily from ancient writings by medieval female mystics \( including joan \) , is not intended to accompany the film rather , it is a piece for soloists , chorus and orchestra that stands separately from the movie and has been performed either with or without it since its completion in 1994 it s not a silent movie with music , but a movie that includes music , he said in his notes he writes that he recorded the church bell at domremy , joan s birthplace , because she often stopped in midmarch to listen to bells , and he thought she would be pleased dreyer , who died in 1968 , may or may not have liked that notion , though he certainly sought authenticity his film was shot from may to november 1927 , a period that corresponds in length to the trial itself artificial light was the only concession to reality actors went without makeup , their naked faces , mr tybjerg says in his commentary , standing out in pitiless detail an actor from the comedie francaise , falconetti never made another film the story was that her experience with dreyer ruined her for the medium , but it is probable that she simply preferred live performance dreyer drove her hard , meeting alone with her before every scene toward the end , her head is shaved , as was joan s all the actors cried falconetti broke down , and dreyer had to wait till she recovered a certifiable lunatic , one actor called him photos maria falconetti , left , as joan in dreyer s 1928 film above , milla jovovich as joan in luc besson s messenger , which opens next month \( home vision jack english columbia pictures \( insert \) \)
in what seems to be baseball s nightly milestone , tony gwynn of the san diego padres took his long expected place among the game s great hitters last night , stroking the 3 , 000th hit of his career at olympic stadium in montreal he was the 22d player to reach the 3 , 000 plateau and the first to do it outside the united states gwynn s firstinning line single against dan smith , the expos' rookie righthander , ended what little suspense was left after he hit no 2 , 999 on thursday night in st louis to get it my first time up was huge , gwynn said for me it s a great day hit no 2 , 999 came in the same game in which mark mcgwire became the 16th player to hit 500 home runs never before had two hitters attained the 500 home run and 3 , 000 hit milestones in such proximity in 1970 , ernie banks slugged his 500th home run on may 12 , and five days later hank aaron collected his 3 , 000th hit two months after that willie mays joined aaron and , at the time , eight other players in the 3 , 000 circle i just want to get it done , gwynn had said in st louis after thursday night s game i just want to get a hit it s down to one little hit one hit chinker , blooper , line drive , just one hit but gwynn went well beyond the hit he wanted he collected four hits in the padres' 1210 victory and left the game in the eighth inning with a career total of 3 , 003 when you talk about 3 , 000 hits , you talk about passion and a love for the game , said gwynn , who got his 2 , 000th hit exactly six years ago to the date in 1993 i love playing the game waiting to join gwynn was wade boggs , but he did not get any of the three hits he needed in tampa bay s 42 victory over cleveland , failing in four times at bat the careers of gwynn and boggs have paralleled each other both first played in the major leagues in 1982 , and both have won multiple batting championships , eight in the national league for gwynn , five in the american league for boggs gwynn , whose physique belies his talent as a hitter , would have made it to 3 , 000 much earlier this season , but an ailing left calf sent him to the disabled list twice nevertheless , he needed the thirdfewest games among the 22 players to reach 3 , 000 this was his 2 , 284th game , trailing only ty cobb with 2 , 135 and nap lajoie with 2 , 224 gwynn , 39 , is the first national league player to get to 3 , 000 in 20 years , since lou brock in august 1979 seven american leaguers have joined the group since then paul molitor , who was the last , did it in 1996 with minnesota if you want to do it in the national league , you have to play a position , gwynn said it s been 20 years since anybody has been able to do it that tells you how tough it is to do it in this league a smooth lefthand hitter , gwynn is also the 11th player to collect all 3 , 000 hits with one team george brett of kansas city and robin yount of milwaukee , who reached that total three weeks apart in 1992 , were the last to achieve the milestone with one team the padres' right fielder had hoped to end his pursuit of the magic number in st louis , but he failed to get a hit in his first three plate appearances thursday night then in his last atbat , in the ninth inning , he lined a double along the rightfield line for no 2 , 999 , and last night he remained on a roll after he sent a soft liner past second base on smith s 12 pitch in his first time at bat , gwynn singled up the middle in his second atbat , nudging ahead of roberto clemente of pittsburgh , whose final hit of the 1972 season , a double against the mets' jon matlack , was the 3 , 000th and last hit of his career clemente was killed in a plane crash the following dec 31 as he was en route from puerto rico to nicaragua with food and supplies for earthquake victims gwynn singled in the sixth inning and again in the eighth for his 3 , 003d hit before being replaced by a pinchrunner gwynn s next target as he climbs the list is al kaline of detroit at 3 , 007 then comes brock at 3 , 023 unlike the crowd at soldout busch stadium in st louis on thursday night , 13 , 540 fans were in the stands at olympic stadium for gwynn s feat the size of the crowd was not surprising because the expos have the tiniest attendance in the major leagues but the fans who were there stood and clapped throughout gwynn s firstinning atbat and saluted him when he got the hit with a loud and lengthy ovation even louder were the fireworks , in place for expos home runs , that were set off instantly every time i came to the plate they were pulling for me , gwynn said of the montreal fans they were great his teammates mobbed him , and even the first base umpire , kerwin danley , got caught up in the emotion and excitement of the moment , hugging gwynn , who was his teammate at san diego state university then gwynn s mother , vendella came onto the field and embraced him that gwynn waited until this night to get no 3 , 000 was in one way fitting it was a special present for his mother , who was celebrating her 64th birthday six years ago on her birthday , gwynn rapped no 2 , 000 mrs gwynn was on hand along with gwynn s wife , alicia , and their daughter , anisha she s gone from one end of the country to the end of another country to see this and it means a lot having her here , gwynn said of his mother i thought 2 , 000 was a pretty good one , but for a contact hitter this is the ultimate although none of the previous 21 players got his 3 , 000th in montreal , pete rose , when he was playing for the expos , stroked no 4 , 000 in the canadian city

hong kong , may 25 softening its tone toward foreign lenders , china announced a plan today to overhaul a debtridden state company , with the banks and the government sharing the losses the company , guangdong enterprises , is staggering under 56 billion in debt and other liabilities it stopped making loan payments in january , after its owner , guangdong province s government , announced that it would overhaul operations with the help of goldman , sachs china s handling of guangdong enterprises is in stark contrast to its treatment of another troubled state company , guangdong international trust and investment , known as gitic when gitic capsized under 43 billion in debt last october , beijing forced it into bankruptcy and told banks that they would lose most of their loans as the nextmostprominent corporate casualty , guangdong enterprises has been scrutinized by foreign banks as a test of how unforgiving the government will be in cleaning up troubled state businesses if this one went badly , it would have spelled trouble for creditors generally in china , said gordon g chang , a bankruptcy lawyer in the beijing office of paul , weiss , rifkind , wharton garrison today , officials of goldman , sachs and of guangdong outlined a plan for guangdong enterprises it would recapitalize the company s main hong kong subsidiary by selling the subsidiary a profitable water business the plan would also swap equity for a portion of the parent company s debt and would carve out 238 million of bad loans and place them in an asset management company in what amounts to a grand exercise in financial triage , the chinese government would revive the healthiest parts of guangdong enterprises while asking the banks to accept losses on the hopelessly sick parts there should be a mutual sharing of loss , said wang qishan , the executive vice governor of guangdong province , at a news conference after he presented the plan to several hundred creditors in hong kong while guangdong enterprises' creditors said in a statement that the plan was not satisfactory on initial inspection , their relief seemed palpable it s definitely an ok place to start negotiating , said ted osborn , a partner at pricewaterhousecoopers , which is advising the creditors the guangdong government did n't have to give anything these companies are bankrupt mr osborn said the creditors would certainly negotiate on the finer points of the proposal , such as how to value the debtforequity swaps and the water plant that the guangdong government would contribute to guangdong enterprises' publicly listed hong kong flagship , guangdong investments ltd but he added the guangdong government has put down its marker now at least the banks know where they stand goldman , sachs , which has labored since january to make sense of guangdong enterprises' tangled finances , said that if the new stock issued to the creditors performed well , some of them could wind up with no losses over the long term there is no forced loss for any of the creditors none , said steven m shafran , a goldman managing director in hong kong mr shafran was particularly enthusiastic about china s contribution of the dongshen water supply company , which supplies 75 percent of hong kong s water and which he said was worth more than 2 billion still , creditors are skeptical about guangdong enterprises , given that many of its assets are in sad shape and some former executives are suspected of corruption one executive who advises the creditors estimated that the plan would result in 20 percent to 40 percent losses to the banks on their loans in the case of gitic , the banks are likely to recover less than 20 percent of their loans mr wang said that if the government had chosen to liquidate guangdong enterprises , its banks would have received a similarly paltry return as with gitic , guangdong enterprises' creditors are a who s who of global institutions , including sumitomo bank , citigroup and deutsche bank chinese , japanese and french banks have greater exposure than american banks although gitic and guangdong enterprises bear similarities , there are crucial differences gitic is an investment trust company , while guangdong enterprises is a stateowned enterprise whose main subsidiary is a red chip company listed on the hong kong stock exchange the chinese prime minister , zhu rongji , has expressed his distaste for investment trusts , which he contends are outmoded vehicles to raise capital red chips , on the other hand , remain china s most dependable way to tap global capital markets mr wang said he took special care with guangdong enterprises because he did not want to throw hong kong s redchip market into turmoil shares in hong kong eased today , as investors waited for the guangdong enterprises proposal to be announced , after having risen monday as initial details of the plan leaked out regardless of the province , mr wang said , we feel we should make a contribution to the stability of hong kong mr wang , who was appointed last year by prime minister zhu to rein in the freewheeling financial practices in guangdong province , gave a freewheeling performance of his own today by turns playful and scolding , he reiterated mr zhu s campaign to reform china s economy and banks and he switched seamlessly between freemarket evangelist and dutiful party functionary asked whether china would suffer more corporate failures , mr wang said , the fundamental principle of a market economy is that the winners win and the losers lose photo

trenton , may 18 as the governors of new jersey and connecticut prepared court challenges to the elimination of new york city s commuter tax for new york state residents , one suburban lawmaker today suggested retaliatory action on several new battle fronts , including the ticket booths of broadway and yankee stadium if new york goes to such extremes as implementing a discriminatory commuter tax , said assemblyman raul garcia of union city , nj , then new jerseyans should go to similar extremes in sending a payback message the yankees and the mets , forget about it , mr garcia said send your regards to old broadway , literally watch leno instead of letterman skip 'nypd blue' and tune into 'the sopranos , ' he said , referring to the hit hbo series filmed in new jersey but as the crosshudson rhetoric flew over the bill , which would leave outofstate commuters subject to the 045 percent annual income tax , new york city officials characterized the proposed boycott as a misdirected expression of anger that should be aimed at albany the city has fought bitterly against the tax cut because it would lose 210 million a year in tax revenues from state residents and possibly a total of 360 million if outofstate commuters are included in fact , mayor rudolph w giuliani said today that he would support , and might even join , outofstate commuters' legal challenges to the policy on the ground that it discriminates against nonresidents and may unconstitutionally restrict interstate commerce it is unclear whether new jersey or connecticut can actually file suits on their own , because technically they are not aggrieved parties gov christine todd whitman of new jersey and gov john g rowland of connecticut sent a joint letter to gov george e pataki today , urging him to veto the bill and replace it with legislation that would end commuter taxes for all those who travel to the city to work , including an estimated 280 , 000 who live in new jersey and 86 , 000 who commute from connecticut if mr pataki follows through with his plans to sign the bill , the governors vowed , they will pay the legal fees if commuters file a class action suit to challenge the legislation because this measure is uneven and discriminatory in its treatment of new jersey and connecticut residents , it is clearly unconstitutional , the governors wrote either every nonresident who works in new york city should be subject to the commuter tax or none of them should both the constitution and fairness demand nothing less since 1966 , new york city has charged commuters an income tax to help defray the costs of infrastructure and essential services like police and fire protection the move to exempt only new york state residents from the tax was engineered by the new york senate majority leader , joseph l bruno , to woo suburban voters the bill put the mayor in the unusual position of siding with his frequent adversary , governor whitman , with whom he has sparred over issues as diverse as garbage carting , airport renovation policies , ellis island and , yes , the new york yankees the mayor , who plans to file his own court challenge to the bill , said he thought connecticut and new jersey residents had a strong case my recollection of constitutional law tells me they have a pretty good lawsuit , mr giuliani said photo new jersey officials say that commuters to manhattan , like these people waiting in the hoboken path station , should not have to pay the city s commuter tax if it is eliminated for new york s suburbanites \( angel franco the new york times \)

hershiser had a second act with the los angeles dodgers after dr frank jobe performed the operation , a third with the cleveland indians , a fourth with the san francisco giants and now a fifth with the mets rarely does a starter come back on even three days' rest anymore and only once in a moreoftenthannot superb 16year major league career had hershiser started a game on two days' rest that was in 1986 , when , according to the elias sports bureau , the 28yearold hershiser pitched an eighthit shutout for the dodgers on the final day of the regular season hershiser had never pitched on one day of rest but when manager bobby valentine asked if he would do just that , hershiser said he could pitch whenever the mets needed him the 30 , 053 fans on hand last night chanted his nickname , bulldog , at every opportunity , as the mets pulled within three games of the atlanta braves in the national league east \( coincidentally , the 100 score was the same as it had been on sept 29 , 1986 , when hershiser started against the san diego padres on two days' rest \) it was not a bad way to rebound for someone who had been driven from the game in the third inning of a start against the braves just two nights before hershiser , who is 71 in his last 10 starts , not only rediscovered his sinkerball , but also had the expos beating it into the ground on a regular basis benefiting from a threerun first by the mets and brian mcrae s three runs batted in , including a tworun homer in the third , hershiser scattered three singles against the young , inexperienced expos lineup nine of the 15 outs hershiser recorded were on grounders four were on strikeouts one was a soft liner to short one was a fly ball to right only four of the 18 expos batters hershiser faced hit the ball out of the infield none reached second base what effect did the short rest have \? as you can see , it really helps my sinker , hershiser said there were several reasons the mets had asked him to take the mound last night , but that was n't one of them the move allowed the mets to bump the rookie righthander octavio dotel back a day , and meant that the more experienced hershiser could start again sunday against the yankees in the last game before the allstar game break the move also gave masato yoshii , who has been bothered by a sore right quadriceps , an additional day of rest he will start tomorrow afternoon against montreal and that makes it possible for al leiter , who beat the yankees in the bronx on june 6 , to start the series opener against the yankees at shea friday night most important , said dave wallace , the pitching coach , was that hershiser had a chance to get back out on the mound as quickly as possible , so he could forget sunday night s rocking hershiser said he made two adjustments last night that was why he really thought his best pitch had some sink again he threw 59 pitches , 45 for strikes \( 76 percent \) , in five innings on sunday , he threw 52 pitches before he was lifted with two outs in the third inning so i threw 111 pitches over seven and twothirds innings , hershiser said it just took three days inside pitch jason isringhausen pitched three scoreless innings for his first major league save in his first major league relief appearance i 'll have to think i'm going to have a lot longer career if they keep me in relief , he said melvin mora recorded his first major league hit , a seventhinning single , for the mets john franco , on the disabled list with a strained flexor tendon in his left middle finger , said he would undergo a magnetic resonance imaging test this afternoon manager bobby valentine said bobby jones threw without pain yesterday , including off the mound , and that jones s next throwing session would be exclusively from the mound before the allstar game break jones has been on the disabled list since may 23 with a shoulder ailment general manager steve phillips responded last night to a report that the mets and the st louis cardinals were the leading candidates for a possible seasonopening series in tokyo next year he said in general , we 're open to international considerations it certainly is along the lines of what we 're trying to do photos orel hershiser , removed in the third inning of his previous start on sunday , pitched five scoreless innings last night \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg d1 \) brian mcrae \( 56 \) was congratulated by his teammate roger cedeno after his tworun homer in the third inning gave the mets a 50 lead robin ventura , right , also scored \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg d3 \)

havana american foreign policy toward cuba is really unique among us foreign policies it is n't just 15 degrees off it has the distinction of being 360 degrees wrong that is , the longstanding us boycott and isolation of cuba is a failed policy if your desire is to punish cuba s people so they will oust fidel castro , and it is a failed policy if your desire is to ease the pain on cuba s people while they wait for mr castro to pass away it is a failed policy if you think we should be preparing for a postcastro cuba and it is a failed policy if you think we should be trying to bring down mr castro today it is a failed policy if you believe in human rights , and it is a failed policy if you believe only in trade with mr castro having celebrated his 40th anniversary in power , it s safe to say us policy has n't worked in any direction and no wonder it s not really a policy it s an attitude a blind hunger for revenge against mr castro by a small , exile cubanamerican minority residing largely in florida , and a blind hunger for campaign contributions from this cuban minority by us congressmen what would a sensible cuba policy look like \? first , it would acknowledge that the unilateral us boycott of cuba has not weakened the regime cuba can still trade with 160 other countries does that mean cuba s economy is flourishing \? no , but not because of our boycott it is n't flourishing for the same reason that the soviet economy crumbled because communism does n't work communism is great for producing missiles , but terrible when it comes to breakfast , lunch and dinner what ails the cuban economy is the internal embargo here , the selfimposed sanctions that come from cuba still adhering to failed marxist economics the only thing the us embargo does is obscure that fact and give the regime another excuse for remaining ironfisted mr castro argues to his people that they are under siege from america , therefore they have to remain mobilized and ca n't loosen up make no mistake , this is a repressive regime it has taught its people to read in record numbers , but wo n't allow them to read what they want it has educated its people better than anywhere in the caribbean , but wo n't allow them to speak freely it is a worker s paradise where people still have to live off ration books but it is a repressive regime led by a charismatic figure who knows how to stay in power which is why a wise us policy today would be focused primarily on shaping the postcastro cuba , so that we do n't have another haiti where , after the regime collapses , everyone tries to build a raft for miami and the cuban people do n't have another 40 years of repression last july the us diplomatic mission here held a lottery for 20 , 000 immigration visas to the us it received in 30 days 541 , 000 applications that meant that roughly onetenth of the total eligible population of cuba applied to leave imagine the scramble to get out if mr castro suddenly goes there are no trade unions here , no free nongovernmental organizations , no business groups none of the elements of civil society that hold a country in place it is haiti waiting to happen , only closer to our shores by not helping cuba develop a transition system that can lead to a soft landing after mr castro \( who is 73 \) , we are insuring a hard landing our best tool for shaping postcastro cuba is engaging with cuba now letting more cubans study in the us , training their technocrats to run a modern state , and , yes , opening the way for some us investment and trade sure , in the short term mr castro would use any openness to his advantage but he s using our boycott to his advantage already the difference is what us engagement with cuba would produce in the long run at a minimum it would put pressure on mr castro to ease the human rights abuses , by making it much more difficult for him to justify continued repression and at a maximum it would help lay the foundations of a cuban economy that could thrive in the future , and insure that whoever succeeds mr castro has to be more open everywhere you turn here you see american influence despite the boycott they love our chevys , they love american dollars , they love american baseball , and they love american democracy american values permeate this place without even trying imagine what would happen if we actually tried

in a move that underscored how far the fortunes of good morning america have fallen , and how much that hurts the fortunes of the abc television network and its stations , abc news yesterday plucked one of its biggest stars , diane sawyer , from the firmament of primetime news and named her coanchor of the morning program , where she will be twinned with charles gibson mr gibson was coanchor of good morning america for 11 years until last may , when he left the program to kevin newman and to lisa mcree , who had replaced joan lunden a year earlier the new anchor team will be interim but indefinite , said david westin , the president of abc news , and will take over on jan 18 ms sawyer , who will retain her twiceweekly role as coanchor of the news magazine 20 20 , as well , said she envisioned her morning role as lasting a few months , but we 're not trying to put a number on it the move come after a long slide in the program s ratings once the premier show in morning television , good morning america lost its lead to nbc s today program in 1995 and has since declined precipitously in the nielsen ratings , losing more than a quarter of its audience in two years the morning programs are the most profitable news shows for abc and nbc yearend figures are not yet available , but estimates compiled by nielsen from network and advertising agency figures show that for the first half of 1998 , today earned about 117 million for nbc , a general electric unit , while good morning america earned about 77 million for abc , a unit of the walt disney company these programs are also vital to each network s owned and affiliated stations they split advertising time 5050 with the networks but sustain almost none of the costs and the programs help lead viewers to the rest of a station s morning programming mr westin acknowledged that abc s stations had put pressure on the network to remedy whatever was wrong with good morning america we needed to make a very dramatic move , he said for 1998 , nbc s today program averaged a 53 rating , while good morning america averaged 30 , with each rating point representing 994 , 000 homes cbs this morning , the third network television morning show , averaged a 23 rating the move yesterday stunned abc news colleagues , who see ms sawyer as one of the stars of primetime news and mr gibson as having finally escaped from an earlymorning duty at which he had served long enough neither one really needs this in their career right now , mr westin said but charlie is deeply committed to the 'good morning america' franchise , and diane is being a very loyal colleague and stepping up to help ms sawyer was cohost of the morning show for cbs news in the early 1980 s , before joining 60 minutes and then moving to abc she said she would now cut back on assignments requiring travel , but otherwise planned to be fully part of the '2020' team they 'll just have to give me a lot of extra makeup for under my eyes , she remarked until this fall ms sawyer and sam donaldson had coanchored their own news magazine , prime time live , on wednesday nights it was renamed 20 20 and joined that franchise , with barbara walters and hugh downs remaining the friday night anchors and ms walters and ms sawyer on camera sunday nights colleagues who insisted on anonymity said that in the egodriven world of primetime news , ms sawyer had been unhappy about prime time live being subsumed into 20 20 , long identified with ms walters , and the good morning america role gives her a fresh and prominent identity , apart from ms walters it is also flattering , they said , to be regarded by top management as the potential savior of a program that is financially vital to the company ms sawyer excused herself early from yesterday s telephone news conference to catch a plane , and had no further comment mr gibson had just been named coanchor , with connie chung , of the latest edition of 20 20 , on monday nights , starting feb 1 he said yesterday that he would do that but would reduce the number of pieces he reported mr westin and both anchors said that no extra compensation or contract revisions had been made to induce them to take the new roles but two of ms sawyer s favorite producers were chosen to run good morning america shelley ross , who recently produced ms sawyer s exclusive interview with kenneth w starr , the independent counsel pursuing president clinton , was named executive producer of the program , replacing shelley lewis and phyllis mcgrady , who had been executive producer of prime time live for four years until it was folded into 20 20 , will be the abc news management executive supervising the show mr westin said abc news management , which has included him for 20 months , was to blame for the swift decline at good morning america , and that he did not expect recovery overnight he said his two goals were to restore the program s core identity , which he said means a warmer , more familylike show , and to groom contributors for the next generation the today program has been very successful at gradually acclimating its viewers to new talent , both anchors and news readers matt lauer , who replaced bryant gumbel as coanchor with katie couric in 1997 , filled in as an anchor in almost a third of the previous year s programs before taking over by contrast , mr newman came from almost

i remain in darkness by annie ernaux translated by tanya leslie 94 pp new york seven stories press 1895 annie ernaux is the sort of writer who practices vivisection with words , she lays open a life not only her own but others' as well mother , father , lover , friend keen language and unwavering focus allow her to penetrate deep , to reveal pulses of love , desire , remorse in eight spare books , she has dismantled and coolly examined her early youth and her strivings to escape the humiliations of her parents' bluecollar world for the seemingly rarefied realm of academia , dissecting the consolations and disappointments of transcending her parents' social class as well as the agonies of selfloathing that ensued raised to be an observant roman catholic , ernaux lingered excruciatingly over an abortion in her first book , cleaned out , and in simple passion explored her love affair with a married man all of this writing even when addressing a different subject is informed by the love , the rage and sometimes even the hatred she bears for her mother , a woman whose presence is as strong , as lifegiving and as dangerous for ernaux as sido s was for colette in 1988 , ernaux published a woman s story , a biographical novel , or novelized biography , whose stated purpose was to find out the truth about my mother roughly a decade later , ernaux has released 'i remain in darkness , ' the journal she kept as her mother died , a series of notes that inspired a woman s story but which she says she did not read as she wrote that book she claims its entries frightened her because of their naked disregard for consequences but this same disregard is something that she clearly believes is crucial to the integrity of a text and that has led her from the start to ignore the boundaries between genres any reader familiar with ernaux s work suspects that she must have found the recent muchtouted showdown between the novel and the memoir to be ludicrous if , that is , the debate was something the french even entertained for 20 years , she has held tight to a humming , taut cord stretched between author and subject , to a plumb line that always drops true rather than a border to be drawn and redrawn for a long time , ernaux writes in her introduction to 'i remain in darkness , ' i believed that i would never have this text published maybe because i wanted to offer only one image , one side of the truth the version she carefully assembled in a woman s story over the years , however , she has reconsidered , deciding that the consistency and coherence achieved in any written work even when its innermost contradictions are laid bare must be questioned whenever possible that said , there is little inconsistency between the two works details and even scenes are repeated , sometimes almost word for word \( both books are translated by tanya leslie , who renders ernaux s style with the simplicity and elegance of the original \) , but the sympathy between novel and memoir is not a matter of mere repetition while 'i remain in darkness' will not give ernaux s readers new information , it serves as a more intimate revelation of the slow death that prompted her to bear witness to the life that was ebbing ernaux s mother died of alzheimer s disease like john bayley s memoir elegy for iris , ernaux s memoir catalogs the deterioration of a once powerful , almost totemic presence , a fall so cataclysmic that it cannot be analyzed or contextualized , only reported as revealed by ernaux , the details of a loved one s deterioration have such emblematic force and terror that the particular becomes universal she hides her soiled underwear beneath her pillow , ernaux writes , helpless against the childhood memory of finding her mother s bloodstained underwear buried at the bottom of the laundry pile , recalling the thrill and awe occasioned by such evidence of life and generative power of a vitality and womanhood that has now been destroyed in her mother s nursing home , ernaux notices that an old man in pajamas is always busy making phone calls he spends all day trying to get hold of someone although she alludes to the labor involved in her craft , ernaux renders the plight of the dying with a seemingly effortless economy , with an instinctive aim that forces her readers into the existential trap of the hospital corridor the old man is n't crazy he s sane one day , we will be as helpless against our fate as he is when he pushes a scrawled phone number into ernaux s hand , hoping for reprieve the refusal to do more than report what she observes is ernaux s way of testifying to the betrayal of literature , a troubled theme that recurs throughout her work what is the point of mastering language and dialectic , of studying great works why did ernaux herself forsake a life of using her hands for one of using her head \? when fate will level her anyway \? ernaux s struggle is not so much with mortality as with the consciousness of mortality , the awareness of life and the apprehension of death that we are always trying to deflect or obliterate with sex or food or alcohol or physical labor with books , for that matter , although most books offer more in the way of escape than those by ernaux ambivalence is central to her work like most writers , she intends to assemble meaning , cohesion , to find out a truth that can be conveyed only by words , and with that truth save herself \( and only incidentally her readers \) from the damnation of meaninglessness and yet this is the same writer whose purpose , as she admits in simple passion , is to produce a feeling of anxiety and stupefaction , a suspension of moral judgment desperate for the comfort of explanations , she suspects there are none , and is left with no choice but to endure the extreme discomfort of a conscious life it is an awareness that renders writing and every other attempt to hold on to experience as frail , hopeless in 'i remain in darkness' \( its title taken from the last coherent sentence her mother ever wrote \) ernaux abandons her search for a larger truth because , in the face of a loss as profound as that of her mother , all attempts to make sense of it have the feel of artifice the only available option is necessarily modest the choice simply to be true to oneself i have searched for my mother s love in all corners of the world , ernaux observes toward the end of her journal in this she finds consistency , if not comfort
it took a lifethreatening fall from a horse to chart the course that has not only made debbie mcdonald a champion in dressage , that horseandrider partnership in a sort of equine step dance , but also has her fulfilling her dream of riding at madison square garden in the national horse show when the 116th rendition of the national gets under way tonight , then runs through sunday , mcdonald , a double gold medalist in dressage at the 1999 panamerican games , will perform a musical exhibition on her goldmedal mount , brentina , an 8yearold hanoverian mare with the instincts of a ballerina even though mcdonald had always envisioned herself thundering over fences astride a jumper for her garden debut , 10 years ago she sustained a fall that came inches away from being fatal these days , she s grateful to be riding at all it was just an ordinary schooling fence ahead , the kind she had navigated a thousand times , but when mcdonald s horse was spooked in midair by the backfire from a truck , the jump turned into a somersault the fivefoot , 115pound mcdonald landed on her back , conscious , only to look skyward and see a petrified 1 , 200 pound hanoverian mare named dominate crashing down on her mcdonald thought the impact would kill her instead , it broke several ribs , crushed her reproductive organs , herniated a disk in her neck , and changed her life after 15 years of showing hunterjumpers , the crash left her afraid to jump but unwilling to stop riding according to mcdonald , who at the horsecrazy age of 13 mucked 20 stalls a day at the orange county fairgrounds in california in exchange for room and board for a 400 pony her parents scrimped to buy her , horses not only helped her earn her living , they also helped make life worth living so at the urging of her husband , bob , she turned to the less dangerous equine discipline of dressage and somewhat to his and her surprise , she became a star in the beginning , i really had no interest in dressage it seemed kind of boring to me , mcdonald said earlier this week after a prenational schooling session aboard brentina at the united states equestrian team complex in gladstone , nj now i ca n't think of anything else for anybody who has a true passion about having a partnership with an animal , there s just something about dressage it takes tons of patience , but when you get to that high level , you really do think as one when things go right last year mcdonald , now 45 , rode in her first major international dressage competition , the world cup at goteborg , sweden , finishing 12th this summer , mcdonald not only anchored the united states team to a gold medal at the panam games in winnipeg , manitoba , she and brentina also won the individual gold when the panam games ended , mcdonald got back into the truck and went back to everyday reality in hailey , idaho , where she and her husband operate river grove farm , a training center that houses 20 horses , none of them her own mcdonald has been buying and selling horses since she was 15 and sold her first pony for a 200 profit , then invested in a thoroughbred she could n't afford to show so she let a few wealthier teenagers campaign the horse , then sold it for 1 , 500 it was a tearjerker each time i sold a horse , mcdonald said but that was the only way i could afford to be around horses and save up enough money to show them myself this is the first time in my entire career that i 've had somebody say , 'you can keep these horses for as long as you want , ' mcdonald said of her dressage mounts both brentina and the 13yearold beaurivage , her world cup horse , are owned by peggy thomas , who has sponsored mcdonald since she first began riding competitively nearly 30 years ago mcdonald purchased beaurivage for 25 , 000 on thomas s behalf at an auction in verden , germany , in 1989 brentina , purchased there five years ago , cost around 325 , 000 i 've been lucky to have such great owners , said mcdonald , who estimates it takes six years to train a dressage horse for elite competition the trouble in this country is that everybody s usually in such a hurry , they end up breaking the horse down and burning it out hoofbeats because of a lack of competitive teams from europe , the national decided to jettison the nations cup event this year riders from switzerland and italy had intended to compete in jumper classes but pulled out after the european union , fearing a possible health hazard from the west nile virus , imposed quarantine restrictions on incoming horses from new york , new jersey and connecticut three horses have died of the virus on eastern long island back after an unpopular hiatus in 1998 is the puissance jimmy torano , who won the class with a 7foot1inch

tel aviv an election in israel is not just about politics , shlomo benami said it is anthropology one more chapter in the kulturkampf , the conflict of cultures mr benami , a leading figure in israel s labor party , was explaining why it is hard to predict the result of the upcoming election israel , he said , does not have a real democratic pendulum masses of voters swinging away from a politician when his policies are seen to fail , as the french elected the conservative jacques chirac and then swung to the socialists the weight of tradition , religion , tribalism is so great here , he said people will vote for a bad government because it is theirs israel s voters are almost equally divided between left and right benjamin netanyahu , the candidate of the right , was elected prime minister in 1996 by just 16 , 000 votes by ordinary democratic standards , mr netanyahu should be in desperate political trouble four of his former senior cabinet members are campaigning against him now his zigzags in the peace process yielding , then stalling have cost him trust on all sides the police are investigating possible crimes by his foreign minister , the minister of justice and the prime minister himself most political commentators scorn him for what gideon samet of haaretz called his serial bungling but this is israel , with its seemingly immutable politics of tribalism mr netanyahu relied in 1996 , and can still rely , on the support of three major groups in addition to his own nationalist conservatives russian immigrants , who make up about one million of israel s population of six million having suffered under a communist regime , they incline to the political right here at least at first orthodox jews , whose political parties won 19 percent of the seats in the last knesset many were traditionally antizionist , but most have moved to become passionate nationalists allied with the right socalled oriental or sephardic jews , especially immigrants from north africa they harbor resentment of the formerly dominant jews of european origin mr netanyahu is skillful at appealing to all three groups as victims of unfair treatment and identifying himself with them his version of bill clinton s i feel your pain amounts to the elite discriminate against you , and they treat me badly too fear is another important element in mr netanyahu s electoral technique it is effective , as prof yaron ezrahi of the israel democracy institute explains if there is a people that has trouble being optimistic , it is the jewish people for good reason so the politics of pessimism has greater energy here netanyahu appeals to the part of us that says , 'the world is full of enemies' in his campaign statements , mr netanyahu warns against a palestinian state with a large army equipped with tanks , missiles and artillery something to which no imaginable israeli government would agree he hints that his principal opponent , the labor party s ehud barak , is supported by yasir arafat mr barak s main campaign theme is that israel needs change that seems to fit the public mood there is a sense of economic insecurity , notably among lowerincome people hit by rising unemployment the question is whether policy interests can overcome political loyalties or to put it another way , whether tribal politics is really immutable some say there are signs of more flexibility , for example among younger members of the various groups shlomo benami himself bridges the divisions an immigrant from morocco in 1955 , he has risen far and fast he has a phd from oxford , is a scholar of modern spanish history , has published nine books , was israel s ambassador to spain in 1996 he was elected to the knesset after just three years there , polls show him to be the most popular figure in the labor party he is a symbol of an optimistic israel polls now show mr barak slightly ahead of mr netanyahu but there are other candidates , and none is likely to win the required majority on may 17 then there will be a runoff when much will depend on how many members of the various groups turn out to vote as mr benami said , it s such an unpredictable country

on the final day of my presidency , martial law was declared no one was allowed in without a little paper pass i had made myself you do not know the feeling of power until you have stood at the border with a guard and kept out those who do not belong and last tuesday night , at a packed meeting , i gave it all up it was emotional they were overjoyed to see me go they were afraid i would become president for life the doorbell is silent now , no one calls , and i am invisible to people who once curried my favor yet i feel free i will work on my relationships with three new friends , cleve , elie and especially rover i will have time to reflect on these tumultuous years , and to concentrate on my most visionary project , inviting hillary clinton to spend her summer vacation here in my neighborhood , grapus mrs clinton in grapus will spare shelter island and the adironacks , two of my favorite places , and put pressure on the warring parties of gramercy park , the city s least used and most private there have been reports of several dead birds and squirrels , collateral damage from a pigeoncleansing operation peace in gramercy park should be a campaign priority one fears the spread of the conflict to union square i was drafted to the presidency of my coop board two years ago and elected by acclaim no one else wanted the job i was around the house more than most to accept packages and scare strangers , put off by my ninja pajamas during my administration , there was a 50 percent turnover in occupancy , which required my stamping many documents with the corporate seal by far my greatest accomplishment was the repainting and recarpeting of the entire building i had the executive brilliance of assigning the job to a new resident , shonagh , a greatlooking blond wife and mother of strength , intelligence , energy and vision i saw her as a younger hillary and my eventual successor she became president just in time to supervise an even bigger job , the replacement of the front stoop , which has required a guarded entrance through the basement the morning after her election , just another citizen , i visited cleve , who begs at third avenue and 16th street i had ignored him at first as just another shambling , smiley , middleaged man with boardedup windows for eyes there are dozens like him in the nabe , junkies , mentally ill , connected by their drugs to clinics operated by beth israel medical center and other local pharmacopias then one day , i saw him lurch into traffic and make a protective fence with his arms around a small elderly woman who had apparently become confused in the middle of third avenue he led her to the sidewalk , tipped an imaginary hat and returned to shaking his cup at the likes of me i gave him 5 that day he is my designated bum now i met elie only two weeks ago while trying to find someone who could put a new 6 battery into my old 15 wristwatch a shoe repair shop i had barely noticed on east 17th off irving place advertised watch repair the man behind the counter was wearing a shoepolishstained tshirt from stephen a halsey junior high school 157 , queens did you go there , too \? i asked it took a while , but he explained that he had come from russia six years ago , that his family lives in rego park , the neighborhood in which i grew up , and that his 13yearold son goes to my old school then he fixed my watch rover moved in six weeks ago and will fill none of the emotional holes left by my loss of presidential power he still bites me when i poke him in the belly , and he shares my tuna fish sandwiches as if i am the animal on welfare there is no relationship between the times i need affection and the times he rubs against my leg i had thought he would be my pet , but i have become rover s boy cleve , elie and rover will help me inform mrs clinton while she is vacationing in grapus about the realities of health care , mental illness , work , immigration , education and love these will be crucial issues in a senate race to which only the new nattering ninnies of neonihilism \( rover calls them the readable rats \) are looking forward if the commentaries of the new nihilists are accurate and there is no difference between mrs clinton and the mayor , if all politicians are worthy only of ridicule , my plans may have to change despite what i promised shonagh , i may have to take back the seal and the power but for now , i am just rover s boy i have memories and , like all expresidents , papers to work on they are all over the floor drawing \( mark matcho \)
stanley kubrick , the famously reclusive director of such classic films as dr strangelove , 2001 a space odyssey and a clockwork orange , died yesterday at his home in england , his family said he was 70 the police were summoned to mr kubrick s rural home in hertfordshire , north of london , where he was pronounced dead yesterday afternoon there are no suspicious circumstances , a police spokesman said mr kubrick s family announced his death and said there would be no further comment one of the few american directors who had the prestige to make bigbudget movies while working outside the hollywood mainstream , mr kubrick directed coldly brilliant films that explored humanity s baser instincts with great visual flair and often savage wit although those films won eight academy awards , none were for best director that may be because his subjects were often dark the comic satire dr strangelove , made at the height of the cold war , portrayed the military as a collection of incompetent , jingoistic yahoos itching for an chance to unleash nuclear devastation the film was a harsher and much funnier version of the same vision of military pathology and hypocrisy found in paths of glory , the movie that brought him to prominence in 1957 , and that was reiterated 30 years later in full metal jacket mr kubrick s sarcasm and ironic humor flared memorably in dr strangelove in the juxtaposition of vera lynn singing we 'll meet again against images of nuclear catastrophe it was also evident in the blue danube waltz accompanying a spacedocking sequence in 2001 and in a scene of malcolm mcdowell jauntily crowing singin' in the rain while delivering a brutal beating in a clockwork orange that film s savagery was so pointed that some critics complained that the movie glorified violence mr kubrick withdrew the film from distribution in britain after it was said to have inspired copycat crimes but if mr kubrick s misanthropy prompted some critics to accuse him of coldness and inhumanity , others saw his pessimism as an uncompromisingly swiftian vision of human absurdity mr kubrick s chilly outlook coincided with his reputation for being an extreme perfectionist who insisted on control over every aspect of his films , from casting and screenwriting to editing , lighting and music it often took him many months and sometimes years to complete a film he was known to film up to 100 takes of a scene increasingly reclusive , he announced in 1974 that he was settling permanently in england refusing to give interviews , he withdrew so completely that an englishman impersonated him for several months before being discovered stanley kubrick was born on july 26 , 1928 , in the bronx as a child he was encouraged by his father , a doctor , to take up still photography , and when he was 17 he was hired as a staff photographer by look magazine , which had been impressed by a picture he had snapped the day president franklin d roosevelt died while working at look he attended film screenings at the museum of modern art and later said that seeing so many bad films gave him the confidence to do better i was aware that i did n't know anything about making films , but i believed i could n't make them any worse than the majority of films i was seeing , mr kubrick once said bad films gave me the courage to try making a movie in 1950 he quit his job at look to make his first film , day of the fight , a 16minute documentary , which he sold to rkopathe he completed two more documentary shorts before making his feature debut in 1953 with fear and desire , a lowbudget film that was financed with family money , and that he wrote , directed , photographed and edited after making a second feature , killer s kiss , he formed a production company in 1954 with a producer , james b harris , and made the killing , a drama about a racetrack heist starring sterling hayden mr kubrick s fourth fulllength film , paths of glory , established him as one of the most promising postwar american filmmakers the world war i drama , starring kirk douglas , was a devastating indictment of military duplicity that still stands as one of the most powerful antiwar movies he made the killing and paths of glory for a percentage of the profits , and both received critical acclaim while faring indifferently at the box office two years later , in 1959 , mr kubrick was invited to replace anthony mann , the director of the highbudget roman epic spartacus , which starred mr douglas as the leader of a slave rebellion against the roman state the film , released in 1960 , was noticeably more intelligent than most roman spectacles of the era and was an enormous boxoffice success soon after , mr kubrick moved to england , where he hoped to maintain greater creative control of his films than he could in hollywood but he soon returned to the united states to scout locations for lolita , an adaptation of the vladimir nabokov novel in which james mason played humbert humbert , the middleaged lover of the pubescent lolita \( sue lyon \)
a rare siberian tiger that escaped into a densely wooded area in jackson township , nj , was shot dead last night after tranquilizer darts apparently failed to subdue the animal , the police said a team of local , state and federal authorities , assisted by a veterinarian , had been searching for more than six hours when the tiger was found , and shot with a tranquilizer dart , the police said but the tiger failed to succumb to the tranquilizer , and officers from the new jersey division of fish , game and wildlife killed it around 9 35 pm , the police said a decision was made at the scene to put down the animal , said sgt richard ferrarelli , a spokesman for the jackson township police the authorities were trying to determine who owned the tiger a jackson township woman who raises exotic animals told the police that none of her animals had escaped , sergeant ferrarelli said debbie israel , a spokeswoman for six flags great adventure , a nearby nature preserve closed for the winter , said that all of its nine tigers were accounted for agents of the fish , game and wildlife division took custody of the tiger s body and were checking the whereabouts of all tigers in the state , whose handlers are required to be licensed by the new jersey department of agriculture sergeant ferrarelli said a woman reported seeing the tiger in her backyard at 1 40 pm officers sent to the house , on wright debow road , found a large paw print , he said local and state police , agents of the federal bureau of investigation and animal experts from six flags great adventure , helped by a police helicopter and an fbi airplane equipped with a thermalimaging device to detect warmblooded creatures , spent the afternoon and early evening in pursuit of the animal , sergeant ferrarelli said tigers , fierce predators that hunt by night , are the largest of all cats , weighing more than 400 pounds the siberian tiger s natural habitat is eastern russia , korea and northeastern china according to a 1994 assessment by the world conservation monitoring centre , it is critically endangered , with fewer than 250 adults left in the world
on wednesday , fans of the odyssey channel who live in manhattan will be able to tune in to worship services , gospel music shows , theological discussions and extensive coverage of pope john paul ii s trip to st louis but if they tune in to that station , channel 70 , on thursday , they will see a total transformation the odyssey channel , which also offers family entertainment , will be replaced by the new msg metro channel , which will offer a melange of features and information on what to do and where to go in the city , along with weather reports and information on coping with emergencies odyssey , which was never available in brooklyn , the bronx or queens , will continue to be shown on staten island and in other parts of the country , where it reaches 29 million households to leaders of the clergy in new york , the change represents a significant loss last week , a coalition including the rev dr arthur caliandro , pastor of marble collegiate church rabbi gilbert s rosenthal , executive vice president of the new york board of rabbis , and imam alhajj talib w 'abdurrashid , of the mosque of islamic brotherhood in harlem , met with the president of time warner cable , barry rosenblum , and other officials of the company , in an effort to have the decision reversed this is the one vehicle where there is a strong spiritual programming , programming for the soul , dr caliandro said in the new york environment there is almost nothing supportive of religious interests his sunday sermons have been regularly broadcast on the channel mr rosenblum told the group that the decision was irrevocable but offered to work with them to find other creative options , possibly allocating time on another channel for odyssey programs or giving them air time when digital technology increases the number of available channels but for the time being , he said we want to fill a void and build on the success of new york 1 news our customers tell us they want more local programming and to add something when you have no more channel capacity means you must subtract something else we looked to see what needs were being met by other channels there is an extensive amount of religious and family programming on other cable and network channels as well as on the four public access stations time warner cable executives also attributed the decision to low viewership but claude wells , odyssey s senior vice president of affiliate relations , said that the channel had better ratings in the fourth quarter of 1998 than cnn headline news , the fox news channel , court tv or the food channel moreover , the audience is almost certain to grow in april when programs from the jim henson company , creator of the muppets , and hallmark entertainment begin to be shown the two companies acquired 45 percent ownership of odyssey in november , becoming partners with the national interfaith cable coalition and telecommunications inc , the country s largest cable company the new partners agreed to provide at least 40 hours a week of programs dealing with faith and values john cardinal o'connor wrote a letter to mr rosenblum several weeks ago protesting the loss of the channel , and joseph zwilling , a spokesman for the archdiocese of new york , attended the meeting last week we went hoping to demonstrate the importance of odyssey to various faith groups , mr zwilling said , and i was very disappointed that there was no flexibility , no sense that this was in any way a decision that could be reexamined listing programs specifically directed to roman catholics holy week services from st patrick s cathedral , sunday mass from san antonio he said it is ironic that holy week services might now be available all over the country but not in manhattan people who are unable to be in st patrick s wo n't have access at all even if viewers can find similar spiritual programs elsewhere on the dial , they will not have the same impact , religious leaders said i think there are many channels that drop a religious program here or there in their schedule , but none has the same kind of philosophy , said the rev bernard r bonnot , a roman catholic priest and senior vice president for religious affairs at the odyssey channel there are none that carry a comparable amount of religious programming and none that has the affiliation with an interfaith coalition of religious bodies that odyssey has
albany , may 11 an unusual bipartisan coalition of state lawmakers , whose constituents range from innercity residents to affluent suburbanites , is pushing to scale back new , more stringent graduation requirements for nearly all public high school students the lawmakers contend that the new graduation standards are being phased in too quickly , do not accurately measure the overall academic performance of students and could result in increased failure and dropout rates in school districts across the state the rising concern in the state legislature comes as the board of regents , the body charged with setting educational policy for the state , and the state education commissioner press ahead with new standardized tests that all high school students will eventually have to pass to graduate some lawmakers fear that as many as 20 percent of seniors may be unable to pass the tests beginning next year , students will have to pass a more rigorous english regents exam to earn a high school diploma in later years , students will have to pass similar standardized tests in four other subjects math american history and government global studies , and science it is not clear what action the legislature might take to scale back the new standards , or whether such a move would have the support of gov george e pataki , whose aides declined to comment today but one measure has already been proposed in the assembly to allow school districts to use alternative standards to the regents exam for graduation the democraticcontrolled assembly and the republicanled senate are holding joint hearings on the issue around the state aides to the leaders of both chambers say they have heard widespread concerns that the new graduation requirements may deny diplomas to thousands of students that the senate and the assembly have found common ground on this issue is remarkable , given that their leaders agree on almost nothing else to date , both houses have jointly passed only about two dozen pieces of legislation this session , none of them major , and budget talks are still deadlocked almost six weeks past the deadline there s growing concern that relying on one set of standardized , timepressured tests will leave hundreds of thousands of students behind , said assemblyman richard l brodsky , a democrat from westchester county who proposed legislation to allow alternative standards this issue has resonance that goes well beyond the traditional fault lines that have polarized education debates in the past , mr brodsky added it affects every community in the state , whether they are in the inner cities or in the suburbs dean g skelos , a republican from nassau county who is a deputy majority leader in the state senate , agreed there is really universal and bipartisan concern with what they are doing , he said of the new regents standards we are hopeful that the board of regents will get the message that the legislature is not happy with what they have done but in an interview late this afternoon , richard p mills , the state education commissioner and one of the architects of the new graduation standards , said any move to relax the standards would rob students of the education they need to compete in the workplace the reason we raised the standards was in response to a public outcry that the old standards were too low , he said , adding , we just have to stay the course and insist that children get the education that they need mr mills said the new standards had already raised academic performance he said 78 percent of high school seniors passed the regents english exam last year , even though it was not required for graduation the standards are working , he said the commissioner is chosen by the regents , who in turn are appointed by the legislature an aide to mayor rudolph w giuliani said the mayor favored the tougher standards the regents' plan restores the value of a high school diploma , said the spokeswoman , sunny mindel to reverse this would be a terrible step backward in time the state first offered the regents exam in 1879 as a standard for colleges to use in evaluating high school graduates but until now , students only needed to pass a competency test to graduate , and only a minority fewer than 25 percent of graduates in new york city have taken diplomas showing they passed the more difficult regents exams mr mills and the board of regents have contended that the old twotiered testing system had created two classes of students high achievers , who often go on to college , and low achievers , who lack the skills to function well in the workplace but mr mills and the regents are not just requiring students to pass the regents exams to graduate they also say that they are making the exams considerably harder the new exams are being phased in gradually , beginning this june , when 11th graders will be required to take the twoday , sixhour reading , writing and listening test in english the class of 2003 will be required to take five subject exams in math , science , global studies , american history and government , and english that has led to widespread concern , if not panic , among parents , teachers and administrators over the prospect of widespread failures lawmakers here are careful to point out that they heartily applaud the regents' effort to raise the academic performance of students but they also argue that the tests are just one measure of academic ability , and that many school districts , particularly poor ones , lack the resources to prepare lowachieving students to take the new tests jeffrion l aubrey , a democratic assemblyman from queens , said he was particularly troubled that teachers did not have enough time to review the tests how can teachers construct a curriculum or conduct classes around a test they have n't really had a chance to see \? mr aubrey asked that s not fair i would raise the curriculum standard first , without tying it to a test that means as much as this one does steven sanders , a democrat from manhattan who is the chairman of the assembly s education committee , expressed similar concerns are we really prepared in this state to witness perhaps as many as 15 or 20 percent of our high school seniors not to graduate , and then to suffer the very real consequences of what that will mean \? he asked senator michael a l balboni , a republican from nassau county , said he supported the effort to enact higher standards , but questioned the reliance on a single series of tests to determine the academic fate of a high school student this is an example of rushing perhaps in the right direction , but not having all the details worked out ahead of time , he said
in the spring of 1998 , prudence bushnell , the united states ambassador to kenya , sent an emotional letter to secretary of state madeleine k albright begging for the secretary s personal help ms bushnell , a career diplomat , had been fighting for months for a more secure embassy in the face of mounting terrorist threats and a warning that she was the target of an assassination plot the state department had repeatedly refused to grant her request , citing a lack of money that kind of response , she wrote ms albright , was endangering the lives of embassy personnel the central intelligence agency and the federal bureau of investigation had been amassing increasingly ominous and detailed clues about potential threats in kenya , officials said the state department bureaucracy still dismissed ms bushnell s pleas she was even seen by some at the state department as a nuisance who was overly obsessed with security , according to one official ms albright took no action and three months later , on aug 7 , the american embassies in tanzania and kenya were simultaneously attacked with car bombs twelve american diplomats and more than 200 africans were killed in kenya the state department has acknowledged that ms bushnell raised questions about security before the bombing but a close examination of events in the year before the assaults , based on interviews with officials throughout the united states government , shows her concerns were more intense , more well founded , more specific and more forcefully expressed than has previously been known the review produced these findings the central intelligence agency repeatedly told state department officials in washington and in the kenya embassy that there was an active terrorist cell in kenya connected to osama bin laden , the saudi exile who is accused of masterminding the attack the cia investigated at least three terrorist threats in nairobi in the year before the bombing and took one seriously enough to send a counterterrorism team from cia headquarters the agency ultimately concluded that the threat was unfounded , but some officials say the inquiry was botched , and the agency s inspector general is investigating how it was handled state department officials brushed aside gen anthony c zinni , commander of the united states central command , who had visited nairobi and warned that the embassy there was an easy and tempting target for terrorists general zinni s offer to send his own specialists to review security in nairobi was turned down by the state department the state department had all but abandoned the commitment it made after the 1983 bombing of the embassy in beirut to improve embassy security department officials had long since stopped asking congress for the money needed to meet its own standards , and had adopted a strategy of improving the handful of embassies it believed were at greatest risk nairobi was not one of them ms bushnell , in a rare interview about the bombing , said by telephone from nairobi yesterday this is a tragedy in the real sense of the word , and it s a tragedy that has caused us to think differently we no longer operate under the assumptions that we did in the past a report made public yesterday by a commission appointed by ms albright excoriated the state department for failing to safeguard american missions against terrorist attacks , and particularly for giving vulnerable missions like the one in nairobi lower priority when experience shows they make attractive targets for terrorists but the report , signed by adm william j crowe jr , former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , concluded that intelligence provided no immediate tactical warning of the aug 7 attacks still , classified cable traffic and intelligence reports , which were not included in the public version of admiral crowe s report , show that while none of the warnings gathered by american intelligence in the year before the bombings pointed to a particular act of terrorism on a particular day , the united states had growing indications that the embassy was a target of terrorist plots , and that terrorists hostile to american interests were active in kenya state department officials insist that they were sympathetic to ms bushnell s concerns they added that it was impossible to respond to each terrorist threat it received department officials also assert that even if ms bushnell s requests had been granted , a new embassy could not have been in place in time to prevent the attack in august they also said they were told at the time by the cia that the threats in nairobi had either proved unfounded or had been dealt with by the kenyan authorities administration officials said ms bushnell began raising concerns about embassy security soon after her 1996 arrival in nairobi she sent two cable to headquarters in december 1997 outlining the dangers and asking for a new embassy her request was not seriously considered , officials said , when senior state department officials met in january 1998 to set a budget for embassy construction in the coming year it did n't come up on the radar screen , a senior administration official said
after scrutinizing the answers that 785 prospective jurors gave on a questionnaire , lawyers and a federal judge are to begin the second stage of jury selection this week in the trial of four new york city police officers accused of brutalizing abner louima the second stage is to include the dismissal by judge eugene h nickerson in federal district court in brooklyn of potential jurors whose answers he believes indicate that they cannot be impartial in the racially charged case the dismissals are expected to take place tomorrow , to be followed , starting wednesday , by the judge s individual questioning of the remaining candidates in the search for 12 jurors and 6 alternate jurors as part of determining which potential jurors should be eliminated based on their answers to queries on the 40page questionnaire they were given two weeks ago , judge nickerson has asked the prosecution and defense to list candidates for dismissal lawyers on both sides refused over the weekend to say how many such dismissals they will seek but given the intensive news coverage of the louima case and of the recent killing of another black man , amadou diallo , by white police officers , it would not be surprising if the total number of jury candidates the defense and prosecution wanted excused amounted to at least a third of the 785 people who filled out the questionnaire when the defense and prosecution differ over whether a candidate should be immediately excused , judge nickerson will make the decision and even when they agree on immediate dismissal , he might well decide otherwise that is because even though none of the 128 questions referred specifically to the diallo case judge nickerson denied defense lawyers' requests for direct mention of that case they go beyond the louima case and were intended to help gauge the potential jurors' views of relations in general between the police and city residents who are black or members of other minority groups the four defendants , officers justin a volpe , charles schwarz , thomas wiese and thomas bruder , who are white , are all accused of beating mr louima , who is black , in a police car after he was arrested in a street brawl in the flatbush section of brooklyn in 1997 officers volpe and schwarz are also accused of torturing mr louima , a haitian immigrant , in a police station by ramming a stick into his rectum , causing major internal injuries one of the questions asked of the prospective jurors was , do you feel that law enforcement is discriminatory against blacks or other minorities in new york city \? another question was , do you think that police officers treat criminal suspects in lowincome neighborhoods differently than in middle or high income neighborhoods \? prospective jurors who answered yes to such questions are likely to have made the defense lawyers wary among the candidates the prosecutors are likely to be wary of are those who agreed with the statement that the job police officers perform is so difficult and important that it is wrong to secondguess them by prosecuting them for alleged wrongdoing that occurs in the course of their job performance
television has more channels than ever before , more primetime shows than ever before , and , of course , more commercials than ever before and yet , to the consternation of many television industry executives , the one thing it seems to have fewer of is one of the most essential commodities of the business stars at the very least , television seems to have smaller stars than it once had in interviews with executives from networks , studios and talent agencies , the list of names that were consensus choices as unquestioned television stars of the magnitude of some of the names of the past even the notallthatdistant past of five years ago , the era of jerry seinfeld , tim allen and roseanne was remarkably short it basically began and ended with one name calista flockhart of fox s hit ally mcbeal the reasons range from the spread of the television audience over an increasing number of channels to the networks' strategy of aiming at specific age and gender groups the falloff in widely recognized , massappeal stars has some serious implications for the television business , more than the problems it causes for tv guide magazine , whose editors admit a certain desperation in trying to find 52 stars a year for their covers \( the magazine has gone so far afield lately in its starvation hunt for identifiable tv names that it put the cast of star wars and the latin singer ricky martin on two covers in the last month , though neither has much of anything to do with television \) for broadcast networks , which continue to market themselves as the one source for advertisers to achieve mass reach , the faces and names of stars are at the center of marketing strategies in his first executive change , garth ancier , the new president of nbc entertainment , added a new head of casting for the network i do think a great part of the identification of a network is the faces of its stars , mr ancier said they represent your network and create your brand they 're all important and yet there does not appear in the networks' current roster to be a host of likely successors to mr seinfeld , who left his nbc comedy last season , and mr allen , who wrapped up his hit comedy , home improvement , last month for the abc unit of walt disney and no one in the same universe of appeal as icons like lucille ball , jackie gleason , mary tyler moore and the bill cosby of the 1980 s \( though the bill cosby of today remains perhaps the biggest name still working in prime time \) one clear indication of the decline in recognizability of today s television stars is the socalled tv q poll , conducted by marketing evaluations inc stars are ranked in this poll based on both popularity and familiarity in the latter category , television stars have recorded a sharp dropoff in scores over the last decade in 1990 , for example , the top 25 female television performers averaged a 68 percent familiarity score by this year that number fell to just 50 percent among male performers , the top 25 had a score of 70 as recently as 1996 this year it is down to 58 if we 're talking about the kind of star who could not walk through times square without stopping traffic , said alan berger , the executive vice president of the television division of the international creative management talent agency , i really do n't think many of today s stars would qualify mr berger emphasized today s stars because he acknowledged that mr cosby remains a star of enormous recognition and popularity , and michael j fox of spin city on abc is another completely familiar and popular figure other stars on their second or third gorounds of stardom \( all , not coincidentally , at cbs , the network that trades most heavily in stars from the past \) include ted danson , don johnson and dick van dyke but all of these performers owe their stardom much more to their previous work than their current work mr johnson , in fact , is often cited as the kind of whitehot star of a generation ago , when he was in miami vice , that is rarely if ever generated today the producers of the network latenight entertainment shows have also detected for some time that , as one executive producer put it , the number of stars who will move the needle of the ratings has dwindled drastically and among the few stars that do have an impact on the ratings , he said , virtually none are a current television star so where have all the big stars gone \? more than anything , they have gone the same way the big hit shows have gone to smaller fame in smaller arenas david f poltrack , the executive vice president for research at cbs , said the entire scale of television had to be reduced , based on declines in network viewing percentages he pointed out that hit shows of the past reached 30 to 40 percent of the viewing audience now a show is a hit if it reaches 15 to 18 percent of the audience and shows on one new network , wb , are being called hits when they reach only about 5 percent of the audience indeed , even more than the overall reduction in what constitutes a hitsized audience , it is the willingness and even the desire of some networks to seek only a small slice of the total viewing pie that is contributing to what one talent agency executive called the honey i shrunk the stars trend in television
seoul , south korea , april 23 for four decades in prison , woo yong gak coolly handled just about every challenge life could throw at him , from the most brutal tortures to endless spells of solitary confinement yet a few things do intimidate mr woo these days in a way that torturers never could vending machines , for example how do you do this , anyway \? mr woo asked , staring in puzzlement at a hotdrink machine on a seoul street i 've never used one of these contraptions mr woo , 69 , emerged in february after 40 years , 7 months and 13 days in prison , after becoming known in human rights circles as the world s longestserving political prisoner after decades simply as prisoner 3514 , he has recovered his name and he has a nice new watch on his wrist and he is even taking lessons in using computers but , he said quickly , i have n't gotten as far as getting an email address nowhere could a rip van winkle encounter greater changes in four decades than in south korea , the world s fastestgrowing economy in that period these changes are particularly poignant because they seem to challenge everything that mr woo believed in , everything that carried him through beatings and sickness and the constant threat of anonymous death in the darkness of his prison cell mr woo endured because of his faith in the communist government of north korea , and in 1958 , when he was arrested , that might have seemed a good bet north korea then was booming economically and was regarded by many koreans as a more legitimate government than the americanbacked dictatorship in the south yet now mr woo has been released into a different world , one where south korea is a rich , industrialized country and a vigorous democracy north korea , on the other hand , is so poor that it is suffering a famine , and it remains a tightly run authoritarian nation halfway between a communist country and an ancient korean kingdom none of this persuades mr woo to change his loyalties in a long conversation in the offices of a human rights group that battled on his behalf , he comes across as friendly , humorous and polite and a dedicated north korean communist the real issue is n't economic development , he said stoutly , dismissing south korea s economic gains gnp that s just numbers the fact that the living standard has increased might be an interesting research topic , but it s not everything as for politics , mr woo is not particularly impressed by the degree of freedom in the society that imprisoned him for 40 years for a determined korean nationalist like mr woo , the crucial issue is whether a country is selfsufficient and can stand on its own and there he finds north korea does better we have lost our selfreliance here , he added , referring to south korea economically , politically and militarily , the level of dependence on the outside has increased south korea , as a vibrant democracy whose president , kim dae jung , is himself a longtime dissident , may seem like an odd place to have held the world s longestserving political prisoner but south korea somehow manages to be deeply authoritarian as well as vigorously democratic , and there is strong public support for repressive laws that punish anyone who praises the enemy in the north minkahyup , a leading human rights group , says south korea still has more than 200 political prisoners the longestserving political prisoner now that mr woo has been released is sohn song mo , 70 , who has been imprisoned for 18 years president kim dae jung has been honored with human rights awards and touted as a 'human rights president , ' said nam kyu sun , the secretary general of minkahyup but such things do n't make a 'human rights president' the way for mr kim to really earn the title , mrs nam said , would be to ease the national security law that punishes communist sympathizers and to curtail the security organizations that now run around seizing people who praise north korea although mr woo came to be renowned as a political prisoner , he started his prison career as an ordinary spy he was commander of a boat that was gathering intelligence on south korea s coast when he and his comrades were captured in july 1958 but such intruders were quickly released if they agreed to denounce north korea and cooperate with the south , and indeed some of mr woo s companions were freed in this way even terrorists who blew up a south korean airliner and attacked the presidential mansion were pardoned after switching sides , and no one doubts that mr woo would have been freed as well if he had not stubbornly clung to his faith in the north day after day , the torturers battered mr woo , trying to force him to sign a statement denouncing north korea he lost his teeth to the torture now he is outfitted with dentures and he says his best times in those decades were the moments when he felt himself fainting from the pain it was such a peaceful feeling , he recalled i was so comfortable the most unbearable thing was watching my friends dying of the torture , one by one , he said , adding that 12 of his companions died that way the worst heartache , he said , was when a childhood friend , choi seok ki , was stomped to death in his prison cell for refusing to renounce north korea when mr woo left on his mission , he had a wife and a 4yearold son in north korea , and he says the knowledge that they were safe was an enormous comfort to him the thought that my child would remember me as a father who went missing while fighting for reunification was a source of great strength to me , he recalled north korea and south korea have talked publicly about exchanging prisoners , so that mr woo could go home and see his family again although he has no word on whether they are still alive but those talks quickly broke down , and so mr woo remains stuck in south korea he is trying to make the most of it by taking his computer classes and trying to acquire skills that might help him get a job in some charitable organization but he has a lot to catch up on , for until his release he had never done something so simple as ride a subway or make a telephone call things that are common knowledge to other people are all new to me , he said with a laugh i 've made some phone calls , now , but i'm still really bad at speaking on the telephone photo freed by south korea after 40 years , woo yong gak worked a vending machine for the first time on a seoul street he was known in human rights circles as the world s longest serving political prisoner \( nicholas d kristof

at a lecture before a recent lieder recital in irvine , calif , graham johnson made a case for balkanizing schubert , after a fashion mr johnson , a piano accompanist , scholar and teacher based in london , suggested that the six songs schubert wrote to texts by heine included in the posthumous song cycle schwanengesang be split off and viewed as a freestanding work the idea is vintage johnson , unconventional yet compelling the next day , during a talk to students at the university of california , irvine , mr johnson suggested that heine be seen in an altogether new light , as a 19thcentury jackie mason he cited the poet s quick wit , persecution complex and pentup anger it was an iconoclastic but thoughtprovoking perspective , in a way persuasive tomorrow , at the juilliard school , mr johnson begins a series of five master classes for singers and accompanists focusing on german song it is unfortunate that the classes are not open to the public , for the 48yearold mr johnson has an engaging teaching method , which marries wit with erudition his attractive , intelligent pianism is another strength , and his knowledge of song literature is vast in any given program he is likely to be more familiar with the songs than the singer is his discography as an accompanist is huge \( he has never recorded solo repertory \) he made his first studio album in 1978 , and he reckons that his catalogue numbers between 75 and 80 disks although mr johnson has accompanied such outstanding vocalists as elisabeth schwarzkopf , peter pears , victoria de los angeles and jessye norman , his most celebrated musical relationship is with hyperion , a small , critically acclaimed english record label he made his first hyperion disk , voices of the night , an album of schumann and brahms lieder , in 1980 his bestknown project is hyperion s vaunted schubert edition , which began in 1987 and is expected to be completed next year it will comprise 37 cd s and include every known song of schubert , some 700 items in all about 40 singers are attached to the endeavor , all accompanied by mr johnson the impetus for the project came abruptly , according to ted perry , the founder and managing director of hyperion it was a bold idea mooted by graham over dinner in a japanese restaurant and sealed with a drink , mr perry said what could not have been foreseen then , or even in the early years of the venture , was its future value as a comprehensive resource of late20thcentury schubert interpretation intended to feature only english vocalists , the project expanded to embrace artists from the continent and america as well as it stands , three generations of singers have left their mark on mr johnson s vast opus , including janet baker , elly ameling , peter schreier , brigitte fassbaender , lucia popp , thomas allen , felicity lott , thomas hampson , christine schafer , ian bostridge and matthias goerne even the great baritone dietrich fischerdieskau has been peripherally involved , as a reader on mr bostridge s schone mullerin cd a nice linkage , for mr fischerdieskau recorded nearly all of schubert s songs three decades ago with the esteemed accompanist gerald moore , one of mr johnson s teachers mr johnson likes to think of schubert as a shakespearean character , meaning that the composer s works embrace a broad spectrum of emotions and invite a wide variety of interpretations schubert does n't belong to any one person , he said born in rhodesia \( now zimbabwe \) to a father who played piano and saxophone , mr johnson received early training in music my dad was highly musical and my mother highly neurotic , so i'm both musical and neurotic , he said with a smile he became an avid record collector as a young man and developed a love for song he was obsessed by poetry and literature and had an interest in acting , he said , but his parents , fearing that he would meet undesirable people , put a stop to his budding stage career in 1967 , at 17 , he journeyed to the royal academy of music in london for serious study he was n't cut out for a solo career , he said , because that requires a narcissistic level of selfabsorption i do n't have instead , he gravitated toward chamber music and the song literature , which he found much more fun for mr johnson , the complexity of vocal music proved irresistible songs do n't have one creator , he explained they have two you have a melding of biographical contexts , and it s the combination of experience that makes a song the great song composers of the 19th and 20th centuries , he notes , were all pianists and often accompanists except for carl loewe and samuel barber , none of them sang when i saw britten play schubert , he became schubert , mr johnson said it was an act of transubstantiation the greatest thing that can be said to me is , 'you play like the composer' mr johnson also happens to like singers they 're more lively and controversial than violinists , he said , even though he considers singers often less skilled as absolute musicians they 're selling themselves , not an instrument of the singers he has actually heard perform , his favorite remains pears , whom he calls the greatest artist i 've ever heard live , and the greatest musical influence of my life
salzburg , austria the 1999 salzburg festival was shrouded in scandal the shock did not come from any of the festival stages , which have indeed been more inclined to turn heads in the last seven years , since gerard mortier became director in 1992 with mixed success and to mixed acclaim , mr mortier , who succeeded the salzburgborn conductor herbert von karajan after his death in 1989 , has sought to dekarajanize the festival by making it more cosmopolitan and more contemporary mr mortier has added messiaen to mozart , and playwrights like the iconoclastic elfriede jelinek to such stalwarts as hugo von hofmannsthal , who was also the festival s principal founder mr mortier s innovations are not news the shock this past season came from a declaration of war against mr mortier and the festival s new profile , delivered at the opening ceremonies by none other than the president of austria , thomas klestil why such an attack from the austrian president \? why salzburg \? why now \? mr klestil was elected president in 1992 , succeeding kurt waldheim the job is largely ceremonial but not entirely first , the head of state carries a symbolic identification with the country itself thus , the debates over mr waldheim s suppressed nazi past became synonymous with the question of austria s unresolved nazi past second , mr klestil , like mr waldheim before him , functions as a kind of metarepresentative of the conservative people s party although the socialist party has held onto the chancellorship for 30 years , the two parties have governed in a grand coalition since 1986 with the reconfiguration of eastern europe after 1989 , the people s party s hold on austrian conservatism has been challenged from the far right by the freedom party , an antiimmigration faction much like the national front in france but in austria , a country with a fascist past , this party s neofascist rhetoric cuts swiftly to the bone during the summer , the most pressing question on the level of national politics was whether the people s party would consider a coalition with the freedom party as a way to wrest the government from the socialists \( that possibility seems to be ruled out by the people s party s thirdplace performance in elections this month \) mr klestil s culture wars speech at the opening of the festival in july was clearly a campaign event mr klestil called for a return of the festival to the ideals of its spiritual founder , hofmannsthal in 1918 , at the moment of austrian defeat in world war i and the collapse of the hapsburg empire , hofmannsthal sought a new symbol for austrian identity and prominence in europe the city of salzburg as he wrote and as mr klestil quoted at length in his speech lies at the geographical center of europe this is true enough salzburg also lies , hofmannsthal wrote , at the spiritual center of europe this is a far more problematic assertion , since the culture of salzburg is german , and roman catholic , and historically intolerant of people who are not both the new cultural identity that hofmannsthal promoted thus claimed to be cosmopolitan but was in fact a german catholic culture hofmannsthal sanctified this very ambiguity by writing a new version of the english morality play everyman jedermann , which opened the first festival , on a stage built in front of the salzburg cathedral , in 1920 , has , with a few significant exceptions , opened the season every year since and will do so again in 2000 a mirror of austrian political conservatism , hofmannsthal s jedermann claims to speak for everyone but actually speaks for germanspeaking catholics mr klestil stated explicitly that nothing has changed between 1919 and 1999 , wrapping himself in hofmannsthal s key ambiguity cultural nationalism disguised as cultural cosmopolitanism to his invocation of an unchanging austria , he added the dates before 1938 and again after 1945 , expelling the period of nazi rule from austrian history \( in fact , the 1938 incorporation of austria into the third reich was wildly popular , and seemed to a vast majority of austrian citizens to have accomplished an alliance between catholic conservatism and modern power the city of salzburg was staunchly pronazi there were , of course , exceptions the governor of the province of salzburg , franz rehrl , spent most of the period in prison hofmannsthal died in 1929 , but his jewish grandfather caused him to be classified as nonaryan according to the 1935 nuremberg laws his name and work were absent from the festival during the nazi years \) critics of the festival ideology , mr klestil went on to say , not pulling his antimortier punches , insist on a democratic understanding of culture , and that means confrontation instead of harmony , provocation instead of agreement , spectacle instead of fidelity to the work , 'demolition drama' instead of humanistic , spiritually elevating theater mr mortier reacted furiously first he wrote mr klestil a personal letter , which went unanswered then he gave press interviews he branded the speech a campaign act and told the austrian newsmagazine format that mr klestil s position was closest to that of the freedom party this is not only about me but about the situation of culture in austria , mr mortier said this speech is a signal
our constitution , envy of the world , is made of currency too valuable to be spent reinforcing preconceived conclusions yet both sides in the gun control debate have done just that with the second amendment partly as a result , we have reached an impasse the housesenate committee addressing the issue remains deadlocked , as the white house acknowledged this week most advocates of gun control have argued that the right to bear arms can reach no further than the second amendment s preamble , which calls a wellregulated militia necessary to the security of a free state they conclude that the amendment shields only state militias like today s national guard from federal authority according to these people , the rights of individuals to selfdefense or to private gun ownership are not constitutionally protected at all but the second amendment reference to the people s right to be armed cannot be trumped by the amendment s preamble besides , the 14th amendment , which makes parts of the bill of rights applicable to the states , reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms was a privilege of each citizen those on the other side have been even more intransigent opposing controls of any kind , with the possible exception of laws keeping convicted felons from acquiring guns the gun lobby has argued that second amendment clearly protects the right of the people to keep and bear arms , which they regard as giving every citizen a nearly absolute right to own guns for private pursuits like hunting and target shooting the truth is more complicated almost no right known to the constitution is absolute and unlimited not even the rights of free speech and religious exercise thus , it has been a terrible mistake for both sides in the gun control controversy to insist that the second amendment bans virtually everything or virtually nothing the fact is , almost none of the proposed state or federal weapons regulations appears to come close to offending the second amendment s core right to selfprotection the right to bear arms is certainly subject to reasonable regulation in the interest of public safety laws that ban certain types of weapons , that require safety devices on others and that otherwise impose strict controls on guns can pass constitutional scrutiny it is often argued that any regulation of weapons , however modest and sensible , places us on an inescapably slippery slope that can only end in the confiscation of all guns in private hands this is precisely the kind of allornone thinking we should reject as a matter of constitutional logic , to uphold reasonable regulations is not to say that no right exists , or that anything goes as a matter of practical politics , a great majority of americans seems to favor reasonable regulations but oppose wholesale confiscation if guncontrol advocates conceded that some regulations might indeed go farther than the constitution permits , they might earn the confidence of those who are frightened that the second amendment will otherwise be reduced to a cipher conversely , gun control critics would have greater credibility if they dropped their insistence that virtually no restrictions are permissible sometimes , the truth both constitutionally and democratically lies at neither extreme
franz xaver ohnesorg , a widely admired german arts executive , has been named executive and artistic director of carnegie hall , officials announced yesterday mr ohnesorg succeeds judith arron , who died on dec 18 and had run the hall since 1986 the appointment was ratified tuesday afternoon in a unanimous vote by carnegie hall s board , said sanford i weill , the chairman he is one person she respected above all others in the profession , mr weill said of mr ohnesorg in an interview before the news conference we felt as though judy was telling us what to do he has the vitality and imagination that are necessary to build on the work that she did here mr ohnesorg \( pronounced ohnuhzorg \) , 51 , has been director of 2 , 200seat cologne philharmonic hall in germany since 1983 in that position he has presented about 400 concerts a year , in a season that resembles carnegie s in that it includes visits by international orchestras and recitalists , as well as jazz performances he has also been active in promoting contemporary music , having commissioned 140 works , on his own and in partnerships , over the last 15 years at carnegie , mr ohnesorg will oversee 550 to 600 concerts a year in the main hall and weill recital hall , and programming in the new arthur and judy zankel hall , which opens during the 20012 season his contract is to run two years , beginning in september , but will have an evergreen clause that allows for automatic renewal he will also become a member of the board the most surprising element of the appointment was that with so many accomplished american arts executives to choose from , the most famous concert hall in the united states selected a european ms arron had come to carnegie from the cincinnati symphony , and has been credited with transforming the hall by expanding its educational activities and making new music a larger part of the hall s mission isaac stern , the president of carnegie hall , said he and mr weill had spent the last month in an assiduous search that included discussing the post with eight or 10 other candidates , but that they considered mr ohnesorg to be ms arron s handpicked successor in 1996 , after cancer was diagnosed in ms arron , she invited mr ohnesorg to join the staff as her partner , partly in the hope of guaranteeing a smooth succession mr ohnesorg was unable to accept the position then , but a week before her death , ms arron asked him to reconsider mr ohnesorg said that friends in the american orchestral world had given him an appreciation of american culture he has adopted one decidedly american idea in cologne like many european organizations , his hall faced a loss of government support , with no tradition of philanthropy to compensate mr ohnesorg persuaded european companies to underwrite 20 percent of his hall s budget his experience overseeing the planning and construction of the cologne hall , which opened in 1986 , was also appealing to carnegie he will have a similar task with zankel hall , and a free hand in shaping that hall s programming , none of which has been planned the schedule for the coming season and much of the 20001 season in the main hall and weill recital hall is already in place mr ohnesorg s stamp will not be evident until the next season it is far too early to speak about details , he said this is the most vibrant and intact organization i can imagine , and if i find things i would like to change , i will speak to the staff and the board about them he said he expected to keep carnegie s artistic staff in place i ca n't be , and do n't want to be , a copy of judy arron , he said i have to find my own way but she left a great heritage mr ohnesorg his name means without worry in german was born in weilheim , in bavaria he was trained as a flutist but also earned a degree in management from the university of munich he worked as a freelance journalist before taking his first music management job , as a touring manager for the conductor karl richter and the violinist gidon kremer from 1979 until he took his cologne post , he was the managing director of the munich philharmonic my only mixed feeling , mr ohnesorg said , is that i have to go back this afternoon to explain to my own team , which i assembled over the last 15 years , why i have to come to new york photo franz xaver ohnesorg will take over as executive director in september \( sara krulwich the new york times \)
fordham bills itself as new york city s jesuit university but apart from a courtyard statue of mary and jesus and handsome stainedglass windows in a student lounge on its rose hill campus in the bronx , there are few outward signs of fordham s roman catholic identity mass is not required there are no crucifixes in the classrooms the faculty of more than 500 includes only 37 jesuits and although the university s president is a jesuit , the chairman of the board , the chairwoman of the theology department and the faculty chairman are not even catholics from notre dame to georgetown , most catholic colleges and universities operate similarly as secular institutions that make only a respectful nod to catholic traditions in their mission statements but a committee of american bishops , in response to a vatican request , has proposed standards that would make catholic colleges and universities more answerable to the church a move that alarms many catholic scholars and teachers , who fear their autonomy and academic freedom are being threatened at a meeting in washington this week , the association of catholic colleges and universities discussed ideas for a counterproposal that they would present to the committee by may the full national conference of bishops is expected to vote on the issue later this year since the bishops have no direct control over most of the universities , they would have to rely on moral suasion and the institutions' reluctance to antagonize the church to persuade universities and their trustees to go along none of these catholic colleges wants to throw away its catholic identity , said the rev thomas j reese , editor of america , the weekly jesuit journal of opinion but if these guidelines were adopted , the colleges would be put between a rock and a hard place three of the bishops' standards in particular have caused concern among educators one calls for university presidents to be faithful catholics and for new presidents to make a profession of faith and take an oath of fidelity to the church a second calls for theology professors , who are subject to the same criteria for hiring and promotion as other academic appointees , to be approved by church officials the last requirement directs colleges and universities to try to fill a majority of the positions on faculties and boards of trustees with faithful catholics to many catholic educators , these proposals , which are being called norms , are blind to the realities of american higher education they would handicap them in recruiting faculty members and students and in receiving government money , and they raise legal concerns this will marginalize our institutions , said the rev joseph a o'hare , president of fordham in an article in the jan 30 issue of america , the rev edward a malloy , president of the university of notre dame , and j donald monan , chancellor of boston college , found the proposals profoundly detrimental to catholic higher education in an earlier issue , the magazine called them unworkable and dangerous not everyone sees the proposals as a threat the rev james j conn , a dean and professor of canon law at st mary s seminary and university in baltimore , said the concepts already existed in the church s canon law and were entirely appropriate there was not a whole lot of attention being paid to them , he said now we 're saying that they are not going to go away the rev david m o'connell , president of the catholic university of america in washington , says the proposals will not destroy academic freedom or institutional autonomy i do believe that the church should clearly be involved in the institutions that exist under its sponsorship , said father o'connell , whose university is the only national university of the roman catholic church in the united states catholic colleges in the united states were pulled into a secular orbit decades ago , partly because of the need for government money as well as the less religious nature of american culture itself the distance widened in the 1960 s , spurred by the freer spirit promoted by the second vatican council and by the shrinking participation in religious orders , which forced colleges once run by the clergy to look increasingly to laymen , even noncatholics the pressure to reverse these trends comes from pope john paul ii , who has sought to reassert the church s primacy in many spheres and to step back from vatican ii in 1990 , the pope spelled out his vision in a paper entitled ex corde ecclesiae , or from the heart of the church , where , he said , universities were born he acknowledged cultural and legal differences around the world , but left details to be worked out region by region american church and university leaders have tried three times to spell out specific norms for catholic colleges and universities a first attempt was deemed overly binding a second draft was approved by the national conference of catholic bishops in 1995 by a vote of 224 to 6 it affirmed respect for church authority but called for institutional autonomy and academic freedom
when jake shulmanment walks down the halls of his suburban high school , he sometimes hears , hey , klezmer boy ! he does n't know if it s a shout of derision or a friendly greeting but he could n't care less for two years , ever since he started studying klezmer for his bar mitzvah , he has been just that , a musician who feels connected to this eastern european folk music so much so that jake , a classically trained violinist , recruited three other teenage musicians to found the klezminors for 18 months , the quartet has been playing regularly throughout the new york metropolitan area today , it appears at the 15th annual international jewish arts festival of long island at the suffolk yjcc on hauppauge road in commack the klezminors are said to be the youngest such band in the united states , but the teenagers fit right into this year s festival , today and tomorrow it has a decidedly youthful look , meant to introduce the audience to what the festival s director , rea jacobs , called the next generation of traditional performers some of them are following their family traditions , adding another generation to what might be called the family business , she said others have discovered a previously unknown part of jewish culture and are attracted enough to it to start mastering it mr shulmanment , who lives in hastingsonhudson , westchester county , knew nothing about klezmer until he began preparing for his bar mitzvah at the west side yiddish school in manhattan almost immediately , he realized that although he considered himself a completely secular jew , he found that klezmer connects to my past and is a big part of where i come from , and , of course , is just great music , he said he began taking lesons from alicia svigals , the violinist with the klezmatics , an acclaimed contemporary band through living traditions , a manhattanbased jewish cultural organization , he met aaron kushner of new rochelle , a 15yearold saxophonist and guitarist who , equally moved by the music , was already playing the klezmer in which his father , sy kushner , a wellknown accordionist , specializes they recruited josh stober , 15 , a bass player , and sara wolkowitz , 16 , a pianist , both from hastingsonhudson , who also found the music , which was new to them , exciting and the klezminors was born we get a lot more support from people in my parents' generation , mr shulmanment said but the more our friends hear it , the more they see it s not boring , but is exciting adam amram , on the other hand , grew up surrounded by ethnic music a 15yearold percussionist , pianist and harmonica player , he will be performing with his father , the composer and conductor david amram , on both days of the festival adam will play the dumbek , a middle eastern ceramic drum , in a concert tracing the roots of jewish music drums in a symphonic rendition of many voices one heart music of jewish composers , and the harmonica with the david amram jazz trio it s very jewish , the notion of teaching by doing , said david amram , who lives in putnam valley , westchester county , but has participated in all the jewish arts festivals on the island by your actions you are known you know , walking the walk as well as talking the talk adam has been at every one of those festivals , first as an infant and lately as a performer it s always been my dream to be a professional musician play with dad until i'm ready to go out on my own , he said i like the jazz and blues especially , but the jewish music is great , too , and i enjoy playing it , knowing about it in many ways , it s the roots of all music similarly , jordan brand , a 21yearold guitarist , will join his father , the veteran folk singer oscar brand , tomorrow one of the programs will trace the brand family s arrival on the canadian frontier from russia and england jordan is more into rock these days , said mr brand , who lives in great neck and he has his own rock band at harvard but he still enjoys doing the folk especially the jewish folk material with me svetlana katayeva , 14 , is also following in family footsteps her greatgreatgrandmother was a court dancer for the emir of bukhara , and subsequent generations of the family have all performed the music and dances of jews from asian areas the former soviet union that are now independent republics like tajikistan and uzbekistan when the family immigrated to the united states , it brought its traditions along and , joining other emigres who settled in queens , eventually formed maqam , an ensemble that performs music and dance forty girls are being trained to be the next generation , and four of them , including svetlana , are to perform today you do n't have to be jewish to to be fascinated by the circus at the jewish center of kings highway in brooklyn , where the new way circus center is based , being russian is enough these days , especially if you are one of the 20 youngsters from 4 to 16 on the roster of the russianamerican kids circus , which will be at the festival both days , performing and conducting participatory workshops founded in 1995 by alex berenchtein , a former star of

these new circus artists his mother read about the program in a russianlanguage newspaper and thought it might help her short , shy son after four years at the center , mr bokhman has become a principal acrobat who has learned that if you want to do something in life and work hard , you can get it i found my point in my life , a way to express myself , and the circus will always be in my heart , he said but god forbid , in case i break a knee or a hand , i'm going to college to be a doctor in addition to the young performers and their related elders , the festival includes the

one insight into why ken griffey jr was not traded during the general managers' meetings in dana point , calif , this week comes from examining the asking price the seattle mariners , the moving party , asked the atlanta braves for andruw jones , kevin millwood and ryan klesko , an executive of another club said yesterday he said the braves , who had been the favorite before the meetings to win the griffey sweepstakes , replied with a polite no , thank you , pronounced themselves out of it and went about their business jones is understandable he would replace griffey in center field in seattle but millwood was the braves' most consistent starting pitcher this year and , at 24 , is also their youngest , and klesko was their primary first baseman thus , the braves' reaction was similar to that of the cincinnati reds , whose general manager , jim bowden , tried diligently this week to find the right combination but could not induce pat gillick to say yes brian cashman , the yankees' general manager , took an early flight home from california yesterday , but he did not depart without having spoken with gillick , the mariners' general manager they talked wednesday evening at the general managers' cocktail hour one member of the yankees' organization called it a factfinding mission whether or not the yankees have interest in griffey , cashman made sure to know where the mariners stood , in case his boss called and asked cashman s penchant for selfpreservation prompts him to do his homework so that if the teacher asks , he does not have to say the dog ate it the mets , the reds , st louis and houston are the only teams that have acknowledged talking to the mariners about griffey , but a baseball official said yesterday that he understood two others were involved boston and san francisco hentgen goes to cardinals in the third and final trade made at the meetings , the toronto blue jays showed yesterday how far the value of a former cy young award winner had plunged they traded pat hentgen to the st louis cardinals and added a second pitcher , paul spoljaric , for a package of three players , none a frontliner the blue jays received lance painter , a journeyman relief pitcher alberto castillo , a backup catcher , and matt dewitt , a minor league pitcher hentgen won the cy young as a 20game winner in 1996 , edging the yankees' andy pettitte , a 21game winner but hentgen has won 38 games in the three seasons since , falling to an 1112 record this year at that rate , the blue jays did not want to wait to find out what the 31yearold hentgen might do for them next year with a 6 million salary and another 600 , 000 guaranteed if they did not exercise an option for 2001 these things are very difficult , gord ash , the toronto general manager , said in dana point he s been in the organization for a number of years i was there with him when he started we talked for quite a while yesterday he understands that business is business hentgen greeted the traded with mixed feelings part of me is sad , but part of me is excited , he said in a conference call whether it was business or personality or overall performance , the jays thought it was the right move the cardinals have been scouring the major leagues for starting pitching they talked to colorado about darryl kile and may still acquire ismael valdes from los angeles in spoljaric , they get a 27yearold lefthander who has been primarily a reliever but can start if necessary he had a 22 record and 465 earned run average in 35 relief appearances and two starts for the blue jays this year walt jocketty , the st louis general manager , said he previously tried to get hentgen we followed him a lot last year , jocketty said i think he had some arm trouble a couple years ago and he s coming back from that really , the second half of last year , he pitched very well we think he should be fine , plus changing leagues i think will be a big asset for him boggs retires with 3 , 010 hits wade boggs is the most recent player to reach 3 , 000 hits , and now he is the most recent 3 , 000hit player to retire after 18 years , boggs put aside his tampa bay uniform yesterday for a job in the devil rays' front office in which he will scout and evaluate young players it was n't an easy decision , boggs said at a news conference in st petersburg , fla , because an athlete can always look in the mirror and say ok , i can still play deep down inside , probably i thought i still could but why not go out out on top \? i 've always said , 'i 'll never embarrass myself in this game' boggs finishes his career with 3 , 010 hits when he reached 3 , 000 on aug 7 , he became the only one of 23 players to do it with a home run only 118 of his hits were home runs although he played a careerlow 90 games last season , he batted 301 , marking the 15th season he finished with a 300 batting average he won six american league batting titles and is the only player in this century with seven successive 200hit seasons he played his first 11 seasons with boston , the next five with the yankees and the last two with the devil rays in his hometown boggs spoke yesterday of the amazing ride he had as a player but it was another ride for which he will be remembered in new york after the yankees won the 1996 world series , boggs took a ride around the perimeter of the field at yankee stadium on a police horse boston s williams honored without mo vaughn , whom they let leave as a free agent a year ago , the red sox were expected to fire popguns instead of bazookas and finish well down in the standing this season but they won the american league wildcard spot for his role in the red sox success , jimy williams was named al manager of the year the 28member panel of the baseball writers association of america gave williams 20 firstplace votes and a total of 115 points art howe of oakland finished second with 5 and 85 , joe torre of the yankees third with 21 points , johnny oates of texas fourth with 1 and 18 and mike hargrove of cleveland fifth with 2 and 13 we were n't trying to replace mo , williams said during a conference call maybe some other players could step up and do a little more here and a little more there basically that s what happened photo pat hentgen , who won 38 games for the blue jays in three seasons after receiving the cy young award , was traded to the cardinals yesterday \( associated press \)
sheffield , mass , june 27 no one pretended that what we were doing was art , sings the director mack sennett , looking back on the pioneer days of silent film comedy in the musical mack and mabel you can imagine the show s composer and lyricist , jerry herman , saying much the same thing about his own career the sennett of mack and mabel wants nothing more nor less than to make the world laugh mr herman , the songwriter of such popular shows as hello , dolly ! and mame , has often suggested that he just wants to make the world feel good , to leave audiences happily humming there is no question that mr herman has often achieved just that who does n't have the title song of hello , dolly ! playing brassily in some corner of his memory \? and after a recent performance of the revival of mack and mabel by the barrington stage company here , the parking lot was filled with the sound of departing theatergoers buzzing away with fragments of the show s score yet mack and mabel , the story of sennett s stormy love affair with his favorite star , mabel normand , is n't just another oldfashioned musical and therein lie the problems that have thwarted it since it was first seen on broadway 25 years ago , in a production with robert preston and bernadette peters that is fondly remembered by theater cultists mr herman may see himself as one of the last of the strawhat entertainers in a musical world shaped by the intellectual moodiness of stephen sondheim and his many heirs \( it s worth remarking that mr herman s sennett character says he leaves sweeping beauty and grandeur to d w griffith \) but there is a wide dark streak in mack and mabel , a vein of shadowy complexity that rubs against the bright razzmatazz of mr herman s natural style this tension inspired the composer to write some of his best work , including the torch ballad time heals everything and the haunting antilove song i wo n't send roses at the same time , the show , which has repeatedly died and been reborn and was seen in an awardwinning london production in 1995 , is imbued with an odd , brooding quality that directors have n't been able to accommodate julianne boyd , who oversees the current interpretation , is no exception mack and mabel shimmers with appetizing musical moments , especially from its stars , jeff mccarthy and kelli rabke but it keeps undercutting the upbeat vigor of its showbiz anthems and for a work about creating comedy , it is almost never funny mack and mabel has been in a constant state of revision since its birth on broadway under gower champion s direction the original book by michael stewart \( bye bye birdie , hello , dolly ! \) , who died in 1987 , has been extensively retooled by francine pascal , mr stewart s sister , to enhance the central love story and to soften the tragedy of normand s later career none of this has brought mack and mabel into a state of harmony its persistent imbalance starts with the show s title characters mack comes across as a full and compelling figure , an intense , bizarrely humorless workaholic mabel , on the other hand , is from the more classic mold of the musical ingenue , spunky but sweet , and the spectacle of her being beaten up by life as she is here feels unseemly it s like watching a street gang attack marian the librarian accordingly , this production s greatest value is as a showcase for mr mccarthy , who was seen to good advantage on broadway in the shortlived side show and who here feasts on his harddriven , harddriving character mr mccarthy has a firm , nicely shaded baritone and a springy physical agility , and it s intriguing that his mack is on the somber side still , when his character sings a paean to slapstick called hit 'em on the head , it s sinister in ways that mr herman surely never intended \( lash 'em in the loin , grind 'em in the groin audiences find that pain is so amusing \) you wonder what a nice girl like mabel is doing with this cinematic sade , for ms rabke s mabel is unquestionably a nice girl with a nice voice and not much more than that there s not a breath of the quirky wildness you can still sense in normand s films in fairness to ms rabke , it is almost impossible to translate the charisma projected through silent movies into the joyous noise of the musical ms boyd s staging encounters similar problems as she tries to recreate vintage sennett sequences the show abounds , in strained ways , in eureka moments , with mack s stumbling onto ideas for pie fights , keystone kops and his fabled bathing beauties yet there s no exhilaration to these sequences , enacted against kenneth foy s handsome , multipurpose set and choreographed by hope clarke the show s most effective dance number , nicely led by kathryn kendall as a goldhearted old pro of a performer , is called tapping your blues away it is also deliberately cynical in its counterpoint of conventional musical cheer and creepy images of tabloid prurience and hollywood decadence when you slide from that into the shoehorned sentimentality of the revamped conclusion , you feel like murmuring , oh , give me a break there is such novel , dramatic urgency in mr herman s score , starting with his galloping overture , that you can see why so many people in the theater have been reluctant to consign this musical to the scrapheap but after a quartercentury to grow up , mack and mabel still has n't decided what it wants to be mack and mabel based on the true love story of mack sennett and mabel normand and the movies music and lyrics by jerry herman book by michael stewart book revised by francine pascal directed by julianne boyd musical director , darren r cohen choreography by hope clarke sets by kenneth foy costumes by jeffrey fender lighting by jason kantrowitz sound by jim van bergen production stage manager , renee lutz presented by barrington stage company , ms boyd , artistic director irit granger , managing director , in association with jon wilner at the consolati performing arts center , sheffield , mass with jeff mccarthy , kelli rabke , will erat , kathryn kendall , robert anderson , michael j farina , peter kapetan and rick stoneback photo jeff mccarthy as mack sennett , who directed silent films , and kelli rabke as mabel normand , a movie star who was also sennett s lover \( richard feldman mack and mabel \)

micheal ray richardson s voice sounded light and upbeat the indomitable sugar sounded happy as he spoke of life after the nba in europe you could hear his 3yearold daughter , kimberly , and richardson s wife , ilham , in the background at 44 , life is good it s a great life here , he said it s really laid back , not a whole lot of crime not the driveby shootings , not the drug and alcohol problems there is drugs and alcohol everywhere , but over here it s safer richardson and his wife , a native of morocco , have been together for five years they live in antibes on the french riviera , but he plays in italy with livorno of the italian league richardson is heavier at 195 pounds , and plays 20 minutes a game he studies the national basketball association at a distance , and is aware of players and their issues he knows about stephon marbury s travails with the nets marbury is a great player , he said , but you ca n't have a point guard shooting 25 or 30 times a game and expect for your team to win at the same time , richardson said he understands marbury s mindset as a young kid , he said , you do n't want to hear anything , so what you have to do , you have to take your bumps and bruises i took mine in 1986 richardson earned the distinction of being the first player kicked out of the nba under the provision of an antidrug agreement between the league and the players association he applied for readmittance in 1988 and was cleared in 1991 i was the first guy out and the first guy in , he said but by then he was playing in europe , and he never returned to the nba thirteen years after being banned , richardson s tumultuous life in the nba is the subject of a documentary being produced by nba entertainment for tnt a decade ago , the notion of having a documentary done on his life , much less one produced by the nba , seemed out of the question the idea came about in 1997 , when richardson saw david stern , the league s commissioner , in paris at the mcdonald s open at intermission , he approached stern , whom he had not seen since he was kicked out of the league i did n't know if he thought i had bad feelings or what , richardson said but i walked up to him and i thanked him for help saving my life he was a part of it , because he made me open up my eyes richardson has n't seen any of the documentary , which will be televised on feb 16 , but acknowledges that he never thought his life would be the subject of one i really did n't , he said because of so many other problems and issues in the world i thought i was just another guy there were a lot of guys who went through the league who had problems with drugs i guess none of them with an ending like mine few players have had a basketball life like his , beginning on june 9 , 1978 , when the knicks told stunned fans they had selected an unknown player out of the university of montana named micheal ray richardson richardson became one of the more exciting players in knick history richardson was magic in the pros , even before magic got there he was a point guard shooting guard small forward his style was distinguished by kamikazelike drives tempered by good outside shooting and passing richardson was the symbolic bridge between the old nba of the late 1970 s , with its pronounced black presence and raw , uncut urban style , and the new nba with magic johnson and larry bird the old carried an image of a league infested with drugs the new was clean , wholesome and colorless richardson was a star who became an addict , part of a lost generation of players who performed on the nba s high wire before there was a net richardson ran the fast break into an abyss of every imaginable excess i was like a kid in a candy store , he said i guess i was really too young i had n't really matured yet it takes different people different time in his final season with the knicks , when they were going bad and there were rumors he would be traded , richardson told a reporter that the ship be sinkin' the phrase became part of an underground nomenclature in new york sports to describe disaster the phrase easily described richardson s personal life what happened to his career is what happens with cocaine intense , high highs , followed by sharp lows richardson said his drug problems began in 1982 , after he was traded to golden state for bernard king i just could n't deal with it , he said i had never used drugs when i was with the knicks richardson was traded to the nets in 1983 the trade set the stage for a very public fouryear war with cocaine he was suspended , reinstated , suspended , reinstated each time brought pronouncements of being cured from 1983 to 1986 , when he was banned from the league , richardson was living the addict s life jiving , lying , conniving it took me five or six years to come to grips that it really was a problem , he said , referring to his drug use it s really difficult for someone to understand it if you 've never experienced it in life , everybody has problems of some kind my problems at the time was drugs after a while , i accepted that and i guess that s why i'm doing so well , because i finally realized that there was something in the world that was stronger than me part of his problem , he said , was that he felt invincible he was a threetime allstar and twotime member of the league s alldefensive squad , but he said it s like i was 'there , ' i could n't get any higher i could n't move up any more at the time , i was really content in 1988 , richardson reapplied for readmission that same year he followed bob hill , a knicks assistant when he played with the team , to italy where they won the italian cup hill returned to coach again in the nba , richardson stayed he felt roots he felt grounded still , he finds himself thinking , more often than he likes , what if \? at least i had time to get myself together , he said but sometimes i sit and think and wonder , 'where would i be if i never would have got involved in drugs \? ' who knows \? who cares \? the ship is afloat photo micheal ray richardson with his daughter kimberly in livorno , italy , where he plays basketball \( stefano rellandini for the new york times \)

gifts you might ponder for those people from among this year s new patents though it is conventional wisdom that most men are either boxer or brief wearers , there must be some who cannot decide which underwear they prefer for them , robert wald of toluca lake , calif , has patented boxer shorts that double as briefs the briefs are sewn inside the shorts and both are integrated with a single waistband , mr wald describes in his patent \( 5 , 978 , 971 \) the briefs cannot be seen from the outside , so the look of boxer shorts is provided with the added benefit of builtin invisible male briefs for supporting the male anatomy , he adds most women seem determined not to go out in public with curlers in their hair , but if there is a greataunt on your list who still does that , imagine her surprise when you come up with the perfect present carolyn davidson of westerville , ohio , has a patent \( 5 , 868 , 147 \) for a discreet way of wearing curlers your aunt can wrap ms davidson s fake hair strips around her rollers the hair strips have hookandloop fasteners on each end a woman \( or man or child , if that is the case \) would wrap the hair strips around rollers that are

to make the most of each workout in the time available for them , heinz klasen , a german inventor in berlin , has patented vibrating barbells his design looks like a conventional barbell , with a bar bearing weights on each end except mr klasen has added a vibrator and a dampening device in the middle of the bar mr klasen s patent \( 5 , 868 , 653 \) says that the vibrations stimulate the muscles and nerves involved in the exercise , resulting in faster muscle building with less cramping he writes that comparisons with conventional training methods show that the same results can be achieved with a time expenditure up to approximately 80 percent lower using his vibrating bar none of us may ever again hear the warning , your shoe is untied , if someone presents us with sasha and jordan meschkow s shoelace warning system instead we will hear an alarm the meschkows own a patent \( 5 , 936 , 538 \) for conductive shoelace segments hooked up to an indicator , battery and switch that are activated when the segments fail to touch the system also includes a pressure sensor , so that it can detect weight in the shoe that way , when the shoes are untied because they are not being worn ,

they need , but james conrad and michael baxter , both of mountlake terrace , wa , have invented a rake that might surprise them their patent \( 5 , 979 , 957 \) is for a rolling , magnetic rake that can pick up nails and other bits of metal from construction projects the round , wheelshaped magnets are fitted on an axle with a perpendicular handle like a conventional rake in their patent , the inventors say the magnets are arranged to project a magnetic field before , under and behind the operating head of the rake so it can sweep a swathe clean of magnetically attractable debris your

water tank , mr asskaryar writes of course , he adds , the entire system is designed to be water resistant in order to avoid electrical hazards
freedom from fear the american people in depression and war , 19291945 by david m kennedy illustrated 936 pp new york oxford university press 3995 what remains of the legacy of franklin delano roosevelt \? the office of the presidency is as weak today as it has been in decades the welfare state is in tatters even the once sacrosanct social security system is being challenged with our hostility to government regulation , our gilded age reverence for entrepreneurship and our bipartisan devotion to balanced budgets , are n't we all reaganites now \? did n't the roosevelt memorial arrive in washington about 35 years too late \? david m kennedy s freedom from fear not only gives us the chance to reflect on such questions , it also provides us with an engrossing narrative of a momentous time , the best onevolume account of the roosevelt era currently available part of the outstanding oxford history of the united states series , it is good oldfashioned history kennedy is concerned with the big political , economic and military questions , the large decisions , who made them and why dead white males predominate not that kennedy fails to consider minorities and women how could he in the years of antilynchinglaw debates and the japanese internment , of eleanor roosevelt and rosie the riveter \? but these fashionable topics are decidedly secondary to his story similarly , american culture , particularly popular culture , is all but ignored yet if kennedy has chosen to do without jack benny and mickey mouse , louis armstrong and citizen kane \( not to mention william faulkner , aaron copland and frank lloyd wright \) , he is still able to soldier along with dramatic discussions of the great depression , the new deal , the rise of the totalitarians and world war ii indeed , with event piling on historymaking event , freedom from fear is , despite its 936page length , a miracle of compression the first surprise here , especially for those raised on arthur m schlesinger jr s three volumes on the new deal , is kennedy s relatively kind treatment of herbert hoover to a degree uncommon among presidents , he says , hoover was a reflective man of scholarly bent , even something of a political philosopher he had made a reputation as a great humanitarian during world war i , and he arrived in the white house in 1929 the most respected man in america , a progressive republican who was not afraid to use the powers of government for the public good after the market crash that heralded the start of the depression , hoover pressured businessmen to refrain from cutting wages , and he pushed through a small public works bill as an effort at countercyclical government spending bolder measures like the reconstruction finance corporation , which lent taxpayers' money directly to private corporations , followed if his actions seem cautious today , it is largely because no one appreciated the depth of the crisis at first kennedy , who has a genuine talent for plunging the reader into the immediacy of the moment , writes that down to the last weeks of 1930 , americans could still plausibly assume that they were caught up in yet another of the routine businesscycle downswings that periodically afflicted their traditionally boomandbust economy their situation was painful but not unfamiliar , and their president was in any case taking unprecedentedly vigorous corrective actions kennedy , the donald j mclachlan professor of history at stanford university , paints hoover as an imaginative policy maker overwhelmed by events , in many ways a precursor to roosevelt , but often with a better grasp of the economics of the situation it s a persuasive portrait , but one that should n't be pushed too far hoover s policies were always aimed primarily at alleviating the problems of business the great humanitarian could never find it in his heart to support relief for the poor one has to turn to schlesinger to read hoover s damning recollection that many persons left their jobs for the more profitable one of selling apples , but even kennedy s summation of hoover s character goes a long way toward undermining any sympathy one might feel for the man hoover , kennedy observes , had a maddening tendency to subordinate real human needs to his obsessive desire for ideological consistency hoover s besetting sin was rigidity to the point of callousness problems of consistency , even coherence , never bothered roosevelt nobody really knew what to do about the economic disaster blanketing the country , and he was determined simply to act even if that meant going off in several directions at once kennedy is an expert guide to the alphabet soup that was the new deal the aaa , nra , pwa , wpa , ccc , cwa , tva and on and on one s eyes glaze over just looking at this flood of letters , but as kennedy recounts the stresses and strains behind the profusion of legislation , he is able to transform otherwise dry , wonkish material into genuine drama
the sweat had barely beaded around orel hershiser s nose when he slinked back to the dugout , but the blankness in the mets starter s face indicated a complete lack of understanding of how this fiasco could happen a helplessness with which his team has grown terribly familiar the end came quickly and painfully for the mets last night , much as their season appears to be headed for an abrupt and galling conclusion the atlanta braves , who began this reign of terror a week ago , came to shea stadium last night to meet the staggering mets and all but dropped an anvil on their heads with a 93 victory that made it seven losses in a row for new york , which remained a game and a half behind houston in the run for the national league wildcard spot with five games to play the astros , 41 losers to cincinnati in the astrodome , were dislodged from first place in the central division it tells you something about the quality of a game when the first spike of excitement is for an enraged relief pitcher , dennis cook of the mets , who was ejected in the eighth inning for screaming at the homeplate umpire after he was yanked by the mets before cook left the field , he carefully nudged dirt onto home plate , an act of passion and defiance the mets only wished they could replicate during play if the previous six losses were frustrating , then this one essentially decided 25 minutes after the first pitch because the offense continues to sputter was humiliating the mets looked like a team that has hopelessly lost its way and , occasionally , some of its will , too they now must hope that either cincinnati or houston , who play again tonight , falls behind them , or else the mets face an ignominious ending that will easily eclipse last year s finalweek collapse it s about time we get it done , said an exhausted looking bobby valentine they 're all saying the same thing after the game we 're tired of this with the offense slumping on the mets' debacle of a road trip , superb pitching had kept them in every game but last night , hershiser had not been on the mound long enough to even warm up hershiser has typically been good for six innings this season and in his previous 10 starts , his earned run average was 378 this time , though , hershiser , relying on his slider and leaving his pitches up , was n't good for six outs his control missing from the very beginning , he hit leadoff hitter gerald williams with the third pitch of the game and went downhill from there he left with just one out and the score 30 to a wall of boos it was the shortest outing of hershiser s 16year career , and he stayed on the bench to watch the carnage get worse the rookie octavio dotel , the reliever , threw a wild pitch on his first heave to score the fourth run of the inning when i got knocked out early , i thought i should stay on the bench and cheer and show the guys support , hershiser said in the clubhouse later but that did n't work , so i came in here so much for the theory that the braves , already the division champions , would lack motivation in this series it appears you do n't need motivation when you 're playing a team that has run out of pitching and hitting at the worst possible moment the mets' primary failure on the road trip was an absence of hitting with runners in scoring position they stranded 21 in scoring position during the six games on the road last night they went 1 for 12 a parade of seven mets relievers valentine kept pinch hitting in a desperate effort to generate something let atlanta score one run in the third but largely held the braves off until the ninth inning , when they added four runs the mets' first inning against the starter tom glavine gave no indication that they are about to snap out of their torpor valentine spoke frequently last week of the bad luck the mets had suffered the hard hits that had been line outs , the incredible plays in the field to rob the mets of momentum but that explanation did not hold up here rickey henderson , who came to the plate to scattered boos , hit a roller to second base and reached first when bret boone booted it shawon dunston laid down a perfect bunt that stopped dead just in front of the plate , freezing glavine and putting two on with none out but with the fans finally cheering again , john olerud struck out , mike piazza flied out and edgardo alfonzo struck out looking the mets finally managed one run in the sixth inning , and had another chance in the eighth but that inning was a microcosm of everything that has gone wrong for the mets the inning opened with a henderson double and dunston single , but olerud flied out , piazza grounded out to score the run and alfonzo flied out to end the inning one more run , but essentially an act of futility a fitting symbol for the mets' long spiral down the mets stranded eight , and while the top of the order henderson and dunston were a combined 5 for 10 , the heart of the order olerud , piazza and alfonzo got just one hit in 12 at bats in all , the mets had just nine hits we want to put some extended atbats together , valentine said rickey and shawon got some sharp hits and then it

toronto , july 29 the canadian auto workers union is applying extra muscle at contractbargaining time to pressure the big three auto makers into helping the union organize employees at magna international inc , one of the world s largest automotive parts suppliers basil e \( buzz \) hargrove , the canadian auto union president , put magna on the agenda last week in the opening contract talks with daimlerchrysler canada inc , general motors of canada ltd and the ford motor company of canada the auto makers and the union are seeking a new contract before the current one expires on sept 21 the canadian union wants the auto makers to intercede with magna so that the union can conduct organizing drives at magna s 55 plants in canada , which employ 17 , 000 workers none are unionized the effort reflects a fear by the canadian union about its receding influence because of the growing role of nonunion autoparts companies , which have become an important way for auto manufacturers to reduce their costs the union , which represented 80 percent of canadian parts workers in the 1970 s , now represents only about half magna , a fastgrowing 6 billion company based in aurora , ont , makes body panels , frames seats and other parts for vehicles that range from the chrysler minivan to the jaguar xk8 how the auto makers will ultimately deal with the union s magna issue is unclear but mr hargrove said that daimlerchrysler , magna s biggest customer , has been front and center in encouraging magna not to oppose certification of union locals in its plants after repeated failures , the union is again trying to organize 450 workers at a magna seating plant that supplies daimlerchrysler assembly lines in windsor , ont the canadian union has accused magna of subtle forms of intimidation union organizers say the company hires a large number of immigrants who may feel more vulnerable than canadianborn workers magna says there is no need for a union because of the fair employment policies developed by its founder and controlling shareholder , frank stronach these include a hotline so employees can raise concerns with senior management , and profitsharing and stockownership plans dennis desrosiers , a torontobased auto industry consultant , said the main reason workers in the industry joined a union today was because of incompetent management magna has some problems at its windsor seat plant , he said , but over all , this is an incredibly wellmanaged company that puts its workers at the top of the pyramid , not the bottom the union has at least two important reasons for wanting to add magna workers as members first , magna has more canadian workers than ford canada s 12 , 900 or daimlerchrysler canada s 13 , 800 only general motors canada has more 22 , 200 but that number has shrunk from 30 , 000 six years ago as its parts operations were cut back the second reason is the increasingly important role that parts suppliers play in automotive assembly suppliers like magna now combine parts to form larger pieces such as complete interiors , chassis and undercarriage units that creates more jobs in supplier plants and , ultimately , will mean fewer jobs on big three assembly lines

washington , aug 10 prominent republican candidates for president are creating an atmosphere that is subtly but fundamentally more inviting to gay and lesbian voters than party leaders have been in recent memory gov george w bush of texas , senator john mccain of arizona and elizabeth dole , former president of the american red cross who combined have the lion s share of support among republicans in early polls have all signaled an openness to gay supporters , including a willingness to appoint them to positions like ambassadorships in their administrations the new receptivity toward gay voters follows a similar nonantagonist approach by leading republicans on abortion while they still oppose abortion and are by no means converts on other gay rights issues like samesex marriage , the most prominent candidates are offering a lowerkey , more inclusive approach designed to appeal beyond the conservative base of the party to independent and democratic voters it also reflects the continued growing political influence of gay donors and gay voters across party lines the new message on gay supporters is a far cry from 1996 , when bob dole , the republican nominee , returned a 1 , 000 donation from the log cabin republicans , a group of gay party members , and from 1992 , when the dominant voice on the issue from republicans was that of patrick j buchanan , whose declaration of a culture war was aimed squarely at homosexuals many of the more conservative candidates have not changed their views , and even mr bush , senator mccain and mrs dole have not embraced a broader agenda that includes adoptions by gay people and a less punitive approach toward homosexuals in the military but gay political leaders say the difference in attitude is striking nonetheless the tone has totally changed , said rich tafel , executive director of the log cabin republicans what i hear is gay republicans enthusiastic about the tone being set by the leading candidates it looks like republicans for the first time are saying , 'this is a community i'm not going to alienate and maybe i want to reach out to it' that s kind of a shocking revelation democrats , of course , have courted gay voters for years , and this year both vice president al gore and former senator bill bradley , the two rivals for the democratic nomination , are competing for their support both campaigns have fundraisers working expressly with gay donors , who tend to be generous financially and active politically on the republican side , though , this rapprochement is new mr bush , so far the runaway favorite in the republican field , has said he would have no qualms about hiring homosexuals if someone can do a job , and a job that he s qualified for , that person ought to be allowed to do his job , he said earlier this year senator mccain , who has appointed representative jim kolbe of arizona , the only openly gay republican in the house , to his national steering committee , has similarly said he would hire on merit alone he has supported antihatecrimes legislation that would protect victims of crime not only because of their race but their sexual orientation he has said that someday he could envision a gay president mrs dole has said she would appoint to her administration anyone who was qualified , emphasizing in an nbc interview last month that all people are welcome and adding i'm inclusive of the contribution her husband spurned in 1996 , mrs dole said that if she received a check from the same group , i would not turn it away william kristol , who was chief of staff to vice president dan quayle and now is editor of the conservative weekly standard , said that the mainstream republican candidates this year were unhappy under the banner of strident , antigay language the republican establishment does not want to fight the conservative culture war , mr kristol said , partly because they think it s a losing fight but more importantly , they do n't believe in it outside the party establishment , some conservatives remain adamantly opposed to gay rights gary bauer and alan keyes , make their rejection of homosexuality a major plank of their platforms mr bauer said recently that when he heard senator mccain say the party should be a big tent that admits everybody , the phrase sounded to him like fingernails on a chalkboard steve forbes , the wealthy publisher and candidate , flatly opposes any concessions to gay voters he frequently says he wants equal rights for all , special rights for none asked if mr forbes would appoint an openly gay person to his administration , his campaign manager , bill dal col , said if the person is qualified for the job , that s fine as long as it is not a statement on a life style or promoting a life style as for gay adoptions , mr dal col said there are plenty of heterosexual couples out there , and existing laws against hate crimes are enough the rev louis p sheldon , a staunch conservative who heads a national group called the traditional values coalition and who has denounced homosexuals often in his career , denied that there was an effort among republicans to reach out to gay voters
the yankees and the toronto blue jays made a trade yesterday that had nothing to do with the boston red sox but had everything to do with their fans imagine the feelings of the downtrodden red sox fans today they were already preparing for a season without their beloved mo vaughn , knowing it would be a lost season , a wasteland of a season , but doggedly ready to tender their support nonetheless now the roger clemens trade has added sadism to their masochism just as the red sox let vaughn leave as a free agent this winter , they jettisoned clemens two years ago , pronouncing him an aging pitcher no longer worth the money or years he sought as a free agent two cy young awards later , the red sox fans have to face the agony of watching their onetime hero pitch for the hated yankees and help the yankees get where the red sox ca n't april is the cruelest month \? try may , june , july , august , september and october , too don zimmer , the yankees' bench coach , yesterday devilishly planned to add a few grains of salt to the gaping psychic wounds when the yankees play at fenway park in may and clemens is the starting pitcher in one of the three games , zimmer , who is notorious in boston as the manager who squandered a 14game lead over the yankees in 1978 , plans to take the lineup card to home plate it was bad enough when wade boggs returned to fenway the first time in a yankee uniform in 1993 clemens s appearance in the yankees' gray road uniform will be cause for emotional despair for red sox fans their feelings aside , this is a trade that is good for both teams the blue jays shed a player who insulted them by asking out because , clemens said , they were n't a contender even though they made a legitimate run at the wildcard spot and seemed to improve each day of the last seven weeks of the season in return , they received a solid starting pitcher in david wells the yankees gain because clemens is becoming the next nolan ryan , a hardthrowing ageless winner and wells was not likely to match the best year of his life the yankees did n't need clemens to repeat as division champions , but with their lineup behind him , he should finally look formidable in his postseason performances change seems to go well with clemens in the few seasons before he was forced out of boston , he did not resemble the pitcher who had won three cy young awards but he seemed to use the insult the red sox inflicted to work harder and push himself more fiercely , and two outstanding seasons ensued now he has another motivation proving that the two seasons in toronto were not the brightening of the light bulb before it burns out not to mention pitching for the best team in baseball at the hallowed grounds of the legendary ball park and before the fans who reviled him when he pitched for the red sox let us not forget , however , that clemens could have been here before this george steinbrenner tried diligently to lure him to the yankees two years ago at the time , the indians tried valiantly to get him to cleveland clemens , as a free agent , said his goal was to play in the world series the yankees and the indians offered him the best opportunity to accomplish that goal the blue jays were the third team in the chase on a downward slide from the caliber of their 199293 world series championship teams , they were the least likely to reach the world series but desperate to induce clemens to play in toronto , the blue jays violated baseball rules by including an unreported side agreement that gave clemens the right to request a trade and the additional right to approve the team to which he could be traded it was as if the fbi had put a loaded gun in each of john dillinger s hands clemens invoked the agreement last december , saying he wanted to \( 1 \) play for a contender , or \( 2 \) play closer to home but when he asked the team closest to home , the houston astros , who also happened to be a contender , for what amounted to 274 million for one extra year on his contract , it became evident that his trade request was all about money he saw what the market had become for top line pitchers , 125 million a year and up , and he wanted some of it he did n't want to have to wait two more years until his contract would expire it s all about the money , a blue jays executive said the yankees say no contract adjustment renegotiation or extension has been discussed with clemens and his agents but none need be now the agents , the hendricks brothers of houston , know steinbrenner they did n't even need a wink from george to approve the trade the new contract will follow this one may even be announced shortly after the yankees acquired chuck knoblauch a year ago , his agents , the one and the same hendrick brothers , negotiated with steinbrenner a twoyear , 18 million extension to the second baseman s contract the yankees never have announced or reported that one photo roger clemens saluted fans at fenway park after the game against the yankees on sept 28 , 1996 it was his last game for the red sox \( agence francepresse \)
you get a shot of reality with your drink order at monk s place , the ramshackle gin mill that is the setting for small craft warnings , tennessee williams s 1972 rap session of a drama the bar stools are filled each night by a motley assortment of grifters , drifters and rowdies , fellow travelers in the shabby margins of life , consigned to the fringes by dint of criminal misdeed , decadent impulse or illness of the head try as they might to anesthetize themselves , though , williams s contentious outcasts find little comfort at the bottom of their beer bottles unlike harry hope s bar , the no chance saloon of o'neill s iceman cometh , monk s place needs no reformed carouser to sober up the joint these drinkers already sound as if they were cardcarrying members of aa , so eager are they to offer up cleareyed testimonials to the shabby outlines of their lives indeed , before expanding the play to two acts , williams had called it confessional in the course of the evening , each of the barflies has a moment , with the bar s lights dimmed and a spotlight trained , in which they confess a selfrevealing truth the stud owns up to violent inclinations the bartender describes his wait for a lonely death the quack abortion doctor admits to his abject disgrace the homosexual attests to his desensitization the speeches evoke lives steered into dark corners yet there is dignity in the testimony of these trapped sinners , as frozen in place as the petrified sailfish over monk s bar the mere act of articulating their sins and regrets endows them with a kind of poetic valor nothing else really happens in small craft warnings , which is receiving a respectable revival by the director jeff cohen and his worth street theater company in tribeca the play was regarded as minor williams when it made its debut 27 years ago walter kerr found it a work of obvious immobility and its most remarkable feature , at the time , was the performance by williams himself in the production as an occasional understudy that williams would have made such uncharacteristic appearances at that late stage of his career is a striking footnote he had taken to complaining that critics and other analysts had , in recent years , tended to review his life rather than his plays what mr cohen s revival demonstrates is that the play had strengths quite apart from the curiosity value of williams s participation in it the anguish in monk s place is real taking place entirely in the seedy bar on the southern california coast , small craft warnings fills the establishment with a recognizable array of williams characters , from leona , the lusty , needy libertine played by cristine mcmurdowallis , to bill \( anthony mangano \) , the hunk with a heart of stone , to doc \( stewart steinberg \) , the boozehound physician whose license has been taken away but who practices medicine anyway most memorably , there is the mysterious quentin , the dapper homosexual screenwriter who arrives with a young man on his arm and a harrowing vacancy in his soul even in this outpost of outsiders , quentin is treated as unwelcome only leona , who has not recovered from the death of her frail , beautiful brother , pulls up a chair and as portrayed with both restraint and electricity by david greenspan , he is the embodiment of some terminal sense of disappointment in the playwright s psyche mr greenspan s interpretation of quentin s brief soliloquy none of the monologues last more than a few minutes is the production s high point , and unlike anything this talented , idiosyncratic actor has done before the speech is about the death of feeling , the inability to be intrigued or entertained or even wounded by another human being reviewing the original production , harold clurman thought it a monologue for a selfhating gay man , but after seeing mr greenspan , that seems an apt but narrow reading hope has not been extinguished in the actor s shattered mien , which makes quentin a much more complex figure it is that desire to hold on , the inability to give up entirely , that seems to fill this quentin with selfloathing ms mcmurdowallis s leona is a lively creation you buy her need for the nightly pity party at monk s john dibenedetto is completely convincing as a beach bum whose iq drops 10 points with every sip , and liam christopher o'brien locates the questionable openness in quentin s pickup , bobby but some of mr cohen s other actors do not deliver as fully rounded performances , and so the quality of this small craft warnings ebbs and flows even so , worth street

to the editor re new zealanders press plan for apes' rights \( march 16 \) how many members of this group pressing for apes' rights are apes \? none women like susan b anthony campaigned for women s rights , blacks like martin luther king for black rights , gays for gay rights , jews for jewish rights , etc , but there is n't , and ca n't be , an ape equivalent and if a group of men argued that women should have certain rights , but no women were consulted on this and no women would have any knowledge of these supposed rights or choice in exercising them , i would n't call them rights they would be just rules for how to treat women that one group of men believes in so if this group wants certain rules for how apes should be treated , fine , but it s nothing to do with rights humans have theodore miller new york photo \( victoria kann \)
nashville , nov 20 where do wax figures go when they die \? for more than a quarter of a century the country music wax museum was one of nashville s most colorful tourist magnets one in every nine visitors to nashville walked through its doors , gawking at lifesize replicas of hank williams , george jones and dolly parton this was no ordinary wax museum performers like minnie pearl and johnny cash donated clothes and instruments and even tended to their characters once , after jim reeves had died and his exwife dropped by to brush the hair on his exhibit , employees saw she had put a picture of herself on the mantel but the country music wax museum quietly shut its doors two years ago , a casualty of nashville s selfconscious rush toward modernization in 1971 , when the museum opened , nashville was a small city with a handful of studios today the population of the metropolitan area has boomed past one million , and there are 400 music studios professional hockey and football teams have moved into town , and health care has replaced country music as the city s no 1 moneymaker the wax museum was once part of a thriving tourist mall , along with the hank williams jr museum , barbara mandrell country and the car collectors hall of fame now they , too , are closed , and there are plans to supplant them with a traffic circle , offices and a ritzcarlton hotel but what happened to the cherished wax figures of country music greats with their vintage finery and original instruments \? not even officials of the country music hall of fame across the street knew the answer this reporter crisscrossed nashville on the trail of the missing wax figures , encountering tales of a vanished promoter , a kennedy campaign consultant and a taiwanese herb vendor but nothing could prepare him for what he found none of the three shopkeepers who remain in the area once called the gateway to music row but now nicknamed death row knew the figures' whereabouts rumor had it that they had been sold to the music valley wax museum , a newer attraction on the city s outskirts , where the opryland usa theme park , since demolished , had lured the tourists who once kept the mall s shops in business they did offer their collection to us , said doris harvey , the assistant manager of the music valley wax museum but they did n't want to break the set , and we already had many of the same figures inquiries at the country music hall of fame revealed little administrators said they were never offered the figures but one employee brought out a charmingly crude wax museum coloring book she had recently bought for 99 cents at the local grocery virginia brazzell , the proprietor , found the books in the back of the store when she bought the place some two years ago phone calls to former employees of the museum produced the vague conjecture that the figures had been melted down more than 60 figures were missing and it was n't so surprising in a city that likes to reinvent itself every few years , complaining about the loss of tradition while paving over its past the city decided that they want the convention business , said jim cook , the owner of hat country , a wax museum neighbor that is going out of business but they ca n't create that new image of nashville without killing the old one years ago the country music wax museum was tied to the most powerful people in the city aurora publishing , a failed book and entertainment venture that had managed to pull most of nashville into its orbit , founded the museum one of its first chiefs was paul corbin , a political operative who worked on campaigns for john f kennedy and robert f kennedy after their assassinations , mr corbin found respite from politics in wax figures , often borrowing their boots to wear around town but the museum s most notorious operator was dominic delorenzo , an aurora founder described by former employees as a goodlooking , slicktalking charmer who persuaded nashville luminaries like chet atkins , minnie pearl and the newspaper mogul john seigenthaler to invest in the publishing company and museum it was while dining at the peking restaurant , a country star hangout , that mr delorenzo discovered the museum s future daniel hsu , the son of a leading herbal medicine authority from taiwan , who had given up his microbiology studies at vanderbilt university to open the restaurant mr hsu soon become majority shareholder in aurora , and mr delorenzo left nashville for new york and disappeared , leaving behind a pile of creditors , some of whom believe that he faked his death mr delorenzo s son , dominick , who used to spend his summers working at the museum , said his father died of cancer in 1980 under mr hsu , the wax museum thrived and the area around it blossomed into a tourist mecca of offbeat novelty stores and shrines to country stars in a bold move in a world of hank williams jr fans , mr hsu opened a chinese art museum above the wax museum and when mr hsu learned that a relative of mr seigenthaler s was an artist , he commissioned her to make new wax figures the last one she made was of george strait a faded wood sign above the old museum still advertises the addition to the collection
the feeling of what happens body and emotion in the making of consciousness by antonio r damasio illustrated 385 pp new york harcourt brace company 28 this decade has seen a number of books tackling consciousness from various angles , ranging from daniel dennett s consciousness explained , a topdown demolition of the little person inside , to my bottomup attempt in the cerebral code at a contemplative neural circuitry using darwinian processes until now , none have really approached consciousness from the standpoint of why it feels the way it does a livelier question to the nonexpert i formerly dismissed such qualia issues as subjectobject confusions engendered by our language habits , but antonio r damasio \( the portugueseeducated iowa neurologist , known to half a million readers as the author of descartes' error \) has now persuaded me to pay attention and in a way that few philosophers could have done , by citing many neurology patients with odd limitations , ones that show useful distinctions it s not the sort of humanistic detective book that oliver sacks writes damasio tries to piece together a big story , one that philosophers have long struggled with he has one of the best brain stories of the decade and , fortunately , he writes well , his patients come alive on the page and his theory makes a lot of sense though i suspect he occasionally makes a distinction without a difference when he talks of knowing this is a mustread book for anyone wanting a neurologist s perspective on one of the greatest unsolved mysteries , human consciousness and how it exceeds that of the other apes neurologists usually confine themselves to the simplest aspects of consciousness , the spectrum from coma to stupor to wakefulness to fully oriented in time and place this can be studied in most animals fancier than jellyfish some of us say that calling this consciousness confuses the light switch with the light neuroscientists occasionally venture into the other approachable aspect , selective attention for which fish might suffice as subjects damasio puts such foundational aspects in their place and builds on them , all the way up to the autobiographical self and its relation to consciousness , even considering \( all too briefly \) creativity and conscience whatever your favorite connotation of the c word , it is likely the feeling of what happens covers that base , a rare accomplishment among consciousness books but damasio s really impressive feat is that he integrates all this with emotions and feelings , making them play a central role in the experience of consciousness he does n't confine himself to the emotions that an observer could detect but addresses the feelings that only exist internally the title of this book is meant to be taken literally it begins , in a tradition that goes back at least to the book of genesis , with a bangup first chapter that signposts the rest of the book , followed by a less poetic alternative , and both are excellent thereafter the terminology of neuroanatomy and neurology creeps in \( readers might start with a useful tutorial , called notes on mind and brain , at the back of the book \) damasio s genesis of consciousness even has the biblical begats the nonconscious neural signaling of an individual organism begets the protoself which permits core self and core consciousness , which allow for an autobiographical self , which permits extended consciousness at the end of the chain , extended consciousness permits conscience consciousness is more than being awake , as one of damasio s epileptic patients , suffering an absenceofconsciousness seizure , illustrates were you to have interrupted the patient at any point during the episode , he would not have known who you were he would not know who he was or what he was doing he might take a drink or open a door , but there would have been no plan , no forethought , no sense of wishing , wanting , considering , believing there would have been no sense of self , no identifiable person with a past and an anticipated future in other words , the patient would have had some elementary aspects of mind but he would not have had a normal consciousness then comes damasio s succinct summary of the mental process that consciousness entails he would not have developed an image of knowing centered on a self an enhanced image of the objects he was interacting with a sense of the appropriate connection to what went on before each given instant or what might happen in the instant ahead one technological metaphor neuroscientists use for the enhancement of some images over others , so essential to our sense of self , is a blackandwhite movie scene in which one actor becomes colorized , gradually standing out , until another actor develops color and the first fades back to gray scale damasio has a symphonic notion of how higherorder brain maps interact to achieve such shifting emphasis that is far more sophisticated happily , his orchestra does n't really require a conductor any more than a string quartet does we do , nonetheless , have the illusion of a little conductor inside , and damasio suggests how it might arise the images in the consciousness narrative flow like shadows along with the images of the object for which they are providing an unwitting , unsolicited comment to come back to the metaphor of movieinthebrain , they are within the movie there is no external spectator and later , alluding to a line by t s eliot the story is not told by some clever homunculus nor is the story really told by

cape town the female condom , seldom used in the west , is catching on here and in many parts of the developing world , slowly becoming an important new weapon in the fight against the aids epidemic nearly seven million have been distributed in 34 countries in africa , asia and latin america , and the device is gaining acceptance among men as well as women properly used , the female condom is believed to be as good as or better than the male condom at preventing infection , because it is stronger and covers a slightly larger area it is slightly less effective than the male condom at preventing pregnancy there is an urgent need for more methods to prevent hiv infection , especially those that put women in control , said peter piot , executive director of the united nations aids program in geneva unaids and other organizations are working to persuade more women to try the female condom in south africa , as in many countries , they first approach prostitutes and other women with multiple partners , since persuading them to use condoms has notably reduced rates of aids infection among all the barely dressed women waving to passing cars on somerset road here in cape town , glynis rhodes looks a little out of place in her baby blue sweatshirt and jeans but she is bearing gifts hi , she says have you tried the female condom \? most of the first group she meets seven teenagers , all in black , goofy from drugs and working for two pimps lurking across the road know ms rhodes she hands out free condoms on behalf of sweat , the sex worker education and advocacy task force almost none have heard of the female version ms rhodes patiently demonstrates it again and again , stretching it to show how much stronger than a male condom it is , using her halfclosed fist to show how to insert it , getting each girl to touch it some are still skeptical they are young and heedless and think they 'll never die then she runs into fazilin fazilin is 39 , has a jobless husband and six children , and comes from a conservative muslim family , all of whom think she works in an allnight restaurant she has common sense , charm and is something of a street leader , telling the teenagers to insist on condoms and to try the female one i 've been using it since valentine s day , and i like it i 've tried it with about 15 okes , she said , using south african slang for guys it s quite great when men refuse to use a condom , she said , she has gone into a bathroom and inserted the female one they never know , she said , adding proudly , and they think they got fleshtoflesh , so i charge them double the women on somerset earn 25 for sex with a condom and up to 50 without while fazilin unwittingly outlined an economic incentive that may promote the use of female condoms , researchers say she is unusual men can usually see and feel the device the female condom has some drawbacks even at the 62cent price negotiated by unaids for thirdworld governments , it is 20 times as expensive as male condoms , which governments buy in bulk for 3 cents each sixtytwo cents may be small change in the united states , but it is a large consideration in many african countries because the female condom is bigger than a male one and has two rings , one inside and one outside , some find it unsightly success varies the condom is a hit in zimbabwe , while in neighboring botswana , another country where 25 percent of the population is infected , it is almost unknown in mpumalanga province in south africa , it is so popular that the financially pressed provincial health department is spending 700 , 000 for more mmabatho mqhayi , a researcher at the reproductive health research unit at chris hanibara gwanath hospital in soweto , said it is more popular in rural areas like kwazulu natal , where everyone has seen someone dying of aids the female condom was invented in the 1980 s by a danish doctor who wanted women to have a barrier method that they could control it won the approval of the united states food and drug administration in 1993 , and the sole source , the female health company of chicago , sells it under the name reality for about 225 in contrast to the relative enthusiasm in the developing world , united states pharmacy sales are only about 700 , 000 a year american women , said a planned parenthood spokeswoman , dislike the look , complain that it squeaks and do not know how to insert it aids researchers have been surprised at its popularity in much of africa , however we were astounded at the response completely caught unawares , said dr kelvin billing hurst , an aids specialist for the mpumalanga health department we thought it would be ladies putting it in before their husbands came home drunk and trying to keep it a secret but we found there was a demand from males , too in contrast to the conventional condom , which many men shun because they say it interferes with sexual pleasure , some men say they find the feel of the female condom stimulating other researchers report that some men prefer it to constricting male condoms , appreciate the fact that foreplay does not have to stop to put it on , and that it makes aids prevention the woman s worry because it is expensive yet strong , the big question researchers are now trying to answer is can it be washed and reused \? since they planned to sell it to middleclass americans , the manufacturers never tested that , and the packet instructions discourage it reuse , however , would seriously cut the cost for thirdworld women in effect , one reuse drops the price from 62 to 31 cents five uses cut it to 12 cents and health researchers here realized that some women were washing the condoms anyway the soweto unit has begun formal testing , both in the lab and with female volunteers in the lab , condoms are repeatedly washed in hot and cold water with bar soap , dishwashing liquid , detergent and bleach , then checked to see if they are still strong enough to meet fda standards volunteers , most of them prostitutes in the hillbrow section of johannesburg , have been asked to use condoms with customers , wash them and return them for microbial testing preliminary results , still to be discussed with the world health organization , look promising , said dr helen rees , the unit s director the unit may conclude that it is safe to use up to five times , if the user washes it with warm water and liquid soap , does not let fingernails or rings tear it and dries it with a clean towel now social agencies and health workers are trying to build a market street demonstrations , like those by ms rhodes , are not ideal health workers prefer showing women how to use the condom in a more private setting , where women have somewhere to try inserting it and can come back with questions but with nearly four million south africans infected with hiv and another 1 , 500 becoming infected each day , no one has time to wait until conditions are perfect photo in south africa and elsewhere , groups fighting aids have made prostitutes a top priority for female condoms glynis rhodes , right , an outreach worker , gave out samples last month in cape town , south africa \( anna zieminksi for the new york times \) \( pg a6 \)
washington , oct 30 for the first time since congress began passing landmark environmental laws three decades ago , the critically important senate environment and public works committee is about to be headed by someone who wants to make those laws more friendly to business there are two candidates for the chairmanship to replace senator john h chafee , republican of rhode island , who died on sunday but whether republicans choose robert c smith of new hampshire or james m inhofe of oklahoma , they will break the environmental mold filled by mr chafee , and before him by max baucus , democrat of montana , daniel patrick moynihan , democrat of new york , quentin burdick , democrat of north dakota , robert t stafford , republican of vermont and jennings randolph , democrat of west virginia the change is another measure of how the senate s republicans have evolved over the years the original conservation movement was a republican concept early in the century , and over the last three decades republican support was central to a bipartisan committee today the environmental movement considers none of the remaining nine committee republicans an ally republican leaders and senators smith and inhofe declined to discuss the committee or their environmental views this week , saying it would be inappropriate before senator chafee s funeral today but policy statements made available by the pair s staffs clearly describe them , and their records are well known senator smith , for example , has strongly supported a revision of the superfund law that would shift the responsibility for paying for cleanups away from polluters and he has said that although the environmental movement of the 1970 s served a purpose , the challenge of the future will be how to encourage the protection of our environment without jeopardizing economic growth and overburdening taxpayers mr inhofe has been a frequent antagonist of the environmental protection agency over the regulations of the clean air act and the quality of the science behind its views and he accused the agency of turning jobs into endangered species , especially in the coal industry , through its efforts to limit particulates in the air their differences in tone and voting record from mr chafee are deep the league of conservation voters , which gave the rhode island senator a lifetime achievement award this month , rated his votes as correct 70 percent of the time over his career for mr smith , the rating was 36 percent and for mr inhofe , 7 percent under ordinary circumstances , there would be no question about who would succeed mr chafee mr smith joined the committee when he was elected to the senate in 1991 , mr inhofe when he arrived four years later and seniority governs chairmanships but in some amorphous way , mr smith has been out of the republican party since july 13 , when he announced he was converting his hapless presidential bid into an independent candidacy and said the republican party is more interested in winning elections than in supporting the principles of the platform he is now seeking to rejoin the party and will probably be taken back in but republicans may hold his three months in the wasteland against him when it comes to a valuable chairmanship , though they left him in the thankless position as chairman of the ethics committee in recent years , even when mr chafee did not have the votes in his committee or confidence about a bill s prospects on the senate floor , he had a chairman s prerogative of simply pigeonholing it , as he did with the house s 1995 effort to rewrite the clean water act neither potential successor is likely to do that one business lobbyist said on friday of senators smith and inhofe , they would probably be more supportive than mr chafee she added , they have been very big supporters , especially inhofe , of making sure regulations are based on sound science and weigh costs and benefits from an opposite perspective , deb callahan , president of the league of conservation voters , said john chafee was an architect of most of our environmental laws the next person is going to use more of a wrecking ball approach carol m browner , administrator of the environmental protection agency , would not predict the next chairman s course but ms browner said it was time for congress to reauthorize and modernize laws like the clean water act , last overhauled in 1987 , and superfund the contenders have different styles mr inhofe is a satisfied veteran of the partisan wars of the house mr smith is easier to work with , but can be stubborn one environmental lobbyist here , dan weiss of the sierra club , said , it would n't be surprising to see an environmental feeding frenzy launched by mr smith , or especially mr inhofe , whom he dismissed as a spokesman for the oil industry mr smith , he said , at least came from a state that was on the receiving end of pollution and had constituents who were concerned about the environment although environmentalists worked hard to defeat mr smith when he ran in 1996 , they would plainly prefer him to mr inhofe when mr smith served in the house from 1985 to 1990 , he actually voted with the league of conservation voters twothirds of the time , like most new england republicans there is something there we could hopefully build on , ms callahan said moreover , the environment is an issue for new england voters , and if mr smith runs again in 2002 , he is likely to face strong democratic opposition , something mr inhofe need not worry about representative sherwood boehlert of utica , ny , an environmental leader among house republicans , said it was clear that either one would be dramatically different in approach to environmental issues as compared to chafee but mr boehlert said the change might not make as much difference as it would have a few years ago , because house republicans had become much less eager to take the political risks of changing environmental laws than they were at the height of the gingrich revolution of 1995 mr boehlert said it was becoming clear on all sides that the american people want us to protect the air they breathe , the water they drink , the food they eat photos senator robert c smith is one of two probusiness candidates for the chairmanship of the environment and public

paris drake , the 32yearold man charged with smashing a brick into the head of a young woman on a midtown manhattan street , has lived his life in the margins , squatting with drug dealers in a bronx apartment , panhandling in manhattan and maneuvering through the legal system over two decades and nearly two dozen arrests he bounced from the street to the courtroom to jail time after time his record is long , and in the last year he has become increasingly violent still , until now none of the charges were serious enough to qualify for stiff penalties available under repeat offender laws in short , the system s response to mr drake is typical of the way it handles the thousands of lowlevel criminals whose routine cases clog the courts most of mr drake s cases ended in plea bargains that never brought him close to the maximum sentences for his crimes although four of his crimes were felonies , in most of the other cases , the maximum would have been no more than a year this defendant has a long and sordid criminal history , said an assistant district attorney , joan illuzziorbon , at mr drake s arraignment yesterday mr drake , dressed in jeans and a white shirt , said nothing and showed no emotion at his arraignment he was ordered held without bail on charges of attempted murder , assault and criminal possession of a weapon in the nov 16 attack on nicole barrett , a 27yearold office worker who remains in bellevue hospital center with a brain injury that has affected her speech in a written statement , joseph ronson of the legal aid society , who represents mr drake , said he fervently denied his guilt mr ronson asserted that there had been overwhelming pressure on the police to make an arrest such intense pressure can lead to mistakes , mr ronson said mr drake was arrested on monday night , several days after an inmate at rikers island told the authorities that mr drake , who had been arrested on an unrelated charge five days after the attack and sentenced to five days in jail , had bragged about it to inmates the manhattan district attorney s office refused to approve charges based only on the inmate s statement on tuesday , six witnesses to the attack , which occurred near grand central terminal , viewed mr drake in a lineup one , laura s weiner , the last of the six , identified mr drake as the attacker after that , the charges were approved in an interview yesterday , ms weiner said she was walking back to her midtown law office on the day of the attack when she saw a man approach ms barrett and , without a word , throw a paving stone at her just two days before the attack , mr drake had been released from jail , where he had spent one day after an arrest on a drugsales charge the substance turned out to be fake and last week , after another drug arrest , he helped persuade a judge to shorten his jail time to 5 days from a threatened 10 days by arguing that the police had found only a trace of crack cocaine on him i got two empty bags , which is nothing , he said , according to a transcript he also pleaded for compassion , saying he had been in jail or prison for the last five thanksgivings most of mr drake s encounters with the law were for nonviolent , drugrelated offenses , but in the last year he seemed to ratchet up his crimes in october 1998 , he punched a barber in the face and threatened to slash him with a knife in an argument over the price of a haircut he pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced to 45 days in jail the incident occurred at the american barber institute , a training school on west 29th street mr drake entered the shop and asked an instructor , ali afruz , the price of a haircut , which was 299 employees recalled yesterday that mr drake became enraged and said they ought to pay him for having his hair cut when the staff asked him to leave , the employees said , he pulled out a knife , threatened mr afruz , and began kicking the door last december , he kicked a supervisor at rikers island in the leg and tried to punch another officer , and again was convicted of assault he was sentenced to nine days mr drake had spent most of this year and about 10 of the last 20 years in jail or prison since august , he has been living in an abandoned sixthfloor apartment in a building on the grand concourse in the bronx in the middle of the summer , there was a lot of traffic in and out of that apartment , said chico padilla , the superintendent of the building that s when he showed up one resident of the building said there were loud fights in the apartment and constant noise beginning about midnight they would bang on my door and i would n't open it , she said i was scared for my kids the attack on ms barrett sparked speculation by the police that the person responsible might be homeless and mentally ill three days after the attack , mayor rudolph w giuliani announced that homeless people who sleep on the streets would face arrest if they refused shelter there is no indication of mental illness in mr drake s history , but prosecutors said yesterday that they considered him homeless at a news conference yesterday , mr giuliani said the arrest policy had been mischaracterized by the news media , and that homeless people would face arrest only for committing specific crimes at the mayor s news conference , ms barrett s mother , sharon barrett , of athens , tex , said her daughter was doing well physically , there are no real serious concerns right now , mrs barrett said she has some speech problems that are going to have to be dealt with , some cognitive skills that are going to have to be rehabilitated we do n't know how long that will take , but she s come a lot further than anybody expected her to mr drake grew up in freeport , ny , on a block of twostory homes with neat lawns neighbors said yesterday that he and his brother , troy , and several foster children were raised by their grandmother , an uncle and an aunt the boys' parents did not live with them , but there was no hint of trouble in the household , said mark hobbs , 37 , a neighbor the family left freeport in the early 1980 s and lost contact with their old neighbors , mr hobbs said mr drake s first contact with the criminal justice system came in 1982 , when he was arrested on a burglary charge in freeport , according to court records the case was dismissed he was arrested five times over the following five years for lowlevel charges in 1987 , mr drake was charged with attempted assault , criminal possession of a handgun , resisting arrest

on its web site , the coachella music and arts festival , taking place in indio , calif , on saturday and sunday , promises free water fountains , bottled water for no more than 2 , one acre of shade and a higher ratio of restroom facilities to guests than any other festival , with bathrooms cleaned throughout the day coachella is the first major overnight rock festival to be held in the united states since woodstock '99 , and it is clear that the burning and looting that overshadowed that event have sent a message to rock concert promoters \( amid the flames of woodstock '99 concertgoers complained of price gouging , overflowing portable toilets and an excess of corporate sponsors \) for some time concert promoters have treated their customers in a manner that no theater or classical audience would tolerate , forcing them to endure long admission lines and surly security guards who make concertgoers feel as if they were entering a prison coachella , in its news release , pledges an end to rockaudience abuses it promises free parking , bands performing fulllength shows \( instead of the reduced sets they usually offer at radio station concerts \) , a crowd that will be kept well under the site s capacity , a minimum of intrusive displays by sponsors , and nightly cleaning of the festival grounds this is how a festival should feel , the news release says great music , peaceful location , no dust and money left in your wallet at the end ! of course coachella has a lot less to deal with than woodstock a maximum of 35 , 000 concertgoers a day \( instead of the 200 , 000 at woodstock '99 \) and a lineup with none of woodstock s heavy metal , gangsta rap or meathead rock there are some acts that both festivals have in common , however , including rage against the machine , the chemical brothers and moby although the scale of the two events is very different , gary bongiovanni , the editor of pollstar , a leading concert industry magazine , said that marketing coachella as a safe , enjoyable and clean contrast to woodstock was a smart move moss jacobs , one of the owners of goldenvoice , the concert promotion company that has spent two years arranging coachella , said that after woodstock some members of the indio city government , which had voted unanimously to hold the event , needed reassuring the imagery they have in their minds of a festival is the imagery of woodstock , he said and it s hard to explain that this is a different event because the bands will attract a whole different crowd of people primarily the people who will come to coachella are not the people who went to woodstock more similar in spirit to monterey pop than woodstock , coachella offers a lineup that appeals to a cuttingedge crowd , with many performers unused to playing in front of such large audiences there is a strong emphasis on dance music and college radio bands , as opposed to acts that are popular on the billboard pop charts or commercial modernrock stations among the more popular of the 75 acts at coachella are morrissey , tool , pavement , beck , underworld , medeski , ben harper , martin and wood slightly more obscure performers and dj s include the japanese recordcollectors fantastic plastic machine and cornelius , the quirky welsh rock group super furry animals , the agile turntablists kid koala and the scratch perverts , the female dance acts dj rap and neotropic , and the alternative rap groups jurassic five and ugly duckling going to an even greater extreme of postwoodstock concern , the coachella organizers said in an interview this week that a sponsor would be helping them provide each audience member with a free bottle of water on admission , and that the person who would be organizing concert traffic was the same person who reroutes traffic in los angeles during the city s marathon but all these guarantees seem very similar to what woodstock '99 promoters said before their event , promising that the problems of the previous festival , held five years earlier , would be rectified this time and they were but new problems arose can a rock festival , even one as highminded as coachella , ever take everything into account \? when you 're dealing with crowd behavior , you can try and anticipate what people are going to do and try to head that off , said mr bongiovanni but ultimately you 're at the mercy of what a crowd decides to do shut that mouth ten months ago , the downtown spokenword artist emily xyz completed her first full album , a mix of vocals and electronica called electric magistrate , for mouth almighty records , a small label owned by polygram shortly afterward , polygram was sold to seagram , which soon shut down mouth almighty now emily xyz is one of many artists struggling to resume her recording career after being dumped in the merger the problem , however , is that lawyers for universal , the music division of seagram , want her to purchase the masters of her recordings from the company although the recording budget was 15 , 000 , they said she could buy the album back for 5 , 000 but that figure has proved to be too daunting for both emily xyz and for small independent labels interested in releasing the record emily xyz said she wrote and handdelivered a personal appeal to edgar bronfman jr , the seagram president , urging him to waive the fee the bronfman thing was a piece of performance art , she said i did n't expect to get an answer or for him to turn over the masters but i figured he should know what s going on because of what he did moving on to a more effective form of performance art , emily xyz will be reading at a fundraising concert for herself on wednesday night at 8 at st mark s church in the east village admission is by donation \( 20 is suggested \) , all of which goes to her album buyback fund contributors will be thanked in the record s liner notes , she said also rallying to her support with performances will be more than 20 other spokenword artists and poets , including john giorno , bob holman , chi chi valenti , and john s hall photo tom rowlands of the chemical brothers , who will perform this weekend at the coachella festival \( rahav segev \)
mineola , ny , feb 24 following the lead of new york city , nassau county began confiscating the vehicles of drunkendriving suspects today , and suffolk county officials said they were just days away from starting a similar program the nassau county executive , thomas s gulotta , announced his intention to seize cars from drunken drivers in his state of the county address on monday , and he wasted no time in putting the plan into effect speaking at a news conference at police headquarters here , mr gulotta said that five men were arrested early this morning for driving under the influence of alcohol and that their automobiles were being held in police impound yards until they have had their day in court though the police said later that one of the five cars had been returned to its owner because he was not legally intoxicated if we ca n't take the drunk off the road , we will take the vehicle off the road , mr gulotta said let s understand one thing driving is a privilege , not a right farther out on long island , peter a scully , a spokesman for the suffolk county executive , robert j gaffney , said in a telephone interview today that his office expected to start a similar program sometime next week we will begin confiscating cars when the logistics can be worked out with the police , he said the decisions by the long island county executives further expanded support for the forfeitures , which mayor rudolph w giuliani began in the city over the weekend some municipal officials in other parts of the metropolitan area also expressed support today , including mayor anthony russo of hoboken , a democrat , who said , i think the idea has legs fatality rates have been climbing through the roof and we need to do something , mayor russo said i'm instructing my corporate counsel to look into it , and if there is legally a way , we will do it mayor bret d schundler of jersey city said city attorneys had been researching the feasibility of such a plan since mr giuliani announced the city s initiative on saturday it may be doable , mr schundler said it s like seizing a drug dealer s car the argument is that it s an instrument used in the commission of a crime but a spokeswoman for the westchester county executive , andrew j spano , said that county would take a waitandsee approach because of questions about the legality of seizing cars from people who have not yet been convicted as they did with mr giuliani s program in new york , civil libertarians were quick to jump on mr gulotta s initiative as politically motivated and unconstitutional what we have is a 'me too' situation going on here , said patricia perry , president of the nassau county chapter of the american civil liberties union drunk drivers are a problem , everybody knows that however , we do not believe it is legal to take people s cars before they are ever convicted ms perry said she believed mr gulotta decided to start the forfeitures to deflect attention from the county s budget deficit nassau is the only county in the state running a deficit , which has been estimated as high as 190 million in 1998 and projected at 125 million for this year the nassau county program differs from the new york city one in that those acquitted of charges in nassau county will have their vehicles immediately returned also , an automobile seized from a drunken driver who does not own it will be returned to its owner if it can be proven that the arrested driver does not have primary use of the car in new york , mr giuliani has said that he will seek to have cars forfeited in civil court , where standards are less strict , even if a person has been cleared of criminal charges , no matter who owns the car the five men charged in nassau county early this morning were identified by the police as thomas iannaco , 23 , of huntington , who had his 1995 gmc minivan confiscated william cohen , 41 , of east northport , who was charged with driving under the influence of drugs and had his 1993 mazda impounded , and leonides gonzales , 40 , of great neck , who had his 1985 ford ltd seized the fourth man arrested , edward ferenczi , 26 , of west hempstead , was driving a 1997 honda accord owned by a relative , which was held pending an investigation , the police said , and the fifth , robert palazzolo , 18 , of north massapequa , had his vehicle returned to him because his blood alcohol level was less than the 010 threshold that constitutes legal intoxication he was charged instead with driving while impaired none of the men had prior arrests for drinking and driving , said detective lieut kevin caslin , a police spokesman meanwhile , two more people were arrested in new york city on tuesday night on drunken driving charges , the police said james allen sanders , 63 , of hemingway , sc , was stopped at a checkpoint in jamaica , queens , and was arrested after a breathalcohol test his 1997 ford and a loaded 32caliber revolver were confiscated the other man arrested , michael bell , was seen pushing his 1988 buick lesabre at 57th street and 21st avenue in brooklyn after hitting a parked car , and refused to submit to a breath test , the police said nassau had about 6 , 000 drunkendriving arrests last year and 23 alcoholrelated deaths , compared with 6 , 368 arrests and 31 deaths in new york city with nearly one million cars registered in nassau county and with spotty public transportation around long island , restaurant and bar owners said today that they were worried about business say a man that wants to take his family out for dinner , but ca n't have a couple glasses of wine with his pasta because he wants to have a car to drive to work in the morning , said bill leudemann , president of the suffolk county restaurant and taverns association i mean first no smoking , now this , he said how am i supposed to make a living \?

or more than two decades , the photographer camilo jose vergara has been taking portraits of american cities , or rather of parts of american cities that almost nobody wants to see the primary subjects of his 1995 book , the new american ghetto , were poor , gutted , socially ropedoff neighborhoods in newark , detroit , the bronx and elsewhere the pictures , accompanied by a diaristic text that read like a tolling of bells , constituted a baddream architectural saga of things falling down , walls mostly , in slow motion , brick by brick , or in one big , jolting , bulldozerinduced boom mr vergara , who is 54 and trained as a sociologist , caught this process on film by showing up while it happened since the late 1970 s , he has made repeated visits to specific places a city block , a housing project , a school and photographed what he found the pictures that resulted are technically straightforward , objective rather than expressive but seen together and in sequence they add up to feverchart narratives of disintegration mr vergara s relationship to loss is a complicated one , at once hardheaded and romantic \( he traces it to his childhood in chile , when the family wealth into which he was born evaporated before his eyes \) and he took some heat a while back for proposing that a cluster of empty skyscrapers in downtown detroit be declared a ruins theme park where tourists could witness the grand , cautionary spectacle of a city moldering away from within urban change can , of course , be viewed from many perspectives , some positive , even utopian and it is this upbeat spirit that warms el nuevo mundo the landscape of latino los angeles , an exhibition of mr vergara s most recent photographs that opens today at the cooperhewitt , national design museum the bulk of the work dates from 1994 to 1998 , so the timelapse format , which has always been mr vergara s strong suit , is n't operative here \( though he includes one beautiful 20year sequence of shots of a harlem storefront to show how it works \) instead , the 100 color pictures have semiindependent lives , making them feel closer to fine art photography than to field data but they also collectively form a single giant snapshot of life in the present tense in a hardscrabble urban environment where poverty is a constant but new cultural roots are in photogenic flower over the last decade or so , los angeles has become home to the largest hispanic population of any city in the united states more than 40 percent of the city s 95 million people are spanishspeaking many of the hundreds of thousands of new arrivals are mexicans who have settled in areas that were once predominantly black in mr vergara s view , they are different from earlier immigrants , who often moved over long distances to a foreign land , leaving old identities behind mexico is only a few hours' drive from los angeles , and southern california , with its desert climate , was once mexican territory , facts that encourage northbound immigrants to transport and sustain a familiar way of life the shoring up of identity is the focus of mr vergara s show , and he illustrates it in a handful of introductory images one is a tableau of waving palm trees lining a boulevard , a classic hollywood logo beside it , however , are shots of a mariachi band playing in a los angeles street and of an elegant carved stone doorway plastered with advertisements , mostly in spanish , including one for new life immigration services beyond this , the show is divided into a few thematic sections centering on home and work most of the buildings in the mexican neighborhoods are onestory bungalows built in the 1920 s and 30 s house pride is the rule one man has framed his front door with decorative mexican tiles another , who makes castcement architectural ornaments for a living , has fitted his tiny hacienda with baronial balustrades but space is scarce , and houses are often packed to overflowing \( one street address is divided into fractions 823 , 823 1 5 , 823 2 5 and so on \) new shelters spring up in driveways and on empty lots old cars are preserved far beyond their active lives , and in mr vergara s pictures they assume an animated presence , as if they had thoughts and memories of their own home and workplace merge a front yard in southcentral los angeles serves as a showroom for mattress sales certain businesses keep on the move \( a barber makes house calls , grooming an entire family during one visit \) others appear to be traveling even when they are not , as in the case of a shoe repair shop that operates out of a longimmobilized truck painted fireengine red commercial architecture \( which is what this extruck , by default , is \) reflects its surroundings in all kinds of ways a jewelry factory , for example , is given the blank , nowindow look of a bank vault in response to local crime but in terms of design , what clearly fascinates and delights mr vergara most is the proliferation of a vivid public art some of the work is pleasepayattention promotional this is true of maritza s fashions shop , all scrumptious yellow and pink , with skirts and socks painted on the facade and of the magnetic ultra tire service , with its snazzy ribbons of tread patterns painted as trim on the roof
los angeles has compassion become a republican virtue \? seems like it george w bush , in his presidential campaign kickoff speech , positively wallowed in the stuff , not only calling for compassionate conservatism but also declaring his intention to rally the armies of compassion , to show mercy , to take the side of charities and churches governor bush s compassion play annoyed his competitors , softened his image , distanced him from the republican congress and was generally applauded in the press this is great news for democrats compassion is a miserable basis for american politics it was a bad idea when liberals were selling it , and it s no less bad now that conservatives are embracing it it has at least three defects first , it s inegalitarian , carrying the condescending implication of charity , of inferiority and helplessness on the part of those on its receiving end governor bush makes this explicit by citing as examples of compassion charities that run drugtreatment programs and prison ministries there is every indication that governor bush , like his father , really is animated by this philosophy of noblesse oblige people should , of course , feel compassion for those who have fallen on hard times and ca n't help themselves but the relation of charitable giver and recipient is not the relation of free and equal citizens the demeaning aspect of charitable compassion is one reason prenew deal union officials talked of rescuing their members from demoralization at the hands of sentimental almsgivers on the left , an emphasis on compassion has been a sure sign of what the historian sean wilentz calls shmiberalism an ideology whose adherents assume that the poor and powerless are the abject , pitiable victims of other people shmiberalism , he says , appeals to people s compassion rather than to their interests second , the sentiment of compassion tends to override traditional , and sensible , moral distinctions that should govern policy mr bush s charities have compassion for a young father who works 50 hours a week yet gets paid only 14 , 000 but they also have compassion for an indolent drug addict or a prisoner compassion politics makes no distinction between these cases , which is why in the hands of democrats , and not a few republicans it has tended to promote generalized aid programs that shower cash \( in the form of food stamps , welfare or the old holy grail of a guaranteed annual income \) indiscriminately on the less fortunate and disadvantaged obviously , though , the working father and the indolent drug addict are fundamentally different and should be treated differently the worker is an upstanding citizen who does n't deserve to be lumped in with crackheads that s one reason we 've just gone through a revolution in welfare policy that s explicitly designed to separate the deserving , working poor from those nonworkers on welfare \( and to move as many people as possible from the latter category to the former \) third , because it appeals to essentially charitable impulses , compassion politics is fragile if citizens believe the government is engaged in a big united way drive , they 'll give generously when times are good but they will stop giving when they feel pinched themselves you did n't catch franklin roosevelt mooning on about compassion liberals fervently embraced compassion only in their senescent , comicbook phase , in the 1970 s and 80 s a period in which they were repudiated by the voters as impractical mushheads it was during this era that george mcgovern proposed a demogrant , which would have guaranteed 1 , 000 a year for workers and shirkers alike ted kennedy said , the work of compassion must continue mario cuomo defined democrats as those who look beyond our own welfare and reach down to those at the bottom of the ladder and help them up , if only a rung or two none of these men made it anywhere near the white house democrats came back into the nation s good graces only when they found a standardbearer who implicitly abandoned compassion politics by promising to end welfare as we know it and who then , unaccountably , kept that promise so it should be heartening for democrats to hear governor bush flaunt his compassion as a noble calling the calling of a nation where the strong are just and the weak are valued could he have handed democrats a clearer definition of social inequality \? according to governor bush , there are some people \( let s call them the rich \) who , like him , are strong then there are other people \( let s call them the nonrich \) who have the privilege of being valued by people like mr bush take it away , james carville ! certainly , attacking the snobbery within governor bush s compassion is a smarter democratic tactic than trying to link him with harderedged congressional conservatives like representative tom delay of texas the voters will know that mr bush is n't tom delay which is why it was equally cheering to see vice president al gore , in his campaign kickoff speech , react against mr bush s preening virtue by scorning the crumbs of compassion good line ! was it just rhetoric \? maybe but mr gore now has an incentive to find a new , noncompassionate vocabulary for his government activism for example , he can frame the reform of government programs most obviously social security and medicare as a strengthening of institutions created by proud , free working citizens for themselves , not gifted to the grateful masses by bushian brahmins something along the lines of medicare is not charity , mr bush neither is the minimum wage so the republicans now have compassion \? they can keep it

in the soft evening sky , a few puffy clouds reflected the sunset night was falling on 14 days of survival tennis , in which players fell out of kilter , their backs out of alignment , their arms and legs twisted in these final hours of the united states open , two 29yearolds , andre agassi and todd martin , flailed away at each other , as they have for more than a dozen years this final lacked the drama of the women s final because it did not have a sudden new star like serena williams , who outlasted martina hingis saturday evening martin was just a decent guy being asked by more than 20 , 000 fans to produce something memorable , and he resolutely gave them a fifth set , more than they might have expected then , suddenly , agassi started scampering around the court , in shape from sessions with his trainer , gil reyes , already the toprated player in the computer , a man with a plan it s not gamesmanship , agassi said but you do want to show that you 're in shape agassi hunkered low , flicked a few martin serves off the hard floor , and after two weeks it looked easy every time they went into the changeover , agassi raced off the court and when he broke martin in the eighth game , agassi won this survivor s tournament by a 64 , 67 \( 57 \) , 67 \( 27 \) , 63 , 62 score you expect somebody to play well , said agassi , who was in his 10th grand slam final but it is n't easy to go into a finals and play good tennis unless you 've been there a lot it speaks well to his spirit martin had been to a grand slam final only once , the 1994 australian open then there was the 1995 wimbledon semifinal where he squandered a 51 lead over malivai washington in the fifth set he is stalwart , smart , dedicated , and while other players disappeared with injuries and pains , he kept plugging along , even when they had to put an iv in his arm to pump him full of fluids after a bout with stomach flu martin has shown his grit before in 1997 , with his father dying , martin missed much of the season due to shin and elbow injuries but he came back in 1998 , and this year he fought his way back to the no 4 ranking in the world there were many times in 1997 i never would have hoped for that , martin said last night i wish my father could be here to experience it lanky , middle american in appearance , a bit of henry fonda or jimmy stewart in his earnestness , martin has none of the las vegas glitz of his opponent he once talked about the lessons he learned in church back in lansing , mich i think i was lucky in that all though my life , the choice between right and wrong has been pretty obvious i put stock in the power of conscience , too , in that if i think i should do something , i do it that inner life does not necessarily deter him he has a powerful serve and a resolute baseline game , but not often the tools of a finalist he might not have been in the finals if pete sampras s back had n't slipped out in a practice before the open , or if patrick rafter s rotator cuff had not torn during a match , and if a few other gifted players had not suddenly grown clueless or weary but there he was , in the fifth set of his national championship , with a real chance because agassi had frittered away two tiebreakers agassi had the easier tournament 20 sets to get here , as opposed to the 23 martin played , which included a oneset romp when magnus larsson was injured in the third round agassi had floated through this tournament , knowing sampras was not waiting for him at the end of the draw he had shaved the hair off his body and frequently whipped off his shirt to demonstrate and maybe the improved aerodynamics helped propel him through the two weeks in the final set last night , he just glided away from martin this was their 15th meeting as professionals , and agassi has now won twothirds of them todd deserved to be in the finals , agassi said it was just disappointing he had to lose i was just hanging on by a thread as he walked off the court , martin said i could n't think of a better way to go out than to play a great champion they were words martin was conditioned to speak in the midwestern sunday schools of his childhood todd martin did his best but in the end , the cleanshaven andre agassi literally ran away with this survivor s open photo andre agassi and his relentless play were too much for todd martin \( steve berman the new york times \)
my dinner with andre , directed by louis malle , was a surprise success in 1981 and quickly became a cult movie favorite a virtuosic colloquy between two old friends whose wide disparities were philosophical as well as personal over dinner , andre gregory , an experimental theater director , tells of his theatrical and spiritual adventures , and wallace shawn , a playwright with a more sedentary approach to life , listens in amazement while offering his own pithy comments the interplay is both amusing and poignant as each man searches for selfexpression last fall , the movie was shown as part of an archival series of classic films at the hamptons international festival on long island , and it has just been rereleased , beginning with an exclusive engagement at lincoln plaza cinemas in manhattan this seemed a propitious time to bring the two together for another conversation about the film , questions of art and reality , and what has happened to them since that first dinner i have known them both for many years , but this was the first time the three of us had had lunch together we met at mesa grill on lower fifth avenue , a restaurant of mr gregory s choice , and we all ordered quail salad , a tribute to my dinner with andre , in which they dined on quail what follows is an edited version of my lunch with andre and wally at the festival in east hampton , neither of them had watched the entire movie i had seen it again on television and said i was more aware that they were acting , even though they were playing characters based on themselves mel gussow andre gregory in the rehearsal process i was completely floundering because i was trying to play myself as really me , whatever that means once i could get a handle on myself as a character , i actually started using four different voices one was the sort of peter brook guru voice one was a kind of flaky uppermiddleclass , spoiled , offthewall voice one was a kind of religious fanatic who would sell out his best friend for enlightenment and the fourth was my sincere voice , which only appeared toward the end of the movie mel gussow all are aspects of your personality \? gregory oh , but that s true of any role you play gussow but it s rare that anyone has four such contrasting personalities gregory that s part of what s interesting about being a character actor gussow you 're both character actors , are n't you \? wallace shawn well , that s not by choice it s involuntary that s just due to the stupidity of the people who hire us gussow you would prefer to be a leading man \? shawn in one s own life , one imagines oneself to be a leading man , and we could easily be leading men if people made films of different kinds could i comment on what andre said \? i could n't watch the parts of the film with me in it , but i watched the beginning where it s mostly andre talking i was impressed by what a wonderful actor he is , and what a wonderful director louis is but the character that they settled on , this very manic figure who is a compulsive talker , is not in any way what andre gregory ever was now maybe in his head he s the fanatic or the guru dispensing wisdom , but in real life he does n't ever show those aspects , and he does n't show that driving need to dominate the conversation by the way , it was the biggest trap that we had in rehearsal , this danger of trying to be the way you really are in my case , i was much more confrontational and truculent than i would ever be in life gussow at the time , you said you were determined to defend myself against andre and not to let him upset me , and that he was determined to evoke a response from you in a sense , that s the storyline shawn that seems right , although with hindsight i might redescribe our objectives today slightly more in terms of wanting to be enlightened by the other each of us comes to the dinner , in a way , hoping to be cracked by the other , particularly my character gregory a very famous director who will remain nameless thought the movie could only work if it was a man and a woman , probably because there could be an undercurrent of flirtatiousness and seductiveness but i think it s a men s movie on one level because one man has trouble articulating the other guy just talks at him he does n't really talk with him so i see one line of the movie as two men who are hidden one through introversion , the other through extroversion shawn in a sense , you could say i was getting ready to become a little bit more like the character he plays , and maybe he was ready to become slightly more like the better side of the character i play i had the intention of murdering the side of myself that was shown in the film not that anyone would care , but that s the secret story behind the story gussow if you were to remake the movie , could you play each other s roles \? shawn well , we did think of a movie in which i would sort of go berserk and he would be trying to calm me down in a certain way , vanya on 42d street is that movie
gisborne city , new zealand the first sunrise of the new millennium will be a cold and lonely moment as the midnight sun dips below the horizon near dibble glacier in antarctica and then , a few minutes later , creeps up again at the edge of the international date line , the silent antarctic dawn will take place close to 14 hours before the big ball descends to mark the new year in times square and about 21 hours before the sun rises in new york at 7 20 am on jan 1 , 2000 but no one is likely to be there on that distant glacier to see the century s first dawn this has touched off a roughandtumble competition among the islands of the south pacific for the claim of being the first inhabited place to witness the first fresh sunbeams of the future fiji , tonga , kiribati and new zealand s pitt island , near here \( the astronomers' favorite \) , are the main contenders in another part of the world , katchall island in the indian ocean is using a different theory of time to claim the first island sunrise it has its scientific backers too like the millennium itself , which purists point out does not begin for another year , the competition is a matter of definitions and technicalities first midnight or first dawn \? first permanently or temporarily inhabited place \? local time or greenwich mean time \? and , particularly in the case of the often foggy pitt island , is there a sunrise if the weather is bad and nobody sees it \? it s all just a matter of convention , but of course the whole business of the millennium is a matter of convention , said dennis mccarthy , director of the directorate of time at the united states naval observatory in washington \( we are concerned with keeping the time for the country here , he said , explaining his job title so as far as time is concerned , that is what we take care of \) why is the year 2000 the year 2000 \? it s just a convention established in the sixth century by dionysius exiguus , he went on , referring to the christian theologian who is believed to have introduced the current system of numbering years and i think it s pretty much assumed now that he got it wrong , if he actually was referencing the birth of jesus right or wrong , things have gotten heated in this part of the world as new year s eve approaches a wild shifting of date lines , time zones and daylight saving times that has produced some strange geographical and temporal contortions here in this easternmost city of new zealand , yet another claim dominates first city to greet the new century or to put it another way , first land mass to see the sunrise looking more like a small town than a city , this quiet settlement of 30 , 000 seems a pleasant enough representative for the rest of us to greet the future it is described repeatedly by residents as a nice place to raise children many people in the outside world think we 're isolated , said mike coyle , a member of the gisborne district council we 're glad the younger people , they like to move away , have their excitement , then move back and enjoy their retirement or like me you can hop in the car any time , drive seven hours to auckland , have a whale of a time and be back again on monday but like the designation of jan 1 , 2000 , as the start of the new millennium , all these south pacific claims , by one key definition , are wrong they are based on local time rather than on greenwich mean time or coordinated universal time , as the scientists , if not the theologians , call it when the sun rises over the pacific , it will still be about 3 pm on dec 31 in greenwich , england , ground zero for the world s clocks the new year , and the new century , will not yet have officially arrived the only international standard for time across the world is universal time , said robert massey , an astronomer at the royal observatory at greenwich so our argument has always been that the new millennium will begin on jan 1 at the stroke of midnight along the greenwich meridian so the easiest way to measure who is first is to set your clocks to midnight gmt and find out where the sun is rising that in a sense is the first sunrise at that moment , he said , the sun will be rising along a great arc running from eastern russia through china , down along the border between myanmar formerly burma and thailand , out into the indian ocean and on down to the antarctic circle of all the spots on that particular arc , it is katchall island , india , part of the andaman and nicobar archipelago in the bay of bengal , that has decided to raise the cry of first but by the time that happens , it will already be midday on jan 1 in the middle of the pacific ocean why wait \? several places in the pacific are making their own claims pitt island the strongest claim appears to belong to pitt island , home to fewer than 60 farmers and their sheep it is a part of new zealand , but it lies in the blustery seas 500 miles off the coast and not much farther than that to the north of antarctica pitt , the more easterly of the two chatham islands , will greet the sunrise at 4 49 am on jan 1 , or 4 04 pm greenwich mean time on dec 31 it will be 11 04 am in new york

new york s subway riders descend onto steamy , crowded platforms and endure what can seem like interminable waits before squeezing into cars that snake underneath the city and after all that , some riders still end up somewhere other than their intended destinations because they do not see or do not understand those ubiquitous black , white and redtrimmed posters that announce temporary changes in subway service because of construction or repairs it s a real painintheneck hassle , said jeni elkhardt , 44 , who learned only after the subway train passed her regular exit at the 181st street station on the no 1 line that it had been closed for an elevator replacement of course i see the signs , but they all blend together , especially after a long day the new york city transit riders council , a citizens group whose 15 members are appointed by the governor , wants those subway service posters to become more readable and to provide better information to the four million people who navigate the subways every day members of the council unveiled a 39page report yesterday that cited missing posters or those that they described as misleading or confusing at 42 randomly inspected subway stations in manhattan , brooklyn , the bronx and queens \( there are none on staten island \) there are 468 stations in the four boroughs the report called not going your way includes a list of recommendations and has been sent to officials of new york city transit , which oversees the subway system in two earlier reports , the council examined signs at bus stops and on subways platforms we 're happy they 're rebuilding the stations , and we know there have to be signs , but we just want them to be userfriendly so people know where to go , said andrew albert , chairman of the riders' council albert o'leary , a spokesman for new york city transit , said that transit officials faced the challenge of keeping subway riders informed about service changes resulting from 1 , 500 construction and repair projects every year he said the transit authority spent 1 million annually on 55 million posters and brochures , and on ads in newspapers mr o'leary acknowledged that he had received some complaints about the service posters , but declined to give a number we 'll admit to being human , he said there are occasionally regrettable errors they 're put up by people , written by people , and they 're human on station platforms yesterday , riders who seemed to have the most difficulty understanding the service posters were tourists and those heading to an unfamiliar part of the city several veterans of different routes said they never got lost or confused by the posters it actually helps people , to let them know if the trains are running or not , said dan persons , 26 , who lives on the upper east side

hempstead , ny , sept 27 the most optimistic jet of them all today seemed to be the one who usually worries the most , coach bill parcells no , he was n't thinking that sunday s game in mile high stadium in denver , where only two visiting clubs have won since 1994 , could sink the jets to 04 or that the talented jaguars face the jets the next week in a monday night game , which in turn is followed by a game against the colts and then a trip to oakland we 're 03 , things do n't look so good , parcells said today after his team s loss to the redskins in a game the jets certainly could have won we 've definitely got some problems , we 've got to work out of them , but i do n't worry about retrospective views or futuristic pictures i have to do something here we ca n't keep going along the way we are i will do something until i have no recourse there are penalties to address eight of them , including three false starts , against washington parcells said there have been more false starts by the offensive line after three games than there were all last year yet , in the 2720 defeat , the jets may have been emerging from their slump the jets did move the ball on offense with quarterback rick mirer , their defense did halt the highestscoring team in the national football league until a pair of penaltyplagued , mistakefilled defensive series in the final period , and the jets' special teams produced several big plays this all came without the firststring quarterback , vinny testaverde , or the clutch receiver wayne chrebet , without the starting nose tackle jason ferguson , or the most experienced cornerback , otis smith while everyone tiptoes around the subject , the offense still finds itself off balance with mirer , who has been leading the jets for a mere two weeks it is a very rare situation a starting quarterback in the nfl having almost no practice experience with the club he is asked to lead the jets have lost their resourcefulness , whatever the reason , and have now lost two games they led in the fourth quarter i think we can change it , parcells said i think there were several phases of the game that were much better i think our defense against the run was much better , but we still do things that cost us the game these jets did the kind of things this coaching regime has n't seen or permitted offside penalties by the offensive line , repeated passinterference calls on cornerback ray mickens , only 10 players on the field during a stephen davis run that turned into a finalperiod goahead touchdown for these and other problems , parcells accepted some of the blame , saying , i have to take responsibility for the lack of discipline but he also warned his players today that they have to accept their share of blame starting with tuesday s practice , there will be an intense look at execution , and it may begin with some players returning from injuries ferguson was hoping to run today for the first time since spraining his ankle in the season s opener smith has been working out for more than a week because there are four backups now starting , though , the pressure to attend to details is greater for everyone i know i have to coach better , knowing our margin for error was less than it was , parcells said the scrutiny on my part has to be greater the essence is we have to be better to turn this program around , and i think we 're capable of doing that from keyshawn johnson , whose three receptions amounted to only 27 yards , to center kevin mawae , who is trying to get the offensive line in rhythm with mirer , to running back curtis martin , who still does n't have a smooth handoff exchange with mirer , offensive problems remain johnson , trying to explain the conservative approach that mirer has taken , said the opportunities will come working with a new quarterback , sometimes you want to do new things and keep things balanced rick will eventually get to know me a little better i helped this team get to the afc championship last year coach knows that last year i went to the pro bowl johnson has appeared in twoplus games with mirer , covering nine quarters in that span , johnson has caught only 7 passes for 83 yards , none for a touchdown for martin , the relationship is a work in progress it s probably not at its best right now , martin said it s something you develop vinny and i had it i'm still developing it with rick martin produced 85 yards on 20 carries against washington mawae , who is surrounded by firsttime starters at both guard positions , and has to put the ball into the hands of a virtual stranger in mirer , said we 've got two young guys , we 're still at a point where rick s still figuring it out the nonverbal communication is n't always there what made it work for us with vinny was that he s seen so much but what makes the situation difficult now is we 've got to help each other out vinny could take things on himself for parcells , a man who has undergone four heart procedures , and who has not coached a team in a threegame losing streak since 1995 with the patriots , health is not an issue i'm not happy , but i'm fine , he said i do take it personally , but i'm fine photo coach bill parcells says the jets are moving in the right direction \( ozier muhammad the new york times \) \( pg d3 \)
whatever happened to rumpus rooms \? there were millions of them a generation or so ago , and now not a trace can be found of that seemingly unique american institution oh , we have family rooms and dens and libraries and home theaters and the eversopromising great room , but the rumpus room has gone the way of the dodo does that mean that we as a country or as individuals have calmed down , tamed by our architecture into more sedate lives \? i have a theory that some of the mortal remains of the rumpus room have metamorphosed into wine cellars it is a comfort to think that a corner of the basement is still capable of providing a bit of excitement , although i would like to believe that none of us are causing a ruckus or raising a rumpus when we open a bottle of wine leslie ensor , editor of custom home magazine , reports on the growing popularity of wine cellars we 've noted the increase of this category since the wine cellar is a status symbol , the hot tub of the late 90 s ms ensor described a wine cellar she had seen in a house being considered for the magazine the wine cellar had been set into an arched niche in the basement and fitted with elaborate wroughtiron gates and an impressive lock unfortunately , the gap between the iron bars was large enough to allow one to reach through and extract a bottle she concluded consider whether the cellar is to be decorative or functional a wine cellar need not be in the cellar suitable storage can be found in all but the smallest of spaces , and even then , if one reassesses what is important to quality of life , a dozen bottles or so can be squeezed in somewhere kitchen and home stores and catalogues have simple racks in wood , plastic and metal some metal racks are positively sculptural and can be recycled into other rooms as the collection grows and storage matures some suggestions roll up fluffy hand towels and slot them into the remains of your first wine rack or sort some magazines into the compartments or display a salami collection or antique rolling pins when you are ready to move into more serious wine storage , consider the three enemies of wine heat , vibration and light those living near an elevated train line or over the tracks might not want to lay down chateau petrus , but vibration is usually not a serious consideration in wine storage avoiding excessive light frees up the kitchen windows for potted plants but heat is the real devil a steady temperature of 55 to 60 degrees fahrenheit is ideal for longterm storage those who have a spacious cellar at that temperature range must then decide on which types of racks are needed companies like the wine enthusiast in hawthorne 3459463 can help homeowners design the perfect cellar computergenerated images can give an idea of what the cellar will be like in any size space among the decisions are whether to use metal or wood racks if the answer is wood , then it is necessary to winnow down the choices to the one just right for one s esthetic and financial requirements installation can be doityourself or you can pay someone to do the job assembling all those bits and pieces can be a very timeconsuming , patienceeroding experience there are a lot of things in life one need do only once eating rattlesnake is one of those singular experiences , and assembling wine storage is another in the case of the rattlesnake , there is just so little return for your effort even a plump rattlesnake does n't have a lot of meat on its elegant bones less costly wine storage in terms of money and space is a freestanding unit that combines temperature and humidity control in cabinets ranging from under the counter to fullfledged , doubledoored behemoths holding 500 bottles such cabinets can be zoned to hold red , white and sparkling wines at the proper temperatures the doors can match the kitchen or the family room , but my preference is for glass doors the sight of several cases of good wine is a comfort even on days or nights when one is not serving wine another relic of the american past is also an ideal candidate for wine storage the fallout shelter in the backyard now is the time to replace the bottled water and emergency rations john thompson of ardmore , pa , told me about the real estate agent s problem when his parents' home went on the market in the early 60 s the senior thompsons built a fallout shelter with all the bells and whistles his father , a chemical engineer from princeton s class of 1927 , incorporated air filtration , secret passageways and hidden doors the shelter cost more than the original 1940 s house from behind the pingpong table in the rumpus room , the tunnel led to what my father envisioned as their last stop on earth the shelter was stocked with liquor , wine and navy rations , along with orange and black candlesticks and his princeton memorabilia , mr thompson said as appealing as it must have been to his parents , everyone had to agree with the real estate agent that it posed a problem in marketing out with the yearbooks and oldfashioned glasses in with the concept of a really secure wine cellar wine storage problems are not insurmountable a little ingenuity will provide a caring environment for 1 case or 100 and most people are better off without that rumpus room
it seemed a good idea at the time when a business acquaintance named jerome axelrod approached john paul dejoria , the cofounder of the paul mitchell line of haircare products , with a plan for distributing the company s shampoos , detanglers and sculpting sprays in the people s republic of china , mr dejoria jumped at the chance after all , why not have somebody you know someone you trust act as your representative in what is potentially one of the biggest consumer products markets in the world \? three years and one lawsuit later , mr dejoria is far from bubbly about the arrangement his privately held , 100 million company , which is based in santa clarita , calif , has broken off relations with mr axelrod , who also uses the name jerome alexander in business and mr dejoria is suing him , along with several other defendants , accusing them of creating a fraudulent operation in place of the promised distribution in china the lawsuit contends , among other things , that most of the products sent to china ended up back in the united states , often on drugstore and supermarket shelves , in violation of paul mitchell s policy of selling only through approved beauty salons last month , a federal judge in manhattan issued a temporary restraining order that prevents quality king , a distributor based in ronkonkoma , ny , that mr dejoria says worked in concert with mr axelrod , from selling paul mitchell products a lawyer for quality king , anthony j viola , said the company denies any knowledge of or participation in the fraud that is the centerpiece of paul mitchell s complaint stanley r goodman , a lawyer for mr axelrod , said he would be presenting viable defenses to this action the defendants have not yet filed a formal response with the court a burgeoning gray market for brandname merchandise with a certain perceived cachet gave rise to the situation , the lawsuit says now , mr dejoria , a veteran of overseas expansion in 48 other countries , says he has learned the hard way the company estimates its losses at as much as 45 million how not to do business in china if somebody wants to start out really big , be very cautious , he said the other day china is slow in development that was underscored by jeffrey e garten , the dean of the yale school of management who was under secretary of commerce for international trade during president clinton s first term professor garten has witnessed plenty of business disasters , as well as successes , in china the pepsis , the att s , the honeywells and general electric are really in it for the long term , he said they have very sophisticated strategies they have really dug in and invested in chinese communities , built education institutions in china and developed webs of connections with all levels of chinese society on the other hand , he said , many small companies tend to get carried away by the hype that china has suddenly become a market economy there are pockets of it , he added but in order to succeed in china today , you have to establish yourself as an entity that is aligned with the government s longterm goals that does n't mean communism , but it does mean training people and showing you are not a flybynight company and you actually care about chinese society here is a cautionary tale from the paul mitchell experience for businesses that want to expand abroad , whether in china or other difficult environments lured by a billion heads of hair mr dejoria said mr axelrod s offer seemed perfectly legitimate when it was made in 1996 to begin with , mr axelrod and his son , berin , spoke chinese and would be living and working in china and mr axelrod also had something of a high profile in the united states , thanks to his televised sales of cosmetics bearing the jerome alexander name on a homeshopping channel we said , 'now , jerome , this is strictly selling to salons , ' mr dejoria recalled 'no drugstores or supermarkets' he said 'i know that trust me' mr axelrod also signed a document , attached to the lawsuit , stating the terms of the distribution agreement , which limited sales to beauty salons in the people s republic of china paul mitchell began shipping products to mr axelrod s offices in shanghai , which operated under the name china distribution and marketing inc the first shipment went out in 1997 it was not until july of this year , after the company made its final shipment , mr dejoria said , that a paul mitchell employee who spoke chinese , anna wang , went to shanghai and found that nearly all the products had been rerouted from a dutyfree warehouse , where they were being stored , back to the united states , via rotterdam in the netherlands once in the united states , the lawsuit says , quality king dispensed them to drugstores , supermarkets and other outlets that were not salons mr goodman , who represents the axelrods and a third defendant , robert a seibel , who was china distribution s inhouse lawyer , said he found it curious that paul mitchell singled out chinese consumers who have more of a concern about putting food in their mouths and a roof over their heads than getting hold of paul mitchell products what would they be doing in communist china \? he asked about paul mitchell it just seems ludicrous to me

the perfect investment strategy stops working the moment you start following it so argues harry browne , a former investment newsletter editor who was the libertarian party s candidate for president in 1996 he s right many strategies that look good on paper have only been backtested , and very few are as successful in the real world consider the many attempts to improve on the dogs of the dow strategy , which recommends buying , on jan 1 of each year , the 10 highestyielding stocks among the 30 in the dow jones industrial average the strategy has beaten the dow by about three percentage points a year , on average , over the last 50 years , though with somewhat higher risk but that has n't been good enough for some advisers , who over the last decade have proposed a number of modifications to the strategy the first revision to find widespread popularity is known as the dow 5 , in contrast to the original strategy , which is sometimes called the dow 10 under the dow 5 strategy , investors would simply buy the five lowestpriced stocks among the dow 10 in backtesting , the dow 5 performed significantly better than the dow 10 the dow 5 , in turn , gave birth to the dow 4 a variation that drops the lowestpriced dog , which was found to be a true dog in performance as a result , backtested returns of the dow 4 were better than the dow 5 s research also found that the secondlowestpriced stock in the dow 5 was an especially good performer under a strategy called the penultimate profit prospect , as described by michael o'higgins and john downes in their 1992 book , beating the dow , an investor would buy just that one stock in backtesting , that strategy was an even better performer finally , a strategy called the modified dow 4 put two of those ideas together it used the dow 4 stocks , but gave double weight to the nexttolowestpriced stock how have these revised strategies performed in real life \? the hulbert financial digest has been tracking the dow 5 and the penultimate profit prospect since january 1993 , soon after they were proposed there is less of a newsletter record for the other modifications , but regardless of the tracking time , none has done as well as the original dogs of the dow in fact , none has beaten the dow itself that should n't be a surprise backtesting is suspect , because it can involve what statisticians call data mining searching a data base for a desired result , regardless of the causes such a search eventually leads to a discovery of a strategy that has worked wonderfully but that is n't the same thing as passing a realtime test of course , with fewer than 10 years of realworld results , however mediocre , statisticians ca n't be sure that these various modifications are inferior but there are reasons to be skeptical , according to grant mcqueen and steven thorley , associate professors of business management at brigham young university for example , the professors found , the modified dow 4 was significantly less profitable in the 20 years before 1972 than in the 20 years after that raises doubts , they say , that it will work in the future another finding raises more questions the professors duplicated studies that documented the strong post1972 performance of the modified dow 4 , making a simple change using july 1 , not jan 1 , as the date for making annual portfolio adjustments that calendar shift significantly reduced returns but if the modified dow 4 were truly onto something , its performance should have been immune to the change but the most important reason to be skeptical of the revised strategies is risk the dow 4 and dow 5 are about 50 percent riskier than the dow itself , and the penultimate profit prospect is nearly twice as risky accordingly , the proper benchmark against which to compare their performance is n't the dow , but a hypothetical dow that has been leveraged to match their heightened risk even during the backtesting periods in which the revised strategies performed so well , they nevertheless lagged behind this riskadjusted index chart not the best of breed since the beginning of 1993 , two proposed modifications to the dogs of the dow strategy have not only failed to keep up with the dogs but have also lagged behind the dow industrial average itself annual average return penultimate profit prospect 159 dow 5 217 dogs of the dow 222 dow industrials 233 through april 30 \( source hulbert financial digest \)
the trial of four officers accused of brutalizing a haitian immigrant in brooklyn opened yesterday with prosecutors and defense lawyers offering graphic details of their versions of events in a case that has inflamed racial tension in the city jurors and spectators in a packed courtroom in federal district court in brooklyn listened intently as the prosecutor , kenneth p thompson , described what he called the cruel and simply inhumane attack in 1997 on the immigrant , abner louima , whose case prompted a series of angry marches and protests and led to a federal investigation into possible patterns of brutality in the police department mr louima is black , and the four officers accused in the case are white mr louima , the prosecutor said , had been beaten in a police car by four officers , one of whom , mr thompson said , later violently shoved a broken piece of a broomstick into mr louima s rectum and then his mouth in a police station restroom , literally tearing his insides apart later , a defense lawyer for one of the officers suggested in his opening statement that mr louima was not the victim of police brutality , but had suffered the injuries to his rectum and bladder in an act of consensual sex with another man before he had come into contact with the police you will hear from a forensic pathologist and you will hear from other medical doctors that the injuries sustained by mr louima are not , i repeat , not consistent with a nonconsensual insertion of an object into his rectum , the lawyer , marvyn m kornberg , said mr kornberg is representing officer justin a volpe , who mr thompson said in his opening statement attacked mr louima with the stick mr thompson said the officer mistakenly believed that mr louima , 32 , had punched him , knocking him down , during a street brawl outside a nightclub in flatbush , brooklyn , in august 1997 but in an account not previously made public , mr thompson said that it was actually a cousin of mr louima who had punched officer volpe , who is 27 , and that mr louima and his family had lied about this to protect the cousin mr kornberg responded that it was only one of several lies mr louima told as part of an effort to concoct brutality claims that could bring him millions of dollars in a civil suit he has filed against the city he said that a trace of mr louima s feces found in the police station bathroom contains the dna of another male you are going to be shown how somebody else s dna can get into another individual s feces , the lawyer said the prosecution has said in pretrial proceedings that its own medical expert will testify that mr louima s severe injuries a torn rectum and ruptured bladder that hospitalized him for two months were caused by a blunt object being forcefully inserted into his rectum and yesterday mr thompson declared that the trial was about torture the torture of a badly beaten and helpless man by two new york city police officers , a reference to officer volpe and another of the four officers on trial on charges of violating mr louima s civil rights , charles schwarz , who mr thompson said had held a crying mr louima down while officer volpe used the stick but that was n't enough , mr thompson said , adding that when officer volpe pulled out the stick , it had blood and feces on it , and that the officer then shoved that stick in his mouth the louima case was initially prosecuted by the brooklyn district attorney , charles j hynes , but he later turned it over to the united states attorney in brooklyn , zachary w carter the two officials said the rules for introducing evidence are more favorable to prosecutors in federal court and that conviction on federal civil rights charges could bring stiffer sentences for the officers than conviction on state sexual abuse and assault charges if convicted in federal court , officers volpe and schwarz could be sentenced up to life in prison like mr kornberg , the lawyers for the other defendants officers schwarz , thomas wiese and thomas bruder all said that the evidence would show that their clients had not committed the crimes they are charged with while all four are accused of beating mr louima in a police car after his arrest in the flatbush street brawl , only officers volpe and schwarz are accused of torturing him in the restroom of the 70th precinct station house a fifth defendant on trial , sgt michael bellomo , is accused of trying to cover up the alleged beating in the police car officer volpe and the sergeant are also charged with violating the civil rights of another haitian immigrant , patrick antoine , the officer by assaulting him in the vicinity of the nightclub and the sergeant by joining in arresting him on false charges to conceal the beating saying that sergeant bellomo had committed none of those acts , his lawyer , john patten , termed his client a straitlaced , nononsense supervisor and the type of supervisor who covers for no one
the battle of new orleans by robert v remini illustrated 226 pp new york viking 2495 it was a battle that possessed all the ingredients of a grand hollywood epic film a homegrown , popular military hero nicknamed old hickory , whose brilliant generalship on the battlefield led to his election as president of the united states a ragtag militia of regular and citizen soldiers that included creoles , frontiersmen , indian sharpshooters , free blacks , the people of new orleans , the notorious pirate jean lafitte and his renegade privateers , all marching into battle to the strains of yankee doodle and la marseillaise arrayed against them were the mighty british navy and the most elite regiments of the duke of wellington s victorious army , fresh from their defeat of napoleon at waterloo it should have been a rout , this unequal battle between some 8 , 000 british regulars supremely confident of crushing all opposition in their path and andrew jackson s incongruous group of defenders , whose numbers were barely half that of their enemy fought in the most unlikely of places , the battle of new orleans possessed none of the ingredients of the great setpiece battles of the civil war or the two world wars the bloody monthlong clash took place along the banks of the mississippi river on the plains of chalmette below new orleans in december 1814 and january 1815 it was the climactic battle of america s forgotten war of 1812 , and its unlikely outcome changed the course of american history despite winning independence in 1776 , the united states was still regarded with disdain by the great european powers , which believed the upstart new nation had a very insecure future as a democracy britain was still smarting from the humiliating loss of its colonies and determined to crush the united states once and for all its intentions were unmistakable to destroy and lay waste the principal towns and commercial cities to that end , the british encouraged indian insurrection and british ships violated american sovereignty with impunity , seizing american vessels and impressing their sailors to help fight britain s war with napoleon by late 1814 , the war of 1812 , which emanated from these longsimmering disputes , had left the eastern united states under naval blockade , and the nation was on the verge of losing its precious independence the british intended to dismember the republic by having one army take control of the mississippi river and then join with an army moving south from canada however , for their grand strategy to succeed , the british had to capture the bustling , multiracial port city of new orleans robert v remini , whose superb threevolume biography of andrew jackson won the national book award , here turns to jackson s prowess as a military commander , during a seemingly lost period of our history when , in his words , the united states had heroes and reveled in them when he learned of the british intention to seize new orleans , jackson responded by thundering , i will smash them , so help me god ! smash them he did british aspirations were doomed to failure when their commanders played directly into jackson s hands by relying on the outdated stratagem of fighting in massed formations cleverly prepared defenses and unorthodox tactics enabled the americans to repel repeated british onslaughts , while jackson s tennessee marksmen picked off any redcoat who strayed into their sights the result was a massacre from which , remini notes , his majesty s army lay in shreds under jackson s remarkable leadership the american victory at new orleans was one of the most improbable tales of audacity , courage and battlefield genius ever recorded two of the four british generals , including the commander in chief , were killed , and another was gravely wounded this was an ignoble conclusion to the invasion of louisiana and a stake in the heart of the british campaign to vanquish the former colony instead , the remnants of a once proud army were compelled to retreat and sail away emptyhanded it was america s first great military victory and a defining moment for the nation at a single stroke , old hickory had established himself as one of america s greatest generals and the savior of the nation for some time it was thought that jan 8 , 1815 the day all hope of a british victory ignominiously ended would be commemorated as the date the united states won its second war of independence one newspaper proclaimed who would not be an american \? long live the republic ! sadly , jackson s great victory at new orleans did not stand the fickle test of time in the american experience , in part because it actually occurred after a peace treaty concluding the war of 1812 was signed in ghent in december 1814 yet , as remini declares , in that one glorious moment the nation had demonstrated that it had the strength , will and ability to defend its freedom and prove to the world that it was here to stay this is an exceptional book that combines impressive scholarship with a riveting narrative hollywood may never make the movie , but in the battle of new orleans remini has brilliantly documented a landmark battle that has , for too long , been buried in the unremembered pages of american history drawing \( boris kulikov \)
white sulphur springs , w va , march 26 the paradox of a luxury resort in a workingclass county has always been apparent here in southeastern west virginia but now it is fueling a political fight , pitting the values of rural christian fundamentalists against a life style of golf , aromatherapy and finger bowls with breakfast for the second time this century , the greenbrier is planning to expand almost 90 years ago , the owners built a golf course that helped turn the stately hotel into one of the nation s bestknown resorts , a favorite of the rich and the famous now , as it faces financial uncertainty because of a dwindling number of visitors in the winter , expansion plans are under way again this time the owners want to convert a oncesecret bomb shelter built under the hotel for the use of congress in the event of a nuclear war into west virginia s first casino , for the exclusive use of the greenbrier s guests proponents say the casino would generate new jobs and tax revenue that are desperately needed in west virginia , one of the poorest states in the nation a study for the greenbrier by west virginia university says the casino would pump an additional 34 million into the local economy but building another golf course at the resort might be easier led by local church leaders who regard gambling as evil , many residents of greenbrier county are vowing to defeat a county referendum that would allow the casino to open , no matter what economic benefits it might generate even guests at the greenbrier , who now pay as much as 645 a night at the peak of the golf season , say they are not sure casino gambling belongs at a place so genteel that signs posted outside elevators at night ask for quiet , saying , it s sleepy time down south when i walked in here for the first time i thought i was stepping back in time , it was so elegant , said becky belew , a lawyer from stuart s draft , va if you allow gambling to come in here , you would somehow diminish that the casino s leading opponents are less concerned with elegance than decadence for years , they say , they have cherished the 672room hotel as a good neighbor and the chief economic engine of greenbrier county the hotel staff grows to 1 , 600 during peak seasons , making it , by far , the largest employer in a threecounty area and jobs pay well even dishwashers can earn 10 an hour but opponents fear casino gambling will usher in a new era at the greenbrier , which is owned by the csx corporation , a holding company primarily engaged in transportation operations and based in richmond many say they fear that a casino would attract the wrong kind of people and fuel addictions to gambling , causing many to lose far more than they can afford i love the greenbrier , said the rev patricia jarvis , a vocal opponent of the casino who is pastor of the the united methodist church in lewisburg i am certainly in favor of anything that strengthens it but i do n't think this is the way you look around where gambling is a part of the landscape , and you see it has ruined the moral texture of the place the rev mark flynn , pastor of the trinity united methodist church in nearby ronceverte , said my intention is not to prevent people from having a good time my intention is to prevent a large outofstate corporation from setting up shop in my county to prey upon people who have a problem objections by religious leaders are all the more striking in that only paying , registered guests of the greenbrier would be permitted inside the casino after rebuffing the hotel s lobbying efforts for five years , state lawmakers this month passed a narrowly written bill that bars outsiders from entering and prohibits the management from offering free rooms as a lure to wellheeled guests the way hotels in las vegas , nev , and atlantic city do the legislation would also channel a large portion of the casino s revenue to the state 52 percent of the money from slot machines and 37 percent from gaming tables greenbrier county would get 4 percent of the gross revenue , the town of white sulphur springs 2 percent and the remaining six towns in the county would share another 2 percent gov cecil h underwood , a probusiness republican who is facing reelection next year , is expected to sign the bill soon but state lawmakers left final approval to voters in greenbrier county as a concession to those who oppose gambling in general and fought the legislation on the ground that the state has all the gambling it needs in three horse racing tracks , a dog track and a lottery county officials predict that the referendum will go before voters next year , giving both sides time to plot strategy in what could become a bitter and costly fight already , the fight is under way some church leaders have begun preaching against gambling in their sunday sermons at ms jarvis s church , which opposes even raffles and bingo , officials have circulated fliers that quotes the church s book of discipline , which says gambling is a menace to society , deadly to the best interests of moral , social , economic and spiritual life , and destructive of good government as an act of faith and concern , christians should abstain from gambling and should strive to minister to those victimized by the practice

that , soon after mr dottin s body was recovered , the federal bureau of investigation , acting at the police s request , had identified him as a result , it was only two weeks ago that ms fowler was notified that her son was dead , apparently the result of an accident the authorities have attributed the lapse to miscommunication between the two agencies yesterday , friends and relatives traveled

her son missing to detectives in queens five days later , mr dottin s body was pulled out of the river near 38th street the authorities say it appeared mr dottin had died accidentally , perhaps by

had been able to match fingerprints taken from the body to an arrest record mr dottin had in california on a gunpossession charge , new york detectives never followed up with the bureau and the fbi never reported its findings to the police , police officials said we know what a tragic loss this is , and know how difficult it was not knowing what had happened to her son , said marilyn mode , the police department s chief spokeswoman we hope this will bring closure and if there is anything we can do to help her , we will the fbi is looking into the incident mr dottin was buried yesterday at

hempstead , ny , oct 6 in a jets locker room in which otis smith grimaced and vinny testaverde and leon johnson hobbled around on crutches , wayne chrebet today wore his broadest smile in a month the wide receiver was going to practice for the first time since breaking a bone in his left foot in the final exhibition game 33 days ago if he is able to play against jacksonville , in the jets' first monday night home game in seven years , it will lessen the impact of the team s string of injuries today was also an important practice for both marcus coleman and ray mickens at right cornerback coach bill parcells will make a decision later this week about which one replaces smith at the position coleman had a productive game against the broncos last sunday that included a pair of late interceptions , while mickens , who has been trying to overcome a spate of penalty calls , made a big sack while stripping the ball from quarterback brian griese while keyshawn johnson has continued to star in chrebet s absence , and dedric ward has made some big plays in his place , the jets have not been making the thirddown receptions that have become a chrebet specialty in fact , in their struggle toward respectability , the jets \( 13 \) do not have a receiver who ranks in the american football conference s top 10 on thirddown catches chrebet , a former league leader , was third last season it s not so much what i do in practice today , but how i feel tomorrow , chrebet said , as he put on the football shoe with an orthopedic insert to make sure nothing disrupts the threeinch titanium screw that is now part of his foot after practice , parcells said he did ok he did not take a lot of reps there was nothing unusual chrebet was not supposed to be ready for at least two more weeks , and perhaps for another month but on tuesday , he went through a private workout for parcells the coach went out of his way during the workout to make chrebet struggle i know what foot he s got the problem with , and i was purposely making him cut on that foot , parcells said he ca n't fool me chrebet , who has been getting electrical stimulation , massage and acupuncture on the foot , was satisfied with the way it held up it did n't react today , which was a key , he said actually , chrebet admitted , he had been testing it sooner than the jets' medical staff had cleared him to i ca n't tell them that , he said , but i 've been walking on it quite a while parcells said that chrebet would play if he felt able to there was none of the danger of reinjury , claimed the coach , as there was when smith broke his left collarbone again on the first play of the game with the broncos i felt so bad for him when i learned about it at halftime , coleman said coleman played at nickel back while mickens replaced smith but coleman impressed parcells with a specialteams tackle and another to save a first down , in addition to the interceptions of bubby brister coleman has lost several chances to start at either cornerback or safety , but at 6 feet 2 inches and 210 pounds , he is the size that parcells dreams about in cornerbacks marcus s problem has always been the same problem it s his inability to concentrate play after play after play , parcells said there s a big difference in becoming a starter and sustaining it it s a big problem parcells added we 've spent what seems to be an inordinate amount of time with him maybe he feels good about what he s done coleman said he does , and that he even experienced an epiphany of sorts in the game during the week he had spoken to parcells about concentrating maybe my time is now , coleman said today the first couple of games i was too tense last week i said , 'whatever happens , happens' i said i 'll have fun i can use my size to an advantage i guess that s my strong suit at corner mickens , of course , is aware not only of coleman s size , but his own the 58 mickens has faced the size issue his entire career my margin for error is small , he said i know i 'll be rotating with marcus in practice i know i have n't given up a touchdown , but i ca n't let anything happen chrebet , meanwhile , can rejoice that parcells wo n't give him the unconventional pain test he sprang on his wide receiver last year while nursing a sprained ankle , chrebet felt a sharp pain parcells had kicked him in the sore spot to see how badly it hurt there was nothing malicious about it , parcells claimed today perhaps not , but chrebet said of that test , i made it known that if he did it this time , there 'd be repercussions extra points bill parcells may use cornerback corey sawyer as a punt returner in place of dedric ward sawyer had missed two games after injuring a hamstring the club signed a defensive tackle longsnapper , dennis o sullivan , who was among the last players cut by the 49ers before the season otis smith said he played the first half against denver until the pain in his broken left collarbone became too severe photo jets' wayne chrebet was on crutches three weeks ago , but yesterday he worked out for the first time since injuring his left foot 33 days ago \( barton silverman the

trapping all the occupants inside as the man left again in the landlord s car fire chief michael canty , of battalion 57 , said , there is flammable liquid found in the hallway on the second floor and we are doing an investigation into arson another fire official , deputy chief philip j burns , of division 11 in brooklyn , said that workers from the department of environmental protection had begun

the house , and saw that the whole place was in flames there was a lot of smoke and some of it was coming into our house the cops were pulling people out of windows and people were jumping out of other windows she and other neighbors added that the police had been called to the house many times in the past during what appeared to be domestic disturbances she noted that there appeared to have been one such quarrel on friday night , adding , we heard fighting last night and there always was a lot of fighting , but as far as we know they never hurt anyone it appeared that the police were first sent to the building yesterday shortly after an assault was reported , but no arrests were made because the angry tenant who is suspected of setting the fire had left by then and the officers decided that it had been little more than an argument , said lieut sean crowley , a police department spokesman four officers on patrol were the first to reach the scene when they arrived , two residents on the first floor were trying to break open their front window to escape the smoke filling their apartment there was this raging fire coming out of the front door and off the roof , said officer michael knott , 32 , adding that his attention was caught by the man and woman banging on their window they were screaming for help and he was trying to break the window from inside but could n't , officer knott said i picked up a halffull garbage can and hit it but had to do it twice , then tried to climb up on a wooden bench but it was too low finally a neighbor came with a ladder in a matter of seconds their apartment was engulfed in flames as the officers helped the couple out the window , they said , other residents were jumping from the second and third floors moments later , firefighters working their way up through the building found an unconscious and badly burned man in a secondfloor closet another was found nearby , while a third was discovered on the thirdfloor landing , fire officials said the burnedout building was a haven for those down on their luck and in need of help , residents and neighbors said one resident , j t bowman , said that he suffered from schizophrenia and that the other occupants of the threestory brownstone , six men and two women , were on medication for mental conditions or receiving counseling for drug and alcohol abuse he said they paid their rent of 300 to 400 with supplemental security income checks he said he felt lucky because he was in the hospital at the time of the fire i got hit by a car , he said , adding that when he was released from the hospital yesterday morning , the whole place was burned down i do n't know what i should think , but i'm going to have to find a place to live , he added maybe being hit by the car was n't so bad because i probably would have been inside sleeping family members said mr mixson , one of the victims , was a handyman he was a nice person who just liked to joke around , said

albanians from their homes albanians view nato as allies of the rebels but at the same time , the peacekeepers have been at pains to stress that they are a neutral force , trying to protect serbs as

was briefly held by the rebels last year on sunday , the rebels took over what had been the serbian customs post at the morini border crossing to albania , through which the bulk of the bedraggled refugees had poured at the end of march and early april about 10 to 15 guerrillas were guarding the morini station late sunday , according to andrea angeli , spokesman of the organization for security and cooperation in europe in the wrecked city of suva reka , the kla had set up its own checkpoints today , manned by bearded rebels in black berets , although there were no people in evidence and little traffic prizren today echoed with chants of the kosovo liberation army s initials , uck in albanian , pronounced oochekah in the shkollaere district , the guerrillas strutted about in uniforms and pieces of uniforms , some in camouflage , many in varying shades of black one had a lilac in the muzzle of his ak47 and an unlit cigarette tucked behind his ear under a baseball cap people came out to take pictures and videotapes of themselves with the guerrillas i am feeling great as an albanian , said hysen huseni , who said he had been fighting for a year and a half in the drenica region

sleeveless lakers basketball shirt , said his men controlled the whole part of the city except for the three main roads out , which he said they would leave clear for the serbs to use to depart he said his troops would act as a kind of police force in the initial unsettled period until nato forces took full control it s enough in this moment before the full deployment of the international peacekeepers , he said for the present situation , it is very important to protect against criminals , people who want to make profit from the situation as for serbian civilians , the kla will not touch them commander drini , who said he speaks seven languages and wore purple socks and adidas mountain running shoes with his camouflage uniform , readily acknowledged that his men had fired into the air as the tail of the serbian convoy passed yes , there was shooting , it was about 100 people right in front of me , he said i said , 'ok guys , you have used up half the ammunition , ' he added but to see the albanian flag in the streets of prizren after ten years , it s an emotional experience what can i say \? the commander , whose nom de guerre means river in tribute , he said , to his love of fishing said the kla would disarm if its political leadership told it to , but implied that this might have little real meaning what does it mean to disarm , he said it is an albanian tradition to have one arm with you , he said , slapping his hip like a holster we could n't have a worse situation than 1998 to '99 , he added anyway , the domination of the serb forces is over that is what mattered most to mr haziri , the triumphant rebel we are very happy , he said when we came here the people were very happy they think they are safe now from the serbs photos the kosovo

a bronx judge said yesterday that he would interview members of the grand jury hearing evidence in the amadou diallo shooting case before making a final decision on whether to delay and possibly move the inquest to a secret location there have been demonstrations nearly every day outside state supreme court in the bronx , a block from where the grand jury is impaneled in criminal court and lawyers for three of the four police officers involved in the killing of mr diallo , 22 , filed the motion seeking to delay the proceedings and change the venue last week , asserting that the inflammatory atmosphere outside the courthouse had unduly influenced the grand jurors although he did not delay the grand jury proceedings yesterday , justice robert g seewald of state supreme court declined to close the door on the issue , saying he wanted to determine whether the jurors had been tainted by the wealth of publicity surrounding the case he has made a tentative decision , denying at this juncture to stay the proceedings or move the grand jury , said bruce goldstock , justice seewald s clerk but that could change , depending on the outcome of the interviews mr goldstock said that justice seewald would conduct separate , closeddoor interviews with each of the 23 jurors sometime within the week the grand jury was convened on feb 16 to decide if charges should be filed against the four officers who fired 41 shots at mr diallo , who was unarmed , on feb 4 , as he stood in the vestibule of his apartment building in the soundview section if indicted , the four officers sean carroll , edward mcmellon , richard murphy and kenneth boss could face charges ranging from criminally negligent homicide to seconddegree murder legal experts said the judge s decision was a sensible approach to a potentially thorny issue the judge is saying that he is going to make sure there is no improper influence , which i think is a reasonable action for him to take , said stephen gillers , a professor at new york university school of law but i do n't think that the judge s subsequent inquiry will change the result of his decision steven reed , a spokesman for the bronx district attorney s office , would not comment on the judge s move but stephen worth , a police union lawyer who is representing officer mcmellon in the inquiry , said that while yesterday s decision was far from a victory for the officers , he was pleased that the judge had the courage to recognize the extraordinary situation occurring here mr worth added that the judge had fashioned a remedy that will attempt to assure the officers the right to a fair and impartial grand jury presentation although none of the officers involved in mr diallo s killing have agreed to testify before the grand jury , mr worth said that he and the lawyers representing officers murphy and boss would be more likely to offer up their clients if the motion was decided in their favor what is required is for the drums to stop beating , for the daily media events to stop and let a period of time pass so that the grand jury can focus their attention on what is happening in the grand jury room , instead of what s happening outside , he said then , our clients would in all likelihood testify we all made that point today officer carroll s lawyer , marvyn m kornberg , did not join in the motion and has publicly stated that his client would not testify mr kornberg said he had not made his client available to the grand jury because he believed that the indictment of the four officers was a fait accompli but he also hinted at another motive yesterday , noting that if one of the defendants testifies before a grand jury and the district attorney then attempts to use that defendant s testimony at trial , i will have the option of seeking a separate trial
ritzville , wash , aug 18 on long summer days , the amber waves of grain of america the beautiful come to life here in the gentle hills of eastern washington , more so in moist years , still true even in a terribly dry one like this but on many farms , the harvest is soon followed by flames , as growers take a match to their fields to clear the wheat stubble and prepare for another planting season on some days the air is thick with the smoke , and it often drifts from the farms to spokane , the largest city in the region , blowing ill will along with the acrid fumes the decadesold practice of field burning , used by farmers here and in many other parts of the country as the cheapest , most efficient way to clear stubble , weeds and diseasebearing pests , is under increasing attack in many places , especially where the farms are not far from cities whose residents lead lives that are not tied to agriculture there are alternatives to burning , said patricia hoffman , president of save our summers , an environmental group based in spokane that is leading a fight to have the practice eliminated there are n't alternatives to breathing but for farmers here and in the heavily agricultural palouse region along the washingtonidaho border , south of spokane , the issue is not that simple burning is a tool we want to have in our toolbox , said brett blankenship , a thirdgeneration wheat farmer who lives in ritzville and is president of the adams county association of wheat growers it s one of the best ways to clear the fields without chemicals , without drastic tillage measures that cause a lot of erosion earlier this summer , a federal panel advising agriculture secretary dan glickman on environmental issues conducted a threeday tour of spokane and nearby farms the chairman of the panel , which is expected to make recommendations to alleviate the problem , described the inland northwest as a national hot spot for the fieldburning debate and officials with the state s department of ecology , who have declared smoke from the burning to be a significant regional health problem , negotiated a deal with farmers this year intended to reduce the annual amount of stubble burning in the next seven years to half last year s level of 230 , 000 acres in eastern washington \( that was about 7 percent of the wheat acreage in the area farmers generally use fire for especially heavy concentrations of stubble , and clear and reseed other fields with different methods , including tilling \) the longterm goal for both farmers , who hope to avoid a ban or more severe limits on burning , and environmental groups is to figure out better ways to grow wheat that can head off both the need for burning and the erosion problems associated with tilling the wheat farmers have even helped pay for studies at local universities but none of these moves have quelled the debate so far , as environmental groups say the current agreement still allows far too much burning the bottom line is , we do n't allow other industries to pose such a clear public health risk simply because it s cheaper or easier to do it that way , said tim connor , a spokesman for the northwest environmental education foundation , a group based in spokane here in ritzville , about 60 miles southwest of spokane , farmers are feeling beleaguered by the issue , and it is not too surprising to find that few local people seem to consider the latesummer and earlyfall burning objectionable the town was built on wheat it was settled by german pioneers in the 1800 s who for a time

gordon , the manager of a local video store , said of the burning we know what they 're doing , and it s all a part of the growing cycle erin lamping , an insurance clerk , said , i hardly even notice it but many others describe the situation very differently when the smoke comes , it is clearly an irritant , both to the chest and to the eyes and for the elderly , children and thousands of people in the region with asthma or other health problems , it can have far more serious effects while the wheat burning is expected to get under way in a matter of weeks , farmers who raise grass seed have already started to burn in neighboring idaho on one recent day , more than two dozen people called a state health line there to complain about the smoke from a 1 , 100acre fire on the rathdrum prairie in northern idaho and at a daycare center in nearby post falls , idaho , workers kept nearly 150 children inside all day rather than expose them to the smoke people are beside themselves , they do n't

weeks is unclear many farmers have struggled through a drought this summer , alleviated only a bit by rains that have come in recent weeks last year , with much more rain , the region clearly lived up to its reputation as one of the most productive wheatgrowing areas anywhere , and the results of the harvest piled up in the grain elevators that dot the rustic landscape , later to be shipped all over the world this year s harvest is expected to be down by 30 percent to 50 percent , which will also reduce somewhat the amount of stubble in the fields and the smoke from it many farmers do not burn their fields at all , using other methods to clear them jerry l zahl , a farmer near walla walla and a former board member of the washington association of wheat growers , sent a letter to state agricultural officials earlier this year in which he described field burning as a sin against the land , the air and the water and urged that the practice be eliminated but mr blankenship said almost any method of clearing the fields carried environmental consequences erosion , for instance , can ruin productivity and foul waterways we 're trying to strike a balance with all of the environmental issues in play , mr blankenship said we 're trying to comply with the clean water act , the endangered species act , the clean air act , all at the same time the issue has turned increasingly contentious over the years two environmental advocates were convicted of trespassing this year and sentenced to small fines and community service for their role in an effort to document burning practices last summer and save our summers recently filed a lawsuit against the state department of ecology , complaining that the agency withheld documents that might show it was too permissive in striking a deal with the farmers to reduce the burning the environmental groups are pressing for drastic reductions in the amount of burning that goes on now , and some leaders of the antiburn drive talk of pressing the state legislature to outlaw the practice altogether , a move that some farmers say could prove ruinous to them that would put too many family farmers out of business altogether , mr blankenship said we feel boxed in we 're willing to do our part for a better environment , but now they 're asking us to do more than our part photo the burning season has begun for grassseed

the indictment of slobodan milosevic by the international war crimes tribunal told us nothing new about his character or his record he has been carrying out crimes against humanity since 1991 , when his forces leveled the croatian city of vukovar and executed 260 men in a vukovar hospital but the indictment does make a difference , a profound one it clarifies the nature of nato s war against mr milosevic over kosovo and it requires those who have been critical of that war to think again about which side they are on just as mr milosevic is the first serving head of state to be charged with war crimes , so this war is a first the reason was eloquently stated by president vaclav havel of the czech republic last month in a speech to the canadian parliament , reprinted in the new york review of books this is probably the first war that has not been waged in the name of 'national interests , ' president havel said , but rather in the name of principles and values kosovo has no oilfields to be coveted no member nation in the alliance nato has any territorial demands on kosovo it is fighting out of concern for the fate of others it is fighting because no decent person can stand by and watch the systematic statedirected murder of other people nato air attacks have killed serbian civilians that is regrettable but it is a price that has to be paid when a nation falls in behind a criminal leader it happened in germany and it has happened again in serbia how can a young man , a serbian paramilitary , demand money from an albanian family for a child s life and , when they have none to give , knife the child \? that , and other savageries , could take place only because an evil leader had infected his people with the notion that others are less human are untermenschen even serbs distant from the atrocities have been affected reports from belgrade say most people see themselves as victims they are oblivious to what serbian forces have done to other human beings over the last eight years oblivious to vukovar , to the rape camps and ethnic cleansing in bosnia , to the massacres in kosovo in 1992 the serbian commander in bosnia , ratko mladic , told his gunners in the hills around sarajevo , burn it all and they did hospitals , universities , mosques , homes that should be remembered when serbs today describe themselves as victims that nato s purpose is just does not , of course , mean that it has fought the war wisely it has not serious military analysts are agreed that the alliance should not have forsworn the use of ground troops at the start of its campaign , and should not have begun the air war so tepidly nor was the war inevitable american diplomacy went in fits and starts before the final crisis , seeming to lose its way in dealing with mr milosevic s broken promises on kosovo in the critical months beginning in january 1998 president clinton was persistently distracted by a special prosecutor obsessed by sex and mr milosevic well knew that but we are in the war now , and for the most urgent political as well as moral reasons we must win even achieving nato s declared objectives in kosovo will not necessarily end the menace of slobodan milosevic unless he is captured , he will no doubt make more trouble in montenegro and elsewhere but victory , limited though it be , is essential the indictment of mr milosevic may change the politics of the war in this country many republicans have tried to use the war politically that was the strategy of representative tom delay , the gop whip , when a motion to support the war came before the house he urged republicans to vote no , making it bill clinton s war an astonishing position for a party that usually touts its patriotism the motion lost on a tie vote the president should go to the country now , on the strength of the milosevic indictment , to tell people what this war is about he needs stronger public support as a moment of truth approaches a summit meeting of the seven leading economic powers and russia will be held in cologne on june 18 if the air war has not brought mr milosevic to accept nato s demands by then , the prospect of winter means that the unthinkable will have to be confronted a ground war
in an attempt to stave off threatened state and federal regulation of movies and video games , the nation s video rental stores and video game makers , with the cooperation of the motion picture industry , have joined forces in a push toward selfpolicing their effort , which comes in the wake of highprofile teenage shootings in colorado and georgia last spring , includes a move to beef up restrictions on the sale and rental of some products to minors we want to make it clear this level of parental control is the right vehicle , and home video stores are well equipped to handle this , said bo andersen , president of the video software dealers association , which represents more than 19 , 000 video rental stores , about twothirds of the nation s total this week , members of the association independent video rental stores as well as chains like blockbuster and hollywood video are beginning to display brightly colored posters highlighting their updated pledge to parents campaign some posters explain the voluntary movie ratings system that has been administered by the motion picture association of america for the last 30 years others highlight video game ratings , created in 1994 by the entertainment software rating board signs point out that without parental consent , the store will not rent or sell to children under 17 videotapes or video games designated as restricted in addition , when adults apply for membership at a video store , or at any point thereafter , they can elect to prohibit the sale or rental of certain types of video games and movies to their children for some stores , including the blockbuster chain , such moves supplement optional restrictions already in place in about a month , video game makers will begin their own push , which will include ads in national parent and familyoriented magazines as well as posters and pamphlets for retailers , said doug lowenstein , president of the interactive digital software association , a trade group the group also is asking retailers to restrict to people over 17 sales of video games rated mature , , or adults only by the entertainment software rating board , mr lowenstein said we believe we have a great rating system , mr lowenstein said this is about making it as well known as it possibly can be bowing to concerns raised by the clinton administration about how violent games are marketed to children , the video game makers and their ratings board have established guidelines to limit gratuitous violence , sexual content and profanity in advertising video games the guidelines are to take effect at the end of january the moves by these groups follow an announcement in june by the national association of theater owners that theaters would check identification and prohibit minors from viewing adultrated movies video dealers and game makers are planning to have most of the revised educational material for their campaign in place before the christmas holiday selling season while the video game rating system has been in existence since 1994 , and most games now sold include a rating logo , most parents know little about the system and few stores enforce any limits on sales or rentals according to the national institute on media and the family s 1998 video and computer game report card , only 40 percent of parents surveyed said they routinely checked the ratings of the games their children buy or rent only 5 percent of parents could identify a popular maturerated game , duke nukem , while 80 percent of junior high school students were familiar with the title in addition , only 21 percent of the retailers it surveyed enforced ratings policies on the sale of games less than half the retail and rental employees understood the rating system and few stores educated employees about it , the report said although there is a rating system , there s not a lot of knowledge about it , said david walsh , president and founder of the national institute on media and the family , a nonprofit group based in minneapolis moreover , he said , most adults over the age of 30 have no idea what s in these games because they ca n't play them anxiety about game violence and about how inappropriate games are marketed to children comes as the video game industry is enjoying its greatest popularity ever from their start as twodimensional blips on a screen in the early 1970 s to today s nearmoviequality narratives , video games have grown into a more than 6 billion industry they have spawned movies , toys , clothing lines and even a postage stamp the navy has even incorporated a flight simulator game developed by microsoft into its pilot training program through oct 3 , video stores rented about 213 million video games this year , compared with about 23 billion videotapes , according to the video software dealers association last year , stores took in 804 million on game rentals , a 50 percent increase over 1997 , and 81 billion on videotape rentals , a 96 percent rise in the wake of the school shootings this year , several states , including new york and pennsylvania , have proposed legislation to ban the sale , rental or public viewing of violent games to minors , or to establish stategoverned rating systems and an amendment pending in congress would mandate a universal ratings system and prohibit the rental or sale of any unrated product but the issue has been around a while , and other states , including arkansas , florida and minnesota , had already proposed similar legislation none of the bills have become law , according to the video software dealers association and others watching the issue education and voluntary compliance with retailers is probably going to get us further , mr walsh said as soon as we start passing laws , there are going to be challenges earlier industry efforts to head off government regulation included the original pledge to parents campaign , introduced in 1991 and intended largely to limit children s access to sexual content since it was established in 1994 , the entertainment software rating board has rated more than 5 , 000 computer and video games more than 70 percent of the products have been rated e , or suitable for anyone over 6 7 percent have been rated m or mature , and less than 1 percent have been rated ao for adults only , mr lowenstein said the industry may have a tough time persuading retailers to take bold moves to restrict access to some of the products they sell earlier this year , for example , fao schwarz , the toy emporium , reversed a plan to remove all toy guns from its shelves , saying the toys' bright colors kept them from being mistaken for real weapons , a company spokesman said but a handful of fao schwarz stores , including the flagship fifth avenue location in manhattan , did remove about a dozen video games from shelves because of their violent content a kmart spokesman said the chain had no official restrictions , though it has refused to sell some games it has deemed inappropriate and an official for kb toys , the retailer based in pittsfield , mass , said the company did not have any plans to restrict the sale of adultrated video games employees explain the ratings system to parents and other customers , but there are no pamphlets or educational posters in stores now , he said we make parents aware of the ratings , he said , but we do n't make a judgment chart rating games retailers plan to begin using ratings developed by the entertainment software ratings board to restrict who may rent or buy video games here is the ratings system early childhood content suitable for persons ages 3 and older everyone content suitable for persons ages 6 and older teen content suitable for

washington , sept 14 former senator bill bradley picked up the endorsement of a national environmental organization today , dealing a blow to vice president al gore s efforts to cast himself as the clear choice of environmentally minded voters in the democratic presidential primaries officials with the group , the friends of the earth political action committee , said they had decided to back mr bradley this early in the campaign the iowa caucuses are still more than four months away largely out of frustration with the environmental policies of the clinton administration , particularly on global warming and international trade we had very high hopes for al gore , and we 've been disappointed , said mark whiteishelm , a spokesman for the group he s talked the talk but he has simply been unable to walk the walk with 20 , 000 members in the united states , friends of the earth is significantly smaller than other major environmental groups , and it lacks the financial resources to provide much campaign help to mr bradley the announcement also appears unlikely to sway the two other national environmental groups that endorse candidates , the sierra club and the league of conservation voters officials of both groups called today s move premature none of these candidates have even outlined their positions or programs , said deb callahan , president of the league of conservation voters both candidates , ms callahan said , have strong environmental records but mr gore , the author of a 1992 best seller about the dangers of global warming , earth in the balance , has been widely viewed as the leading environmental voice in the administration so today s endorsement raises questions about the depth of his support within an important democratic constituency that might have once been safely considered in his camp this is going to remind a lot of people who care about the environment about how good bradley s record was , said eric hauser , a spokesman for mr bradley kiki moore , a spokeswoman for the vice president , said , al gore will continue to work for a balanced approach and fight for a clean and healthy environment for america s working families mr whiteishelm criticized the administration and by extension mr gore for not pushing to reduce use of chemicals that are believed to contribute to global warming and for negotiating trade agreements that let foreign companies skirt american environmental rules the league of conservation voters , which grades members of congress on their environmental votes , has given mr bradley a lifetime score of 84 percent for the 18 years he represented new jersey in the senate the group has given mr gore , who represented tennessee in the house and the senate for 16 years , a 64 percent lifetime score
now that the mayor has appointed himself the city s chief art curator , it may be time to consider a new method of subsidizing cultural institutions i say this with no disrespect for the mayor s artistic philosophy when he ridiculed a dungstained portrait of the virgin mary by saying that he could have flung the dung himself , mr giuliani provided an admirably succinct definition of art if i can do it , it s not art if nothing else , it was refreshing to hear him admit that there is something beyond his powers and even if you opposed mr giuliani s threat to cut off funds to the brooklyn museum for its coming exhibit of the dung art , it was refreshing to hear someone finally speaking up for the taxpayers who subsidize museums most of us patrons could name exhibits we would rather not support whenever i see barnett newman s vir heroicus sublimis at the museum of modern art , i am impressed that he managed to sell anyone a tribute to heroic , sublime man that consists of a 17footwide red canvas crossed by five narrow vertical stripes but it s painful to think that my tax dollars might be supporting the scam when i'm lost at the metropolitan museum of art , wearily trying to find my way out of the armor collection or the section of colonial knickknacks , i ca n't believe that the city is helping to finance an expansion of the place any patron can see there s already too much stuff i would dearly prefer not to subsidize the american museum of natural history s statue of teddy roosevelt on horseback heroically subjugating the natives of two continents and i'm tired of wandering through the museum s gloomy dioramas of new york state s trees and farms , especially the one paying homage to fertilizer in the soil others have different priorities , of course one friend of mine dreams of ridding the natural history museum of its tribute to mollusks and our world another would refuse to subsidize to the metropolitan museum until there are no audio tours featuring the plummy voice of its director , philippe de montebello many wanted to cut off the metropolitan opera after it let mr giuliani sing in die fledermaus fortunately , there s a simple way to accommodate all these distastes museum vouchers instead of the current system , in which the mayor and city council hand out more than 200 million a year to nearly three dozen museums and other cultural institutions , each new yorker could hand out his or her share , about 35 apiece each person could get one voucher annually to be given to any of the institutions that are now being subsidized you could either mail it in or use it for free admission then the museum would turn it in to the city and receive 35 what about people too lazy to use their vouchers \? at year s end , the city would compute the value of the unspent vouchers and dispense that money , with each institution s share determined by its relative success in collecting vouchers so the museums would get the same total subsidy from the city , and the vouchers would probably yield hordes of new visitors and customers in the gift shops i tried out the voucher idea on several museum officials \( none willing to say anything on the record during the current furor \) their chief objection was it would punish small museums doing vital work that does n't appeal to the mass market as one of them predicted , the winners will be the big museums who draw crowds with impressionist shows that could be but the current system already gives the lion s share of the subsidies to the large mainstream museums politicians do not want to pay for anything that offends anybody individual new yorkers could be far more tolerant and diverse in their patronage while politicians are rushing to denounce the planned exhibition at the brooklyn museum , there are plenty of people here happy to encourage dung art you could probably find tens of thousands of them below 14th street with a voucher , they could subsidize their vision of art without making everyone else so mad , because those who prefer nondung madonnas would have the consolation of spending their money elsewhere the mayor would still be free to complain , but nobody would have to listen his artistic theories , like everyone else s , would be worth all of 35
hoboken it is 6 30 pm on a friday , and michael iurato of childlike records is waiting for erika simonian to show up at his apartment here to negotiate a record deal this meeting will clearly be anything but corporate in nature ms simonian , who sings with the erics , arrives alone , with no agent or lawyer mr iurato resplendent in baggy pants , orange sneakers and a baseball cap is alone , too mr iurato had spoken with members of the erics about making an album for his label , but they have not yet sealed the deal that is to be done at a japanese restaurant nearby so are we going to go ahead with the record \? mr iurato asks why would n't we \? ms simonian replies the deal is done there will be a contract for the sake of a contract , mr iurato says after dinner but we do n't have to sign it this kind of informality is nonexistent at majorlabel conglomerates but here in hoboken where there is a disproportionately high number of independent record companies it is not so unusual the focus is not on money , but on a collaborative spirit of making music mr iurato , 27 , is one of the latest in a breed of new jersey rock aficionados who have created their own record labels and run them from here these one and twoman operations , often teetering in and out of the red , have showed more endurance and tenacity than some of the merged , downsized and reorganized major labels in new york city and los angeles , labels that chase one charttopping hit after another other indies here include bar none records , the state s largest label smells like records , started by sonic youth s drummer , steve shelley the independent music group \( although its founder has recently moved to allenhurst \) , and telstar , started by todd abramson , the longtime booker at maxwell s another label , cropduster records , has strong local ties , although it is based in bayonne its most talkedabout band , the health and happiness show , includes the guitarist james mastro , formerly of the bongos , and vincent denunzio , formerly of the feelies following a nationwide trend , several artists from here have created labels either to release their own music or to put out cd s by a few friends and acquaintances one of them , p o s records , releases the music of skanatra , perhaps the most hobokenthemed of all bands it reinterprets frank sinatra tunes to fit the rhythms of jamaican ska music , and attracts crowds to its live sets through smart , theatrical performances to understand why a city of fewer than 35 , 000 people is a hotbed of indie record activity , it helps to keep in mind a certain part this city s history , starting in the late 1970 s , when maxwell s became a meeting place for musicians and other artists who moved here for its inexpensive housing and its proximity to new york city michael hill , who worked for the artists and repertory department of warner brothers records for 15 years and is now with the manhattanbased shanachie records , remembers hoboken in the early 1980 s as a little bohemian outpost there was a time in the 1980 s when people thought there were a lot of interesting local bands , mr hill said these bands mixed with emerging national talent , like rem , nirvana , the red hot chili peppers , sonic youth and new order , all of whom played at maxwell s the labels are an outgrowth of that scene , mr hill said the pioneer not an owner , but a partner consider bar none the year was 1986 tom prendergast had started the company with money saved from working three jobs running a record store , working for maxwell s as a bartender , and booking bands for a national booking agent it was not long after the label s second release the debut album of they might be giants that the work paid off the record sold 10 , 000 copies in its first year , not bad for an indie record but it was not until mr prendergast and his partner , glenn morrow , \( the originator of rage to live , whose debut album was bar none s first release \) , managed to get a video of the band on mtv that the album exploded within another month , we sold another 40 , 000 records , mr prendergast said total sales eventually passed 100 , 000 , and a followup album , also on bar none , more than doubled the sales of the first that established the label , mr prendergast said but if just one band put the company on the map , then an assortment of talent has kept it there esquivel , yo la tengo , arto lindsay , edwyn collins , luka bloom and 10 , 000 maniacs are among those in the company s catalogue of around 100 cd titles judging from the number of artists who started their recording careers with bar none and then defected to major labels including they might be giants , the tindersticks and freedy johnston the company seems to have a prescient knack for discovering talent they usually take them lock , stock and smoking barrel , said mr prendergast , refering to the major labels that collectively control of the american recording industry to guard against the deep pockets of these everencroaching conglomerates , bar none often signs its artists to contracts that require them to do multiple albums with the label that way , major labels have to buy out the contract , mr prendergast explained
after a month of often graphic accounts and a surprising midtrial guilty plea by one defendant , testimony in the abner louima police brutality case sputtered to an end yesterday when the only officer who had said he would take the witness stand changed his mind the decision by sgt michael bellomo , who is charged with trying to cover up part of the assault on mr louima by other officers , means that none of the defendants have testified in their own defense sergeant bellomo had been the only one of the defendants whose lawyer had said at the trial s start that he planned to take the stand , but the sergeant told reporters yesterday that he decided over the long holiday weekend not to testify after all i reevaluated it , sergeant bellomo , 37 , said outside the courtroom in federal district court in brooklyn he said that all the evidence that the jury needed about his role in the case had already entered the record through other witnesses , so that his testimony was no longer required prosecutors from the united states attorney s office in brooklyn say that sergeant bellomo tried to cover up the beating of mr louima in a police car by four officers after mr louima was arrested following a melee outside a flatbush nightclub one of those officers , justin a volpe , pleaded guilty last week to participating in the beating in the police car and to ramming a stick in mr louima s rectum in a restroom at the 70th precinct station house in brooklyn sergeant bellomo is not charged with participating in any of the assaults or with trying to cover up the restroom attack the sergeant s lawyer , john patten , told reporters that if you 're in trouble in a trial , you have nothing to lose by taking the witness stand , but that considering the evidence presented in the trial , we felt we were in a good position so yesterday , instead of hearing sergeant bellomo personally deny the coverup charge and watch him try to hold his own under crossexamination , jurors and spectators heard only two witnesses whom the sergeant s lawyer had called to testify briefly about specific points in his case lawyers for the three officers still on trial had rested their defenses earlier yesterday or last week after calling few or no witnesses , so once sergeant bellomo s two witnesses had concluded , judge eugene h nickerson told the jurors that they would hear closing arguments today and begin deliberating tomorrow after he instructs them on the laws governing the case the jurors will not have to deliberate on the most notorious defendant in the case the one prosecutors painted as mr louima s chief torturer in the police station restroom because that defendant , mr volpe , interrupted the trial on may 25 to plead guilty and admit attacking mr louima with the stick in the restroom prosecutors said that the assault occurred after mr louima was arrested in a street melee and that mr volpe mistakenly believed that it was mr louima who had punched him during the brawl they said that the restroom attack tore mr louima s rectum and bladder , requiring two months of hospitalization and three operations mr volpe , who was dismissed from the police force , could be sentenced to up to life in prison prosecutors say that the three men still on trial with sergeant bellomo officers charles schwarz , thomas bruder and thomas wiese also took part in the assault in the police car , and that officer schwarz held mr louima down while mr volpe assaulted him in the restroom the prosecutors have charged that sergeant bellomo also tried to cover up an assault by officer volpe on another man , patrick antoine , after the street brawl because mr louima and mr antoine , both haitian immigrants , are black , and the officers are white , the case has taken on bitter racial overtones after he had rested his case and the jury had been dismissed for the day , mr patten asked judge nickerson to dismiss the charges against sergeant bellomo on the ground that the evidence against him was insufficient and that officer volpe , in pleading guilty , had said he had no understanding with the sergeant to try to cover up mr volpe s assault of mr antoine judge nickerson denied the motion , saying that mr volpe s statement in pleading guilty is not before the jury and is not evidence photo john patten , left , defense lawyer for sgt michael bellomo , center , discussed the decision not to testify yesterday the sergeant is accused of attempting a coverup in the abner louima case \( ruby washington the new york times \)

adrice mcmichael , 10 , is nothing if not eager to learn this new game about kicking a ball into a net in jeans and a white urban soccer girl tshirt that hangs to her knees like a dress , she runs determinedly after the rolling sphere , the rainbow of beads in her braids bopping behind it s hard trying to kick the ball , trying to get it in the goal or trying to pass it to the partners , adrice says during a brief break from the scrimmage at lawrence c thompson park on staten island , in the shadow of the west brighton housing project , where some of the 100 girls scurrying around the field in red , blue and yellow pinnies live i try to hit it with my head , she adds , but it hurts after awhile six of the staten island girls , none of whom had ever played soccer before this week , are scheduled to carry a flag during today s opening ceremonies of the 1999 women s world cup at giants stadium , at once symbolizing a milestone in the struggle for gender equity in athletics and the challenges yet to come for the nation s fastestgrowing sport while soccer , and the national women s team s extraordinary success , has sent millions of girls onto the playing fields of america over the last decade , it has thus far been mainly a suburban craze now world cup corporate sponsors are hoping to use the enthusiasm of the tournament to turn city girls into devotees of the game , particularly immigrant girls who come from countries where soccer is dominated by men in new york and the other six cities playing host to the tournament , there are urban soccer girl programs for girls who live in housing projects , as well as soccer skills clinics like the one that drew some 5 , 000 schoolchildren to bryant park on thursday at the clinics , girls and boys alike learn to shoot , pass , trap and head the ball , and are sent home with souvenir photos of themselves dressed up as world cup stars it s kind of nice to have a suburban activity inside the city , said stacey fenley , a teacher at public school 33 in chelsea who brought her first and second graders to bryant park i do n't hear a lot of our kids playing on soccer teams hopefully , this will give them a spark over the past decade , soccer leagues have sprouted in american suburbs as fast as subdivisions , with parents signing children up as early as preschool , and adults playing well into middle age of 18 million registered soccer players in the united states , 75 million are women and girls , according to the soccer industry council of america soccer looks to be the great gender equalizer among youth sports as membership in one national league , the american youth soccer organization , has more than doubled to 607 , 000 over the past dozen years , the percentage of girls has jumped from 25 percent to 40 percent in contrast , fewer than a third of young basketball players are female , according to the women s sports foundation top players , such as those on the high school team in trumbull , conn , are showered with scholarship offers from the more than 700 colleges and universities with varsity programs and teams of little girls in matching jerseys will undoubtedly decorate the stands at today s games , just as they do at the men s major league soccer matches around the nation i think it s amazing that the women get to play , said dawn perry , 10 , who was wearing her green nigeria soccer jersey with no 13 on the back as she practiced trapping at the bryant park workshop for so long , all we see is men playing positions we never see a girl on the field dawn , who lives in east harlem and is in the fifth grade at ps 33 , used to play in a league and would like to once again the clinic coaches said she was one of the few girls there who had playing experience , and one called her a natural , even as the ball slipped through her legs i'm a girl , and i just love soccer , dawn said maybe now when i grow up i could be a soccer player in a world cup a women s world cup much of the success of women s soccer can be attributed to the implementation over the past decade of title ix , a federal law mandating equity in school sports programs , and the rise in prominence of women s sports generally , including the women s national basketball association , but experts say soccer also has particular appeal to young girls height is not essential , strength not as important as skill it s a social game with low scores , and thus less focus on the stars it s cheap , requiring little equipment commitment , and can be played anywhere it s about running around , it s not too violent , it s team oriented and it s something they can play with their friends , said marla messing , president of the women s world cup organizing committee i think it s something girls feel they can own this is my sport the other sports are so dominated by men in the united states , this is something they can really own while the wnba had to sell itself to basketball fans used to watching men play , women have had a prominent role in soccer s rise in the united states practically from the beginning among men , the united states is a relative novice at the world s most popular sport in contrast , soccer became popular among women here earlier than in most other countries
millburn six degrees of separation , the title of the group show at the forrest scott gallery here , refers not to any theme that unites the halfdozen contemporary artists , but rather to the way the show was put together the first artist selected , an upandcoming young new yorkbased painter named erin parish , was asked to choose another this second painter \( joe andoe , a much betterknown artist in what might be called early midcareer \) chose a third , and so on the results feel a little different from the kind of group show organized by a single individual making the choices , or by a committee with its give and take , its compromises it has a different kind of diversity and a different kind of unity not necessarily better , but more indirect , almost unconscious two of the painters are abstractionists joie a rosen is more drawn to hardedged geometry ms parish revels in painterly splatters and drips in the abstract expressionist tradition of the rest , jennifer dubnau shows realist portraits michael j abrams presents idealized landscapes architectural views inflected with a sort of subdued surrealism are by john bowman , and somewhat formalized , grisaille figures of animals are mr andoe s work yet there is an underlying commonality that the eclectic mixture of subjects and styles would not lead you to expect in fact , the exhibition may even be too consistent in sensibility , if not in quality the paintings are more about surface than about space , and \( even when they are representational \) more about mood than about specific subject matter with few exceptions , they are mostly of subdued palette , often in the recessive bluegreen range by contrast , red occurs only in two of the 18 works exhibited , as if the kind of color that tends to jump out at you were somehow too vulgar to deploy without dire necessity the works in this show are , above all , presentable poised , pleasing and tasteful curiously , some of the most traditional work in the show is also the most difficult , in the good sense of the word ms dubnau s triptych , brent turning \( 1999 \) , is a quasicinematic sequence of three closeups of the same man s face as it moves from a profile view on the left to a threequarters view on the right it shows her to be a skillful painterly realist , with none of the dry , niggling overabsorption in details that plagues so much contemporary realism , but also with little tendency to fudge things with vague evocation ms dubnau knows that in painting , this face must be a spatial construction , not a surface image disappointingly , her other painting here , woman leaning on her lover s knees \( 1999 \) , is much less successful the problem seems to be that she does n't deal with bodies as rigorously as she does with faces the man s torso in particular is spatially too indefinite , and with both figures there is little sense of a body inside their clothes this is n't just a purely formal difficulty , by the way the resulting visual mushiness contributes to the painting s sentimentality a dissipation of substance into atmosphere also afflicts mr abrams s landscapes , whose titles seem to refer to definite places \( oxford view from the reservoir , from 1999 \) but convey little sense of place with low horizons emphasizing misty ambiance over earthy terrain , they exist almost entirely in the mental space of nostalgic recall and yet almost buried within them is a curious specificity , the faint traces of abstract , penciled arabesques that populate the air , as if describing the physics of air currents as leonardo might have done somehow , mr abrams should make more of this perhaps the most successful evocations of pure atmosphere here are in ms parish s paintings abstraction does that best , perhaps because it liberates the substance of paint to assert its own specificity even so , the elementary geometrical structure given by the horizontal bands in far apart together \( 1999 \) takes her further than the simple , undifferentiated field of float \( 1997 \) , or even the irregular patterning of pinwheel waves \( 1999 \) ms rosen s paintings are interesting for their technique , but that is also what threatens to distract from their more substantial content her works are painted on two layers of translucent silk , one several inches behind the other , so that there are formal elements right up on the surface as well as others seemingly veiled within it what works here is an implicit sense of internal movement , but when the viewer gets hung up on the thing s making , it becomes static again still , their slightly gimmicky fascination is undeniable unfortunately , the bestknown artists here have some of the least prepossessing work mr andoe seems to be replicating his own signature style , although if you 're a bit embarrassed by your oldfashioned taste and want a picture of a dog or cat that s respectably contemporarylooking , these will do mr bowman s imagery , like the flooded mansion in open house \( 1999 \) , may be the most intrinsically interesting in the show , but his treatment of it is overworked and compositionally flaccid six degrees of separation

albany , july 8 the blackout that stilled upper manhattan for nearly a day was a sort of distress call , a warning that as the demand for electricity sets records , the power systems in the new york metropolitan area are creeping perilously close to their physical limits , experts in the field cautioned today power demand is rising faster than the systems' ability to generate and deliver it , driven by a booming economy and the proliferation of computers , fax machines , airconditioners and the other amenities of an affluent , wired society the more power is pushed through the cables , the greater the likelihood that some of those cables will fail that lesson was reinforced in dramatic fashion on tuesday , when demand climbed to records and power went out not just in the washington heights section of manhattan and parts of the lower east side and long island but also in communities from maryland to massachusetts but in the long term , the increasing use of electricity poses a much broader problem the new york metropolitan area , more than any other part of the country , runs the risk that in the near future , it simply will not be able to import , generate or deliver enough power to keep up with demand , the experts said the core of a solution to the problem , they said , must be the construction of new power plants , but those are a few years away , at least there are now six applications before the state to build or expand plants the new york power pool , a consortium of the state s utilities , requires that each of its members be able to deliver at least 18 percent more power than customers are using at peak periods , and pools around the country have similar standards on tuesday , for the first time , consolidated edison , serving new york city and westchester county , fell below that standard , to 17 percent the long island power authority had just a 10 percent cushion , and public service electric and gas in new jersey came within 5 percent of its capacity the cushion is intended to allow the systems to absorb unexpected problems like the loss of generating power or downed transmission lines without resorting to blackouts in the latest heat wave , each of the three utilities was left with a margin of error that was onequarter to onehalf smaller than it had at its previous peak the capacity problem in new york city is n't critical today , but it could be critical in a couple of years , said william j balet , executive director of the new york power pool and long island is in worse shape than new york city as the margin of error shrinks , it becomes more likely that minor problems will lead to blackouts and on peak days , the margin will evaporate entirely , causing still more blackouts on tuesday , utilities from maine to virginia cut the voltage that they supplied to customers by 5 percent because their three regional power pools were approaching their capacity limits public service in new jersey shut off airconditioning to 145 , 000 homes whose residents had signed up to sacrifice their cool air in case of an emergency , in return for lower rates the utility gives homeowners one hour s notice and is able to shut off units with a remotecontrol device the long island authority persuaded local governments to shut down for the day in both cases , officials said , those measures were all that prevented rolling blackouts , in which power is cut to one community at a time each for an hour or two we are approaching the point where more generation is needed in new york city to reliably supply demands in the future , said louis rana , vice president of con edison for system and transmission operations asked if the system had approached a crisis on tuesday , he said , i would say yes , we were close the problem is not unique to the northeast , though it is more pressing in that region than in most of the country in 1996 , with demand straining the capacity to deliver electricity in the northwest , the failure of a couple of transmission lines in oregon shut power to parts of nine states and last summer , utilities across the midwest lowered everyone s voltage , pleaded with customers to turn off their appliances and persuaded some industries to shut down because demand was pushing the limits of the grid , threatening another major blackout new york city and long island have an added problem the ability to deliver power from outside the region is severely constrained simply because the lines to carry it are few transmission lines from other places represent only about onequarter of the region s capacity to deliver electricity the rest is generated locally that means that at times of peak demand , if there was a problem with the local power plants or the transmission system , the region would not be able to rely on outside help to avoid blackouts a few other population centers , like san francisco , southern florida and parts of new england , have similar limitations that contributed to the failure that blacked out most of san francisco last december but none are as extreme as the new york metropolitan area s
mike remlinger slumped back into his chair and cursed it was his changeup that chad curtis blasted into the leftfield bullpen in the 10th inning last night , sending the yankees skipping onto the field and the braves plummeting into an enormous hole that threatens to swallow them in the world series down three games to none , the braves are in the same precarious position from which the mets tried to claw back last week in the national league championship series the mets managed to win two thrilling games before finally succumbing to what seemed to be the inevitable denouement no team in baseball history has come back from three games down last year , the braves won two games after losing the first three to the san diego padres in the league championship series , but now all the magic and momentum in the world may not be enough to overcome atlanta s tremendous deficit it comes down to who wants it worse , remlinger said us or them \? so far it s been them i do n't know if it s a test or a gut check guys need to ask themselves how badly they want to win it s how much heart do you have and what can you do with it \? from the way we pulled together and all the people we lost and people waiting for us to make excuses and we kept going do we want to go home tomorrow or do we want to fight \? people have to answer that question by the game tomorrow how many teams came back from three games down \? i 'd like to be one of them but for the braves , the situation is ominous although the players in the clubhouse remained evenkeeled there were no angry outbursts , only a slow leaking of soft words the braves clearly knew they had wasted what had been a superb chance to get back into the series after two games of offensive futility , and one compounded by defensive blunders , the braves finally got to a yankees starter , knocking out andy pettitte in the fourth inning it was the fact that they had finally performed well for much of the game , including a gritty pitching effort by the ailing tom glavine , that made this loss all the more crushing we swung the bats well , we played good defense , we pitched well and we still lost , chipper jones said it s a little demoralizing it just seems like they have a great aura about them you 've got to think their luck is going to run out eventually and we 're going to get a break we 've done it before we had the mets do it to us this year but we 're having to do it on the road that s awfully tough but it s doable just barely the braves have lost early leads in two of the three games when curtis s home run reached the stands , the braves visibly slumped that was a big one to lose , manager bobby cox said we were going to get back in this thing we played a first tough inning and we lost them both we could easily be up , 21 , instead of down , 30 for glavine , the loss was especially disheartening because he had pitched so well the braves had taken a risk by starting the weakened glavine just three days after he missed his game 1 start with a stomach virus but he pitched heroically until he gave up a third home run to chuck knoblauch that tied the game 55 in the eighth inning glavine could not recall the last time he had given up three home runs it does n't do any good to analyze where we are or why , he said it s probably more frustrating if i could say we had a fiverun lead and i pitched terribly nobody has ever done this for a reason it s hard to do it s going to happen sooner or later we 've got to do it the sentiment sounded awfully familiar eleven days ago , the mets' general manager steve phillips , asked why his team could n't be the first to recover from a 30 deficit the mets will be remembered for making their series with the braves compelling and perhaps for having taken so much out of the braves that they will not be able to make the world series competitive photo bret boone hitting a runscoring double in the fourth for a 51 braves lead he was caught trying to steal third \( ozier muhammad the new york times \)
up to now there have been no musicians in the family of willie boy morales medina , an aspiring singer from queens who is 17 , husky , almost 6 feet 3 and still growing his mother loves music but ca n't sing a note she s the only female bass i know , he said recently mr morales medina s voice is still shifting around for now , he seems to be a baritone , but his heroes are tenors , especially luciano pavarotti and andrea bocelli he dreams of a career as a singer getting accepted by the la guardia high school of music and art and performing arts was a step toward that goal but where he finally found the courage , support and , most important , training to potentially realize his dream was the harlem school of the arts on st nicholas avenue near the corner of west 141st street , in the hamilton heights section of harlem he spends a lot of time there after school and on weekends the harlem school was founded in 1964 by the soprano dorothy maynor in the basement of st james presbyterian church , next to its current modern building today the school serves some 3 , 000 students , from youngsters who take elementary classes in music , dance , art and theater to young adults with hopes of artistic careers along with similar schools in new york greenwich house music school , turtle bay music school , third street music school settlement and brooklyn music school the harlem school has taken up the slack for the virtual abandonment of arts education in the city s public schools since the mid1970 s the arts programs in the public schools are more or less window dressing , said darryl durham , executive director of the harlem school and a north carolinaborn clarinetist and conductor our work here is much more indepth for example , in addition to taking theory classes , singing in the chorale and taking part in the opera workshop , mr morales medina receives oneonone voice lessons , something beyond the resources of even a special public high school like la guardia before the cuts during the fiscal crises of the 1970 s and the 1980 s recession , most of the 1 , 100 new york city public schools had at least one art or music teacher by 1991 twothirds of the elementary schools had none in this decade , public school arts programs have gained ground with some major help from private sources , like a 12 million challenge grant from the annenberg foundation in 1993 , and from public programs like new york city s project arts , which provided 75 million over three years but getting the arts financing and programs into economically deprived neighborhoods has been difficult , and harlem has historically been one of the least well served we went so many years without arts funding at all , sharon dunn , the school system s special assistant to the arts , said recently we have come to a new thinking about how to deliver the arts , and partnerships with places like the harlem school of the arts are the best way to go indeed , the harlem school gives special attention to a tuitionfree program dating from 1974 called opportunities for learning in the arts it enables about 225 students in the first through third grades from three neighborhood public schools to study percussion , dance , recitation , the visual arts and scene and monologue writing each public school contributes 10 , 000 to the program , but the harlem school makes up the rest of the cost , which can be 150 , 000 annually this is what it means to exist as a community arts organization , mr durham said and once these kids get hooked , we have programs to take them further into the disciplines of their choice teaching discipline through the arts maynor believed that arts education could stimulate a child emotionally and intellectually , teach discipline , cooperation and good behavior , and empower families through a commitment to their children s education all of the private arts schools in the region share this philosophy the fine arts can be a hard sell , especially for families struggling to get by but for teachers at the harlem school , many of whom have broken the color line in orchestras and on stages throughout the united states , a more nettlesome challenge is the confounding perception among some members of minorities that the fine arts are elitist betty allen , 69 , the former mezzosoprano who was executive director of the school for 13 years and is now president emeritus , understands how the elitist stigma came about but finds it dismaying i grew up in a lowincome neighborhood in campbell , ohio , she said the families were mostly of greek and sicilian heritage walking down the street on saturday afternoons you would hear the broadcasts of the metropolitan opera coming from every window nobody told these people that the fine arts were not for poor people like them , just for rich snobs it upsets her that any black child would shun the fine arts after all the efforts by black artists to dismantle racial barriers to professional participation ms allen s first prominent engagement came in 1952 when , at 22 , she was chosen for the allblack cast for the new york revival of virgil thomson s opera four saints in three acts \( singing a tiny role was a young soprano just out of juilliard named leontyne price \) this was three years before marian anderson broke the color line at the metropolitan opera
the police thwarted an illicit act of agriculture on monday when members of the staten island narcotics unit uprooted 72 fledgling marijuana plants in a remote corner of the fresh kills landfill lieut bob glass led six narcotics officers to the site on sanitation commission property near fresh kills creek , about a quarter mile west of the staten island expressway getting to the site , which he called a little farm , entailed leaving a small paved road and hiking across an overgrown field , then struggling down a corridor through a few hundred yards of thick weeds in a clearing , the officers found what were described as welltended marijuana plants eight to 12 inches tall they looked like they had been started at home and only recently planted , lieutenant glass said each plant was circled with chicken wire about one and a half feet tall nearby , he said , the officers found two shovels , a bag of fertilizer and a bag of grub and mite killer the lieutenant said the unit considered leaving the plants untouched in hopes of catching whoever was responsible for them but the officers decided that the small operation lieutenant glass figured the plants would have a street value of 2 , 000 did n't merit that kind of effort we 're not talking about the unabomber here , he said the plants were sent to a police laboratory in queens , where they will be held in case they are needed for evidence on friday afternoon , a police spokesman , detective george nagy , said no arrests had been made and there were no suspects a sanitation department spokeswoman , paula young , said a consultant to the agency had stumbled on the marijuana patch last weekend she said the consultant notified a landfill supervisor , who informed sanitation commissioner kevin p farrell , who in turn called the staten island narcotics unit ms young said that the plants were found in an unused section of the property where no garbage had ever been dumped she said it was the first time marijuana had been discovered at the landfill lieutenant glass said that after the crop was uprooted , a police helicopter flew low over the immediate area to look for more marijuana , but none was found jim o'grady
nashua , nh , sept 27 in the state where he is hoping to pull off an upset , john mccain formally began his campaign for the republican presidential nomination today , pledging to restore faith in government so that americans can believe once again that public service is a summons to duty and not a lifetime of privilege on a flagbedecked stage in a grassy park , the maverick republican senator from arizona pledged to empower teachers and parents , to cut taxes and to strengthen national security criticizing at times both president clinton and the republican congress , he called on his audience to rise to meet a new patriotic challenge it is a challenge to each of us to join in the fight against pervasive cynicism that is debilitating our democracy , mr mccain said , that cheapens our political debates , that threatens our public institutions , our culture and , ultimately , our private happiness it is a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests , and return it to the people , and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve the 63yearold senator faces an uphill fight against gov george w bush of texas , who is far ahead of the republican pack in opinion polls and in fundraising but as other republicans have dropped out of the race former vice president dan quayle ended his campaign today mr mccain has remained a credible challenger in the minds of political strategists he has moved into second place here in the nation s first primary state , according to recent polls , and his new memoir , faith of my fathers , is nearing the top of the bestseller lists the only political figure the senator criticized by name today was president clinton but mr mccain , a former navy pilot who was shot down over vietnam in 1967 and held as a prisoner of war for five and a half years , implicitly drew a sharp contrast between his own life experience and that of mr bush the texas governor served in the texas air national guard during the vietnam war and has had little background in foreign policy mr mccain said there are times when the commanderinchief can no longer rely on briefing books and talking points when a president makes life and death decisions he should draw strength and wisdom from the broad and deep experience with the reasons for and the risks of committing our children to our defense , he said for no matter how many others are involved in the decision , the president is a lonely man in a dark room when the casualty reports come in i am not afraid of that burden i know both the blessing and the price of freedom during a twoweek book tour for his memoir , mr mccain has brought to national attention his personal history and how his family s tradition of military service helped sustain him through his years of torture and confinement his aides make it no secret that they consider his life story crucial to his appeal as he spoke today , the crowd of more than 500 who turned out to see him here raised homemade placards saying veterans for mccain or simply hero before flying to new hampshire , mr mccain began the day by speaking in private to 4 , 000 midshipmen at the united states naval academy in annapolis , where he was once a brash rebel who graduated fifth from the bottom of his class just as his senate record is an unorthodox mix of conservatism and causes that are unpopular with the republican leadership , mr mccain is relying on an unorthodox campaign strategy symbolized by the lack of iowa stops anywhere on his announcement tour mr mccain has all but written off the iowa caucuses because of the belief that his stand against ethanol subsidies and the high proportion of social conservatives in iowa make it unfriendly territory instead , he is putting time and resources into new hampshire , hoping that with the state s history of turning on establishment candidates , and with its rules allowing independents to vote in party primaries , it will give him a strong first or secondplace showing that would propel him to the primary in south carolina , the second state in his announcement tour he is also playing hard for california , with its winnertakeall primary in early march many republicans say that mr bush s more than 50 million in fundraising will prevent any opponent from making a credible challenge in a year when the frontloaded primary process means that many regions will be voting at once mr mccain s aides say he will have raised at least 88 million by the time the next reporting period ends the senator argues , however , that the quick succession of primaries next year could keep a frontrunner from recovering if he lost his footing mr mccain s speech today was in many ways straight out of the republican canon he called for a strong military , for a tax cut and pledged not to raid social security funds for other government programs and on education , he called for a national test of school vouchers , merit pay for teachers and teacher testing but his maverick streak showed when he highlighted his signature issue of campaign finance overhaul and when he took off after the isolationist views of patrick j buchanan , the conservative commentator , saying that there is no safe alternative to america s leadership nor did he shield the republicanled congress he serves in from criticism both parties in congress , he said , have wasted scarce defense dollars on unneeded weapons systems and other pork projects he added , i want you to know that every member of congress knows that if i am president i will refuse to sign any pork barrel bill that crosses my desk and if congress overrides my veto and tries to force me to waste your money , i 'll make sure you know who they are every single one of them fundraiser in new york fresh from new hampshire , mr mccain came into new york last night for a fundraiser that aides said would bring about 500 , 000 to his campaign in a ballroom of the grand hyatt hotel , he told donors attending a 1 , 000ahead reception that , i'm not going to let you down because i'm not afraid of losing this race he pledged to keep fighting to overhaul the campaign finance law in order to combat disillusionment with politics i will not quit on campaign finance reform because i know we must we must succeed before we lose a generation of young americans a closer look john sidney mccain

how dare that pestiferous bunch of anonymous players from canada intrude on the mets' preparations for their interleague rematch with the big bad team from the bronx who are these montreal expos who keep getting in the mets' way \? last season they beat the mets twice in the final week of the season , triggering a fivegame , seasonending slide that carried the mets right out of the playoffs this week they come to new york and , acting like a group of foreign tourists , gazed starstruck at skyscrapers while the mets put them away for two nights but then they suddenly remembered why they were here and who they were playing and they knocked off the mets twice , placing a definite damper on the mets' approach to the threegame series they begin with the yankees at shea stadium tonight we 'd like to have gone into the series on a high note , catcher mike piazza said but unfortunately that s not the case it just seems like we 're always battling piazza spoke after the mets squandered a 31 lead yesterday and dropped a 43 decision to the lowly expos this is a team whose players should be paying their way into major league games , and they have won 5 of the 11 games the teams have played \( last season the expos won 8 of 12 \) the mets wish they could say the expos wo n't have them to kick around anymore this season , but the teams play two more games later this month , after the interleague schedule is completed none of the mets could explain yesterday why the expos give them such a difficult time that s a very good question , said al leiter , who will pitch for the mets tonight that s a good question , echoed john olerud i do n't have a good answer when brian mcrae was asked that question after the expos beat the mets last september , he said teams play harder against the mets because they do n't like bobby valentine , the manager valentine did n't like that answer mcrae was not asked for a reprise yesterday , and no one else offered that explanation the mets are quick learners but now come the yankees , and the mets were divided in their views about whether the series is a distraction for them in their quest to catch the divisionleading atlanta braves , or at least solidify their position in the wildcard race leiter said he likes playing the yankees , but once would be enough , thank you that is , one series , as they played last season , not the two that were scheduled for this season under the theory that something good would be twice as good if done twice i think it s good for the game to have such a rivalry and excitement in this city or any other city that has two teams , the pitcher said , but i do n't care for the six games three is nice last year we were here and this year would have been at their place i think six games takes away from the buildup and all the excitement of the series piazza said he saw the series as a distraction only in the sense that we unfortunately have n't played that well it seems to me , he added , discussing the games with the yankees , the problem is if you do n't play well in that series , you 're almost an outcast in the city , so it works on your confidence you have to keep it in perspective it s big and it s going to be exciting but you want to win because it seems like the city is focused on this event it s an event the times we have n't played well , we felt like complete losers the mets were losers in the first two games of the series at yankee stadium last month and saw their losing streak reach eight games and their wonlost record slip below 500 for the first time since opening day but amid additional turbulence created by the dismissal of half of valentine s coaching staff , the mets , with leiter pitching against roger clemens , who will also start tonight , won the third game and turned their season around there was so much going on with the changes in personnel on our club , piazza said , if that got us to dig down deeper and find a way to play better , that s a good thing beginning with that 72 triumph , the mets won 21 of their next 29 games then they lost to the expos twice to split 2 and 2 against montreal is not what we planned or intended , and it s not a good thing , leiter said i think most everybody in this room is upset and should be upset that we did n't at least win three out of four in two games started by those superstar pitchers dan smith and mike thurman , the mets scored a total of four runs nothing against thurman or smith , leiter said , but it s not maddux and glavine mounting a meager offense against those two atlanta pitchers , he said , is acceptable , but when you face lesser known guys , it s a little more frustrating yes , piazza agreed , it is frustrating today i thought we did some things right , added the catcher , whose fifthinning home run gave the mets a 31 lead but we were n't able to hold them it s frustrating because you really expect to win that game today and it s something you hate to let slip away
when john f welch jr resigns from general electric in april 2001 , he will actually leave two vacancies those of ge s chief executive and corporate america s mostadmired manager the first post will be filled quickly , the appointment will likely be announced months before mr welch steps aside for the second job , however , there is no clear successor , management experts said yesterday , and that is a testament to the rarity of mr welch s nearly twodecade run at the top of one of america s biggest companies mr welch , who announced his retirement date on monday , is not the most famous chief executive in the country that title probably belongs to william h gates of microsoft or warren e buffett of berkshire hathaway but among board members , executives , and businessschool students and professors , mr welch s name is a touchstone for smart corporate management in a way that no other chieftain matches he s the best manager in america , said gerard r roche , the chairman of the executive search firm heidrick struggles what he s done at ge has become the benchmark for other companies , said christopher a bartlett , a professor at harvard business school i'm on four boards of directors , added john o whitney , a former consultant to ge who now teaches at columbia business school , and at every other meeting , someone brings up what welch would do the candidates to take mr welch s place on this score are familiar names in corporate america they include mr gates , louis v gerstner jr of ibm , john chambers of cisco systems and jacques a nasser of ford motor but other than mr gates , who recently cut back his control of daytoday operations and is known for his company s antitrust trial as much as for his management theories , none has nearly the profile that mr welch does as a result , the management experts said , none is on the verge of being so influential many of the decade s popular management theories had their start , or became widely known , after ge adopted them in the 1980 s , mr welch said every ge unit should be no 1 or no 2 in its field he then sold or closed those that he thought could not be fixed , laying off some 100 , 000 employees in the process mirroring the shift in the united states economy , he also moved the company s focus from making products to selling services , and he preached the importance of global business more recently , he began a quality initiative to improve manufacturing efficiency and watched many of his proteges become chief executives at other companies even during a bullmarket run , the results have stood out when mr welch took over on april 1 , 1981 , ge was worth 13 billion at the close of business yesterday , its market capitalization was 425 billion the magnificence of the story of jack welch is the longevity of his success , said hobson brown jr , the chief executive of russell reynolds associates , a new york headhunter mr welch has his critics he earned the nickname neutron jack after ordering the layoffs in the 1980 s and a 1998 book by a former reporter for the wall street journal contended that under mr welch , ge s obsession with profit led to questionable accounting practices and ethical lapses the company has denied the accusations in the book , and mr welch has often said he believed that closing unprofitable businesses was both financially and morally sound there is no debate , however , about whether other managers use mr welch s tenure as a model , and that is the standard that anybody filling his unofficial job would be judged on , professors and executives said yesterday the first place to look , they said , are the technology companies that have captured so much of the popular imagination mr gates and michael dell of dell computer are good examples of executives who understood the importance of the internet long before many others did , and mainstream companies are now following in their tracks but mr gates and mr dell founded their companies , and the vast majority of chief executives take control of organizations that have at least some history the task is very different , said mr bartlett of harvard mr gerstner and mr nasser are similar to mr welch in that they took over large companies and set about changing them indeed , ibm s mr gerstner is frequently mentioned , along with mr welch , as an executive who changed an old , enormous company by making service businesses more important ford s mr nasser , meanwhile , has received attention lately for overhauling a company that was long associated with industrial decline but until now his successes have been only occasionally cited at other companies , management experts said a chief executive who both hails from the high technology sector and took over a company after its founding is mr chambers of cisco adrian j slywotzky , a wellknown author and vice president at mercer management consulting , said mr chambers understands the fundamental premise of business today technology must be at the center of everything , but it cannot replace time that executives spend with their customers and employees that attitude , mr slywotzky said , is very welchlike
hillary rodham clinton yesterday postponed what would have been her third trip to new york as a prospective senate candidate in as many weeks , citing the disappearance and presumed death of john f kennedy jr this week s trip has been postponed because of the kennedy tragedy , said mrs clinton s spokesman , howard wolfson , reading from a written statement mrs clinton joins with the president in sending her prayers and thoughts to the kennedy and bessette families during this very difficult period mr kennedy s singleengine plane disappeared over the weekend as he flew to martha s vineyard with his wife , carolyn bessette kennedy , and her sister , lauren bessette mrs clinton s advisers described the first lady as distraught over the apparent death of mr kennedy in discussing the trip s postponement , they also said that , as a matter of appearances , it might not be appropriate for the first lady to be portrayed as tending to her own political ambitions while the search for mr kennedy s downed plane and its occupants continued the first lady had planned to spend just over two days in new york in the southern tierfinger lakes region , with stops in elmira , ithaca and bath although there are indications that her visits to the state are becoming slightly more routine with their frequency , her trip to elmira promises to be of particular note that is because the first lady , who has never lived in new york , in an apparently unscripted aside during a trip to manhattan last month , boasted that she had been to elmira that was news to people in elmira the stargazette of elmira took note of the remarks by mrs clinton , and interviewed town democratic leaders , none of whom could recall a visit from her the first lady s aides later explained that she had passed through the town as a child , on a family excursion from her hometown of chicago to scranton mr wolfson said that mrs clinton s trip would be rescheduled for sometime over the next month as soon as possible , mr wolfson said
chicago , june 25 the americans had been warned about the voracious nigerian attack possess the ball , coach tony dicicco had told his players keep the defense intact do n't let a track meet break out in the middle of a soccer match within 62 seconds , nigeria drew ahead , 10 , thursday night the 65 , 080 redwhiteandblue faces in the stands at soldier field were stunned the red faces among the american players told of anger and nausea you get mad and you get a little sick feeling in your stomach , forward tiffeny milbrett said given that there were 88 minutes still to play , the americans did not have to break out the twominute offense relentlessly , they pressed forward through a nigerian defense that was more a sieve than a wall , scoring three goals in four minutes by halftime , the united states had pulled ahead , 61 milbrett blasted a rebound shot through the right hand of nigerian goalkeeper ann chiejene in the first half and slid into a splendid pass from cindy parlow in the 83d minute , poking the shot into the net , pulling the americans ahead , 71 , and putting an exclamation point on what she would call the most exciting game we 've ever played seven goals equaled the most the united states has scored in a women s world cup match it matched the total against taiwan in the inaugural event in 1991 , which the americans won you can never prepare for a team coming out and scoring in the first two minutes , milbrett said we got angry and alert and we started playing our game we had a lot of good chances and we put them away with two victories in group play , the americans still have not officially claimed a spot in the quarterfinals thursday at jack kent cooke stadium outside of washington , but that should be a mere formality the 16team field is divided into four groups the top two teams from each group advance after roundrobin play if the united states , nigeria and north korea are tied after sunday s final group matches , the first tie breaker will be goal difference the americans have scored 10 goals and surrendered 1 if they can avoid being humiliated by north korea on sunday in foxboro , mass , they will book a quarterfinal match against either germany , brazil or italy this is such a certainty that dicicco may rest some of his starters on sunday while mia hamm controlled much of thursday s match with a goal and brilliant passes on corner kicks and free kicks , five americans scored against nigeria none was more relieved than milbrett , who had been the team s most reliable scorer this year but who had suffered blows to her shoulder and her composure in the opener last saturday against denmark playing before 78 , 972 fans at giants stadium the largest crowd ever to watch a women s sporting event in this country milbrett admitted being nervous and rattled two pummeling hits further took her out of her game , which consists of quick , slashing charges toward the goal i really did n't feel like myself , milbrett said i was mad about that we had never played in a tournament like this before it was warranted to have some nerves before each match , dicicco meets individually with each of the players thursday , he said he could sense that milbrett was calm and determined she opened with an aggressive tackle , drove a shot wide across the goal mouth , then began finding the target as the american attack poured through an overwhelmed nigerian defense when i talked to tiffeny , i could tell she was excited to play , dicicco said she was n't satisfied with the game on saturday i knew she 'd come out and be all over the field
sony classical s masterworks heritage series was conceived to celebrate the past , but with a new cd devoted to the violinists michael rabin and ossy renardy \( mhk 60894 \) , the label is also paying homage to two artists cut down in their prime both players were already superior musicians when they died , and in certain circles their demise still elicits palpable regret rabin , born in new york city in 1936 to musical parents , made his professional debut in cuba at age 10 , under arthur rodzinski s baton by 1950 , he was playing carnegie hall to enthusiastic notices that same year , columbia records \( now sony classical \) produced an album in which rabin played 11 paganini caprices two other columbia disks followed before the violinist , in 1954 , began a sixyear association with capitol emi that would mark the summit of his fame the masterworks heritage cd includes rabin s three columbia records in their entirety , revealing an artist at once technically brilliant and interpretively sensitive that rabin was an adolescent at the time makes his achievement even more spectacular though rabin would famously record all 24 paganini caprices for capitol in 1958 , his partial set for columbia holds special appeal of course , he injects these short solo works with youthful vigor , but more importantly , rabin finds the music in these tortuous exercises in the no 11 in c major , for instance , he juxtaposes meditative phrasing with incisive attacks and in the familiar 24th caprice , in a minor , the violinist positively sings out his tone sweet , his bowing assured , his inflections graceful a handful of showpieces with piano follow , including works by wieniawski , kreisler and dvorak best of all is a trifle by carl engel titled sea shell , in which rabin , in efrem zimbalist s atmospheric arrangement , limpidly evokes the shore three works for violin and orchestra complete rabin s columbia discography , sarasate s durable zigeunerweisen and two fiendish works by novacek and paganini , both called perpetuum mobile the paganini , especially , reveals rabin s prowess as a firstrate virtuoso but it s in zigeunerweisen , with its throbbing , sentimental charm , that the violinist s talents are more completely on display sadly , in 1972 , less than 20 years after these records were made , rabin , 35 , died in his manhattan apartment over the years there has been talk of depression and drugs , but none of it has been substantiated death by natural causes was the official conclusion like rabin , ossy renardy died tragically he was killed in a car crash en route to a concert in 1953 , at age 33 born oskar reiss , in vienna , renardy was an enormously talented artist whose vibrant tone and innate poise earned him early accolades the conductor victor de sabata , for instance , engaged him at 14 to perform as a soloist with the vienna philharmonic though he made comparatively few disks , renardy was the first violinist to record all 24 paganini caprices , for rca victor in 1940 , albeit with interpolated piano accompaniment and his 1948 account of the brahms violin concerto for decca , with charles munch conducting the concertgebouw orchestra , remains a benchmark performance sadly in need of reissue cheers , then , to sony for releasing a selection of renardy s first recordings , made in 1938 , not long after his new york debut at town hall here is an elegant exponent of the old school rendering sarasate and paganini with delicious dash neither sugary nor schmaltzy , renardy s playing brims with ineffable elegance , summoning contented sighs , as a really good meal might in the four sarasate selections , which include romanza andaluza and zapateado , sparkle and ease characterize renardy s approach , even as tensions rise and double stops , pizzicato and harmonics are employed for paganini s sonata no 12 in e minor , a more melancholy sound first emerges from renardy s gilded bow , followed by ebullience and bravura technique only the absence of renardy s other columbia disks , sonatinas by schubert and dvorak among them , detract from the joy at having these records once more at hand were there more space on this nearly 79minute cd , they doubtless would have been added john donne wrote yesternight the sun went hence , and yet is here today sony seems almost to have taken his words to heart , giving listeners a welcome sampling of two artists who perished early , but not before bequeathing a precious legacy photos ossy renardy , in 1941 he was the first violinist to record all 24 paganini caprices michael rabin , circa 1950 a new yorker , he made his professional debut at 10 \( j abresch \)

two influential , but very different parts of westport , its strong artistic heritage and thriving downtown shopping district , came together in an unusual manner earlier this year when construction workers renovating a former main street department store into a new banana republic store discovered a longforgotten and firedamaged 1930 s mural hidden behind a wall instead of removing the mural , banana republic officials redesigned the store to prominently incorporate the carefully restored 28footlong mural as a focal point behind its front register this was an apparently obvious decision for a company that has over 40 stores housed in revitalized , older buildings in february , before any decisions about the mural were made , surprised workers and building owners called the westport historical society , which in turn enlisted the aid of howard munce , a westport artist and art historian , in an attempt to identify the mural s creator the whimsical , cartoonish , 190squarefoot tempera and oil mural by edmund m ashe jr , an artist who lived in fairfield county , had been last seen in the 1950 s inside the townley s restaurant , which closed after a fire damaged the building klein s department store then bought the property , and the damaged mural was covered up identifying the artist was easy for mr munce , it turns out i was pretty sure who had done it , he said but when i got down there and saw it , i was very sure because he had signed it on both ends so there was no question about it , mr munce said mr ashe , who was born in 1908 and died in 1986 , was the son of the prominent westport artist , edmund ashe sr , an illustrator and cartoonist who was one of the first illustrators to move to westport when it was just starting to become known as an artist s colony the younger mr ashe studied at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh before working as a freelance commercial artist in new york city the mural , which depicts an assortment of people in a bar or restaurant , was originally painted as a wall decoration for the triangle tavern , a popular speakeasytype of bar on main street indeed , one mural subject , apparently a saloonkeeper , eyes a potential guest through a tiny window while holding a note stating , pete sent me the triangle was one of the town s first saloons in the immediate postprohibition era it was this narrow little store , loaded with people sometime they 'd wait outside to get a taste of real beer , mr munce said before that , it was a grocery store mr munce has been able to identify three people depicted in the mural dick maney , a theatrical new york city publicist \( tallulah bankhead was his most famous client \) , is shown as a beefy man seated in a booth and wearing a checkered suit seated across from him is an actor , george mitchell jr on left side of the twopart mural , portrayed as an artist in knickers with a palette , is paul reilly , a cartoonist for life magazine those are the people i can pin down , said mr munce shrdlu ashe of new milford , one of mr ashe s sons , said he believed the actresstype shown with mr maney is tallulah bankhead , mr munce said after the mural was discovered during the recent renovations , nearly everyone involved in the project said they were pleasantly surprised by banana republic s quick decision to restore and incorporate the mural in its new store our role was to be instrumental in alerting all of the people in the corporation to the importance of this , because none of them knew anything about westport other than the fact that they wanted to open a store here , said sheila o'neill , executive director of the westport historical society the mural is another item that serves us out of the wonderful history of when westport was the mecca for all the illustrators and cartoonists that wanted to live here , ms o'neill said they were a closeknit group who all knew each other they really had quite a circle shrdlu ashe said his father was an illustrator and busy comic book artist who did a lot of commercial work for advertising firms in new york city he also developed two comic strip heroes , guy fortune and mark hunt , for a comic syndicate in buffalo the mural was painted while the ashe family lived in norwalk it was just one of the jobs he did , mr ashe said right now , the mural is a big deal and i'm sure banana republic spent a lot more refurbishing it than he ever got for it mr ashe believed the mural may have been painted in late 1940 s or early 1950 s , much later than other estimates by art conservators after moving to new milford , the elder mr ashe gradually weaned himself from commercial work in new york city and began earning a living from painting local advertising signs , portraits at fairs , and landscapes for area inns a retrospective of his father s work was held in new milford recently , mr ashe said cunninghamadams fine arts painting conservation of sandy hook was hired to stabilize , clean and preserve the ashe mural the husbandandwife team of george w adams and christy cunninghamadams have restored 21 of westport s 1930 sera works progress administration murals , among their projects nationwide \( including several at the us capitol \) most notable in town is the restoration of robert lambdin s twopiece mural , which was carefully peeled from a renovated elementary school building and relocated to the westport public library according to mr adams , the conservation of the ashe mural faced four problems , the first being that it was fragmented so we knew from the outset that we were going to have to present , aesthetically , a fragment of a painting , not the whole thing , he said the ashe mural was also unstable and detached from the wall it had to be restored inside a busy construction area and the mural was seriously damaged and discolored by the fire to make things easier for the conservators , building contractors erected an enclosure around the mural area to protect the art from the noise and dirt of construction work then , the couple began the elaborate process of stabilizing the mural to the brick wall behind it , cleaning its surface , filling and retouching scratches and blemishes , and applying protective varnish layers you can tell its been through something , ms cunninghamadams said it s very old and has damage , but we wanted to preserve the evidence of real life and not make it look like it had n't had life it s no use trying to make something like that look like new , it never will look new we tried very hard to do this delicately , so we lowered the visibility of the scars without completely camouflaging it we tried to leave it with evidence of its history there i think the most significant thing about the restoration of the ed ashe mural is the fact that a large company like banana republic listened to the people in the community and made arrangements to redesign the store so the mural could be saved in an appropriate location , said mollie donovan , a member of westports arts advisory committee the fact that they did that is a very important feature photos a mural by edmund m ashe jr hangs behind the cash registers at the banana republic store in westport at left , sheila o'neill of the westport historical society and howard munce , an artist and art historian , both worked to identify the

the return of capital punishment has reinforced the longheld suspicion that new york is not one state but two there is new york city and its suburbs , with the bulk of the state s murders but a fraction of its deathpenalty cases and there is the rest of the state , where prosecutors seek the death penalty far more often , and homicide defendants have been 10 times more likely to face possible execution this striking imbalance accounts for what may be a more surprising trend some opponents had worried that under the new law , enacted four years ago , death sentences would fall disproportionately on minority defendants but because most upstate counties are predominantly white , a defendant in a new york deathpenalty case is far more likely to be white than black though whites make up only 21 percent of the state s murder defendants , they are 55 percent of the defendants in capital cases the debate over the death penalty usually concentrates on whether it is a useful and appropriate tool to reduce crime it is hard to measure what impact , if any , capital punishment has had on new york s murder rate , which has declined sharply for nearly the entire decade and the disparities regarding geography are not the only unforeseen consequences of the death penalty law in new york there have also been an unexpectedly small number of capital cases thirtyfour murder defendants about 1 percent have faced possible execution only two have been sentenced to death , and no one has been executed proponents had predicted that prosecutors would seek the death penalty in 15 to 20 percent of murder cases each of these trends underscores the ultimate source of power on the death penalty local prosecutors who have broad discretion in deciding who will face execution and who will not the death penalty in america is made by local officials , said george h kendall , a staff attorney at the naacp legal defense fund , who works on capital cases around the country some district attorneys use it , and some do n't geographic distinctions have cropped up in many of the 37 other states with the death penalty what you 're seeing in new york is typical , though not usually so stark , said david c baldus , a professor at the university of iowa school of law what you usually see is that , in center city , there is relatively little interest in capital punishment in the prosecutor s office the federal government and most states do not keep detailed statistics about the use of the death penalty , including the racial breakdown of which murder defendants become capital defendants but academic experts have studied geographic disparities in selected states patterns in other states , but with differences for example , mr baldus examined all murder cases in which the defendant was eligible for capital punishment in new jersey from 1983 to 1991 he found that 10 percent of the potential capital cases resulted in death sentences in the state s urban areas , while 24 percent resulted in death sentences in rural and suburban areas political differences between urban and rural cultures account for many of these distinctions , mr baldus said in other states , experts have noted different geographic patterns in texas , prosecutors in harris county , which includes houston , have brought many capital cases during the 1990 s , while prosecutors in dallas have brought relatively few and in florida , prosecutors brought proportionately few capital cases from 1973 to 1991 in dade county , which includes miami , and in broward county , which includes fort lauderdale but prosecutors in rural northern counties and some other cities including pensacola , daytona beach , orlando and tampa , sought the death penalty much more often , according to a study by michael radelet , the chairman of the sociology department at the university of florida while no two murder cases are exactly alike , there are enough similarities to illustrate the differences between prosecutors in the politically conservative counties of upstate new york and those in and around new york city in buffalo , for example , jonathan parker was accused in 1997 of fatally shooting a police officer district attorney frank j clark of erie county sought the death penalty a jury convicted mr parker last october , but rejected execution in favor of life without parole in manhattan , district attorney robert m morgenthau did not seek the death penalty against scott schneiderman , who was accused of killing a police officer as he fled from a botched attempt to rob his own father in a chelsea apartment in 1996 mr morgenthau instead pursued a sentence of life without parole and , like virtually all prosecutors , would not discuss his reasons publicly a jury convicted mr schneiderman last month , and he was sentenced last week to life without parole some of the reasons for the disparities between upstate and downstate which includes new york city and the counties of nassau , suffolk , westchester and rockland are obvious four of new york city s district attorneys personally oppose capital punishment two of them , mr morgenthau , robert t johnson of the bronx , have never brought a death penalty case nor has district attorney denis dillon of nassau , who is opposed but neither have two district attorneys who support the death penalty , jeanine f pirro of westchester and william l murphy of staten island mrs pirro said the law was so restrictive that few murders qualified there is not a lot of discretion in the law , she

san francisco , june 18 walking into davies hall for the openingnight concert of the san francisco symphony s current stravinsky festival on june 11 , i thought for a moment i had been zapped to a manhattan movie theater on a weekend night among those who filled the 2 , 700seat concert hall were the middleaged and elderly culture buffs who traditionally have been the mainstays of american orchestras but there were young people everywhere , arrayed in jeans , sports shirts , sneakers and other casual wear , as well as many snazzily dressed young couples \( mixed and samesex \) clearly enjoying a special night out it was enough to make the heart soar with hope for the future of classical music college students , postgraduates , young professionals these are exactly the people that every orchestra in the united states is trying to attract , however unsuccessfully the san francisco symphony is obviously doing something right and remember , the audience on this night had come for an allstravinsky program that included only one familiar work , the rite of spring san francisco is a culturally rich place but its orchestra was not such a source of excitement under the previous music director , the distinguished though rather stolid herbert blomstedt the new vitality seems largely due to the music director since 1995 , michael tilson thomas , m t t as he is called here , even in the newspapers mr thomas has sometimes been underrated by critics put off by his theatricality \( his family worked in the yiddish theater \) , his kinetic podium style and , during earlier days , his occasional lack of discipline this seems unfair he is a fine musician with an affinity for music ranging from josquin to stockhausen , a skilled conductor , a gifted pianist , even a sometime composer at 54 he has lost none of his enthusiasm and attained new maturity on the basis of these concerts he is also an impressive orchestra builder the playing was excellent , and the musicians seemed palpably inspired that mr thomas has become such a presence in the city surely helps he shares a house in the pacific heights section with his companion , joshua robison , and mr thomas s ease about his personal life has made him a role model to san francisco s many gay and lesbian residents he takes his dog on walks in the park , he hikes in the marin county mountains , and he is happy to take feedback about the orchestra from those who approach him he has invited a singer he first heard at a local jazz club , kim nally , to perform in a forthcoming gershwin program his family concerts are hugely popular not since leonard bernstein has a conductor shown such a knack for speaking about music helpfully but the most important tenet of mr thomas s work was recently characterized by an orchestra spokeswoman it s the programming , stupid mr thomas has been able to convince mainstream listeners that unfamiliar music , particularly from the 20th century , including new works however challenging or confusing , can be stimulating and exciting achieving balance and providing context are his operating principles in putting programs together mr thomas is hardly turning the san francisco symphony into a newmusic outfit audiences hear plenty of standard repertory a typical mix is one new work , one from the earlier 20th century , and something old a program this spring , for example , offered stravinsky s canticum sacrum , william kraft s recent timpani concerto and ravel s oneact opera l'enfant et les sortileges an interesting fall program that no one could call offputting presented strauss s till eulenspiegel s merry pranks , the world premiere of robin holloway s clarissa sequence and the brahms fourth symphony mr thomas has said that performing a standard repertory work , like the brahms fourth or beethoven s eroica , is the hardest challenge he faces these great works were once audaciously modern , and they should retain a sense of their radicalism today how do you do this \? for starters , by not overperforming them , nor by performing them in some selfconsciously different way ideally they should be presented in a context , both on a particular program and in entire season , that makes the audience hear them freshly this stravinsky festival , the final programs of which are on june 24 and 26 \( sacred works \) and june 25 \( stravinsky in america \) , presents additional challenges but mr thomas s basic approach remains the same , as the opening night program , stravinsky s russia , made clear when the rite of spring is performed today , this smug attitude often comes through , as if the conductor were saying here is this radical ballet score that provoked a riot at its paris premiere in 1913 , but now do n't we all just find it terribly thrilling \? so let s have a good laugh at those old parisians mr thomas was more interested in the music s russian roots than its place in the history of modernism so he presented it in a russian context , beginning with a great work you almost never hear reynard , a burlesque for four soloists and orchestra though stravinsky drew the story of a wily fox from russian folk tales , the music uses no folk tunes it is utterly original , brashly humorous and full of color
schools chancellor rudy crew presented a broad proposal yesterday to halt the practice of promoting students with failing grades beginning next year , saying it would tax the school system s resources but move it toward higher academic standards dr crew estimated that up to 362 , 000 students nearly onethird of the 11 million pupils in the public school system would be forced to attend summer school next year to be promoted , the students would be required to pass a test administered at the end of the summer session , and dr crew projected yesterday that as many as 88 , 000 of them would fail the test and be forced to repeat the grade the plan , which the board of education is expected to vote on later this month , would apply to students in grades 3 to 12 parents had a mixed reaction to the plan , with some calling it too punishing on the students but others saying it held the potential to help the system and randi weingarten , the president of the united federation of teachers , said that dr crew could be hard pressed to find enough teachers to implement the plan dr crew had initially proposed holding back failing students in the fourth and seventh grades beginning in the 19992000 school year but he came under pressure from mayor rudolph w giuliani to end the practice known as social promotion in all grades , and dr crew and his aides accepted the idea the chancellor had already announced that up to 70 , 000 third , sixth and eighth graders would be required to attend summer school this year or be held back dr crew portrayed the new plan , which would use standardized test scores , class work and attendance to assess which students may be held back , as necessary to raise achievement in a school system that as recently as tuesday received word that scores on citywide reading and math tests had declined sharply over the last year i know that there has been an awful lot of people over the course of the last several weeks , maybe longer , who have actually thought from time to time that this is really a public school system unable to redeem itself , dr crew told reporters before a board meeting yesterday i find that not to be the case at all but he and his aides acknowledged that the plan would severely tax the resources of the school system lewis h spence , the deputy chancellor for operations , said dr crew s plan would cost the school system 176 million more than the 60 million to 70 million it expects to spend in the coming summer session about 200 , 000 students are expected to attend summer school this year , including the 70 , 000 third , sixth and eighth graders required to by dr crew mr spence said that classroom space and teachers have been lined up for this summer mr spence said city hall was committed to helping find the additional 176 million that would be needed for next year s summer session , but at least one board member , sandra e lerner , who represents the bronx , urged dr crew and his aides to seek stronger assurances that the money would be there officials of the giuliani administration did not return telephone calls seeking comment last night mr giuliani has said he would help the board search for more funds to help end social promotion , though he has said some of that money can come from cutting fat from the board s bureaucracy only about a fifth of the classrooms in the school system have airconditioning , and many buildings are closed in the summer for renovations and other construction work dr crew said he would look for space at community colleges and in other buildings to house students , but conceded that finding enough suitable space might be difficult in terms of trying to keep it as local as we can and as close to children s homes as we can , dr crew said , we are going to try to use existing facilities , but i know that pattern wo n't hold in every borough board members gave cautious support to the plan yesterday none said outright that they would not support it , but some expressed qualms irving s hamer , who represents manhattan on the board , said he was concerned that the chancellor s plan took a broadbrush approach to holding back students and did not put enough emphasis on individually assessing them ms lerner , the bronx representative , said , you must have the resources before you implement the policy she further raised concerns that unless the summer session , typically five or six weeks long , was held in a student s school , the student would not go , especially if it was far from home dr crew and his aides said the new promotion standards would differ significantly from those in current practice the policy has evolved in the last 20 years , as education philosophy has shifted nationally to the point where few students are ever held back , on the grounds that it would hurt their selfesteem and that they would often repeat the same work with the same poor results dr crew said students in any grade could be held back an unlimited number of times , though students who were held back would receive what judith a rizzo , the deputy chancellor for instruction , called an accelerated curriculum of intensive instruction to prepare them for the subsequent grade
louisville , ky , april 30 three of them bring horses and intriguing tales to their first kentucky derby two others have been here before one wears a black cowboy hat and needed a judge s ruling to get his horse into the starting gate another survived the destruction of her tokyo home during world war ii , taught asian studies at the university of kentucky and did n't begin training horses until 1993 there is also a graduate of d wayne lukas s finishing school , a hall of famer and a budding training star who came within a length and a half of winning here last year at least for two minutes saturday , dallas keen , akiko gothard , dallas stewart , scotty schulhofer and elliott walden will be linked in the 125th running of the kentucky derby their horses valhol , k one king , kimberlite pipe , lemon drop kid and ecton park have been lumped together in the race s mutuel field for horse racing aficionados , that means the churchill downs oddsmaker , mike battaglia , determined these five horses were the least likely to win in a crowded 19horse field the horses are grouped this way out of necessity the churchill tote board can handle only 14 betting interests \( a 20th horse , aljabr , was scratched today \) for casual fans , however , necessity means sort of a price club bargain opportunity think of it as buying in bulk a 2 bet on no 14 in the program brings five horses for the price of one in one of the most open fields in kentucky derby history we 're all here because we think we have pretty good horses in our barns , said stewart , the lukas protege we all think we got a good shot to win the horses do n't know the odds , stewart added , shrugging off the 121 odds on his kimberlite pipe and the rest of the field horses the field had been bet down to 71 by tonight history has not been kind to horses that toil in the field they have won only three times in 124 years the most recent victory came in 1971 when canonero ii part of a sixhorse field circled wide from 15th place into the winner s circle and paid 1940 on a 2 bet to win but the trainers choose to ignore the low rate of success and none more than keen , the cowboyhatted colorado native who has been a force on the modest louisiana and texas circuits his valhol became the most infamous kentucky derby entry in recent times when arkansas racing officials withheld the 300 , 000 firstprize money the gelding earned by winning the arkansas derby the dispute , which has yet to be resolved , centered on whether valhol s rider , billy patin , applied an illegal electrical device , or buzzer , to valhol in order to goose him to a victory spurt for two weeks , the 41yearold keen has been in virtual quarantine at barn 42 as first uncertainty , then legal maneuvers , swirled about his horse on the eve of the deadline for derby entries , valhol s owner , jim jackson , won an injunction that forced the arkansas racing officials to release the money the winnings got valhol in the race but did not quiet the bitter words on the backstretch if i saw what they saw , and i owned that horse , i 'd be embarrassed to show up at the derby , said the trainer randy morse , whose colt , torrid sand , failed to make the field now keen , who has denied knowledge of any wrongdoing , has only one thing to comfort him his horse this is a nice colt , he said the first time he came to this track , it was like he 'd been here every day he s got some cool , and i got to believe in that stabled around the corner from valhol is gothard s colt , k one king gothard is 68 and the only female trainer with a horse in the race she came to the united states in 1957 , earned a psychology degree and joined the faculty at the university of kentucky but by 1970 , gothard was seduced by the bluegrass country s major industry and began buying and selling horses she picked up a nice colt named john henry for 1 , 500 , had him gelded and sold him for 25 , 000 it was shrewd trading even though john henry went on to win more than 5 million , barreled into racing legend and was twice named horse of the year in k one king , gothard may or may not have her first john henry as a trainer the runnerup in the galleryfurniturecom stakes is an improving colt who has been impressive in workouts here bringing the horse to the derby is as difficult as writing a dissertation , said gothard , whose everpresent smile has made her one of the most welcome sights on the backside it s made me more philosophical what you put in life good and bad is what you take from it stewart , the other firsttime derby trainer , learned his trade from lukas , the latest hall of fame inductee stewart was an exercise rider for the lukastrained filly winning colors , who won the derby in 1988 he was an assistant trainer when the stable won the derby in 1995 and '96 with thunder gulch and grindstone like his mentor , the 39yearold stewart is among the first at the barn and the last to leave , and the hard work has transformed kimberlite pipe from a 11 , 000 yearling to the louisiana derby winner and a triple crown hopeful he gave me a lot of rope , stewart said of lukas he was n't always breathing down on me he gave me an example and taught me a lot rounding out the field entries are two trainers who have had their hearts broken here last year , walden s victory gallop ran second to real quiet in the derby and again in the preakness before catching him at the wire in the belmont to thwart his rival s triple crown bid walden also trains the current third choice , menifee , but his ecton park is part of the field ecton park , a forty niner colt , was favored in the arkansas derby but failed to get a grip on the track and finished fourth but after ecton park donned blinkers early this week and blitzed a workout in 1 minute 2 seconds over five furlongs , walden perked up he stubbed his toe a little bit in arkansas , walden conceded i like them to have a little confidence going into the biggest race of their life he was super today it was left for schulhofer , the lone hall of famer among the trainers of the mutuel field horses , to inject reality into the current situation he came here in 1987 with the florida derby winner , cryptoclearance , and ran fourth in lemon drop kid , he has a spectacularly bred horse that won more than 222 , 000 last year and is suited for the oneandaquartermile distance here but the kingmambo colt has been a disappointment as a 3yearold he s a good horse who is as ready as he s ever going to be , schulhofer said in his lilting south carolina drawl the question is is he good enough and is he lucky enough \? the odds may be long that any of the field horses prove either good or lucky but if one of them somehow earns the blanket of roses , the odds are 100 percent you 'll hear a good story photos akiko gothard , with k one king , is the only female trainer with a horse in the derby \( agence francepresse \) dallas keen , right ,

moscow , may 13 with russia s political and economic fates in suspended animation after the sacking of prime minister yevgeny m primakov , the communistled parliament began a surreal and mostly ritual struggle today over whether to impeach president boris n yeltsin for treason , genocide and other crimes in a day of largely legalistic speeches , mr yeltsin s opponents charged , in the words of one , that he plunged the russian people into the deep chasm of suffering and unfortunate decisions in eight years as president , leaving a trail of blood and tears the blood of the killed and maimed the tears of the dying , the deprived and the humiliated communist leaders said they were certain to obtain the required 300 votes in the 450member lower house to pass at least one of the five impeachment counts , a judgment some others disputed behind the scenes , mr yeltsin s emissaries were said to be lobbying furiously , dangling job offers and other inducements before undecided legislators their goal was more a political victory than a legal one for an array of reasons , this impeachment is unlikely to lead to mr yeltsin s removal from office outside the parliament , meanwhile , the very real struggle over russia s future set off by mr primakov s dismissal began to take on a clearer form on the day after he replaced mr primakov , a communist favorite , with his loyal interior minister , sergei v stepashin , mr yeltsin made no public appearance or comment mr stepashin scheduled a meeting with parliament s leaders and said he had no specific candidates in mind for positions in his cabinet but others began to sketch the outline of a new government in which socalled radical reformers those who charted the freemarket policies that ended with last august s economic collapse might again play a leading role most of the speculation focused on the crucial post of first deputy prime minister for economics and finance , which has been occupied under mr primakov by a communist , yuri maslyukov among the names being floated for the job are boris fyodorov , who was pushed out of the government last year after his federal tax service began dunning major russian companies for unpaid taxes , and viktor khristenko , an international finance expert who is currently deputy finance minister appointment of either man would reassure russia s international creditors , who hold the key to the country s economic recovery and who are already unsettled by the week s developments that was underscored today when the world bank , which has nearly 5 billion invested in russian programs , suspended plans to lend an additional 2 billion until the country s financial course becomes clearer the international monetary fund has agreed to extend russia 45 billion more enough to forestall a truly crippling default on the country s foreign debt but only if the parliament enacts a package of politically unpopular tax increases and other belttightening measures mr primakov had already negotiated parts of that package with his communist supporters in the parliament the yeltsin government said today that it would continue to support it , and the parliament s speaker , gennadi seleznyov , a communist , said he expected its approval this month mr yeltsin has filled a second deputy s post , on the same rank as that of the economic and finance position , with nikolai aksyonenko , a midlevel official who currently runs the state railroad monopoly mr aksyonenko s duties remain illdefined , but he may supervise the government s industrial policies on another important front , russia s foreign ministry said the country s foreign policy was unaffected by mr primakov s dismissal , and it appears likely that the current foreign minister , igor ivanov , will stay while mr yeltsin has clearly laid down a challenge to the parliament by dismissing mr primakov , it was not apparent today what the parliament intended to do about it , beyond press for his impeachment communist leaders promised to meet mr primakov s dismissal with a nationwide round of street protests , but none of any note occurred nor was it clear how they would deal with mr stepashin a few see the choice of mr stepashin as a sly warning that any effort to remove mr yeltsin from office will come back to haunt the legislators mr stepashin made his career running russia s formidable internal security forces some believe mr yeltsin wants those forces close at hand should he decide to move against his foes by declaring a state of emergency and seizing parliament s powers others say parliament would shy away from removing mr yeltsin because , under russia s constitution , that would automatically elevate mr stepashin to the post of acting president the parliament could reject mr stepashin s nomination but that is in some ways an even greater risk because the constitution potentially allows mr yeltsin to dissolve the parliament under those conditions and call new elections and most analysts believe the communists would lose legislative seats in a new election most of the calculation , however , was drowned out today by the drone of the impeachment debate , which was devoted almost entirely to a recitation of the charges against mr yeltsin and a technical argument by his defenders that those charges were not based in law the president is accused of five crimes illegally disbanding the soviet union destroying the russian military waging an illegal war against the breakaway republic of chechnya staging an illegal coup against communists who sought to seize control of the government in 1993 , and genocide against the russian people , whose average life span has declined since russia became independent most of the charges are widely seen as propaganda tools of mr yeltsin s communist rivals , and have no chance of being approved the exception is the charge involving the chechen war , which is supported by at least 280 legislators votes on the five charges are expected to take place after debate ends on friday or saturday any charge approved by the parliament must be referred both to the supreme court , which would rule on its legal content , and to the constitutional court , which judges the constitutionality of the proceedings finally , for mr yeltsin to be ousted , the upper house , the council of federation , would have to approve it in fact , an impeachment charge involving the chechen war would probably die an early death in the supreme court , which is unlikely to overturn a 1995 ruling by the constitutional court that upheld the legality

it is n't often that one leaves a dance performance feeling sore from laughing but that was the case with paco alonso s espanolisimass on saturday night at theater east , a hilarious yet loving tribute to flamenco singers , dancers and styles from the 1920 s on mr alonso , who is from barcelona , has danced and sung flamenco with antonio ballet espanol , jose greco and jose molina and has also performed on television and in musicals in spain an uninhibited female impersonator in espanolisimass , mr alonso was exuberantly awash in seas of errant flamenco flounces , frizzy wigs and paper , silk and beaded flowers as he sang and danced numbers evocative of stars including antonia merce , pilar lopez and dolores la cabezona a huge presence on the tiny stage , mr alonso put the emphasis less on embodying women than on deft comic timing , wordplay and escalating , inspired silliness his evocation of ms merce was intriguing a pursedlipped maiden auntie as popular star , peering nearsightedly and ineffectively at music on an elaborately decorated stand then lunging close to the microphone with wildly hyperactive castenets there were glints of affecting tenderness in his performance to a song about flowers in the cuple style a knowledge of idiomatic spanish was helpful , in general , but not necessary la constanza was mr alonso s genial sidekick the show opened with potent flamenco dance and music by rafaela reyes , luis heredia , paco ortiz and la trianera mr alonso performs in new revues through june 19 at the redesigned theater east , which now has something of the intimacy and rakish charm \( though none of the dust \) of barcelona s bodega bohemia

the preferred term is urban entertainment destination for almost a decade , retail cognoscenti mall developers , theme park owners and entertainment giants like disney , dreamworks , and universal

thom mckay , vice president of rtkl associates , a baltimorebased design firm , put it , urban entertainment centers are the holy grail sony , a newcomer to the field , has come up with a unique blend

sony s done is remarkable , said mike rubin , president of mra international , a retailing and entertainment consulting firm in philadelphia they really broke the mold it is an approach to retail

, per shopping trip developers have long been searching for ways to bring excitement back to their palaces of consumerism sony s effort has its roots in two trends that are increasingly seen as solutions emphasizing entertainment and recreating the vitality of authentic city streets but safely socalled festival marketplaces , like faneuil hall in boston , the renovated baltimore inner harbor and south street seaport in new york , built in rundown but historic neighborhoods , were among the first experiments such developments have fallen out of favor , mostly because they continue to require heavy government subsidies the next wave of innovative malls , in the early 1990 s , relied on attractions to create novelty but most just plopped features like a multiplex theater or a theme restaurant into a standard amalgamation of stores the mall of america in minneapolis which houses an entire amusement park but also the usual jumble of chain stores is the archetype more harmoniously

are more explicitly focused on entertainment , with shopping secondary , sony s metreon has tried a more delicate balance the company s path toward metreon was hardly obvious having sold its products mostly through retailers , sony had scant experience with selling directly to consumers many executives were skeptical about any moves in that direction the early feeling was that sony s entry into the urban entertainment business should be a minitheme park , light on the retailing , like disney quest or gameworks in fact , sony s initial concept was much more disneyesque than the final plan the idea was to mine the sony music and film divisions for characters to become the basis for attractions , like a luther vandross after hours club and a cinetopia cafe that would change its design to suit the newest sony releases but sony s fiefs were not enthusiastic about sharing control of their stars sony responded by trying to determine what truly united its disparate realms its answer was

a surprising new study found that the drug mark mcgwire said he used on his way to breaking the singleseason record for home runs did not build muscle but did increase the risk of heart disease , pancreatic cancer and breast enlargement the study of the drug , androstenedione , is the first of many called for by the white house , by organized baseball and by the medical profession , because the use of the drug increased rapidly after last year s acknowledgment by mr mcgwire the study also appears to have produced the first scientific evidence on the safety and effectiveness of the drug , though it was developed in east germany in a governmentsponsored athletic program nearly 30 years ago , the researchers said the research was financed by experimental and applied sciences of golden , colo , which distributes a product containing androstenedione an editorial that accompanied an article on the study , in today s issue of the journal of the american medical association , suggested that the federal government move quickly to consider removing the drug from the market it is sold legally without a prescription though it closely resembles anabolic steroids , for which a prescription is required there is thought to be little chance that the drug will be taken off the market without further research , though studies are being urgently pushed ahead at harvard university and elsewhere androstenedione , a synthetic form of a compound that occurs naturally in the body and is converted to the male hormone testosterone the body s major muscle builder caused none of the expected increases in blood levels of testosterone and no enhanced physical strength , the researchers said instead , they found that it raised levels of the female hormone estrogen elevated levels of estrogen in men , in heavy doses , has been linked to increased risk of pancreatic cancer and breast enlargement the researchers could not explain why androstenedione produced this effect they also noted a significant decrease in highdensity lipoprotein , the good type of cholesterol that carries plaque away from blood vessels and reduces cardiovascular disease dr douglas s king of iowa state university , who led the study , said in an interview , i find it quite shocking to see not the thinnest of evidence backing the claims being made in this new multimilliondollar business industry officials estimate that sales of the many companies now making and distributing androstenedione will exceed 100 million this year , up from average annual sales of about 5 million dr king and his colleagues enrolled 30 young men , ages 19 to 29 , in a controlled , random trial for eight weeks twenty of the men were put on an eightweek , resistance weighttraining program ten of them received 300 milligrams of the drug a day and 10 received a placebo \( manufacturers generally recommend a dose of only 100 milligrams a day , the researchers said \) the study found no difference in added strength or added muscle mass between those in the group who took the placebo and those who took androstenedione , nor did testosterone levels differ members of the third group of 10 were each given one pill containing 100 milligrams of the drug one day a week , and checked for increases of testosterone in their blood every 30 minutes for the next six hours the next week each was randomly selected to receive either another dose or a placebo , and their blood levels were checked in the same way that tested the claim of some manufacturers that a 100milligram dose increases testosterone levels in the body by 300 percent almost immediately , an effect they say lasts three hours the researchers found no testosterone increases in this group dr gary i wadler , a clinical medicine professor at the new york university school of medicine , said the study was very important in beginning the fill the gaps research must be done now with much higher doses than those recommended we know much higher doses are being used widely dr charles e yesalis of pennsylvania state university , an authority on steroid abuse , who wrote the editorial accompanying the iowa article , said some advertisements for the product are suggesting daily doses as high as 500 milligrams to 1 , 200 milligrams dr wadler said the iowa study reinforced the need for more research on new androstenedione products combining androstenedione and other ingredients that are being rushed to market almost no scientific research has been done on these products , he said only modest use was made of the drug , introduced in the united states three years ago , before mark mcgwire s statement that he used androstenedione , which he has said he still uses major league baseball has not banned it , though other sports associations have anyone can buy it as a result of drug deregulation laws enacted in congress in 1994 , and no action has been taken against the drug until now the industry argues that in the form in which it is sold , it is not harmful medical authorities have strongly disagreed , saying that once in the body , it converts to a hormonelike steroid , like estrogen , which can be dangerous in large amounts many health experts have expressed concern , dr yesalis said , that its use by sports heroes would encourage youngsters to use this steroid hormone indeed , the white house s office of national drug control policy said the drug s use among young people had increased fivefold since mr mcgwire s disclosure experimental and applied sciences distributes andro6 , which contains androstenedione , and one of the study s coauthors is the company s manager of research and development , dr matthew v vukovich in answer to questions about the study and whether eas would continue to market andro6 , the company issued a statement saying eas finds the research from iowa state university to be very interesting and suggests it be taken into account by anyone considering taking androstenedione because it is difficult to draw conclusions from any one study , eas is committed to continued support of additional research on androstenedione
surveying the recent spate of books about women , even the most dedicated feminist might find herself muttering , be careful what you ask for , you might get it i'm thinking of the way the personal is political , that watchword of 1970 s feminism , has morphed and mushroomed into something quite other than originally intended indeed , almost the opposite as originally articulated in the consciousnessraising groups of the 70 s , the personal is political was a way of saying that what looked like individual experiences , with little social resonance and certainly no political importance rape , street harassment , you doing the vacuuming while your husband read the paper were part of a general pattern of male dominance and female subordination it was a way of understanding your experience and connecting it to the hitherto unsuspected experiences of others wow , your husband always interrupts you too \? the point being to challenge the social and political and legal structures that shape our lives the personal is political did not mean that personal testimony , impressions and feelings are all you need to make a political argument the important texts of feminism have , in fact , been rather unselfrevealing simone de beauvoir spent more than 700 pages in the second sex analyzing women s position in society through every conceivable lens anthropological , economic , historical , literary , psychoanalytic , biological , philosophical , legal except that of her own life , about which the reader learns next to nothing at a more journalistic level , betty friedan s feminine mystique was almost as magisterial and sweeping and only slightly more autobiographical a mountain of reporting and research lay behind friedan s engaging , accessible pages , and that is one reason millions of women found their lives mirrored there contrast these books on women s condition with some of this year s more highprofile efforts in a return to modesty , a 23yearold conservative journalist , wendy shalit , cites her experience in fourthgrade sex ed to argue that feminism and liberal sexual mores have encouraged men to degrade women the solution women should stay virgins , and arm themselves , as shalit implies she has done , with blushes and long skirts to inspire chivalry in men in what our mothers did n't tell us , danielle crittenden advises women to imitate her own early marriage and motherhood she waited until 28 , but recommends 23 blithely disregarding the welldocumented high failure rate of this life plan after all , who would you rather be , danielle crittenden or a lonely crone in your 30 s whose male coevals cavort with younger women whose eyes have not yet begun to crinkle \? over toward the left end of the spectrum , susan maushart , in the mask of motherhood , paints a dismal picture of new mothers reduced to jelly by society s mixed messages and lack of support her chief case study herself two years ago we had katie roiphe s last night in paradise , which argues that we overrate the risks of aids we meaning educated white young heterosexuals like roiphe and naomi wolf interviewing herself and her high school friends for her book on young women s sex lives , promiscuities feminist or antifeminist , moi s the word the lens of the personal lets you see your life as an instant trend thus , wendy shalit begins her book by describing her growing fascination , and eventual identification , with modestyniks young jewish women who have been raised in a secular home and who suddenly adopt orthodox dress and modesty codes \( no touching , not even hand holding , before marriage \) and are happy and sane , although regarded as freaks by their bedhopping peers a few pages later , having mentioned two books that feature happy young christian fundamentalist women and quoted a new york magazine article about happy orthodox jews , she declares a modestynik epidemic and invites the reader to wonder , why would so many young women be adopting modesty as the new sexual virtue \? so many \? how many \? ten \? ten thousand \? in several days of calling and mass emailing all over academia i was unable to turn up any professor , counselor or student who was aware of this supposed trend as for williams college , where shalit was an undergraduate , i never saw any student being a modestynik here , said prof sam fleischacker , one of the few observant jews on campus secular young women adopting the appearance of orthodox practice without the substance of belief and torah learning \? said rabbi devorah jacobson , former associate chaplain at williams that does n't resonate with my experience at all once the political has been reduced to the personal , the author can portray herself however she likes with respect to the general case she can declare herself the tip of an iceberg no one else can see , like wendy shalit , or a bold dissenter from the misled majority , like danielle crittenden a member of the rightwing independent women s forum , crittenden , who is married to the conservative writer david frum and is the mother of two children , writes as if women were scorning family life for studio apartments and lean cuisine but are they \? true , women are marrying later 25 is the median age but they 're still marrying postponing marriage does n't , in fact , mean forgoing it , as crittenden argues and her claim that mothers work because they have been led up the garden path by feminism leaves unexplained her own career as writer , editor and ubiquitous lecturer and tv guest the real difference between crittenden and most women is that she is wealthy , well connected and , being a writer , does n't need to worry about credentials and career ladders and rusting skills
richmond here on the streets of virginia s capital , melvin douglas smith was known for his luck as much as his troublemaking for all the charges brought against him in state courts over a decade , from larceny and resisting arrest to illegal firearms and murder , none stuck he never served a day in prison then mr smith s luck ran out when a patrol officer pulled him over for a traffic violation in 1997 , the officer looked in the car and found 12 grams of crack cocaine , a 12gauge shotgun and a 9millimeter pistol the combination of guns and drugs was his undoing under a new program aimed at gun offenders called project exile , prosecutors were able to charge mr smith in the tougher federal system he is serving 16 1 2 years in a federal prison as cities across the country sue the gun industry or buy back handguns as last resorts to get them off the streets , project exile is being credited for helping reverse a decade of rising crime rates in richmond by moving gun offenses into the federal system , where bond is less available , sentences are longer and convicts are sent out of state to serve their terms officials in richmond concede that other factors are contributing to an overall drop in violent crime but as an experiment testing whether violent crime can be reduced by aggressively enforcing existing gun laws , project exile is expanding to other cities , while the national rifle association is promoting it as the best alternative to more restrictive gun laws the justice department , long an adversary of the nra over gun control , has held back from recommending project exile as a cureall , and a panel of federal judges in richmond has criticized it as a federal intrusion into state matters but philadelphia and rochester have adopted the program , and more than a dozen other cities are considering it while project exile s precise contribution has yet to be studied , the authorities in richmond say it helped cut their rate of homicides by firearms by 36 percent last year , to 78 homicides from 122 in 1997 , one of the steepest declines in any city the program has also helped the authorities solve older cases once mr smith was sentenced , for example , witnesses no longer afraid of him came forward with enough information to charge him with six murders , including two that could bring the death penalty in richmond , there has been an intense need for people to become believers in their own community , mayor timothy m kaine said high crime has been our psychological downer but project exile is driving the crime rate down , and that is starting to make richmonders believers again patterned after federal efforts to fight illegal drug activities , the program evolved from a determination by the united states attorney s office in richmond to prosecute gun charges in federal courts , where the consequences are more severe than in state courts , even though federal courts generally regard gun violations as lowlevel crimes many gun offenses can be prosecuted in federal or state courts but project exile officials in richmond have decided that certain gun offenses , like those involved with drugs or when the person arrested is a convicted felon , will be tried in federal court as another key element of project exile , business and civic leaders have cooperated with the richmond police by saturating the area with radio and television messages , billboards and posters , warning that anyone caught with an illegal weapon faces a jail term of five years project exile is so well known on the street , said david e boone , a criminal defense lawyer here , that the first thing i hear now when i talk to a client is , 'can you keep this from going exile \? ' a lot of them ca n't add two and two , but they know a gun plus drugs equals five some do , anyway s david schiller , an assistant united states attorney here who conceived the program , said the first two years of project exile had led to the recovery of 475 illegal guns , indictments against 404 people on gun charges more than six times the annual average a conviction rate of 86 percent through trials and plea bargains , and an average prison term of more than four and a half years and richmond police officers say the program is convincing some wouldbe criminals to leave their weapons at home still , not everyone is convinced that project exile is the appropriate means to attack the gun problem in a recent court opinion , all three judges of the federal district court here characterized the program as a substantial federal incursion into a sovereign state s area of authority and responsibility and the justice department has remained reluctant to promote it as a national solution to gun violence deputy attorney general eric holder said recently that department officials take issue with the notion that there is a cookiecutter approach to reducing gun violence mr holder also said the department had sent additional federal marshals , agents and prosecutors to make exile successful
most americans may not know it , but there are really two wall streets one is the wall street of the new york stock exchange closing bell , of brash stockbrokers and hairtrigger traders , of big deals and big fortunes , of microsoft and mutual funds but in the crooked alleys of lower manhattan flourishes another wall street this is a world of lowpriced stocks and highpriced dreams , of grimy offices and sham companies , of swindlers and touts who prey on average people trying to grab the brass ring in the greatest bull market in american history like the world of organized crime , with which it increasingly overlaps , it is a violent place full of colorful characters and arcane lingo , of naked shorts and pump 'n' dumps and it specializes in creating illusions that are as complex as a broadway play and as simple as a game of threecard monte it was in this world that albert alain chalem and maier lehmann lived and died the men , who were promoting stocks over the internet together , were both shot in the head on oct 25 and left to die on the marble floor in the 11 million home in colts neck , nj , where mr chalem lived their world might seem arcane except that its denizens bilk americans out of roughly 2 billion a year , securities regulators say the problem is so severe that regulators and prosecutors have made it one of their chief goals to crack down on what they used to dismiss as pennystock fraud , before it became clear that the money involved amounted to many billions of pennies a sustained , prolonged bull market really does bring out the crustaceans from the bottom of the sea , said richard h walker , director of enforcement for the securities and exchange commission they 're attracted to the money while the enforcement effort has closed down many of the big brokerage operations that pushed shady stocks over the telephone , mr walker said , many people who were kicked out of the securities business have moved their schemes into cyberspace that s where the action is now , he said and that is where mr chalem and mr lehmann were before they were killed in addition to running a web site , mr chalem was trading stocks electronically , and may have had an account under an assumed name at a manhattan firm called harbor securities investigators are examining whether he traded there , and if it was linked to his death page b6 from the very first , investigators have suspected that the slayings somehow involved the two men s financial dealings , rather than their personal lives and , although the investigation remains in its early stages , law enforcement officials have clearly not changed their minds on the surface , mr lehmann , 37 , seems to have had the more troubled work history he had pleaded guilty to mail fraud in an insurance scheme and settled civil securitiesfraud charges before his death he told barron s magazine that he had secretly worked at patterson , travis inc , a small brokerage firm with a history of regulatory troubles company officials said yesterday that they had no record of his having worked there in fact , mr lehmann was more than willing to talk he told reporters , regulators , prosecutors and , apparently , anyone who would listen about what he said were various schemes and swindles but it was mr chalem , 41 , who cast the longer shadow in the world of shady stocks , and it is mr chalem who is increasingly the focus of investigators he had worked at a brokerage firm , a s goldmen company , that prosecutors contend was a criminal enterprise a charge that the firm denies he also worked secretly at a firm called toluca pacific securities , according to several people who knew him toluca , which is defunct , had a long history of regulatory runins and had links to career felons and to organized crime mobsters have increasingly turned up in stock swindles in january , two men whom prosecutors said were tied to the bonanno and genovese crime families pleaded guilty to federal charges that they participated in a conspiracy to manipulate the stock of an arizona company that owns a health club the president of the company was convicted of related charges in may in federal district court in manhattan in june , federal prosecutors in brooklyn indicted a group they said included members of the colombo crime family and an associate of the bor organized crime group of russian immigrants the men , who prosecutors said ran rogue brokerage firms that manipulated stock prices , were charged with conspiracy , securities fraud and money laundering they pleaded not guilty mr chalem was widely believed , in the penny stock world , to have dealings with russian organized crime and to be a protected guy , as one lawyer put it new information is coming to light about his activities in the weeks before his death last week , federal prosecutors served subpoenas to retrieve trading records , which may be linked to mr chalem , from harbor securities , which catered to selfemployed day traders heavy financial losses recently forced the firm to close
the manhattan bridge was closed to brooklynbound traffic during the morning rush yesterday after officials discovered a broken drain cover on the upper level of the bridge , city transportation officials said all brooklynbound traffic was rerouted away from the bridge beginning at 7 am , leading to heavy traffic congestion along canal street and elsewhere in lower manhattan two of the three brooklynbound lanes were reopened shortly after 10 am , and the remaining lane was opened at 3 pm , said mark patterson , a spokesman for the city s department of transportation officials said the problem broken bolts meant to secure one of 13 storm drains on the upper level of the bridge was discovered at 6 45 am the bridge is normally congested with heavy trucks and other commercial traffic in both directions on weekday mornings , since the closest alterative for crossing the east river , the brooklyn bridge , is off limits to commercial vehicles while the broken bolts were replaced , mr patterson said , all of the other 12 storm drains on the bridge s upper level were inspected as a precaution he said none of the other drains were in need of repair

skopje , macedonia , april 23 the organization for security and cooperation in europe said today that it had collected testimony and other evidence that serbian paramilitaries and bands of armed civilians have raped , killed and mutilated ethnic albanians in kosovo in the last month in its first official statement on the situation in kosovo since its observers were evacuated from the province on march 20 , the agency said that corroborating accounts and other evidence made the testimonies highly credible none of the evidence has been confirmed the statement released today was based on an internal report the organization s human rights staff members have been compiling the evidence from hours of interviews with ethnic albanian refugees from kosovo , who are now living in camps and villages in macedonia the material , which covers events since march 20 , will be made available to the international war crimes tribunal in the hague , said jorgen grunnet , an organization spokesman here the statement says displacement of ethnic albanians is the most prevalent violation of human rights that has been reported , but it also lists killings , executions , rape , physical abuse , intimidation , harassment , assaults , pillage , shelling , robbery and the burning of houses reports of mutilation and sexual assaults of the dead have also been recorded the report said those interviewed identified those responsible for the abuses as large groups of yugoslav army and police forces and groups of paramilitaries or armed serbian civilians many referred to them as arkan s men or seselj s men arkan , whose real name is zeljko raznatovic , heads a paramilitary force known as the tigers and has been indicted on charges of war crimes by the tribunal in connection with his previous activities in bosnia vojislav seselj is a serbian deputy prime minister and leader of the radical party in several cases interviewees were able to give precise descriptions of the uniforms and insignia worn by these groups , the statement said a substantial number of perpetrators could be identified the interviews have been done in a very meticulous and systematic way , the organization s spokesman said , adding that some interviews took hours to complete we are only saying what we are absolutely certain about refugee accounts painted a picture of total lawlessness and an almost complete absence of any form of protection for ethnic albanians , the statement reads the action would generally begin with attacks from the yugoslav army on civilians and their property , and then be followed by operations by the police , paramilitaries and armed civilians often executions are reported as being done in front of family members or villagers , it said sometimes the victims are separated from the group and are later found dead or not accounted for the number of rape of groups of women is increasing , it continued other reports include torture , illtreatment , harassment , intimidation and use of groups of people as human shields the organization also recorded many reports of mutilations and maiming of victims reports include throat cutting , cutting out of eyes , cutting off breast , nose , fingers , hands , and or feet , slicing of body parts , and carving of serb nationalistic marks on the chest , forehead or other parts of the body , the statement said
early in the film pleasantville , a teenage boy named david flops onto the couch of his suburban home , eyes fixed on the television for a rerun of a 1950 s sitcom , all banter about mom s meatloaf and the school science fair just behind david , meanwhile , his mother argues over the telephone with her exhusband about who s stuck with custody of the boy this weekend before long , in the pivotal moment of pleasantville , he finds himself transported through the picture tube and into the show that scene conflates the two standard images of suburbia in american culture it is either the scrubbed and cheerful utopia of such actual television series as ozzie and harriet and leave it to beaver or else it is the miserable , materialistic dystopia of novelists like john cheever and rick moody from either extreme , the chroniclers of suburbia agree on this much it is white and upper middle class in the last generation , however , suburbia has evolved in startling ways , becoming ever more varied by race , class and ethnicity and eluding the grasp of all but a handful of perceptive artists and entertainers as highbrow films like todd solondz s happiness and popularculture phenomena like the brady bunch revival peddle the same old cliches , reaping money and praise by pandering to audiences that share their smug presumptions , figures as disparate as the author junot diaz of drown , the filmmaker tamara jenkins of slums of beverly hills and the comic d l hughley of the television series the hughleys are presenting the complex portrait of suburbia circa 2000 i always feel really alone in this conversation , says mr diaz , a dominican immigrant reared in central new jersey the world i 've created feels lonely he could be speaking for the fellow artists who depict a suburbia of lowrent apartments beside gated developments , of strip malls and toxicwaste dumps , of the improbable commingling of ambitious immigrants , upwardly mobile minorities and workingclass whites whose security is imperiled by downsizing and deindustrialization the suburbs have changed , but our way of looking at them has n't changed , says rosalyn baxandall , a professor of american studies at the state university of new york in old westbury and coauthor of the forthcoming book picture windows how the suburbs happened the stereotype has always been that the suburbs are for rich people who ran away from the city , and there s alienation and conformity but when i teach my classes , my students are mostly nonwhite i 've had 17 languages in a class some of these families are taking in boarders it s a big , big revelation demographic data lend authority to what mr diaz and ms baxandall describe the percentage of blacks who live in suburbia rose from 23 percent in 1970 to 32 percent in 1990 , the demographer william frey of the state university of new york at albany has found some 40 percent of all minorities are suburbanites , according to the 1990 census the los angeles suburb of monterey park , which is 60 percent chinese , has emerged as the archetype of the socalled ethnoburb the counterbalance to the successful movement of immigrants and minorities into suburbia , though , is the deterioration of innerring suburbs these communities , clinging to the borders of cities , have been growing poorer , more segregated and more troubled for decades , losing population nearly as rapidly in some cases as urban ghettoes several years ago , the federal government surrounded its own office complex in suitland , md , a suburb just outside washington , with a chainlink fence topped by razor wire the seismic shifts that have engaged scholars , though , have escaped many of the makers and consumers of culture what s missed is the diversity of suburbia , says greg hise , a historian at the university of southern california who specializes in urban planning at least with urban novels and films , you see cities as a place of freedom , autonomy , possibility with the suburbs , the writers and producers and directors are working with a set of accepted wisdom we see the same stories about suburbia because we expect them early in this century , suburbia actually received a more nuanced portrayal academics like graham taylor and chauncey harris delineated a variety of suburbs commuter , industrial , working class f scott fitzgerald s great gatsby , set in a fictional version of great neck , ny , memorably etched the tensions between old money and parvenus , treating gatsby s social climbing as the stuff of tragedy with the suburban boom after world war ii , however , the stereotype of nuclear families in splitlevel homes was born if in truth suburbia was already more stratified than that , with whitecollar scarsdale virtually next door to bluecollar mount vernon , the myth nonetheless reflected a certain amount of fact about the fast growing middleclass and the extraordinary increase in home ownership it was true , too , that federal mortgage regulations and private covenants conspired to keep much of suburbia white

charismatic flew through thunderstorms into new york yesterday morning for the final scene in his triple crown drama , accompanied by three horses who will try to snatch the belmont stakes from his grasp and shepherded by his trainer , d wayne lukas , who was wearing a big white cowboy hat and keeping a wary eye on his celebrated horse we 're at the crossroads in racing , lukas said , taking the broad view after stabling charismatic in his stall at belmont park tracks are changing ownership and the business is searching for answers a triple crown winner would be an enormous thing for racing then he made it clear that winning the triple crown would be an enormous thing for the entire charismatic team , too charismatic has responded at every turn , lukas said he s had three great runs , in the lexington , the kentucky derby and the preakness if he gets one more , we 'll all be very happy if he does n't , we 'll still be very happy after being delayed two hours in louisville by weather , charismatic was led down a ramp from the chartered horse plane and up another ramp into a van for the short trip from kennedy airport to belmont park then lukas hustled upstairs just in time to take part in the draw for the belmont stakes , and was rewarded when charismatic drew the no 4 post position in the starting gate and was made the 21 favorite twelve horses were entered , which will be run for the 131st time saturday and which has completed triple crown honors for 11 winners , though none since affirmed in 1978 it has also meant the end of the dream for 14 horses , including the last six who tried , starting with spectacular bid in 1979 and reaching a peak of drama in the last two years , when silver charm and real quiet lost thrillers at the finish line bob baffert , the trainer of silver charm and real quiet , will try to spoil the lukas scenario when he runs the filly silverbulletday , who drew the no 3 slot alongside charismatic and was made the third choice at 41 behind charismatic and menifee at 72 baffert had already flown to new york from churchill downs the night before the horse caravan arrived , and lukas played a teasing game with him we had some really bad weather in louisville that delayed the boarding of the horses , he said , with a smile they were all eager to get on the plane except silverbulletday she was reluctant to get on baffert , undaunted by any suggestion that his filly might resent the challenge of racing 11 colts a mile and a half , later replied with a straight face wayne said she traveled beautifully but baffert , trying to put the task into perspective , added fillies can take only one of the triple crown races if she had trained this way before the derby , we would have entered her in the derby but the derby was n't the right time for her the preakness , we drew the outside post now , we 've cranked up her works she s a classy filly who moves effortlessly , and we 'll find out if she s good enough but , like lukas , he also viewed the belmont stakes philosophically i 've been through this two years in a row , he said you have to have a great horse to win two triple crown races we need stars in racing and you have two of them running saturday three , if you count menifee and his trainer , elliott walden , who spoiled real quiet s bid last year when victory gallop won the belmont by a nose , appeared with his two rival trainers at the draw ceremony menifee is showing less strain than victory gallop did , he reported in the derby , he ran a great race i think he could have won if he got turned loose a little earlier the two horses who accompanied the stars on the flight were pineaff , winner of the tampa bay derby , and prime directive , second in the derby trial and the illinois derby post position in the belmont stakes is not particularly important because the track is wide and the distance long , giving the horses plenty of room and time to get into position for their best moves the rail was drawn by the 991 moon shot , teletable , trained by alfredo callejas , with bill mott s vision and verse to his right , at 201 on the far outside , menifee drew no 10 and , to his right , stephen got even and best of luck
lynbrook , ny , nov 15 the marion street elementary school , which was closed for three days for a cleanup last week after toxic levels of airborne lead were found in a basement rifle range , reopened again today after school officials said the school was safe state education officials , citing the experience in the lynbrook school district here , issued a memo today to all districts that have shooting ranges , advising them to test their ranges for environmental hazards the problem must be addressed quickly in the interest of children and all those who work in the schools , said tom dunn , a spokesman for the state department of education mr dunn said there were 26 districts with interscholastic rifle teams in the state , down from 65 teams 15 years ago nine teams are in nassau county , where school officials in the districts involved said today that they had already taken steps , in light of lynbrook s experience , to have their ranges tested none , however , said they would close their schools to do so as students returned this morning to the marion street school , they and their parents were met at the door by the schools superintendent , william metkiff , who assured them that the rifle range had been cleaned and repeatedly tested to make sure there were no toxic remnants threatening the students and staff last week , mr metkiff said he was permanently closing the range , which was used by the district s high school rifle teams all the classrooms are clean , and the range remains closed and sealed off , he said mr metkiff ordered the tests after a parent who opposed the range asked about possible health hazards the lynbrook rifle team had used the range for more than 35 years mr metkiff said the 30 students who signed up for the team this year and their coach were now looking for a shooting range outside school in garden city , also in nassau , superintendent stephen leitman said that the district s old range had not been used for 15 years and that the high school team practiced at nassau county s public shooting range in uniondale he said that even though the old range in the basement of the high school had been sealed off , he ordered last week that testing be done after hearing about the lynbrook range elevated levels of lead were found in some areas inside the range , so we 're having it cleaned and then resealed , mr leitman said the other nassau county school districts that have rifle ranges and teams are massapequa , freeport , bellmoremerrick , valley stream , baldwin , glen cove and sewanhaka officials in each district said today that so far , the situation in lynbrook had not prompted any parents in their districts to call for range closings there are no rifle ranges in suffolk county schools , state officials said the sewanhaka school district , the largest in nassau , with 8 , 000 students , has an active range in its hyde park high school that is inspected yearly and meets all standards as set by the national institutes of occupational safety and health , said dr george goldstein , the district s superintendent we have n't heard from any parents about the range , only from the media , dr goldstein said in the valley stream school district , the superintendent , dr martin brooks , said that after he received word from mr metkiff last week of the problems in lynbrook , he immediately ordered the testing and cleanup of the district range in memorial junior high school all of the air samples were well within osha guidelines , he said periodically , the school board discusses the philosophical question of whether there should be guns of any sort in school , including the rifle club , he said , adding that the board had continued to support the team since the shootings at columbine high school and elsewhere in the country , there is a growing sensitivity to the issue , he said but so far i 've received no calls from parents about the range in valley stream dr marc bernstein , the superintendent of the bellmoremerrick school district , said tests were being done on its shooting range at calhoun high school and two others that were closed 15 years ago
after all the indictments and revelations of scandal , the new leaders of district council 37 , new york city s giant municipal union , have taken steps to reshape the union as the muscular force it once was but in trying to prepare for a more forceful role in coming contract negotiations and next year s senate race , district council 37 has clashed repeatedly with the giuliani administration , which has attacked the union s new combativeness as a misguided effort that serves neither its members nor the public under lee saunders , the trustee heading district council 37 , the union has not hesitated to oppose mayor rudolph w giuliani on workfare and privatization unlike stanley hill , the giuliani ally who was ousted as executive director , mr saunders has begun a smallscale war against mr giuliani s workfare program , filing three lawsuits against it and maintaining that it places welfare workers in a kind of servitude in recent months , district council 37 , by far the largest union of city workers , has stated forcefully that it will not accept a twoyear wage freeze as it did in its current contract instead , it is demanding a generous share of the pie in next year s contract talks , now that the city has a budget surplus estimated at 2 billion when i first came here in november , this institution was broke , and the members were very disheartened , said mr saunders , who has long been an assistant to the president of the council s washingtonbased parent union , the american federation of state , county and municipal employees we needed to reinvigorate this institution , and since november we 've done that i believe the members feel good about the direction dc 37 is taking but his efforts to restore the union and its image might be tripped up by robert m morgenthau , the manhattan district attorney , who plans to empanel a new grand jury after labor day to hear new evidence about wrongdoing by council officials and in seeking to reinvigorate the union , mr saunders has got on mayor giuliani s bad side , creating a sharp contrast with mr hill in an interview at council headquarters in lower manhattan , mr saunders had unflattering words for the mayor , and city hall officials quickly responded in kind choosing his words carefully , mr saunders described the mayor as testy and added he s pretty inflexible he does n't have the ability to compromise his initial positions it s awfully difficult to have differences of opinion with him because he goes on that one straight line and does n't move off of it that poses real difficulties in running a major city deputy mayor randy levine , who oversees labor matter for city hall , hit back just as hard city officials have been displeased with the many demonstrations that mr saunders has helped organize to protest workfare and the mayor s privatization plans \( mr hill hardly ever organized protests , but mr saunders said they were vital to rebuild the union s spirit and mobilize its membership \) the bottom line is lee has been there more than six months , and i do n't think he s delivered one thing , mr levine said they 're just meandering in the wilderness i do n't know what they 've done except for holding protests they have n't accomplished anything such harsh words portend hard and perhaps illspirited bargaining when mr saunders and other union leaders begin negotiating with mr giuliani s team on a new citywide union contract this coming winter or spring mr levine , who described mr saunders as a nice guy trying to do the right thing , said he should follow mr hill s example and work out differences with city hall through compromise but many union leaders say that mr hill was so intimidated or outmaneuvered by the mayor that he made too many concessions , including accepting the unpopular twoyear wage freeze in the current fiveyear contract city officials insist that mr saunders has betrayed two agreements that mr hill reached with the city , one allowing the city to privatize services under certain conditions and the other accepting the workfare program , by far the nation s largest fearing that 200 union members will lose their jobs , mr saunders is battling the city s plan to use a private contractor to replace a cityowned laundry in brooklyn that serves public hospitals and he said he could not accept a workfare program that in his view violates state law by using welfare recipients to perform jobs once done by city workers workfare is very unfair to the participants , mr saunders said they 're essentially performing functions performed by permanent employees who used to receive wages and benefits while the workfare workers receive none a number of them say it is a kind of servitude under mr saunders , the district council is becoming more visible and more liberal in politics three weeks ago , district council 37 became the first big new york city union to endorse vice president al gore , who is seeking the democratic nomination for president this early endorsement , labor leaders say , indicates that the union hopes to become the political heavyweight it was in decades past
for months , the john hancock mutual insurance company had been steaming smoothly toward a major reorganization that would permit the sale of shares to the public , raising the likelihood of nice bonuses for policyholders and considerable wealth for some top executives but on friday , a massachusetts appeals court reinstated a lawsuit that dredges up an old scandal in which the company was charged with illegally bestowing gifts dinners , tickets to shows and sports events and outings to resorts on more than two dozen massachusetts legislators in the 1980 s and early 1990 s the litigation revives questions about the integrity and management of john hancock , one of the nation s largest life insurers , at a time when the company has been doing everything possible to enhance its attractiveness to potential investors the dispute s ultimate damage , insurance industry analysts said , will depend on how it plays out in the courts the suit strikes at the core of the company in it , one of john hancock s seven million policyholders the formal owners of the mutual company contends that the top executives and directors participated in , or approved , the illegal lobbying and saddled the company with expenses of more than 4 million in fines , legal fees and other costs in 1994 , john hancock acknowledged that its lobbying , on a range of issues including legislation permitting the company to reorganize and sell stock , violated massachusetts law the company paid 101 million in fines about a dozen state legislators , including , paul cellucci , who is now governor of massachusetts , also paid small fines in her lawsuit , the policyholder , loretta m harhen , is demanding the resignations of john hancock s highest executives stephen l brown , the chief executive , and david d'alessandro , the president , as well as e james morton , a former chairman , who like the others is on the board she also wants them and two former employees raeburn b hathaway , who headed the government relations department as the scandal unfolded , and a former chief lobbyist , f william sawyer to repay the company the 4 million ms harhen is not seeking direct compensation for herself john hancock says in court papers that the decisions by its executives were entirely appropriate but in a 38page decision , three appellate judges concluded that that contention should be tested at trial the legal assault could not have come at a more delicate time for john hancock , a company with assets of 67 billion and revenue last year of more than 136 billion it has been trimming and polishing its operations in hopes of drawing top dollar when it begins selling shares with other mutual insurers also preparing to issue shares , competition for investors is intensifying two years ago , john hancock agreed to pay 350 million to settle a classaction suit asserting that the company , like many other big life insurers , who were also sued , had misled customers into buying policies they did not need on guard against anything that could rekindle memories of the past scandals , mr d'alessandro reacted quickly to the disclosure earlier this year of corruption among the organizers of the olympic games , which john hancock has sponsored for years he yanked the olympics logo from all the company s promotions and suggested that unless the games regained their sterling image , john hancock would be gone as a sponsor the integrity and quality of john hancock s leadership will be particularly important as the company presents specific plans in coming months for the reorganization and the distribution to policyholders of at least 33 billion in accumulated profits the plan , which for the first time will make executives eligible for stock options , is subject to approval by both policyholders and the massachusetts insurance commissioner how this will all play out is unclear any litigation against a company is not good news and particularly any litigation in which the company has lost an appeals decision , patrick finnegan , a senior analyst at moody s investors service , said but in order to assess the impact of this , one would really have to wait to see how much of the company s resources have to be used and whether it brings real pressure on the executive officers to step down this could be a fly in the ointment or it could very well be a big deal stephen p burgay , the chief spokesman for john hancock , said the company still expected the reorganization to be completed early next year and did not expect the offering price of the stock to suffer no one , he said , planned to resign this matter was thoroughly investigated years ago by the us attorney , the fbi , a federal grand jury and the state ethics commission , he said none of these investigations found senior management to be involved in improprieties john hancock s adversary in the lawsuit , jason adkins , the founder of the center for insurance research in cambridge , mass , said the criminal investigation did not address management s responsibility to the owners of the corporation the us attorney was looking out for the citizens of the state and the taxpayer , mr adkins said this suit is about protecting the rights and interests of the policyholders mr burgay says the suit is all about publicity and trying to squeeze the company as the offering nears john hancock will most likely try to settle the suit swiftly indeed , mr burgay did not discourage that line of thought we 're considering all our options , he said unless the lawsuit develops into a courtroom brawl , analysts said they expected that the opportunities for personal enrichment for policyholders , investors and top executives would keep the company rolling toward a stock market destiny it would be unusual for a policyholder s suit to derail a process with so much momentum , said eric n berg , an insurance analyst at cibc world markets should the lawsuit succeed , mr burgay said john hancock s corporate liability insurance would be expected to pay any obligation assigned to the executives but robert mescal , a specialist in initial public offerings at the institute for econometric research in deerfield beach , fla , said the executives would not necessarily need insurance they could simply pay , he said , and make sure the options on the ipo would be sufficient to cover the cost
mozart , being a practical man , wrote piano concertos with disposable parts take away the woodwinds and brass and a soloplusorchestra piece became chamber music if a customer for his compositions had not the means and the space to employ many musicians , a quintet fit nicely in more modest parlors the presenters at carnegie hall , being practical people , noted the prestige of alfred brendel and its ability to fill 2 , 800 seats , and put mozart s little version in the kind of space it was created to circumvent such are the paradoxes of the music world but also , i suppose , of every world mr brendel , in new york for a septathlon of pianistic and literary events , began his series on friday night with mozart for four to five players there were the two piano quartets and , after intermission , the amajor concerto \( k 414 \) in strippeddown form his colleagues were young string players brought from britain to come in the next weeks are two piano recitals , two evenings of songs with matthias goerne , a solo appearance with the met orchestra and a poetry reading friday s concerto is perhaps the gem of mozart s early vienna period we should all know it better if the music rolls along at an unhurried pace , it is filled with wonderful coups of inspiration and , in its first movement , one of the composer s more powerful minorkey episodes mr brendel , restrained but passionate , made himself into the most gentlemanly of chambermusic players , listening carefully to his string players while commanding the respect to be listened to in turn the gminor quartet was the evening s biggest statement , in terms of size and elaborateness , its most concertolike music it was also performed as such the key is one mozart reserved for darker , wider thoughts \( the nexttolast symphony , for example \) and if the piano part tries to burst out of its confinement , mozart ingeniously transforms and sublimates the opening dramatics into chamber music proportions the other piano quartet , in eflat , is one of those mozartean puzzles graceful , perfect , bland , sometimes even boring the eflat quartet is like one of those beautiful , perfectly formed creatures we see around town , gorgeous but vacanteyed , flawless but without the charisma that draws one close mozart s technique was always in working order , but sometimes , it would seem , his spirit went to sleep it is certainly better balanced chamber music than its partner the piano part is relatively retiring , blending with the ensemble rather than crushing it as the gminor often does the bigger problems on friday had to do with the instruments and the space a hall this big plays into the hands of the 20thcentury piano , which by its nature ca n't help dwarfing everything around it none of the instruments were the ones mozart wrote for , and the hopeful equation that goes modern piano against modern strings equals 18thcentury piano against 18thcentury strings does not work the proportions do n't survive updating both the piano and the violin have become more powerful , but the first at a greater rate yet what a lovely program and how lovingly played a full house on friday ignored the builtin distortions and seemed happy for what it got mr brendel s ardent young colleagues , whom he shepherded around the stage like a solicitous parent , were katherine gowers and lucy jeal , violinists douglas paterson , violist , and adrian brendel , cellist and yes , the last name signified the evening s true parental connection photo lucy jeal , violinist , with alfred brendel , in mozart works \( chris lee \)
at the cacophonous end of another memorable yankees world series run , the cameras sought out the stars , and their faces glistening with champagne lighted up the night far away from center stage of this now familiar theater , clay bellinger found his wife outside the clubhouse , they kissed , and their eyes welled with tears jennifer bellinger had 2weekold cole in her arms , while trying to keep her other children 7yearold ashli and 4yearold cody from disappearing into a mass of yankee families and famous friends spike lee edged past then billy crystal and george steinbrenner , with his best buddy , the mayor , while all the familiar television faces dashed about , none of them stopping to put a microphone in the face of the yankee they most likely did not know in this telegenic age of overexposure , it is virtually impossible even for the most casual of fans to not recognize a champion new york yankee there are only slightly more than two dozen , but here was one his uniform drenched , his world series champions cap backward who could walk down a corridor , be a face in the crowd my face is going to be in the team photo of the world champions , bellinger said after the yankees had swept the braves and the season out of new york late wednesday night and it s going to be there forever forever is a long time , but clay bellinger , who for a decade has harbored bigleague dreams as if scripted for bull durham , finally found the best company to spend it with at 30 , without a major league statistic to his name , he fought his way onto the yankees at as good a time as any to be a member of the most famously successful team in a hundred years of american sports maybe the best of all times , considering the record three million plus who this season paid their way into a ball park the owner once claimed people were terrified to go near certainly it would be difficult to refute the argument that the yankees' 25th championship team its hefty payroll and its nearmetronomic postseason precision notwithstanding is the most endearing of all from the cancerstricken manager , right on down to the last utilityman that would be clayton daniel bellinger , who a year ago watched the yankees sweep san diego like the rest of america , fighting sleep after a long day s work he had gone home to chandler , ariz , after hitting 224 at the yankees' class aaa columbus farm he needed a job , supplementary income , the way it used to be for all but the superstars , the chosen few , in the major leagues i worked in a warehouse , shipping and handling , bellinger said when you 're a minor leaguer , when you 've got a family to support , that s what you do one year later , after an almost unfathomable life turn , he could count on as much of a world series share , several hundred thousand dollars , as bernie williams and paul o'neill he is 6 feet 3 inches , 195 pounds , out of oneonta , ny , and was thrown a life preserver by the yankees' organization after being released by baltimore two years ago don zimmer took a liking to him , the grizzled , limping bench coach with more than a halfcentury in the big leagues struck by the passion of a young man just dying for a taste prostate cancer hit joe torre early last spring the interim manager zimmer , an old softy at heart , was an emotional mess himself breaking the news to bellinger that he had finally made the majors clay called me from anaheim and he was crying , jennifer bellinger said all those years , all those towns , and it finally had paid off with the exception of a sixweek demotion in late july , bellinger toured major league america for the first time , and perhaps last he saw yogi berra come home he saw joe dimaggio mourned he saw david cone s perfect game he had 45 atbats , nine hits , a yankee stadium home run on sept 2 i know torre has stated his professional reasons for including a 250 career minor league hitter on the postseason roster , instead of a jim leyritz or shane spencer i wonder , though in the spirit of this team s public vulnerability , its tender disposition , i am inclined to believe that someone made a sentimental decision along the way his 31st birthday coming next month , his major league future hardly assured , clay bellinger got into four postseason games , had a playoff atbat his parents are coming down from oneonta for today s parade that will roll slowly along the canyon of heroes for a man who labored 10 long years to get here , this procession cannot move slowly enough photo clay bellinger \( mary dibiase blaich \)
riyadh , saudi arabia , march 17 ever so gingerly , the internet is being allowed across some final frontiers , into restrictive parts of the islamic world , under the wary eye of governments used to playing big brother in places like saudi arabia , where access was barred until two months ago , the change is being hailed as a belated revolution internet cafes have sprung up in teheran , iran , and here in riyadh , and novices are being dazzled by sites like yahoocom still , the authorities are trying to have it both ways in iran , users who are monitored by some providers must promise , among other things , that they will not contact stations against islamic regulations , a reference to sites with sexual content violators are warned that they could lose internet privileges censorship in saudi arabia is even more overt under a system that took two years to develop , all internet connections in the country have been routed through a hub outside riyadh , where highspeed government computers block access to thousands of sites catalogued on a rapidly expanding blacklist want to check out what opposition groups abroad have to say about the ruling saud family \? forbidden ! ! ! the computer responds how about a chat service that allows for , well , freewheeling conversation \? no again a game of blackjack \? uhuh all access attempts are logged , users are warned somberly , in a hint that any attempt to stray beyond what the saudi government considers acceptable bounds could have further , unspecified consequences still , the enthusiasm with which the internet is being received seems to reflect a view that a little access is better than none at all sometimes i get angry that we had to wait so long , said hisham a turkistani , 25 , a saudi who sat hunched over a computer in the cafe de paris in jidda , saudi arabia s first internet cafe , listening to mariah carey on mtvcom but now the internet is all that my friends and i talk about there are so many things in this world ! on a recent evening at the cafe in jidda , on the red sea coast , other customers who were paying 12 an hour for the privilege included a medical student , hilal sonbul , 25 , clearly amazed as a technician showed him how much information about his future profession could be found with a few keystrokes across the persian gulf in iran , at another brandnew cafe , a young man was sending an electronic greeting card to a friend in the united states he had also spent his friday afternoon downloading applications , he said , for admission to graduate schools , among them the engineering program at the city university of new york it used to take three or four weeks for letters to get through , said the young man , who would give his name only as hamid now it takes a few seconds i know that some people here are afraid of the internet , but i do n't think most of them even know what the internet is technophobia is hardly new to the middle east , where the sensitivities of strict islamic cultures and the worries of securityconscious governments have long combined to justify censorship at one time or another , every government in the region has jammed radio broadcasts , intercepted publications , scuttled fax transmissions , barred mobile telephones or prohibited satellite television but since the arrival of the internet , many countries , including egypt , jordan and lebanon , have quietly conceded the fight , concluding that the benefits of the new technology far outweigh the cost in those countries and others , essentially unrestricted internet access has been available since the mid1990 s still , more conservative governments like those in syria , iraq , iran and saudi arabia have done their best to keep walls in place there is no internet access in iraq and syria , where the concept is being studied by a committee headed by the son of president hafez alassad , an indication of the matter s sensitivity in iran , an islamic republic that prohibits the publication of photographs of women unless their heads and bodies are covered , ordinary people were not permitted graphic access to the internet until december 1997 , after the election of president mohammad khatami ushered in an era of relative openness even now , the service , with prices beginning at 330 a year for one hour a day , remains too costly for all but a few in saudi arabia it was not until january that users could get access to the internet without first establishing an account abroad and then connecting to the provider via an international call , at a cost of at least 1 a minute under new rules , 42 local providers have been licensed , after a highlevel government study that lasted two years but the service has been plagued by growing pains , and only 10 , 000 saudis have signed up so far , though some 115 , 000 are expected by the end of the year a small fraction in a country of 20 million and still , neither delays nor limitations have assuaged fears that the information highway is a road to corruption a top iranian cleric , ayatollah janatti , warned in a recent friday sermon that the disgraceful , immoral pictures broadcast on the internet were an affront to all humanity , morality and chastity that threatens us all even now , the iranian government has still not officially legalized internet use , perhaps with an eye to conservative militias that have threatened attacks on the offices of internet providers in saudi arabia criticism has been muted since king fahd issued a decree in march 1997 calling for the drafting of guidelines for internet use , thus offering the idea his implicit endorsement now that the system is in place , saudi officials are seeking to call attention to what is quickly becoming available , including internet banking , instead of what is banned there is nothing to block except two things that which is against our religion , and that which is against our society , said abdullah alrasheed , deputy director of the king abdelaziz center for science and technology , a government entity that supervises the internet in practice , those criteria have proved farreaching one local provider s effort to establish a saudi chat site was rejected , apparently out of concern that it would allow contact between unmarried men and women still taboo in a society in which even dating is prohibited apparently for similar reasons , videoconferencing also remains off limits sites containing nudity or sexual material are rendered inaccessible and the absolute ban on content against our society has kept a lid on political dissent , barring access to sites that offer any hint of criticism of the saudi government the restrictions have prompted some quiet criticism , mostly from parents who argue that online contact between young people is a healthy alternative to trying to suppress such contact altogether they 're not hearing the voice , they 're not seeing the face , so where is the haram there \? samar fatany , a radio broadcaster , asked , using the arabic word for something prohibited for religious reasons i do n't think anyone can label it as a sin to enforce the rules , the saudi government has

brad grey , who grew up in buffalo studying show business so closely he all but memorized every line from the classic comedy the honeymooners , certainly knows the name max bialystock that was the zero mostel character in the antic mel brooks film , the producers , who sold off endless percentages of his latest broadway production to unsuspecting widows in the last five years , mr grey , the chairman of brillsteingrey entertainment , has made deals for 50 percent interests in his television production company to no fewer than three separate partners , none of whom would ever qualify as widows or as unsuspecting abc , universal and sony poor max bialystock wound up in jail mr grey has wound up collecting millions in producer fees and he still has 50 percent of the latest iteration of his television production company , bgtv , a joint venture announced last week with the columbia tristar television group of sony mr grey appreciates the humor in the comparison to the producers , but understandably does not want it taken literally for one thing , he never intended to change partners and dance so many different times i would have loved to have stayed in business with abc or universal for a long time , mr grey said it was , he added , circumstances beyond his control namely that both those companies changed corporate hands shortly after his deals were consummated that altered his relationships beyond that , he emphasized the quality of the product coming out of his company , which certainly is not of the same nature as max bialystock s unforgettable musical flop , springtime for hitler in fact , in at least his most recent series , the sopranos mr grey has come up with something unforgettable of his own , the mosttalkedabout television show of the season his track record also includes the burgeoning hit comedy just shoot me , as well as the highly regarded \( if never highly rated \) comedy news radio , both on nbc , and another ongoing comedy , the steve harvey show , on time warner inc s wb mr grey s company also produces politically incorrect for abc , and it was the production company that created the larry sanders show , another groundbreaking series , for hbo if you 're talking deals , brad is the best , ted harbert , who once led abc s entertainment unit , said abc ended the deal with him before it paid off , but if they had stayed in , and realized the full potential of shows like 'just shoot me , ' abc would have done quite well indeed , the changes that have undone mr grey s dealmaking are mainly rooted in the volatile nature of the television business in hollywood mr grey made his deal with abc in 1994 the network became his banker , financing development of his shows in exchange for coownership and first crack at them this was attractive to abc because brillsteingrey s management side controlled so much talent , including stars like adam sandler , brad pitt , nicolas cage , dennis miller , david spade , bill maher and courtney cox but a year later , abc was acquired by the walt disney company referring to the disney chairman , mr grey said , michael eisner told me disney was not in the business of owning half of another company after some negotiations about joining disney as an executive , mr grey went in another direction in 1996 , he sold 50 percent of brillsteingrey entertainment to mca inc s universal for an estimated 100 million in effect , that meant disney was supplying financing for shows to be coowned by universal this was not a situation disney found appealing the company settled with mr grey , retaining a small interest in some of the shows but mr grey s deal with universal had hardly taken root before universal sold most of its television operations to usa networks the deal was not transferable , meaning he was now in partnership with a studio that had essentially closed down its television business and thus had lost the leverage that would help get mr grey s shows on the air after again contemplating a possible jump into the executive ranks , as head of a new universal television division , mr grey decided to stay with his own company the philosophy was very simple , he said we started in the talent business we have to stick to talent but the economics of the television business , in which producers accumulate big deficits hoping for hits to pay them back , usually demands a big company s bankroll by now mr grey knew this game well this time he approached columbia tristar jon feltheimer , the president of the columbia tristar television group , cited mr grey s track record a lot of money was being made , mr feltheimer said why would n't we want to be in business with brad \? mr grey negotiated a settlement with universal and set up bgtv columbia will cover production overhead and will supply 15 million to 20 million a year to develop new shows the dealmaking has at least one other dizzying layer mr grey has made further partnerships with networks to help insure his shows get on the air in the sopranos , hbo is his partner and will share in sopranos merchandising mr grey also brought nbc in on news radio to keep the show on the air last year and ceded ownership interests to the network in two new comedy pilots for next season arrangements like this have been criticized by producers who say they were forced to pony up financial interests in shows to get them on the air , but mr grey dismissed such complaints as whining one partner mr grey no longer does business with is garry shandling , the star of the larry sanders show , and once a close friend in a highly publicized lawsuit , the actor accused mr grey of taking money both as a manager and a producer mr grey denied the accusation and countersued he said of the coming trial , i 'd like it to get over with he said he was also eager to begin his new deal with his latest 5050 partner , columbia and i 'd be delighted if this partner decides to stay in business with me , he said photos brad grey , chairman of brillsteingrey entertainment , currently has three successful comedies on television nancy marchand and james gandolfini in the sopranos on hbo \( hbo \) dave foley and maura tierney carry on a secret romance on nbc s news radio \( nbc \) laura san giacomo , left , and wendie malick hatch a plot on nbc s just shoot me \( nbc \)
to the editor a statement in your article dueling over dumbo commerce vs parks \( april 11 \) is seriously misleading in describing david walentas s development plans for the neighborhood , you describe the site in question as land he owns on the brooklyn waterfront this is not true mr walentas owns many buildings in the dumbo neighborhood , but none are directly on the waterfront the land that he has sited for commercial development is owned by the city and state this is the only remaining publicly owned land on the brooklyn waterfront more important , perhaps , is that it abuts the brooklyn bridge , one of our national treasures that the city and state are considering and according to mr walentas and his supporters , are committed to turning it ovver to a private developer so he can build what is , essentially , a shopping mall , is unacceptable and contradicts why so many of us choose to live in new york city if we wanted to live near a mall , we 'd live in the suburbs drew mcghee brooklyn heights
in the cupertino , calif , offices of the japanese software developer trend micro , an avalanche of pizza boxes tumbled to the floor from time to time last week , and the company pool table was commandeered as a cot both were a result of programmers' working through the night to create software that would clean the melissa virus from computers whatever the impact on revenues and the company s bottom line , the effort paid off quickly for stockholders on friday , march 26 , the day the virus was first reported , the company s stock , which is traded exclusively in japan , was listed at the equivalent of 104 a share at the close of trading on the following monday , it had climbed to 127 , although by the time federal agents arrested a suspect in the case in new jersey last friday morning , the shares stood at 12448 on the tokyo exchange clearly , the investors seem to think it s good for business , said dan schrader , director of product marketing clearly , we are benefiting from it but trend micro s surging stock is an exception , a benefit of being well positioned in asia , where the use of antivirus software is not pervasive , and of specializing in software to protect email servers , which were melissa s target other antivirus companies failed to get such a lift , in part because they compete in more mature markets but in addition , for giant american players like the symantec corporation and network associates inc , antivirus software is one of many products , meaning that the potential revenue opportunities from battling a new virus are diluted across a broad product line that was not always the case four or five years ago , publicity about viruses produced benefits for antivirus companies traded in the united states similar to those enjoyed last week by trend micro today , the use of these digital vaccinations is so pervasive in the united states and europe , among both companies and individuals , that even the unusual amount of attention given the melissa virus by the news media failed to nudge the market one reason is that in a saturated market , even a potent new virus may inspire very few more people to buy such software at the same time , symantec and network associates both post free updates for each new virus on their web sites , so keeping existing customers protected is a net cost stock prices actually dropped slightly last week for network associates of santa clara , calif , and for symantec of cupertino on march 25 , the day before the melissa virus appeared , network associates closed at 31 a week later , well into the virus publicity , the stock was at 3075 symantec closed at 1663 on march 25 , and was at 1613 a week later it s unlikely that any of those companies is going to see any measurable revenue as a result of the virus , said paul saunders , a research analyst at soundview technology group in san francisco it s not likely there s any huge untapped market to be penetrated it s a fairly mature market he estimated that antivirus software was installed in 75 percent of business computers aggravating the situation , he said , is the fact that network associates , which holds 50 percent of the market worldwide , has been asked by the securities and exchange commission for a clarification of its accounting writeoffs on companies it has acquired the company s stock price behaved very differently after the last major virus announcement in late december , when network associates announced the discovery of a virus called remote explorer , the company s stock jumped 22 percent within a week symantec saw a 13 percent increase in the flurry of publicity do i think the stories had some effect \? yes , said john powers , a networking software analyst for bancboston robertson stephens in san francisco , in an interview in january still , he pointed out that technology stocks in general were strong toward the end of the fourth quarter i would n't get carried away with attributing all that move to the virus stories , he said at the time , officials from both antivirus companies played down the role of virus reports in their stock prices to tie a single event like that to our stock prices is a little difficult , said steve trilling , director of research for symantec , which produces the norton utilities as well as norton antivirus the business grows over time i would n't expect we would see a spike the next week because of remote explorer before the market neared saturation , virus reports often led to huge increases in purchases of antivirus software , a phenomenon that encouraged the companies to publicize the existence of new viruses in their rush to make the first claim and counterclaims , they 're both guilty of overblowing and overpublicizing a strain of virus , mr powers said of symantec and network associates that competitive culture was back in evidence after the melissa discovery last week , with companies pressing their advantages in a barrage of press releases that emphasized speed in producing fixes network associates' press release said it was the first company to offer detection and cleaning symantec offered detection and repair within an hour after spotting the virus trend micro said it had actually discovered melissa and had been the first antivirus vendor to provide a solution for the melissa virus at its web site while none of the three companies would divulge its postmelissa sales figures , they all reported fourfold to fivefold increases in traffic to their web sites but the biggest benefit may have been simple brand exposure i have been on the phone or in front of cameras for two days now , said sal viveros , group marketing manager for network associates the round of publicity , he said , helps position network associates as the technological leader in the antivirus world graph scare tactics losing their power companies that make software to combat computer viruses have not gotten much benefit from recent discoveries of new strains graph tracks share prices of symantec and network associates , since december 1998 \( source bloomberg financial market \)
steven roth s twoyear search for a director of development for his vornado realty trust , the big manhattan commercial landlord , in recent weeks included none other than john e zuccotti , an eminence grise of new york real estate mr zuccotti did not appreciate the call , according to a close friend no mere hired hand , mr zuccotti , the former deputy mayor , is chairman of brookfield financial properties , which owns almost as much manhattan property they were so naive to even think they could hire him , this person said at least two other candidates have rebuffed overtures and bernard mendik , ostensibly cochairman of vornado , left a year ago rather than continue playing third fiddle to mr roth and endure his barbed wit vornado plans to announce an , er , winner early next year this is absolutely everybody s dream job as a developer , said jane lyons , a partner at rhodes associates , hired 82 days ago , she said on friday , for the search but you 've got to have the professional weight and experience to sit at the table with steve charles v bagli
washington , oct 23 one of the biggest surprises of this campaign year has been former senator bill bradley s ability to be competitive with the vice president in the campaign cash sweepstakes mr bradley has raised nearly 20 million this year and has more cash in the bank than vice president al gore but mr bradley s fundraising prowess should come as no surprise , despite his claim to be running as an insurgent candidate who espouses an overhaul of campaign finance he was a legendary fundraiser in the senate raising 9 million a full year before his last senate campaign , in 1990 , and outspending his opponent , christine todd whitman , now new jersey s governor , 15 to 1 he was one of the top congressional recipients of money from corporate political action committees before forswearing their donations this year he was called king of the bundlers in 1990 by the center for responsive politics for his ability to gather scores of 1 , 000 contributions from individuals employed by top investment banks , insurance companies , media concerns and law firms today , mr bradley s unexpected challenge to mr gore is backed by numerous corporate titans , especially those from wall street but it is not only as a candidate that mr bradley has benefited from wall street s largess when he left public office in 1996 , he earned 300 , 000 as a consultant for j p morgan and reaped more than a million dollars from paid speeches , many delivered to audiences of financiers , bankers and health executives wall street s generosity to mr bradley is noteworthy for another reason it does not appear to be rooted in favorable legislative treatment while he was in the senate , mr bradley espoused proposals that the financial world opposed , including an increase in the capital gains tax in his presidential quest this year , mr bradley s list of top fundraisers includes john l thornton , cochief operating officer at goldman , sachs douglas a warner 3d , chairman of j p morgan richard s fuld jr , chief executive of lehman brothers john l steffens , head of brokerage operations at merrill lynch joseph h flom , senior partner at the law firm skadden , arps , slate , meagher flom , who is a powerhouse in the world of corporate takeover battles sanford i weill , cochairman of citigroup thomas g labrecque , recently retired president of chase manhattan , and louis b susman , a managing director at salomon smith barney each has enlisted dozens of bankers and traders from their firms , as well as wealthy friends and relatives , as 1 , 000 contributors to mr bradley s campaign major wall street investment houses are the top six sources of income for mr bradley s campaign , accounting for nearly 600 , 000 this year this has been the easiest fundraising i have seen in my 30year history of raising money in politics , said mr susman , the unofficial national finance director for the bradley campaign we do n't have a wall street strategy per se , he said , but bill has had a relationship with many of these people over many years and we involved them early on to see what they could do among their friends and associates in the case of these top executives , their donations to mr bradley are not hedge contributions , in which a donor puts down money on several candidates none of the top bankers with the exception of mr susman , who also gave 1 , 000 to senator john mccain as a favor to a friend has so far contributed to any other presidential candidate , according to records of the federal election commission mr bradley s fundraising network extends well beyond wall street he has also used his contacts from 10 years as a player with the new york knicks of the national basketball association to recruit top sports stars as fundraising draws he used a year as a visiting lecturer at stanford in 199798 to nurture relationships with lawyers and venture capitalists in the technology corridor south of san francisco they have already raised more than 2 million for his campaign but it is the preponderance of new york banking and brokerage firms at the top of mr bradley s donor list that sets him apart from the other leading candidates for the presidency only two wall street firms are in mr gore s and mr mccain s top 10 lists of contributors only one makes gov george w bush s list of 10 biggest donors the only firm to make the top 10 list for all four candidates is goldman , sachs , whose partners and their families have contributed 22 , 455 to mr mccain , 60 , 250 to mr gore , 77 , 250 to mr bush and 210 , 000 to mr bradley mr bradley s success is even more notable because goldman s former chairman , robert e rubin , was chairman of the national economic council and treasury secretary in the clinton administration mr rubin is so far sitting out the 2000 presidential contest mr bradley s familiarity with top bankers , brokers and bond traders grew from his 18 years of service on the senate finance committee he was one of the primary authors of the landmark 1986 tax bill and the architect of a plan to address the third world debt crisis in the mid1980 s
when four plainclothes police officers arrived for work in the bronx at 9 30 pm 11 days ago , the mission of their latenight tour was clear and uncomplicated they were members of the street crime unit , assigned to patrol the 43d precinct in an unmarked car , keeping a wary eye out for crimes in progress , people with illegal guns and a rapist who had terrorized 44 women but less than three hours later , the officers' lives would be capsized , an unarmed west african immigrant would be dead at their feet and the often strained relationship between the police department and the city s many minority groups would have frayed even further in the space of perhaps no more than 10 seconds , investigators believe , the officers fired a fusillade of 41 shots at amadou diallo , a 22yearold street peddler , killing him and raising a series of questions about how an unarmed man with a spotless record came to be gunned down in the doorway of his apartment building in the soundview section today , many of those questions remain unanswered because the officers have yet to speak to investigators and detectives have yet to find anyone else who witnessed their initial encounter with mr diallo the largest of those questions and one that even police union officials have been incapable of answering is what could explain the explosive barrage of bullets unleashed against what many neighbors have described as a thoroughly mildmannered man but through a review of police documents and interviews with law enforcement officials , lawyers for the officers , and neighbors of mr diallo , the broad outlines of what occurred on wheeler avenue in the early morning hours of feb 4 can be discerned that night , less than two hours after driving their maroon ford taurus off randalls island , where their unit s headquarters are , the officers responded with several other patrol cars to a report of an officer needing assistance , just blocks from the shooting scene in that incident , an officer had been injured when he fell down the stairs of a building at 1261 boynton avenue while trying to arrest two youths on assault and drug possession charges by the time they arrived , however , their lawyer said , the suspects had been arrested , so officers kenneth boss , sean carroll , edward mcmellon and richard murphy resumed patrol although as white men , the officers did not blend in with the largely minority community they were in , they were dressed unobtrusively in gray and black sweatshirts , blue jeans and sneakers officer mcmellon also had on a baseball hat for some reason , which remains unclear , at 12 40 am the officers drove down wheeler avenue , a oneway street of twostory , redbrick homes where mr diallo lived a witness has told the bronx district attorney s office , which is leading the investigation , that while parking his car before the shooting he spotted mr diallo in the vestibule of mr diallo s building at 1157 wheeler avenue and saw him peering up and down the street , as if he might have been waiting for somebody that witness was not there when the shooting started , police officials said , so it remains unclear just what about mr diallo caught the officers' attention the officers' union lawyer , stephen worth , has said the officers believed that mr diallo fit the generic description of the rapist for whom they were looking the officers doubleparked and officers mcmellon and carroll started up the stairs to mr diallo s building , while officers murphy and boss trailed behind all had their badges out , mr worth said , and all identified themselves as police officers but mr worth said mr diallo appeared to have a problem understanding and responding to the officers' shouted commands mr diallo s friends have disputed the notion that he had a problem understanding english at some point in the encounter , according to mr worth s account , the officers believed that mr diallo was reaching for a gun and , believing their lives were in jeopardy , opened fire mr diallo was hit by 19 of the 41 bullets fired at him 11 of them struck his legs , and 1 hit his right arm the other 7 struck his torso his body fell back against the wall of the vestibule and slid to the floor , where it was found , propped up at the waist in a slouched sitting position , investigators said near his body investigators found a beeper and his wallet , police officials said , which are perhaps the items he was reaching for when the police fired in his pants pocket were his house keys it is not clear which of the officers shot first , although a person who has heard the officers' account of the events that night said there is no disagreement among them over which of them first began shooting investigators estimate that the closest officers , mr mcmellon and mr carroll , fired at mr diallo from the building s stoop , perhaps at a distance of 5 to 12 feet one spent shell casing was found inside the vestibule near mr diallo s body , but investigators believe it may have been kicked there in afterward the city medical examiner s office has declined to say whether any powder burns were found on mr diallo s body , which would indicate that he was shot at very close range
a summerlong community uproar over the reassignment of a port jefferson elementary school principal , esther fusco , was no closer to resolution after last week s school board meeting , when more than 150 residents who had gathered to hear the presentation of formal charges against her were told that no such information was forthcoming dr fusco said she was told in june that she was being reassigned and that she had been electioneering on school property against incumbent school board members in elections last may but no formal charges were filed against the principal , who has filed suit against her employers john gross , the district s attorney , said that formal charges would be presented against dr fusco at tuesday s meeting , but none were made public bruce miller , the board s vice president , said such charges were customarily presented in executive session , but , citing confidentiality provisions in personnel cases , neither he nor mr gross nor the board president , suzette smookler , would say whether charges had been filed in an affidavit responding to a complaint that residents made to richard p mills , the state commissioner of education , asking for the removal of the school board , the superintendent , edward reilly , said that in addition to electioneering dr fusco was guilty of misconduct including harassment of teachers , deceitful behavior , chronic tardiness and mishandling serious disciplinary issues involving students the socalled electioneering issue might have been a catalyst , said alan mckeeman , a resident , but what it had in common with the allegations that the principal mishandled sexual harassment and suicide issues was the fact that she exhibited a lack of judgment dr fusco has denied any wrongdoing fusco supporters filed a reply last week to the superintendent s affidavit that included statements from a former school board president and four teachers refuting dr reilly s assertions regarding sexual harassment and teacher abuse of students , which allegedly happened before dr reilly came to the district last year ramin p jaleshgari
a veteran police officer fatally shot a homeless man on the upper east side early yesterday when his service pistol went off during a struggle with the man , who was suspected of breaking into a car , the police said it was the fourth shooting by the new york city police in the last 10 days , and the third fatal one the shooting took place at 3 48 am on east 95th street between first and second avenues as two police officers were trying to arrest a man who had broken into a sport utility vehicle , said inspector michael collins , a police spokesman the man , larry cobb , 30 , put up a struggle and was shot in the chest by officer douglas grant , inspector collins said mr cobb then managed to get to second avenue , where he fell dead outside the last second saloon two senior police officials said that the shooting appeared to have been an accident they said a preliminary investigation indicated that officer grant s 9millimeter semiautomatic might have gone off as he struggled with mr cobb as news of the shooting spread through the neighborhood , several of mr cobb s relatives said that he had been addicted to crack for many years , that he had lived in the streets and that he had sometimes broken into cars to support his addiction but they questioned his death my brother was never a violent person , said kevin cobb , 29 if you look at his history , he did not do violent crimes there was no excuse for them to kill him mr cobb had 21 convictions dating back to 1989 , mostly for breaking into cars , attempted robbery and drug possession , the police said none of his convictions were for violent crimes , but a police official said he had resisted arrest in the past he was known for not going easy , the official said police officials said it was just an unfortunate coincidence that there have been so many shootings by police officers in the last 10 days , and noted that the number of shootings by police officers has declined in recent years , even as the force has grown and the number of arrests has risen the recent spate of police shootings began on aug 9 , when a gunwielding man suspected of trying to rob a bank was fatally shot by the police near wall street then , on sunday night , a man with a machete was shot to death during a drug sting in east harlem the next afternoon an unarmed man was shot and wounded during a confrontation with a police officer after another drug operation went awry in brooklyn the incident yesterday began , the police said , when officer grant , a 17year veteran of the force , and his partner , officer lisa moran , who has been on the force 5 years , noticed that the interior lights of an empty jeep parked on east 95th street were on the two officers , who were on a special assignment to investigate a rash of car breakins in the neighborhood , parked their patrol car and walked over to investigate the jeep s passenger window was shattered , the police said , and officer moran noticed mr cobb hiding under a nearby car the two officers approached the car and ordered him to come out mr cobb obeyed , the police said , but began struggling with officer grant , and it was during the struggle that the gun went off officer grant was using the hollowpoint ammunition that the police department recently adopted , the police said proponents of the new bullets like them because they are less likely to pass through a target and strike innocent bystanders opponents of the new ammunition worry that the bullets , which expand upon impact , are deadlier it was unclear how mr cobb managed to elude the officers after he was shot and make his way to second avenue , where he died stolen property from the jeep including a mobile phone was found in mr cobb s possession , as were a box cutter and a crack pipe , the police said he was also carrying a spark plug , which is the tool of choice among many car thieves , who use it to smash car windows mayor rudolph w giuliani said the shooting appeared to have been justified it appears to be appropriate , he said , but of course it has to be investigated more thoroughly outside mr cobb s childhood home , on second avenue near 97th street , three of his four brothers tried to make sense of his death they said that he began having behavior problems as a boy , and that he then descended into a life of drug addiction and crime but they expressed anger at the police for killing him i'm really dumbfounded by the whole thing , said allen cobb , 34 i'm so upset , i ca n't even express all the things that i feel photo police officials go over details of the fatal shooting of larry cobb , a homeless man suspected of breaking into a vehicle on east 95th street he was resisting arrest when an officer s gun went off , the police say \( william c lopez for the new york times \) \( pg b4 \)
ten days after warning that its thirdquarter results would be dismal , the xerox corporation made good on that promise yesterday , and then some the company , which is based in stamford , conn , said that its net income fell 11 percent , to 339 million , or 47 cents a diluted share , compared with 381 million , or 53 cents a share , in the quarter a year earlier until xerox s warning on oct 8 , analysts had expected thirdquarter earnings to be 58 cents a share revenue , meanwhile , was flat , rising to just 463 billion from 461 billion xerox offered no hope for a quick turnaround during a conference call with analysts that lasted more than 90 minutes , its chief executive , g richard thoman , and its chief financial officer , barry d romeril , said that fourthquarter results would be 20 percent less than those in the quarter a year earlier and that the first half of 2000 would be sluggish as well they confirmed a lot of worstcase scenarios , said benjamin a reitzes , an analyst at paine webber analysts , who had already lowered their fourthquarter estimates to 82 cents a share from 92 cents , lowered estimates to less than 70 cents a share yesterday the issues xerox was dealing with in the first quarter just are n't getting any better , said jack l kelly , an analyst with goldman , sachs company shareholders , who have been steadily dumping xerox stock in the last 10 days , rushed to sell even more the shares , which have fallen 44 percent since the warning , dropped 3625 yesterday , to 238125 i just lost twothirds of my net worth , and none of us are feeling fat , dumb and happy right now , mr thoman said investors seem skittish about the entire documentprocessing industry lexmark international , a maker of printers , announced thirdquarter profit that beat forecasts yesterday , but its shares fell 28 , or 30 percent , to 65 , when it warned that its fourthquarter results might be disappointing for the third quarter , lexmark s net income rose 32 percent , to 765 million , or 56 cents a diluted share analysts had expected profit of 54 cents a share , according to first call thomson financial , which tracks company earnings electronics for imaging , which makes products used in color printers , lost 91875 a share , or 20 percent , to 363125 , even though it has met all profit expectations hewlettpackard fell , too , by 450 , to 7825 copier and printer markets are healthy , so xerox may have pulled these stocks down , said b alexander henderson , an analyst with prudential securities research xerox may be in worse shape than its earnings indicate the company accrued money in the first two quarters to pay out as profitsharing now , with profits looking low , it returned that money to the income stream , benefiting the quarter s profits by 7 cents a share xerox picked up an additional 3 cents a share from stock and asset sales back those out and you get 37 cents , way below the guidance of 10 days ago , mr henderson said xerox executives attributed some of the profit troubles to a range of causes , including weak sales in brazil , currency exchange rates , customer fears of year 2000 problems and a general resistance among clients to trade up on equipment but they acknowledged that internal upheavals accounted for far more of the problems xerox recently consolidated 36 administrative centers into 3 , but did not provide adequate staff the result was severe problems with billing and accounts receivable our sales people have had to spend 40 percent of their time dealing with administrative matters instead of selling , mr thoman said at the same time , the xerox sales force is grappling with a reorganization that makes its sales representatives responsible for specific industries and companies , not geographic territories and they must switch from a decadesold emphasis on selling standalone copiers to one selling digital machines that can be connected to computer networks most analysts expect that the new structure will eventually enable xerox to offer multinational customers a wider breadth of products and services but for now , the sales turmoil has badly slowed xerox s efforts to get customers for the expensive superfast digital copiers that are its highestmargin products canon and ricoh , meanwhile , are making inroads into xerox s market for mediumspeed copiers about 25 percent of our revenues are coming from customers that are new to us , said dennis amorosano , assistant director for networked office systems at canon usa , and i think that growth is coming out of xerox s customer base
the general electric company plc of britain , accelerating the european rush into the data networking business , said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire fore systems inc for 45 billion in cash fore , which is based in warrendale , pa , is a leading developer of an advanced technology that many big communications carriers and multinational corporations are beginning to use to carry voice , data and sometimes video traffic on a single network general electric plc , which is not affiliated with the general electric company in fairfield , conn , is one of britain s largest diversified manufacturers now , though , it is shedding its other businesses to focus increasingly on what is often called the communications revolution the explosive proliferation of electronic communications propelled by deregulation and the internet in its biggest realignment , general electric announced in january that it had agreed to sell its military systems unit to british aerospace plc for 95 billion in stock the problem for general electric , like oldline makers of communications equipment around the world , is that the big phone companies that generate the bulk of its communications sales are trying to upgrade their systems to carry internet and corporate data traffic as easily as they carry traditional phone calls the oldline communications manufacturers have had to scramble , generally though acquisitions , to keep up with their customers the biggest such deal was the january agreement by lucent technologies inc , the former equipment arm of the att corporation , to acquire ascend communications inc , a big data networking company , for 20 billion last year , northern telecom of canada , north america s no 2 maker of traditional communications gear after lucent , agreed to acquire bay networks for 91 billion in stock more recently it has been the european telephone equipment giants that have been making big moves into data communications last month , in fact , general electric plc spent 21 billion to acquire the reltec corporation , which makes equipment that uses digital technology to expand the capacity of traditional phone networks that came as siemens of germany was agreeing to acquire a handful of private data networking companies and as alcatel of france agreed to acquire the xylan corporation , a maker of data switches , for 17 billion but none of those companies had as high a profile in the data networking business as fore s this acquisition reinforces our position as a leading supplier of voice and data networking technology , lord george simpson , chief executive of general electric , said in a statement we will now be in a position to capture the full benefits of the impact of the explosive growth of internet and other data traffic on the demand for communications equipment and systems fore was one of the first companies to exploit an advanced communications technology called asynchronous transfer mode , or atm , which is similar to the language of the internet in that it breaks communications into small pieces under the terms of the deal , general electric will pay 35 in cash for each fore share that is a 43 percent premium over fore s closing price on friday , 2450 in parts of 1996 , fore shares consistently traded above 40 but for much of the last two years have traded below 20 as the company has contended with increased competition from companies like ascend and newbridge networks of canada one potential problem for general electric is that much of fore s business comes from selling to institutional clients like the united states government , and that business is growing relatively slowly general electric , though , is focused on selling to communications carriers some analysts said yesterday that the relative undesirability of fore s institutional sales unit could be seen in the stock movements yesterday of a third company , tellabs inc , which makes telephone equipment many investors were concerned that tellabs might agree to acquire fore , and shortly after trading in fore shares was halted at 9 47 am pending undisclosed news , tellabs shares dropped as low as 111875 , far below the friday close of 115375 but around 10 24 the first word of the general electric deal appeared on news services , and by 11 o'clock tellabs shares had hit 12025 , an increase of about 75 percent in less than an hour tellabs shares closed at 1175625 , up 21875 fore shares rose 925 , to 3375 american depository receipts of general electric closed at 10125 each , up 75 cents
riverhead , ny , april 7 during the nearly two decades he has spent in state psychiatric hospitals , albert fentress has been a model patient , his lawyer says he teaches desktop publishing to other patients and helps run a small business he has made hundreds of supervised trips to museums , ball games and picnics his doctors even let him roam the hospital grounds unescorted but there is another albert fentress or at least there once was state prosecutors remember the man who , as a high school teacher in poughkeepsie , tortured , killed and cannibalized an 18yearold youth who wandered into his backyard and they are now trying to persuade a state supreme court jury of six men and women here to keep mr fentress confined to a psychiatric hospital in suffolk county mr fentress , 57 , who was found not guilty by reason of insanity in 1980 for the killing of paul masters , is contesting the latest in a series of decisions by state judges to extend his confinement at pilgrim state psychiatric center in brentwood if he wins , he could be transferred to a halfway house with little supervision under new york criminal law , patients are allowed to ask for a rehearing before another judge or for a jury trial only a handful have ever chosen to be tried by a jury , state officials say , and none were on long island the proceeding , which began on tuesday , has placed participants on each side in unusual positions the state s lawyers two from the attorney general s office , representing the office of mental health , and a prosecutor from the dutchess county district attorney s office are arguing that the state s treatment has completely failed mr fentress they must prove that mr fentress remains mentally ill and that , if released , he would be a danger to the community mr fentress s lawyer , kim l darrow , of the state s mental hygiene legal service , is expected to call members of mr fentress s treatment team at the hospital , including at least two doctors and others who have worked with him , so they will be crossexamined by lawyers for their employer , the state office of mental health in mr darrow s view , his client has been a real success story at pilgrim his desktop publishing students now sell their work to community groups his therapists think enough of him to let him walk freely about the grounds , which are not bounded by walls or barbed wire and until his father died last year , mr fentress made daylong visits to him at his home in melville in suffolk county as often as once a week , driven there in a van by a hospital aide , as he is now for his appearances in court but in testimony today , a psychiatrist hired by the mental health agency , frederic l gannon , said mr fentress remained as ill as he was when he killed mr masters for 18 years there s been no change , said dr gannon , of brooklyn , who interviewed mr fentress in december he has n't made any movement yet dr gannon warned that mr fentress who scowled , his lips pursed , throughout the doctor s testimony showed the symptoms of a classic case for suicide that creates an even greater danger to others , he said based on his rigidity about himself , his obsessivecompulsiveness , his high standards for himself , the scenario of suicide would be for him to repeat the act of his crime , killing someone else to justify his suicide , dr gannon said the facts of mr fentress s crime are not in dispute he has admitted them , and jurors have been told them repeatedly in august 1979 , his imagination swirling with images from the film deliverance , mr fentress wrote a script for a torture and killing , then burned it , horrified by what he had envisioned but two days later , only hours after playing tennis with a friend , he acted it out after mr masters , a neighborhood teenager , happened into his yard , he lured him into his basement , tied him to a post at gunpoint , sexually abused and mutilated him , shot him twice in the head , and cooked and ate parts of his body the highly publicized crime repulsed people throughout the hudson valley , and its aftershocks were felt on long island years later , after mr fentress was transferred to a state hospital in kings park in suffolk county in 1985 he had been confined to a more secure hospital , the midhudson psychiatric center in orange county and , according to mr darrow , he was transferred after doctors decided that he was not dangerous after an unsubstantiated report that he was seen wandering the streets nearby , neighbors formed a human chain around the kings park hospital in protest mr fentress was moved to pilgrim state when the kings park hospital closed in 1996 much of the history in this case is reflected in at least one of the participants the lawyer representing dutchess county , the assistant district attorney , wayne r witherwax , is a former eighthgrade student of mr fentress s and the son of the detective who was the lead investigator in the masters killing he was a college sophomore home on summer break when his father was summoned to the crime scene mr witherwax is arguing that mr fentress s behavior in the cocoonlike environment at pilgrim state is no reliable indicator of how he would do outside in opening arguments on tuesday before justice harry e seidell , he noted that mr fentress had traced his crime to a series of childish pranks by neighborhood youths who had thrown eggs at his house and written slurs in his lawn with weed killing chemicals what about the stresses of the real world that are out there , that he 'll have to face if he s released \? mr witherwax asked photo albert fentress , 57 , leaving court yesterday in riverhead , ny , where a state supreme court jury is considering his request that they overturn the state s latest decision to keep him confined for a 1979 killing \( vic delucia the new york times \)
for several months , administrators , teachers , students and alumni of polytechnic university in brooklyn have been debating a pleasant problem how to spend 175 million there are proposals for 25 new professorships and plans for a new dormitory , or a new academic building , or both the graduate program may be radically changed nothing is final , and there is plenty of disagreement , but for a university that once faced bankruptcy , the possibilities are stunning maybe too stunning echoing a concern shared by many at polytechnic over how best to spend the millions , the provost , ivan t frisch , said simply now comes really the hardest part where does the money go \? it is a question reverberating across the borough like a heavy snow in an unexpected place , money fell on brooklyn last month , a whole lot of it five institutions , none accustomed to lavish donations , will receive almost half of the 750 million estate of a brooklyn heights couple whose quiet lives gave no hint of their enormous wealth donald othmer , a polytechnic professor who died in 1995 , and his wife , mildred , who died last april , began investing in the 1960 s with a hometown friend from omaha named warren e buffett mr buffett is now one of the world s richest people the othmers did nicely , too without children and with few relatives , the othmers bequeathed most of their fortune to the institutions that shaped their lives , in brooklyn and beyond their alma mater , the university of nebraska at lincoln , will receive 133 million planned parenthood in manhattan , where mrs othmer sat on the board , will get 65 million the chemical heritage foundation in philadelphia will receive more than 100 million to build a library in mr othmer s field , chemical engineering but no place will feel the money as much as brooklyn the bulk of the donations arrived in january at the five beneficiaries , all important institutional pillars of the borough and all financially needy consider that the five polytechnic , long island college hospital , the brooklyn historical society , the plymouth church of the pilgrims and the brooklyn botanic garden will receive more than 340 million by comparison , if brooklyn s application to become an empowerment zone is approved , the federal benefits will total 330 million officials at the institutions realize that such a large donation will probably never come again , so the challenge is to turn the money into what polytechnic officials call a transforming gift officials of plymouth church of the pilgrims simply consider it a gift from god once the church where henry ward beecher preached against slavery , plymouth church is now one of a dwindling number of congregational churches in new york the othmers sat in the same pew every sunday , and mrs othmer left the church 104 million we 've got a lot of responsibility , said frank decker , the church s lay leader mildred othmer became , in a sense , an instrument of god by giving us the opportunity to be a vigorous and vibrant church into the next millennium with the exception of the brooklyn botanic garden , all of the recipients knew they were included in mrs othmer s will some , like polytechnic and long island college hospital , had already received large sums of money when mr othmer died four years ago judith zuk , president of the garden , said mrs othmer had volunteered at plant sales , but had done nothing more ms zuk confessed she had never heard of mrs othmer until she learned about the 99 million she left the garden we 're absolutely elated , ms zuk said the money will be placed in the botanic garden s 20 million endowment , generating additional interest income that should increase the annual operating budget by 400 , 000 among the ideas for the money are schoolbased gardening programs and training for publicschool teachers if the other four institutions knew that money was on the way , they were still pleasantly surprised by its size wall street s bull market had increased the othmers' fortune in the years before mrs othmer died a large chunk of the 7 , 500 shares of her berkshire hathaway stock was sold for more than 70 , 000 a share meanwhile , long island college hospital , the brooklyn historical society and polytechnic all needed money several years ago , the othmers had donated 1 million toward construction of the othmer cancer center at long island college hospital , where mr othmer had been on the board but john wren , the hospital s new board chairman , said long island college had suffered a string of budget deficits , including losses in 1997 that reached 20 million he blamed managed care and frozen reimbursement plans , and he called the othmer bequest extraordinary timing for us taking bequests from both of the othmer wills , the hospital will receive about 130 million its interim president , peter kelly , said interest income from the othmer money will pay for technological upgrades money is also intended for the nursing program and to modernize the operating rooms
littleton , colo , april 21 the good life is gobbling up the old life in every direction around here where not too long ago there was prairie and smalltown america in the shadow of the foothills , now there are new and expensive houses , lush golf courses , shopping malls , multiplex movie theaters and modern walled communities with bygone names like country farms and grant ranch but today , 24 hours after two teenage boys turned nearby columbine high school into a killing field , many people here are mourning not just the sons and daughters who were cut down but also the area s oldfashioned sense of safety and maybe even its oldfashioned faith in the future this used to be one of the quietest places in the state , said kay chambers , the box officer manager of the town hall arts center now , it just feels like the world is out of control , that it is a much more violent and dangerous place when i look at what s going on in kosovo and africa and now here , it breaks my heart still , people here say they leave their doors unlocked and most said they had no plans to lock them yet there are dozens of homeowner associations , ball fields , tennis courts , a new nature path and three or four forests worth of new houses going up downtown denver is about 10 miles away and it seems as though every one of those miles is filled with strip malls , fastfood restaurants and commuters there s been so much growth , we ca n't even get across the street anymore , said marion nygren , who has lived here for 40 years and every summer , this middle to uppermiddleclass city of 40 , 000 residents holds its western welcome week with handcart races , a firemen s tugofwar and square dancing in the streets it was a great place to grow up , said jared smith , 18 , after he left flowers outside the high school to remember the dead and wounded this is the last community you 'd think something like this would happen littleton was founded in 1890 , and its early residents were mostly farmers and gold prospectors the first industry in town was the rough and ready grain mill on the south platte river , where baptisms were sometimes performed after world war ii , ranching and farming gave way to electronics and the aerospace industry , still a factor today , and littleton s population began to skyrocket , making longtime residents like marty garcia a little worried that perhaps littleton was moving too fast it s still nice , but it used to be a whole lot nicer , said mr garcia , the owner of a barbershop in the older downtown section of littleton today , people are moving so fast that they just do n't seem to take the time to pass the time of day with their neighbors maybe if we did , maybe if we looked out more for each other , we could prevent some of these tragedies columbine high s mailing address is in littleton , but the school is actually in unincorporated jefferson county the school accepts students from around the area , and almost everyone refers to its location as littleton today here and in denver almost everyone was in mourning as school sessions were canceled , sporting events rescheduled and flags lowered to halfstaff we will get through this , said rich couris , who has lived in littleton for just a few years after his employer transferred him here from southern california his daughter , kristin , is on the columbine lacrosse team it s a real hodgepodge of incomes , talents , education , mr couris said of littleton it s a great mix and we love it there is little racial diversity the area is overwhelmingly white and heavily republican , said bill babcock , the director of the town hall center , who grew up in denver and has lived here since last july it s a very conservative area , mr babcock said i used to think that i was the only democrat in town tony amaro , who is hispanic , moved to the area from california in 1992 after being transferred by the union pacific railroad although mr amaro said there had been a few times when he felt hostile stares from white residents , by and large , he said he and his family had not encountered racism here that is why he was a little surprised at some reports still not confirmed that the teenage gunmen wanted to shoot the few black and hispanic students who attend columbine high this whole thing is mindboggling , mr amaro said i ca n't believe that somebody did n't see this coming , that somebody did n't see that these kids were so troubled mr amaro came back to the school today with his daughter , crystal , 17 , who attends columbine and saw a friend get shot she was helping a girl who was shot , he said when she got home , she found blood on her boots , her pants we just tossed everything in the garbage we 're going to take her to counseling in a few minutes she just wanted to come by for another look none of us can believe this happened the police were still collecting evidence at columbine today but once the school reopens , andrea grimm , 17 , a senior , said she would be one of the first in line to go back to class miss grimm was also there when the killing spree began and watched in horror as one victim staggered and then fell bleeding on the floor i'm going back to graduate , she said that s my main goal
twentyone muslim cadets from the middle east , who said they were harassed and even beaten by their classmates at the state university of new york maritime college , moved from the college to a hotel in new jersey on friday night the students had refused to attend class since tuesday peter g vecchio , a maritime professor and freshman adviser , said the departure was an emotional scene some of the cadets wanted to go , he said , while others seemed less sure one presented him with a photograph of the group a lot of the cadets were not looking forward to going off , leaving the friends they had made behind , he said the departure of the muslim freshmen , and the dispiriting circumstances surrounding it , sent ripples of introspection through the barracks under the throgs neck bridge in the bronx cadets at maritime train for careers in the shipping industry in a fouryear program that resembles that of the united states naval academy set against a tidal passage and within a precivil war shore battery , the college is rooted in nautical tradition , with cadets sporting crew cuts and khaki uniforms the most common public statement often seems to be sir , yes , sir but the structured routine was disrupted on tuesday when the muslim freshmen announced they were quitting the college , saying they had been abused by classmates after being repeatedly subjected to insulting remarks about their religion and limited english skills one cadet , abdullah alshammari , 24 , of saudi arabia , said he was attacked by a classmate who wore a ski mask the day before the students stopped attending class the attack was the second reported in two weeks in the first reported attack , on sept 13 , two muslim cadets said five assailants beat them in their darkened bedroom none of the cadets were injured seriously , and the college has vowed to expel any cadets involved a campus police investigation is continuing , and the office of the chancellor of the state university , john w ryan , is reviewing the case adm david c brown , the college president , said the reviews to date had found no indication the incidents were intended as hazing , which the college prohibits but the middle eastern students said they believed that their ethnicity made them targets and with the assailants at large and the muslims now living in a hotel in new jersey , the american cadets are contemplating the line between cultural insensitivity and the unpleasant treatment every new cadet gets many of the americans were baffled , and wondered aloud if the students had been adequately prepared for the school others said they were sad to see them quit midshipman ryan kenna , 18 , a freshman , said he had befriended some of the middle eastern cadets and would miss them , personally and professionally the middle east is such a big shipping point , it would only benefit us to learn from them now , instead of us going out into the industry and having such a big culture shock , he said the disappointment is palpable when the middle eastern cadets arrived in the bronx last winter , they were enthusiastic they hailed from four arabian nations , and appeared to be in an excellent circumstance all their expenses were underwritten by the united arab shipping company , a kuwaitbased concern that was grooming them for management positions in the national shipping line of the arabian gulf moreover , since 1995 the college has trained two dozen saudi naval cadets the saudis familiarized the college with muslim holidays and daily cycles of prayer , and maintained a mosque in the barracks watching the saudis graduate , the new cadets anticipated a smooth stay in america when we first arrived , we loved it so much , said homood altawari , 23 , of kuwait everybody was friendly everybody was so polite but after spending seven months polishing their english , the muslims soured to their college in august when they began indoctrination in the regiment of 680 cadets first they struggled as lowly midshipmen under guidance , or mugs many lagged in their studies , having trouble mastering mathematics and engineering in a second language while meeting cadet duties they said their frustrations mushroomed after the attacks , prompting them to quit and their peers to wonder what went wrong midshipman david giancarli , 24 , a senior , said he was disturbed by the allegations of violence but he said he had seen no instances of unfair treatment based on ethnicity or religion when you are an underclassman , you get picked on , he said i was picked on because i was fat , and i took it for a whole year freshman year at maritime college is certainly not for everyone mugs live in dormitorystyle barracks that are a study in spartan simplicity they must jog to and from class , and have few privileges they are not allowed to outfit their rooms with posters , radios , televisions or fans visitors leave , and lights go out , at 11 pm further , the quadrangles bustle with upperclassmen who enforce myriad rules older cadets can require mugs to light their cigarettes on demand to be ready , mugs carry books of matches in plastic bags the muslim cadets acknowledge that the mug regimen influenced their decision to resign we are not like students here , said one of the cadets who said he was assaulted , faisal ahmad , 24 , of kuwait we are like hostages but mr ahmad and his peers also described pockets of insensitivity a few cadets mocked their arabic names , they said , or chuckled when they headed to the mosque for prayer other slights were heard about secondhand for instance , they said their american peers told them that a member of the staff warned female cadets not to date middle eastern men , because they might make unwanted advances they also said the college did not adequately investigate the theft of their property capt robert j weaver , commandant of cadets , said he had received no official reports of discrimination but he did not directly dispute the cadets' accounts i could never say that did n't happen , because with more than 600 people , you could have one person do something stupid , he said after the resignations , the college allowed the muslim students to remain in the barracks and to confer among themselves and their shipping company managers in kuwait before their decision to move out and though the college said the majority of muslim students appeared to be following a few of their most dissatisfied peers , the cadets maintained a united stance before their departure , they made their sentiments clear we are like one hand , we are like brothers , said wajdi alhawar , 20 , of saudi arabia if we are going to leave , we will leave together photo middle eastern muslim cadets who

the psychiatrist , dr eran metzger , smiled a year ago , the woman was so depressed that she had not only lost interest in talking to anyone , she had stopped eating but not long after he started her on remeron , an antidepressant , her mood began to improve the ringing telephone , he said , was as good an indication as any that she was again engaged in life the woman , a former business executive , had suffered a series of griefs that might seem to define old age the deaths of her husband and her five sisters the loss of her vision and her ability to walk finally and crushingly , the death of her only child , a son to tell you the truth , i did n't want to live , she recalled few people would argue that the woman , 92 or not , should not be treated for what doctors call major depression , a condition in which the brain chemistry is altered in fact , she was one of the lucky older americans who suffer from depression her home for the aged had a geriatric specialist on staff , dr metzger , who could recognize her symptoms and not confuse them with old age itself most nursing homes and residences for the aged do not just as medicine is more able than ever to treat depression , experts worry that the nation s health care system is not prepared to deal with a surge in cases as baby boomers approach old age eventually doubling the population 65 and older and encounter the chronic diseases and losses that can make a person vulnerable to depression but the growing treatment of depression among the old also raises questions about the quality of the last stage of life and its emotional complexities the mingling of grief at the loss of a spouse , for example , with the anticipation of seeing a grandchild that younger people , who mostly fear old age and disability , find difficult to understand while doctors say there is no question that depression can be safely treated , they also debate where sadness ends and depression begins , what realistic expectations for the final years are poets and philosophers have always spoken of the despair the tragic sense of life , the spanish philosopher miguel de unamuno called it that the very old experience as they confront the dwindling of their days some experts on aging worry that modern medicine may end up trivializing that despair , trying to medicate away the deep sadness that comes with losses some despair is inevitable as you recognize that time is short , that you do n't have the opportunity to work out a different life , said rose dobrof , 74 , the brookdale center on aging s professor of gerontology at hunter college what too often happens is that because the family doctor does n't have time to talk , he prescribes medication , professor dobrof said it s the easiest thing to do what people need are human connections people , she said , need to talk , to doctors , clergy and social workers , and to family and friends at the same time , professor dobrof said , medication particularly newer antidepressants like zoloft , paxil and prozac that have fewer side effects is often needed to ease depression in many cases medication undoubtedly played a major role in the recovery of the 92yearold woman \( many old people talk freely , even eagerly , about their ailments , but depression is not considered a subject for open discussion the woman , like other patients interviewed for this article , did not want to be named \) she had attended weekly group therapy sessions , dr metzger said , but until she began taking antidepressants she could only sit and cry now she joins in but dr metzger said her recovery was also helped by a psychiatric nurse , phyllis cronin , who recognized the woman s isolation and made an effort to form a close relationship with her the goal of treatment , dr metzger said , was not to erase her sadness , nor to transform her into a cheerful old woman we 're not trying to make everyone conform to our stereotypes of aging , he said most of the cases he treats , he said , are people with major depression , a condition that can inhibit recovery from disease and strokes and increase pain though the woman no longer talks of wanting to die , dr metzger said , she still cries over her son , and she still gets angry about living in an institution he is mindful of how she put it the other day the doctor and the medicine help you , but the pain in your heart will live forever for most of this century , to the extent that doctors thought about depression and the elderly at all , it was to say , who would n't be depressed \? but geriatric psychiatrists and other experts see no reason that the old and infirm should not find some fulfillment in life in her book , another country navigating the emotional terrain of our elders \( riverhead books , 1999 \) , mary pipher explored the psychological growth that many old people experience as they decline there is an amazing calculus , she wrote anyone who is n't an idiot becomes a philosopher it is important , experts say , that younger people not impose their fears and stereotypes about old age on the old

the charter school of wilmington sits atop the old district highschool building like rome on its ruins the old school was phased out in the mid90 s in favor of four themed minischools , the educational innovation of the moment that moment turned out to be very brief two of the minischools the banking and finance school and an academy based on the progressive theories of ted sizer did not even attract enough students to open the charter school of wilmington absorbed the math and science minischool and opened on the third floor of the building in 1996 the new school has been an instant success its population has already grown to 552 from 253 , and next year it will begin creeping down into the space vacated by the former high school what is true in wilmington is true generally the charter school movement is sweeping everything before it there were , at last count , 1 , 208 charter schools across the country , with 200 more scheduled for september even the most intransigent state legislatures are falling in december , after several years of stout resistance from teachers' and administrators' unions , new york became the 35th and most recent state to pass a law governing the creation of charter schools responding to all this enthusiasm , president clinton has called for 3 , 000 new charter schools by the year 2000 critics are getting hard to find , while from advocates one increasingly hears breathless tales of dead schools transformed , of innercity children engaged , of hidebound school systems rising to the marketplace challenge with a burst of reform of course , one hears a lot of euphoria these days in the world of school reform about multiple intelligence schools and core knowledge schools and parochial schools and a dozen other species of schools indeed , a recent study from the university of california at los angeles , which questions virtually all the claims made by charter advocates , concludes that policy makers who hope for a broad impact should reconsider some of the underlying assumptions that led them to favor charter school reform in the first place the archeological metaphor is , after all , doublesided is there , in fact , something so fundamental about this particular innovation that we should expect charter schools to become a fixed part of the school terrain , or will they subside into the rubble of yesterday s indispensable ideas \? under laws now being passed , organizations or individuals often parents and teachers can petition an officially designated body for a charter to operate a school that is free from some or all of the union and civilservice rules and budgetary restrictions that govern ordinary public schools the charter functions as a contract in which the prospective school spells out how it plans to operate as well as what it vows to accomplish the sponsoring agency monitors the school , and chooses whether to renew the charter at the end of a specified period , typically five years the premise of the charter school movement is that the difference between good and bad schools lies not in any particular classroom practice , but in the way the school itself is administered or , alternatively , that without the selfgovernance made possible by a charter , the desired classroom reform , whatever it is , will never be fully realized if you give children access to a missiondriven atmosphere , a school that has high expectations and a structure free from bureaucracy , it s going to yield better results than had that child been in a traditional school , says jean allen , the head of the center for educational reform in washington and a strong charter advocate that theory was first articulated by john e chubb and terry m moe in their highly controversial 1990 book , politics , markets and america s schools the two scholars argued that public schools were bound to fail because they had to answer to school boards , teachers' unions , state governments and other entities whose interests often collided with those of children private schools were free to make decisions according to what worked , and so achieved more with the same students using data gleaned from a study of 60 , 000 highschool students , they concluded that the difference between effective and ineffective school organization could amount to more than one full year of academic achievement over the four years of high school if americans want effective schools , the authors wrote , it appears they must first create new institutions that , in their effects on the choices of individuals , naturally function to promote rather than inhibit the right kinds of organizations even educators who do n't share mr chubb and mr moe s faith in the marketplace might agree with their critique of the bureaucracy indeed , the fuel of the charter school movement lies in the overwhelming sense of frustration and helplessness many educators say they feel in the face of the system moreover , charter schools have had an unusually nonpartisan appeal because they prescribe nothing both progressives and traditionalists can create schools of their own , leaving agnostics free to believe in the wisdom of letting a hundred flowers bloom ideologically , the charter proposal occupies a position midway between choice the idea that children can attend any school in their district and vouchers , which allow children to attend private or parochial schools with public money liberals like choice freemarket conservatives like vouchers and , as it turns out , both have found they can live with charters
trenton , oct 20 twentysix middle school students were apparently stricken with food poisoning today at a new charter school here after the cafeteria served tainted fruit cups , according to state education officials eighteen students were taken to two hospitals , but all were treated and released last night , hospital officials said students from the sixth and seventh grades at the granville charter school began reporting nausea and stomach pains shortly before noon , about 20 minutes after the end of the first lunch period , officials said as the number of stricken students grew , school officials inspected the food being served in the cafeteria and found that some of the fruit cup desserts , which were prepared by a private food service company and delivered to the school in wrapped paper containers , appeared to have gone bad you could see that the cellophane wrapping had swollen on some of them and you could smell that the fruit had started to turn rotten , said william granville jr , who runs the school we took it off the menu for the next two lunch periods and no one got sick classes were disrupted as ambulances packed the parking lot and ill students lay waiting for medical attention in classrooms , the nursing office and hallways but none of the students appeared seriously ill , school officials said the granville school is one of 47 privately run charter schools in new jersey , part of a nationwide movement to use public funds to finance smaller , independently operated schools , particularly in innercity neighborhoods the granville school , which is affiliated with the edison project network of forprofit schools , opened an elementary school for 500 students in 1998 and a middle school for 400 students this fall a spokesman for the state department of education said there was no history of complaints about the food service or the educational program at the granville school mr granville , a businessman who left his job as an oil executive to run the school , said it used the same food vendor as the trenton board of education did to feed students in other schools they 've been a quality program with no issues like this in the past , said peter peretzman , a spokesman for the department of education this school has a very good record photo a paramedic and betzy newsome , a parent volunteer , comforted a sixth grader who was not feeling well but was afraid to go into an ambulance \( laura pedrick for the new york times \)
location , as they say , is the key to success but as some downtown merchants are now learning , location means nothing if foot traffic is suddenly cut off such is the case around city hall park , which has been closed for a yearlong renovation , creating a wedge between shops to the east and the office workers in the buildings to the west having the park closed is killing us , said joe stanford , who works behind the counter at smoker s choice , just east of the park at 1 beekman street business has never been this bad we 've had more people in here when it snowed indeed , on wednesday at 1 15 pm , the peak of lunch hour , the shop was empty this place should be jumping , mr stanford said there s a 17 million lotto tonight normally , they 'd be lining up out the door right now his shop carries 120 brands of cigars , mr stanford said all those lawyers that work over on broadway used to cross the park for a cigar , he added not any more people do n't have any time in new york they 're not going to spend 10 minutes going out of their way to get somewhere and 10 minutes back that refrain was heard over and over among the businesses east of the park , which has been closed since november with barricades also blocking city hall s parking lot , formerly a popular pedestrian transverse , people west of the park are staying on their side , rather than walking around the nineacre , triangular park my customers are complaining it takes too long to get here , said mohamed elghamry , an owner of a sandwich shop at 5 beekman street all those people who work on broadway used to come over for lunch now , business is off by a third about five businesses on nassau street have closed , said al mizrachi , who owns shoe city , at no 133 he organized some of the local merchants to seek relief , although none is in sight he wrote to city councilwoman kathryn r freed asking for help \( she sent a letter to the parks commissioner , henry j stern \) and met with staff members in the mayor s office just a passageway through the park , that s all we want , mr mizrachi said even if they just opened it up at lunchtime but a spokesman for mayor giuliani , curt ritter , said he did not think a pathway would be possible it s a safety issue , he said this is a construction site it may be an inconvenience now , but when the park is revitalized and restored to its 1880 s grandeur , it will be a big draw and bring more tourists downtown and that will help merchants a lot such promises were small comfort to mr mizrachi we wo n't last that long , he said we 're getting mopped here this is a massacre david kirby photo the se sheik boutique at 97 nassau street is one of the businesses on the street that have closed recently \( carol halebian for the new york times \)
boston , oct 16 in the midafternoon sunshine , amid the festive fans outside fenway park , a tall man wearing a red , white and blue uncle sam costume carried a sign that said , this yankee loves the red sox a younger man in a gray boston jersey walked up to him , hugged him and said , it s a good day to be an american and a dominican the second reference applied to pedro martinez , the red sox' star pitcher from the dominican republic martinez pitched brilliantly in a 131 victory over the yankees to cut new york s lead to two games to one in the fourofsevengame american league championship series aside from the pitching of martinez , it was a good day to be a boston red sox batter from new jersey , like john valentin , who had a home run and two other hits and five runs batted in or from california , like nomar garciaparra , who went 4 for 5 with a home run and three rbi or from illinois , like brian daubach , who had a home run and a double or from the dominican republic , like jose offerman , who went 3 for 6 , or from north carolina , like trot nixon , who went 3 for 4 the red sox had 21 hits , a record for the alcs , breaking the mark of 19 set by the yankees in 1981 the boston batters hit 3 home runs , 1 triple , 6 doubles and 11 singles the boys are back in town , and they love to hit here it s just nice to be home , garciaparra said it s nice to feel the positive energy on your side they started hitting early against yankees starter roger clemens , who fell behind by 20 in a new york minute after a triple by offerman and a home run by valentin , the first two batters he faced valentin said he was just trying to hit a sacrifice fly in the first inning when he put a 22 fastball over the wall it gives us a little confidence that we can win , valentin said we knew we had to win today going down 03 to the new york yankees , it s almost impossible to come back it s like going down 02 to cleveland of course , when they went down 02 to cleveland , the red sox won the next three to upset the favored indians that was impossible , valentin said , trying hard to stifle a smile but it happened after losing the first two games to the indians in jacobs field , the red sox returned to fenway to score 32 runs in two games beneath the shadow of the green monster they went back to cleveland to clinch that series after scoring five runs in the first two games at yankee stadium , the red sox exceeded that total before the end of the third inning and doubled it before the end of the seventh valentin also sparked last week s comeback against cleveland in game 3 , he had a home run and a tworun double in game 4 , he had two home runs and seven rbi born in mineola , ny , valentin is a graduate of st anthony high school in jersey city and attended seton hall in eight postseason games , he leads his team with 17 rbi he and garciaparra are tied for the home run lead with four valentin is 32 years old , he spent time on the disabled list , he needs offseason knee surgery and his throws from third base to first are not always the best like his team as a whole , he was somewhat overlooked as the playoffs began everyone knows about him now he has some very impressive numbers , red sox manager jimy williams said williams was asked about the homefield advantage , particularly for his team though every ball park is unique , none are more different than this quirky fun house in kenmore square it sometimes intimidates pitchers scores in double figures are not uncommon i think in baseball there is less of a homefield advantage over all than other sports , williams said i do n't know if there is a homefield advantage stronger here than anywhere else i have been if the fans feel it creates enthusiasm and electricity , and they really get involved , then maybe it can , maybe it does martinez , who does n't swing the bat because the american league uses the designated hitter , thanked the red sox who do a whole bunch of grinders out there picking me up , he said i kept praying the guys would score a bunch of runs we are home we are more confident we know our field photo john valentin of the red sox , who had three hits and five rbi , slugged a tworun home run off the yankees' roger clemens in the first inning yesterday \( barton silverman the new york times \)
all that stands between paula kennedy and the man she loves is a 12 million tax lien from the internal revenue service she inherited 150 , 000 and one undeveloped lot on lake winnipesaukee , nh , from her mother , who died 13 years ago , but the irs says she and her brothers owe millions in gift and estate taxes until the case is settled , she fears that if she marries joseph s kennedy , his assets will be drawn into the case to keep up appearances , because they live together in scotch plains , nj , she has legally changed her name ms kennedy , 43 , has good reason to be afraid even though she and her brothers , bill and tom boyer , 54 and 50 , have cooperated with the irs , the agency has turned their lives into a nightmare , going after them with a powerful tool congress created for dealing with major tax criminals without notice , the agency seized their bank accounts , their paychecks and ms kennedy s 7 , 500 bonus three years ago , using a cudgel known as a jeopardy assessment and while the irs has vowed lately to treat taxpayers as customers , the boyers remain trapped in a case left over from the old culture , in which all taxpayers were viewed with suspicion and getting a case closed could take years ms kennedy and her brothers may well be in the wrong , and may be victims of bad legal advice a review of court filings shows that the rights and wrongs are anything but clearcut but they have no money to pay any taxes , especially after incurring more than 1 million in legal fees fighting the irs yet the irs will not let them go because they have one potentially valuable asset a malpractice claim against the lawyers who originally handled the estate in effect , the irs has become a speculative investor , hoping to profit from that litigation and has refused all settlement offers the agency , as its resources shrink , pursues fewer and fewer cases , but when it does take on a case it rarely lets go the story of the irs versus the estate of elizabeth boyer raises questions about how carefully it picks those targets , considering that by pursuing this case , it has inevitably been forced to pass up numerous more lucrative ones the case also raises questions about the competence of government lawyers , who twice had the opportunity to collect all or most of the taxes the irs claims are due , but let both chances slip away tax litigators across the country , in interviews , were uniformly critical of the irs for using the jeopardy assessment in this case , and most said the case illustrates how the irs fails to close cases that no longer have much chance of generating money once a case is started , they are all javerts , said julian block , a tax lawyer in scarsdale , ny , and a former irs criminal investigator , referring to the detective in les miserables who pursued a man for decades over a stolen loaf of bread there is no one to tell them to stop and david aughtry , an estate tax litigator with chamberlain hrdlicka white williams martin in atlanta , said with the irs you are dealing with a sleeping giant the giant awakens and gets excited on an individual case and its reaction is disproportionate to both the circumstances of that case and the normal reaction of other taxpayers the toll from the case , which has spawned eight separate court actions , includes the failure of tom s and paula s first marriages and the delay of her second bill and his wife , mary jo , say their marriage has become strained the roots of the saga go back to world war ii , when donald boyer married elizabeth skivington they became teachers at a private school , buying her parents' modest row house in philadelphia , where they lived until they died they worked summers at camp dewitt on lake winnipesaukee , where many campers were recruited by mr boyer over the years , his children say , his skill with boys won the favor of several wealthy philadelphians , who , in turn , helped the boyers buy a growing stake in the camp s 90 wooded acres and 5 , 000 feet of lakefront in 1981 , when he was 65 , mr boyer retired from teaching to run camp dewitt full time , but suddenly died his widow stayed on and with their second son , tom , kept the camp going she bought the last half of camp dewitt in january 1984 for 430 , 000 , with the sellers holding the mortgage the family lawyer , albert ciardi jr of philadelphia , drew up a plan in 1985 for mrs boyer to transfer ownership of the camp to a partnership in which she and her three children would each have a quarter share even while his mother was alive , tom boyer envisioned dividing half the camp into lots for second homes , using the profits to start a new camp in maine , then developing the other half but bill and paula had other interests and wanted nothing to do with those risky plans in the summer of 1986 , elizabeth boyer , who was 71 , grew ill , hiding the gravity of her sickness from everyone until the last boy left camp she then asked paula to drive her to the hospital , where doctors said she was near death from cancer

washington , sept 7 having declared that its own computers are ready to deal with any glitches as the year 2000 arrives , the pentagon is now worried that the 500 , 000 american troops and military dependents overseas may face problems if foreign power grids , water systems or phone lines go haywire with less than four months to go before computers around the world have to cope with the year 2000 software flaw , senior pentagon officials say about 40 percent of the 130 key foreign bases that the military is monitoring meet american standards of assurance that essential services will remain unaffected but the officials say that number is expected to climb rapidly as more information is gathered from local officials the american military uses more than 300 installations worldwide the questions commanders are asking include will foreign air traffic control systems work \? will seaport cargo handling equipment function properly \? will automated security networks go down \? will civilian hospitals suffer power outages \? we anticipate there will be some disruption , but we do n't think it 'll affect our warfighting ability , deputy defense secretary john j hamre said in an interview we are concerned about what happens to dependents living on the economy overseas by midoctober , mr hamre said , the pentagon will decide where it may need to send backup equipment , like auxiliary generators , water purification machines and air traffic control systems , as a hedge against possible problems the pentagon effort has touched some raw diplomatic nerves , as some countries or local officials have been reluctant or unable to give american officials technical details about safeguards against the problems that could arise because some computer software cannot recognize that the twodigit date 00 means 2000 , not 1900 most countries are n't going to tell you they have a problem , so you have to read between the lines of what they say , mr hamre said to improve the reliability of their overall assessment , the pentagon began dispatching teams of experts late last month from the military , american embassies , the energy , commerce and transportation departments and the central intelligence agency to europe , the middle east and the far east those experts are meeting with foreign counterparts to fill gaps in information about specific bases and to ask about scores of ports , airfields and other overseas sites that the american military relies on but does not control , like the suez canal most european countries , including britain and germany , are passing with flying colors , as are japan , saudi arabia and kuwait , officials familiar with the assessments say but the essential services provided to large numbers of american troops and dependents by some key allies , like italy and turkey , require greater scrutiny , the officials say the military , of course , plans for all kinds of contingencies pentagon officials say the point of their review is not to demand computer safeguards or provide corrective measures , but to identify where the military may need to step in with help in the end it s not important whether a foreign port works or does n't work , but that we have a plan for that situation , said peter f verga , a senior pentagon troubleshooter for overseas issues important bases in italy , like aviano , from which allied warplanes flew missions in the air war over kosovo , are mostly selfsufficient , military officials say but officials are less confident about services outside the gates the concern is between the bases , said maj jim dudley , a logistics specialist for the year 2000 computer issues for the military s european command we use leased communications lines mostly from incountry utilities they seem to be doing well , but we do n't have a complete picture of where they are american officials express concern that the major earthquake in turkey last month could set back that country s efforts to assess its potential computer problems the military is also worried about outposts in south america and africa , because many countries in those continents were late in addressing the issue , officials said the military s european command is planning a major drill at ramstein air base in germany in early october to test routine operations , such as sending an electronic computer message or making a secure telephone call to another base using information gathered by government teams and from other sources , the state department plans , later this month , to issue countrybycountry travel advisories of possible problems the pentagon and its regional worldwide commands have created task forces to examine the issue of compliance by host nations mr hamre has ordered monthly briefings on the subject , beginning this month , and top military aides to the joint chiefs of staff will brief the fourstar regional commanders in washington on sept 23 to assess its progress , the pentagon is using a rating system for the 130 key installations , using stoplight colors as benchmarks the system evaluates seven variables communications , energy , finance , safety , sewage , transportation and water a green light means that the pentagon is confident that a service will be unaffected a yellow light indicates that the military has yet to be persuaded that the system will function properly a red light means that the country acknowledges that it will have problems by and large , we have very few cases where it s red , mr hamre said a sampling of the assessments provided by the pentagon reflects how much the review is a work in progress as of last week , for example , most lights were yellow on the chart for the navy base in rota , spain camp humphries , an army helicopter base in south korea , showed a mixture of yellow and green an army garrison in hanau , germany , showed solid green none of the briefing charts provided had any red lights there is also an important fourth category white lights , which means that the information is unknown right now , many installations' charts are filled with white lights , and coloring in those blanks will be a top pentagon priority we do n't want to be surprised , said rear adm robert f willard , who is overseeing the year 2000 computer assessment for the joint chiefs of staff
chicago , april 11 prime minister zhu rongji of china took his tour of america to the heartland today , tossing footballs with denver broncos , inspecting a black angus bull and listening to a tibetan sing chinese nationalist songs visiting denver and chicago after sharp exchanges in washington over trade and human rights , mr zhu tried to show an interest in everyday americans and their culture but he refused to relax the grueling pace he has set since he began an american tour in los angeles a week ago he zipped around the two cities in his 40car motorcade for most of the weekend , slackening the pace slightly this evening for private meetings with members of the chineseamerican community in chicago protesters calling for independence for tibet made scattered appearances in both cities , usually in groups of two dozen to three dozen , sometimes stationed on highway overpasses along the motorcade route one group of 30 protesters outside the hilton chicago towers in downtown chicago chanted , red china , shame on you loud enough to be heard on the upper floors of the hotel where mr zhu was staying some wariness toward china followed him from washington over a dinner of fillet of beef and colorado spring greens , gov bill owens instructed mr zhu , who stands third in china s political hierarchy , on liberty and the american way of life but the comments elicited only smiles from the prime minister in the tradition of senior chinese leaders who visit america , mr zhu , well known for his economic focus , sought to show that his interest in america went beyond trade and technology in late 1997 , president jiang zemin visited the united states and explored revolutionary war sites mr zhu had a more modern passion football local officials said that although he was told that spring was not football season , mr zhu insisted on visiting the denver broncos and expressed a particular interest in meeting john elway , the quarterback who led the broncos to backtoback super bowl victories in the last two years the visit was a fumble of sorts mr zhu s interest in football exceeded his familiarity with the game when he visited the broncos' elaborate training site outside denver , he joked that the uniforms and shoulder pads look like the garb on ancient warriors he said he did not dare wear the equipment i am afraid my legs would buckle and i would fall down if i tried , he said mr zhu experimented with throwing a football on the broncos' heated practice turf he first tried shoving it away from his chest , like a medicine ball given a second chance , he sidearmed a blistering pass into a group of television cameras , hitting a reporter in the face the prime minister seemed slightly upset when none of the champion broncos' big stars showed up for the event , including mr elway there had been rumors that mr elway , whom some local politicians are hoping to recruit to run on a republican ticket , did not want to have his picture taken with a chinese communist but mr elway put those to rest when he appeared at a dinner for mr zhu on saturday night mr zhu also accepted a gift of a blueandorange broncos shirt , with zhu and no 7 , mr elway s number , on the back mr zhu also made a quick stop at denver s openair red rocks amphitheater the program featured some local music but in what seemed like a deliberate effort to counter the ubiquitous protests against chinese rule of tibet , the organizers included a performance by a tibetan opera singer , dorji ciren he belted out a version of my homeland , kind as a mother , a song of homage to mainland china akin to my country tis of thee though he was presented with gifts at every stop , none compared with the 1 , 500pound black angus bull , genetically engineered by scientists at the university of illinois to produce calves that make the highest grade of beef the bull was a gift from thomas j pritzker , president of the hyatt corporation , who also owns a farm outside of chicago mr zhu briefly inspected the young bull but he seemed more intrigued by a 10ton caterpillar combine parked nearby to the consternation of the secret service officers surrounding him , he climbed the steep stairs to enter its cab and peppered the operator with questions he also continued his energetic politicking for china to be accepted by the world trade organization china failed , at least temporarily , to win entry when talks on admission fell through last week while most of his delegation remained inside buses and limousines to escape bitter winds , mr zhu courted local farmers gathered on the farm he urged them to call president clinton personally and relate how much they want china to join the world trade body he told us to call the president directly and tell him how much we want this wto thing , said pete tekampe , 57 , who grows corn and beans on a 1000acre spread nearby i do n't know if i can do that for him , but maybe i 'll call my local representative photo prime minister zhu rongji of china showing off a cowboy hat given to him by gov bill owens of colorado , left , at a state dinner in denver on saturday mr zhu has gotten a broad taste of american culture on his trip \( associated press \)
washington , jan 11 president clinton formally defended himself today for the first time against removal from office by the senate , arguing that he committed no crimes and that the charges against him are so vague and muddled that they are unconstitutional hours later , prosecutors drawn from the house of representatives released a scorching memorandum mapping their case for an illegal presidential coverup , which they will begin to present on thursday the dueling documents , filed in response to deadlines imposed by the senate , drew on the same body of evidence but they provided nightandday versions of whether mr clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice to hide his affair with monica s lewinsky and whether the charges against him could warrant ejecting a president from office for the first time none of the wrongdoing of which the president is accused , his lawyers argued , reaches the level of high crimes and misdemeanors , the constitutional standard for removal from office the charges in the two articles of impeachment do not permit the conviction and removal from office of a duly elected president , they wrote in their 13page brief but the house prosecutors took a far different view of the charges , and of the stakes if the president is not convicted as a consequence of the conduct that has been portrayed , they wrote , reprising arguments made before the house judiciary committee , then no house of representatives will ever be able to impeach again and no senate will ever convict the bar will be so high that only a convicted felon or a traitor will need to be concerned in an intensifying flurry of paper , the filings came as each side refined its legal and political arguments in preparation for thursday today s defense filing was in response to a summons from the senate on friday on wednesday , the president s team is expected to provide the senate with a fuller brief rebutting today s prosecutorial document , which at 105 pages contained much more detail although the president met briefly with his lawyers and political team this morning , he did not comment in public on his filing instead , mr clinton presided over the state visit of president carlos menem of argentina , greeting him in the grand foyer this morning , meeting with him at length and holding a state dinner for him this evening the white house took the unusual step of not scheduling a joint news conference for the two leaders while mr clinton sat down with mr menem at the white house , 9 of the 13 house prosecutors toured the floor of the senate , where new tables were installed over the weekend for the prosecution and defense teams mr clinton also spent two hours this afternoon in the oval office with his senior advisers to discuss his state of the union message the white house said today that , despite the objections even of some democrats , mr clinton still planned to give the speech to both houses of congress on jan 19 to contest charges that mr clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice , his lawyers boiled down their previous factual arguments into a tightly focused summary they attacked what they called myths about his sworn testimony before the grand jury investigating his relationship with ms lewinsky he simply did not tell lies that the house accused him of telling , the lawyers said they said , for example , that it was a myth that the president failed to admit his improper intimate relationship with ms monica lewinsky mr clinton , they noted , read a prepared statement at the beginning of his testimony acknowledging inappropriate intimate contact the statement s intent , the lawyers wrote , was to permit prosecutors to obtain necessary information without unduly dwelling on the salacious details of the relationship but the house prosecutors tried to turn that same statement against the president , saying that it contained totally false assertions and other clearly misleading information on the obstruction of justice charges , the president s lawyers saw sweeping vindication where the prosecutors saw an absurdly narrow interpretation of the facts mr clinton s defense , as presented today , relies heavily on ms lewinsky s statement to the grand jury unprompted by prosecutors that no one ever asked me to lie and i was never promised a job for my silence anticipating that argument , the prosecutors had prepared a salvo of derision , turning against mr clinton a favorite white house term for describing his ability to divide his attention the evidence , they wrote , cannot be compartmentalized events and words that seem innocent , they added , may well take on a sinister , or even criminal connotation when observed in the context of the whole plot the white house brief was delivered to the secretary of the senate today at 11 48 am although the white house responded as mandated to the senate summons today , it passed up an opportunity to file motions , due by 5 pm , challenging the charges or the conduct of the trial such motions , white house aides said , could have delayed the trial for weeks
in a severe case of out of sight , out of mind , major league baseball and its member teams have suffered a collective lapse of memory since the celebration 21 months ago of the 50th anniversary of jackie robinson s barrierbreaking exploits since baseball celebrated robinson and his impact on the game and society that april night at shea stadium in 1997 , six general managers and eight managers have been hired the five highestranking positions in the commissioner s office , four of them new positions , have also been filled the number of members of minorities in those 19 hires one , jerry manuel , manager of the chicago white sox in that same period , one black general manager left his job and two black managers were fired , leaving the minority roster in those highlevel positions reduced by a net of two those statistics do n't say much for the vows and promises that were rampant during the seasonlong salute to robinson and his legacy when the heat s turned up a little bit , the people at the top or in position to do something make a lot of promises , frank robinson said but as soon as time passes and the heat goes down and it s cool again , it s business as usual you look around and not much has been done robinson is a veteran of the minority wars he was major league baseball s first black manager and later was an assistant general manager for five years , but he never cracked the ethnic ceiling he now works out of the commissioner s office but far below the level of the top five in the summer of 1997 , in the midst of the jackie robinson celebration , the executive council , under the leadership of bud selig , named paul beeston president and chief operating officer last july the owners elected selig commissioner a couple of months ago , sandy alderson was named executive vice president of baseball operations , robert dupuy executive vice president for administration and rob manfred executive vice president for labor relations and human resources in those particular cases , selig said of the four new officials , obviously i thought about it , but for each one of those positions we already had the candidates because of their past experience and what they brought but we 're not done there yet , and we 're sensitive to the concerns that are raised popular perception had it that bob watson had been interviewed for the job alderson got it did n't happen i was never interviewed , watson said i talked to paul beeston in the middle of last summer , and he told me they were thinking of restructuring he said he would include my name on a short list that s the last i heard of it until the news came out that sandy was the guy alderson , watson said , is a good man with varied experience but , he added , i would love to have had the opportunity to pursue the job i never got a real opportunity to do that watson , the major leagues' first and only black general manager until he voluntarily left the yankees a year ago , was interviewed for the general manager s job with the los angeles dodgers were the dodgers sincere or was he merely a token candidate for the job kevin malone got \? i thought i served a very good situation for them , watson said without answering the question directly frank robinson knows the feeling i went through it three years ago , he said using the analogy of hitting a baseball well and knowing it , he added , recalling his own experience with general manager interviews it s the same way in the interview process from the way they treat you , the way they talk to you , you have a good idea when you leave about whether they were really serious about it when i left the two interviews i had , i knew they were n't serious , that i did n't have a chance malone , ed wade of philadelphia , frank wren of baltimore , billy beane of oakland , steve phillips of the mets and brian cashman , watson s successor with the yankees , are the general managers who have been hired since the start of the jackie robinson celebration if you recall , during the jackie robinson celebration year , watson said , there were speeches made by people in higher positions saying that in the future there would be a number of minorities hired in decisionmaking positions , and that has n't taken place major league baseball s most recent employment study , for the 1997 season , said that 15 percent of senior executives , directors and general managers in team front offices were members of minorities , up from 11 percent two years earlier the figure for central offices was 17 percent , down from 21 percent a club official estimated that 30 percent to 40 percent of players in the major leagues are minorities since the end of last season , three assistant general managers have been named who are members of minority groups dave stewart of toronto , david wilder of the chicago cubs and ruben amaro jr of philadelphia have joined omar minaya of the mets and darrell \( doc \) rodgers of cincinnati in that role , as well as two women , elaine steward of boston and kim ng of the yankees at the next level down , al avila was recently named the florida marlins' scouting director and don reynolds is the montreal expos' new farm director as more members of minorities gain those positions , there will be more candidates in the pipeline , as baseball officials refer to it , to be considered for general managers' jobs

jerusalem , feb 14 at the top of the hill that climbs into this ancient city , about 250 , 000 ultraorthodox jews gathered today for what amounted to a blackhat power rally , unprecedented in size and markedly tranquil in tone convened as a protest against the supreme court s supposedly antireligious judicial tyranny , it was really a show of solidarity by the ultraorthodox who , in their traditional black hats and coats , swayed in prayer under the watchful eyes and helicopter surveillance of a heavy police presence at the bottom of the hill , in a counterrally with a decidedly different flavor , about 50 , 000 academics , lawyers , kibbutzniks and devoted secularists waved israeli flags , sang the national anthem and cheered fiery prodemocracy speakers while munching cotton candy and drinking coke in between and around the two camps was a cordon of 2 , 000 police officers , dubbed operation static electricity but the feared violence never erupted , and the culture war over israel s identity , which seemed to be building to an explosion , remained at a standoff religious and secular jews , a few hundred yards and a world apart the idea is not to get into a conflict , but to make ourselves be seen and heard , avi stein , a religious man , said as he smoked a cigarette at prayer s end we feel toward the others , the seculars , that they 're brothers who made a mistake with their lives such relatively conciliatory language was not the mood of the week leading up to the huge rally today by the ultraorthodox , known here as the haredim , literally those who tremble before god instead , religious leaders made a series of vitriolic attacks on the supreme court , which they believe to be overstepping its bounds by ruling against them on matters of religion and state all week long , the tone was so combative that the country s political leaders worked hard , if unsuccessfully , to persuade the organizers to call off today s event , which packed 1 , 000 buses with religious jews following their rabbis' orders to attend the politicians feared that the rabbis had whipped the haredi public into a frenzy that would climax in clashes with the police and secular israelis but after loudspeaker announcements warning the haredim to keep their cool , a ram s horn blew loud and triumphant , and a sea of blackhatted men began bobbing in unison over mimeographed prayer sheets this is a very obedient crowd , said david zilbershlag , an ultraorthodox advertising executive and spokesman for the demonstration when they were told to come , even if they did not really understand this issue , they came and when they were told that they needed to disperse in total silence , they dispersed in total silence a few blocks away , the supreme court held business as usual today , although the building was ringed by armed troops and after a week in which the judges were attacked as enemies of judaism who issued antisemitic decisions , each justice traveled to and from court with at least one personal bodyguard this morning , preparing for what they expected might be hostilities , tel aviv university students , their classes canceled , decorated placards as a leader told them , people should understand that blood could be shed , and people could drop like flies but once the prodemocracy crowd had gathered at sacher park in jerusalem , the notion of bloodshed seemed implausible the atmosphere was defiant , but festive , and the speakers' combative words descended on a crowd lounging in the grass under a brilliant sun there is a war in israel , a struggle of life and death for israeli democracy , said one speaker , avraham burg , a labor party member and head of the jewish agency dressed in a power suit and working his cellular phone , shaul ivtzan , a lawyer , nodded as he stood at the edge of the park it was the first time he had ever been to a demonstration , he said , but he felt he had to show up to defend the supreme court the supreme court is supposed to be above the fray , he said when it s attacked like this , we ca n't sit still this is the red line , the causus belli it s time to stand up against the orthodox several political commentators suggested today that the haredim , fearful of losing power , were trying to flex their muscle in advance of the may 17 elections , although none of the candidates for prime minister showed up at either of the rallies as a crucial bloc of votes in prime minister benjamin netanyahu s governing coalition , the haredim have maintained considerable power during his tenure politicians from religious parties controlled seven ministries , including housing , education and labor , and they traded their support for more money for their constituency but it is considered unlikely that they will play such a key role in the next administration , even if mr netanyahu is reelected at the same time , the haredim have been losing battles in the supreme court , which has repeatedly struck at the power and privileges of the orthodox in israeli society they called today s rally in anticipation of a hearing next week on the issue of conversion , which raises the sensitive question of who is a jew we the haredi jews are prodemocracy , but we do n't think the court should answer that question because what do they know on the subject , said moshe rolnick , who moved to israel from flatbush , brooklyn , 13 years ago the supreme court happens to be a clique of leftist and extremely antireligious men avraham leizerson , an ultraorthodox member of parliament , said his constituents felt choked and persecuted and helpless as they are increasingly disdained by secular society at both rallies , israelis spoke of the other side s mounting disrespect for them and in the cases where their paths crossed , they argued furiously and spitefully i'm here at this democracy demonstration because i despise the haredim , said gadi suisser , who shook his finger in the face of an ultraorthodox man i'm a traditional person from morocco , and i think you 've taken judaism and castrated it , and wrung out its soul you think no one else in this country has morals \? you think you 're holier than the overwhelming majority of israelis \? the religious man , who declined to be identified , asked if he was finished , and then answered i think jewish law is holier than the law of the land , he said the man who has torah holds the answers to life s questions in his hand you want to go to pubs on the sabbath \? the torah does't allow it sorry this enraged chana schwartzeisler , a high school teacher from kfar saba you bunch of no good parasites , she said throwing stones at cars on the sabbath you find time for but god forbid you should work in calling on his fellow diehard seculars to come out for the protest , the israeli novelist a b yehoshua said theirs should be a demonstration for democracy rather than against the ultraorthodox the conflict over the balance between jewish and secular law in the jewish homeland would be a chronic one , he said , and it was important to defuse the volatility of the moment this is a structural problem , like the problem always in america between the federal government and the states , he said in 200 years , there will still be someone who will speak about why the supreme court has too much power it is built into our nature , because we will never entirely separate religion from state photo ultraorthodox demonstrators at the top of a hill in jerusalem yesterday were protesting what they call antireligious rulings by the israeli supreme court at the bottom of the hill , secular israelis staged a counterrally \( rina castelnuovo for the new york times \)

the rice paddies and scraggly pine groves of hunan province , thousands of farmers more than 10 , 000 , participants say streamed from the surrounding hills to the government office in daolin , a town of a few thousand they came to demand an end to what they consider excessive taxes and corruption by the local communist party officials who rule over them but the rally , possibly one of the largest farmer protests in china in recent years , was quickly crushed mr zhang was killed by an exploding teargas canister fired by riot policemen scores more people were wounded by the gas or by clubs , witnesses said eighteen people were detained for one or two days , a participant said in an interview here , and four leaders of the protest escaped arrest and have been sought ever since , with reward posters plastered on village walls by the police and torn down by angry farmers the event , called by a twoyearold illegal organization of local farmers , was one of many similar protests that have erupted in rural areas around the country like most others , it was completely unreported in the chinese media , and rural protesters have rarely had a chance to describe their grievances directly to outsiders along with the ire of unpaid urban workers , boiling resentment in the countryside is a major source of the social instability that has recently preoccupied china s leaders the rampant discontent seems less to reflect any new crisis than it does the slow grinding down of farmers who have long been known for their ability to eat bitterness but multiplied across rural china , where twothirds of the country s people still live , the alienation of farmers whom mao zedong once called the main force in the revolution poses a longterm challenge to communist party rule the simmering conflict in hunan is a particular embarrassment for the party because hunan is the birthplace of mao and other top leaders , including the current prime minister , zhu rongji adding further to the sense of disorder , in the last month hunan was also the site of two unsolved bombings one on a bus in the provincial capital of changsha that wounded 37 and the other in the southern town of yizhang that killed eight but no evidence has surfaced to link those events to farmer or worker protests daolin township , an administrative area of some 50 , 000 people scattered in many villages , is neither poor nor rich by the standards of rural china , a place where families squeeze out two rice crops a year on small plots of land candid conversations with numerous farmers across the angry township suggest that resentment of local party and government officials is pervasive , linked to the multitude of taxes they levy and a sense that the officials fritter the money away with extravagant wining and dining so general is the antipathy that the local police have not dared to enter the villages to arrest wanted protest organizers , and large rewards posted for their capture have yielded no takers the national leaders have acknowledged the threat to the party president jiang zemin , prime minister zhu and others constantly rail against arbitrary taxes and against corruption both petty and grand the party has also promoted elections of village leaders , intended to vent discontent and root out venal or incompetent cadres but an afternoon with farmers in hunan suggests that here at least , hostility toward local party and government officials remains high , though farmers seem to retain some faith in top national leaders the farmers , most of whom took part in the jan 8 demonstration , spoke on condition of anonymity several said essentially the same thing the officials just help one another , and the corrupt ones just get moved on to new jobs in several telephone calls to daolin township and police offices , officials refused to comment on the jan 8 confrontation or the farmers' charges about two years ago , concerned farmers from several villages of daolin formed an organization , said a man who was involved , who for fear of arrest would not allow his name to be used similar groups have been formed in at least 4 of the 12 other townships in the surrounding county of ningxiang , he said the daolin group was spearheaded by a man named yang yaojin , farmers said , who is now wanted by the local police the group adopted an intentionally innocuous name volunteers for publicity of policies and regulations the name was a sly one , reflecting the farmers' basic complaint and their strategy , which is to praise national officials and paint local ones as violators the central government , the involved man noted , has a policy that taxes on farmers should not exceed 5 percent of their previous year s income we had found that the policies of local cadres ran counter to those of the provincial and central governments , said the man the farmers charge that township and county officials have inflated the incomes of local villagers in their records , so they can levy higher taxes without seeming to violate the rules the real per capita income in daolin in 1998 was 1 , 400 yuan , or about 170 , the man said , but officials said it was 2 , 400 yuan , about 290

orange , nj , may 21 inside home dairy , a sliver of a store that sells candy , cigarettes and newspapers here , people mill around all day searching for phantom riches writing down numbers and scratching tickets in a nonstop frenzy that amounts to 14 , 400 in average weekly lottery sales despite the store s name , only a few cartons of milk are sold each day more customers come looking for dream books , which sell for 3 to 5 and offer advice on what lottery numbers should be associated with a dream or daily occurrence if a person dreams about a cat , one book advises , the number to play is 114 if the cat is black , the number is 244 and if a person buys a hat , the book recommends 815 or 816 standing in the store one evening , dennis dutton , a 36yearold custodian who bets on numbers every day , explained how important a lottery jackpot was to his financial planning throughout the month , mr dutton said , he intended to bet 15 each day on the number 898 at the time , his telephone was disconnected and he was hoping that hitting the number for winnings of about 2 , 750 would help pay his bills i wish that 898 would come out , he said , because it would solve all my problems \( it did not \) in this workingclass neighborhood , 18 miles west of manhattan , as in similar areas across the country , the statesponsored daily lottery is becoming so deeply woven into so many lives that it is a part of the social fabric it is a pastime more popular than baseball , a ritual as routine as watching the nightly news , a practice far more common than voting with lottery machines as prevalent as cash registers in the 38 states with lotteries , instantwin tickets hanging behind store counters everywhere , and 35 billion bet each year across the country , the most prevalent purveyor of betting games in america is no longer the street corner sports bookmaker or the las vegas casino operator instead , it is the state governments the same entities that for years outlawed gambling that are now leading the way in building widespread acceptance of gambling across the country the impact that state lotteries are having on communities around the country has also been a focus of the national gambling impact study commission , appointed in 1996 by president clinton and congress to examine the social and economic consequences of legalized gambling in the united states the commission , which in june is scheduled to release a report of its twoyear study , is expected to recommend that state lotteries curtail their advertising in economically distressed communities and that they be required to contribute some of their revenues to research and treatment for problem gambling it is in communities like orange where the lottery is a dominant force and many poor and modestincome residents are devoted to an endless search for winning numbers and an unswerving belief that a jackpot waits for them the players the best customers can least afford it a close look at orange and a computer analysis of lottery playing in new jersey by the new york times provide a compelling picture of just how vital the people who live and work in cities like this one are to the lottery business far more than previously known , modestwage earners , the poor and less educated people spend a greater percentage of their income on the lottery than do wealthier new jersey residents , the times analysis found using 1998 new jersey state lottery data , the analysis found that in the zip codes where people with the lowest incomes live , the amount spent per 10 , 000 of income on lottery tickets was more than five times the amount spent on tickets by people who live in wealthier zip codes the analysis was calculated from information on 48 , 875 lottery winners and estimates based on census data it found that for a chance to cash in on an instantwin scratch ticket , people living in the 100 lowest averageincome zip codes in new jersey spent 53 per 10 , 000 of their earnings but in the 100 zip codes with the highestaverage income , spending on instantwin tickets was just 12 per 10 , 000 and for the pick 4 game , which can pay as much as 2 , 788 for a 50cent bet on the correct four numbers and which is one of the state s most popular games , people in the 100 lowestincome zip codes spent 29 per 10 , 000 income , compared with 5 per 10 , 000 income in the 100 highestincome zip codes in new jersey , people who are less educated also spend far more money playing the lottery in the zip codes with the lowest percentage of people with college educations , people spent more than five times as much per 10 , 000 of income than those in areas with the highest proportion of collegeeducated population the analysis is consistent with those in other states that have shown that as a percentage of household income , poorer people in cities and rural areas alike , spend much more on the lottery than do people in highincome brackets living from paycheck to paycheck , they are easily captured by the notion that the lottery can fulfill their basic financial goals and while these customers put far more money into the lottery , there is little evidence that they get more back
albany , may 29 new york , until recently considered a leader in combating smoking , is rapidly becoming a laggard , as other states leapfrog past it in the size and aggressiveness of their efforts two years ago , new york was one of just four states that financed advertising and education programs aimed at persuading the public , particularly teenagers , not to smoke now , 8 states have such programs , and 11 others , including new jersey and connecticut , expect to begin theirs in the next year with one possible exception , all those states anticipate spending far more than new york on the programs , when adjusted for the states' populations gov george e pataki , a republican whose party has reaped major campaign contributions from the tobacco industry , has proposed spending 84 million on new york s antitobacco program over the next year , up from 82 million in the last year california , in contrast , is spending 1201 million in the current fiscal year florida is spending 704 million , and massachusetts , 60 million the cost of other existing state programs ranges from the 259 per person that oregon spends in its current budget to the 1126 that mississippi allots new york spends 45 cents per capita that s about like throwing a mosquito at an elephant , said michael moore , mississippi s attorney general , who led the multistate sixyear legal fight against tobacco companies it has no effect michael mckeon , mr pataki s press secretary , defended new york s program we could probably spend a zillion dollars , and there s always going to be advocates who say we could do more , he said but we think we have a good plan and a good program , and we 're always open to new ideas under mr pataki , new york began antitobacco advertising on radio and television three years ago those ads have been dismissed by antismoking groups as all but useless , mostly because they do not appeal to young people , and they are broadcast so infrequently that many people have never seen or heard them one shown last year featured dennis c vacco , then the attorney general , speaking earnestly of the dangers of smoking the most prominent part of new york s current campaign is billboards with a collage of celebrity faces and the line , we choose not to smoke , reminiscent of the just say no antidrug campaign of the 1980 s by contrast , ads in other states often have a slapintheface tone , aiming to be shocking or darkly funny one television ad shown in florida depicts a ceremony held in hades , with adolf hitler in the audience , to award tobacco the prize for most deaths caused , ranking ahead of other contenders like murder and drugs john signor , a spokesman for the new york state health department , which administers the antismoking program , noted that some of the advertisements used by new york were produced by other states or by the federal government we have a very comprehensive plan of advertising , education and enforcement , he said but timothy nichols , the director of governmental affairs for the american lung association , said new york pales in comparison to these other states what they call an antitobacco program , they might as well not even spend the money while antismoking groups in new york direct most of their criticism at the governor , the leaders of the legislature , in both parties , have put little pressure on him to strengthen new york s program the rush by states to start antitobacco programs has been propelled in part by research showing that aggressive advertising can be highly effective in reducing smoking several studies have reported that in the 1990 s , smoking has declined more than twice as fast in california , which has the oldest such program , as nationwide a report this year showed that just one year into florida s effort , middleschool students there were 19 percent less likely to smoke , and smoking by high school students had dropped 11 percent the federal centers for disease control and prevention called the results one of the largest documented oneyear changes in smoking rates anywhere in new york , as in the rest of the country , adult smoking has declined in the 1990 s a 1996 study found the rate at 23 percent of adults in new york , while in california it had dropped to 18 percent the prospect of having billions of dollars to spend from settlements with tobacco companies has also motivated states to embark on new antitobacco campaigns , a trend that has taken on particular intensity this spring , as states draft their budgets for the next fiscal year some states have also been swayed by the argument that the programs will save money , because the decline in smoking could cut healthcare costs in new jersey , gov christine todd whitman has proposed 186 million for antitobacco advertising , education and law enforcement in the fiscal year that starts july 1 , and legislative leaders have agreed in principle in connecticut , gov john g rowland has proposed just 200 , 000 , which would make it the only state spending less per capita than new york but leaders of the legislature are pressing in budget talks for a much higher figure
rome , oct 11 hoping to stanch a growing spy scandal , an italian parliamentary committee made public a dossier today identifying 261 politicians , bureaucrats and journalists as having cooperated , in some cases unwittingly , with the soviet union the scandal , however , mainly backfired on committee members , who released the documents and then expressed regret for not having first checked their credibility armando cossuta , an italian communist leader whose party supports the governing centerleft coalition , was the most prominent figure to appear in the documents , copied from soviet files by a kgb archivist and smuggled to british intelligence in 1992 the italian government received a copy of the dossier from britain four years ago , but did not act upon it at the time mr cossuta scoffed at the spying charge , saying , let s not be ridiculous prime minister massimo d'alema , who had been badgered by political opponents and some members of his own coalition to disclose the information , declined last week and turned the files over to magistrates to investigate but , yielding to the pressure , he gave a copy today to a parliamentary committee that investigates security matters , which immediately decided to make the dossier public even though we have not verified the authenticity and veracity of the information contained in the documents , giovanni pellegrino , head of the committee , said in a statement , the need to inform public opinion prevailed over the individual right to privacy as soon as the dossier was made public , however , committee members expressed regret we should have verified the dossier first , mr pellegrino said , adding , i do not think we are doing a great service in the name of truth other members warned that some of the reported kgb informants were identified only by code names while still others were listed as potential sources to be cultivated some were listed as unknowing informants the socalled spy network included generals , a nuclear physicist , foreign ministry typists and even a roman catholic monk francesco de martino , 92 , a professor and lifetime senator from the italian socialist party , was described in the dossier as someone who could influence public opinion , but not as a kgb agent his name was nevertheless leaked by the committee a few hours before the dossier was made public mr de martino called the spy charge pure fantasy mr cossuta , 73 , who now heads a splinter faction of the communist party known as the party of italian communists , denied that he had ever leaked state secrets to moscow , but he did not deny contacts with soviet leaders , or charges that the communist party received money from moscow as late as 1987 instead , he acidly recalled the financial contributions received by many italian political parties from the united states the names were taken from files that a former kgb archivist , vasily mitrokhin , handed to british intelligence in 1992 and that formed the basis for a recently published book written by mr mitrokhin and a british scholar , christopher andrew , the mitrokhin archive the kgb in europe and the west the book identifies italian agents only by code names , but says the kgb found italy second only to france as a source of information because of the popularity of the italian communist party after the war mr mitrokhin s disclosures caused a sensation in britain , where an 87yearold suburban grandmother was one of eight former government employees , academics and journalists who gave away secrets to communist agents none of the british informants were still in government service and none had the kind of access likely to compromise british security seriously in italy , it was not immediately clear whether any of the people identified as informants disclosed vital information , but the fact that the investigating magistrates declined to keep the files secret suggested that national security was not severely breached italians of all political stripes were mentioned in the files , but overall the scandal was mostly dangerous for mr d'alema , a former communist , who was accused by rightwing opposition leaders of seeking to protect political allies his predecessor , romano prodi , who was prime minister from april 1996 to october 1998 , said last week that he had not known about the spy list , and repeated that statement today but mr prodi s former defense secretary , beniamino andreatta , said he had known of the documents as early as october 1996 and had passed the information on to mr prodi former prime minister silvio berlusconi , a centerright opposition leader who has been convicted three times of accounting fraud , demanded last week that mr d'alema disclose the names but even mr berlusconi was indirectly affected by the revelations his former spokesman , jas gawronski , was listed in the kgb dossier as a desirable source to be cultivated mr gawronski , a polishborn journalist who is now an italian senator , expressed amusement at the disclosure if they had n't wanted to cultivate me i would feel discriminated against , he said the kgb were criminals , but they were not stupid they did n't want leftists , they wanted to use people who were against them
washington , oct 23 president clinton dropped one of the most contentious elements of his plan for bolstering social security s finances today , and called on congress to break the partisan deadlock over how to prepare the retirement system for the aging of the baby boom generation in his weekly radio address , mr clinton said he would send congress legislation next week based on a proposal he first floated earlier this year to shore up social security with projected federal budget surpluses but the new version will not include mr clinton s longstanding call for the government to invest some social security taxes in the stock market the american people deserve more than confusion , double talk and delay on this issue , mr clinton said so it s time to have a clear , straightforward bill on the table , and next week i plan to present one legislation that insures that all social security payroll tax will go to savings and debt reduction for social security social security is now taking in more than 100 billion a year above what it is paying to retirees , but as the baby boomers retire , payroll taxes will no longer cover benefits in a signal of his desire for bipartisan cooperation , white house officials said mr clinton was withdrawing for now his plan to seek higher returns for the system by having the government invest as much as 15 percent of social security s reserves in the stock market republicans had rejected the idea of government investing in equities , saying it would amount to federal ownership of private industry most republicans have rallied instead around alternatives under which individuals would be able to invest part of their social security payroll taxes on wall street although republicans are sure to welcome mr clinton s concession , they long ago dismissed the rest of the president s basic approach , which is built around reducing the national debt and then capturing some of the interest savings on the retirement system s behalf republicans have often said mr clinton s underlying plan is nothing more than an accounting shell game that fails to address the fundamental mismatch between promised benefits and the revenues to pay them if the president is serious about saving social security , he 'll work with us to give personal accounts to american workers rather than relying on tired old accounting changes that simply fill the trust fund with more iou s , said trent duffy , a spokesman for representative bill archer , the texas republican who is chairman of the house ways and means committee the white house said its plan would extend social security s solvency from 2034 , when under current projections it would be able to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits , to 2050 , beyond the life span of most of the 76 million americans born in the 18 years after world war ii what we have tried to do is present what we feel is the most solid , bipartisan , hopefully uncontroversial proposal to lock away the social security surpluses for debt reduction , and use those interest savings to extend the solvency of social security , said gene sperling , the director of the white house s national economic council mr clinton s announcement today was in part a lastditch effort to make some progress this year on dealing with social security , which has more than lived up to its reputation as the most politically and ideologically charged of issues but it was clearly also an effort to put the white house back on the offensive after several weeks in which republicans in congress have used social security to attack democratic spending proposals in news conferences , rallies on capitol hill and television commercials in the districts of 10 house democrats , the republicans have made a case that democrats want to spend so much money that they are raiding social security s reserves to foot the bill responding to the president s radio address , republicans in congress promised not to use social security surpluses to pay for other spending programs , and called for cuts in spending representative j c watts , the chairman of the republican conference , said republicans now planned to cut spending and keep the budget balanced while paying down 150 billion in debt in the coming year the social security surplus must be off limits , said senator pete v domenici of new mexico , chairman of the senate budget committee , who gave the republicans' radio address today we believe the government should stay the course and live within its means , mr domenici added by doing so , we can preserve the social security surplus , pay down our national debt , keep the budget balanced , while investing in priorities such as education and health care both parties routinely agreed for decades to spend excess social security payroll tax revenues on general government operations but this year the two parties have both pledged to balance the budget without using any of the social security money , and they have been trading bitter accusations about the inability of the other to show how to do it the fight has been less about social security the retirement system s longterm health is only indirectly connected to whether some of its excess revenues are spent on other programs in a given year than about exploiting an issue that both sides believe can play to their benefit in next year s elections although members of both parties have come up with approaches to dealing with social security s underlying problems , none of the plans have enough support to have been given serious consideration mr sperling said mr clinton s plan was intended to be a start on the broader goal of insuring social security s viability for at least 75 years mr clinton s plan is based on the idea that by using the social security surplus to pay down the national debt , the government s interest bill will decline substantially by the white house s estimate , the government s interest expense will be 107 billion lower in 2011 than it would be if the social security surplus were not used , starting this year , to reduce the debt mr clinton s proposal would take the money saved because of the lower amount of debt , starting in 2011 , and earmark it to shore up social security from 2011 through 2015 , the total savings in interest dedicated to social security would be 544 billion , mr sperling said , and savings would continue accruing beyond 2015 at around 189 billion a year the savings would at first go to further reductions in the national debt after the debt was paid off around 2015 under the white house s current scenario the savings would continue to be transferred to social security in the form of a government iou that would later be redeemed to pay benefits republicans said the plan would still require that the government eventually pay social security benefits using general revenues in that way , they said , mr clinton s plan would merely defer tough choices about raising taxes , cutting benefits or again increasing borrowing
if the literary agent richard curtis has his way , there will be one more chapter written in the handwringing saga of st martin s press and its canceled biography of governor george w bush of texas despite the abrupt recall by st martin s last month of fortunate son george w bush and the making of an american president , mr curtis is trolling for another company that would be willing to publish the title , which was abandoned after reports that the author , j h hatfield , was a federal parolee who had been imprisoned for plotting to kill his boss in a car bombing there are several publishers that are interested in this , mr curtis said , noting , with understatement , that the talks are delicate and complicated because the previous experience was delicate and complicated after st martin s recalled the biography , the rights to publish the book reverted to the author , which left his agent free to search for a new taker so why bother , given his author s severely damaged reputation \? well , has the book been discredited \? said mr curtis i'm asking a question with a question and so my answer is that i want to focus on the veracity of the book mr curtis said he was not sure whether a new publisher would include the book s disputed afterword all i can say for the moment is that all these things are up for discussion , he said when i actually have a deal , and i know what is going to be in the book i promise to tell the author , mr hatfield , has retreated to his home in arkansas without addressing whether his resume includes criminal convictions and he has refused to respond to messages left for him seeking comment mr curtis said the report of a criminal record was a sensitive topic that he had not discussed with mr hatfield , whom he said had contracts to write four books for other publishers , none of which he would identify when jim is ready to discuss his background , i will , said mr curtis he added it s the one area of conversation that i 've refrained from bringing up it s kind of like , do n't ask , do n't tell doreen carvajal
atlanta , oct 18 as incredible as it may seem , the atlanta braves have the look of a loser they have actually positioned themselves to suffer another postseason disappointment the mets , on the other hand , have put themselves in position to be winners who woulda thunk it \? the score of the national league championship series still favors the braves with three victories , they need to win only once more to attain their coveted goal of the world series with kevin millwood pitching tuesday night and tom glavine wednesday night if necessary , they would seem to have the odds on their side the mets would have to win both games to spoil the braves' plans their pitching prospects are not as favorable as the braves' wellrested duo al leiter starts game 6 on three days' rest for only the second time in his career , and a yettobenamed pitcher would start game 7 out of rotation but recent developments suggest a different scenario they create at least the possibility of the mets becoming the first team of the 24 that have started a sevengame postseason series 03 to win the next four games and the series the braves , to begin with , have squandered lateinning leads in the last two games they were four outs from the world series with a 21 lead in game 4 and lost , 32 , and they were two outs from the world series with a 32 lead in game 5 and lost , 43 now they are 27 outs or 54 outs from the world series the task becomes tougher but it was n't simply that they lost game 5 by allowing the mets to score two runs in the second half of the sixth hour sunday night it was the way they played in the many innings leading up to that juncture and their reaction afterward that raised questions about the ability of the braves to hold on to their once seemingly insurmountable lead the braves put 25 runners on base and drove in only three of them in a middleinnings stretch , 9 of 14 braves batters reached base , and none scored as good as the braves have been all year , they could not figure out a way to push even one of those runners across it s a problem , said don baylor , their playoffexperienced hitting coach it really is worse , after the game , the braves' hitters did not take responsibility for their failure to hit when they had opportunities to drive in runs they bemoaned the inability to hold the onerun lead they had going into the mets' half of the 15th they did n't come right out and say it was kevin mcglinchy s fault , but the rookie pitcher was the one who gave up the lead it was not the braves at their finest moment , and uncharacteristic though it might have been , the scene did reflect a different mindset from what the braves usually have it presented a different picture , too , one in which the braves did n't have the look of a team going to the world series millwood might have added to their questionable look today when he praised the mets' ability and said , it would n't surprise us whatever happens what might happen if the mets take a lead early in tuesday night s game \? hopefully we 'll jump out to an early lead like we did in cincinnati , john franco said , referring to the playoff for the wildcard spot when the game was only two batters old and the mets had a 20 lead if you jump out to an early lead , it puts pressure on them to be a little more aggressive at the plate , maybe swing at pitches they normally would n't swing at , try to make things happen instead of being patient leiter , who benefited from the early lead against the reds , recalled another postseason game 6 in which the team trailing by three games to two had the lead it was the philadelphia phillies in the 1993 world series , and they were leading toronto , 65 , until joe carter clouted an electrifying threerun home run in the ninth inning that ended the series i think all along we thought we had them , said leiter , a member of the blue jays then but if we had lost game 6 , we would n't have felt too good about game 7 if the phillies had won that game , there would have been a total momentum swing to them tomorrow is do or die for us , but emotionally the answers will be different after tomorrow s game if we win as far as where the pressure lies millwood expressed the precise feeling leiter recalled , saying , we definitely do n't want it to go to a seventh game the mets are only the second team in history to win games 4 and 5 after losing the first three games of a fourofseven series the nlcs has produced both of those series , the first coming only last year , when the braves won those two games before losing game 6 to san diego no team , of course , has gone from 03 to 33 , but the mets would surprise no one at this point if they became the first there s some kind of 1800 psychic line behind us the way things have been happening , leiter said another leiter observation is at play here after he beat the braves in new york last month and ended the mets' sevengame losing streak , he cited similarities between that game and the one in which he beat the yankees in june and ended an eightgame losing streak he also noted that his june victory began a fourgame winning streak and that a fourgame winning streak was what the mets needed to reach the playoffs they lost the next day to the braves but achieved the fourgame winning streak anyway , beating pittsburgh in the last three games of the regular season , then knocking off the reds in the playoff when the mets fell behind the braves , 30 , what did they need to advance to the world series \? a fourgame winning streak they are halfway there leiter , however , did n't want to talk about the coincidence we 're in the middle of it , he said we do n't want to jinx our chances photo the braves had the look of a loser as they watched robin ventura s hit beat them in the bottom of the 15th inning sunday \( associated press \)
harrison , ny , june 27 at 36 years old , dennis paulson is a former national longdriving champion , a veteran of the asian and nike tours and a guy who says he might have won more tournaments earlier in the decade had he not damaged his shoulder in a thrillseeking dive off a 60foot cliff paulson lost a playoff to duffy waldorf today for the buick classic championship at the westchester country club , but paulson nonetheless made a splash this weekend , in a figurative , more productive way paulson , who is one year removed from the nike tour , has five top10 finishes on this year s pga tour , including four in the top 10 in his last six tour events he is becoming something other than a novelty paulson might be a bit of a late bloomer , but today he did something none of the featured names on the leader board could do mount a charge for the championship even waldorf shot a par 71 today other contenders wilted in the blazing sun justin leonard limped in at 75 as lee janzen and the twotime champion ernie els each shot 73 jim carter , who began the day tied for the lead with waldorf , closed with a 74 paulson shot 67 , making him eight under par for the tournament after posting that score , he put his feet up and waited for someone to catch him only waldorf did his second shot on the first playoff hole drifted into the trees next to the 18th green , dooming his chances against waldorf , but afterward paulson was at ease and clearly pleased which may not be surprising because there are nearly a dozen tour events left and paulson has quintupled his earnings from 1998 , when he made 145 , 000 i feel like i can beat these guys , said paulson , who earned his way onto the 1999 pga tour by finishing sixth on last year s nike tour money list i do n't hold the pga tour in awe paulson was a prominent golfer on the california junior circuit and as a collegian at san diego state he won the national longdriving championship in 1985 , something that became a mixed blessing i do n't know that it hurt me , but it was n't something that helped , he said today , recounting how galleries wanted longer and longer drives each time at every event eventually he scaled back , striving for accuracy rather than distance and eschewing the long driving championships i used to weigh 175 pounds and benchpress 300 , he said now i weigh 300 and benchpress 175 it s an exaggeration , but paulson s new approach brought results and by the early 1990 s , he thought he was ready to have an impact on the pga tour he said the deaths of his father and grandfather distracted him for a while , as did shoulder problems that grew progressively worse i was out with some friends having a good time when i was 19 years old and jumped off a 60foot cliff , paulson said i kind of banged my shoulders up there my right shoulder , the rotator cuff is toasted , but that does n't bother me unless i try to throw a baseball my left shoulder , i might have an arthritic condition for a long time , i tried to play through it when i probably should n't have it got so i could n't lift my shoulders over my head you 're young and you think you 're invincible it bothered me for a long time , but in time , it s gotten better it does n't bother me anymore he has bigger goals than getting close to a title , as common as that s been in the last two months and he acknowledged that a tour victory would give his quirky golfing resume a mark of distinction this was good theater today and fun , paulson said i was very relaxed at the end i was more nervous doing the interview on national television afterward than i was playing the 18th hole so i 've been playing well for me , i just have to be there enough and i 'll think i 'll win one photo dennis paulson , no longer driven by the long game lost in a playoff \( barton silverman the new york times \)
london , aug 31 the planned merger of the french retailers carrefour sa and promodes sa sent shares of other leading european food retailers sharply higher today as investors and analysts wagered on the companies' chances of merging or being acquired fourteen of the 20 largest publicly traded retail stocks surged amid rumor after rumor that a showstopping deal was in the works the carrefourpromodes combination is the second big retail merger in europe this summer , a deal seen by analysts as a defensive move against an aggressive push into europe by walmart stores in june , walmart bought asda group , britain s thirdlargest supermarket chain , adding to purchases in two other european retailers , wertkauf and 74 stores of spar handels ag analysts said that the merger might signal the beginning of a spate of paneuropean mergers as retailers try to stave off a takeover or fail to be competitive this is definitely a triggerpulling deal , said miriam shea , a food retail analyst with j p morgan here the reality is that now everyone has to think about doing a deal ms shea said the merger might make it too hard for companies to stand alone and compete on price because the bigger companies will be able to strongarm suppliers among possible takeover targets , speculation is rampant that britain s big three food retailers tesco plc , j sainsbury plc and safeway plc may be ripe for takeovers possible deals for the dutch supermarket giant royal ahold and the german food retailer metro have also been mentioned in fact , almost every major european food retailer is being assessed because most european retailers trade at significantly lower pricetoearnings multiples than what the carrefourpromodes deal values the two companies promodes , the smaller of the two , was valued at 195 times its earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization based on salomon smith barney estimates for 1999 , while most of the other european retailers trade at 9 to 14 times their estimated value several bankers said that almost every european retailer had picked up the phone to talk to one another as the companies try to formulate strategies but none of the bankers said a deal was imminent , a thought echoed by many analysts , who said they thought the market overreacted today some called it simply a kneejerk reaction it s just a bit wrong on the timing , ms shea said , adding , it s nonsense to think that there is a possibility for value creation as big most analysts said that even walmart could not create such value in any one deal and any chance of a lastminute hostile bid from walmart to thwart the carrefourpromodes deal seems small , despite the ascent of the shares of both companies today on hopes that it might it would be difficult for walmart to come between carrefour and promodes , ms shea said the two companies are merging to protect themselves from a potential takeover by walmart , she said , and a hostile bid in the retail industry , a business based on people and relationships , is a hard thing to do

atlanta , jan 28 phillip , a 41yearold gay man in atlanta , had always been scrupulously safe in his sexual practices until one night last october normally somewhat straitlaced , phillip went that night to a midtown club and decided to cut loose i'm not even a big drinker , he said , speaking on the condition that he be identified only by his first name but sometimes i can let my hair down and i decided that this was going to be one of those nights after a few drinks , he met a man he liked and invited him home during sex , phillip s partner offered him a few snorts of ketamine , or k , an animal anesthetic and a popular drug on the gay club scene it definitely relaxed me , phillip said i know that it took away my inhibitions because i did some things i would never do one of those things , phillip later realized in horror , was sharing a condom with his partner , a practice that can facilitate the transmission of hiv ever since , phillip has lived in terror that he contracted the virus two hiv tests have come back negative , but given the virus s incubation period of about six months he will not be out of the woods for several more months it was just going to be one night of fun for me , phillip said , but it turned into a nightmare aids caseworkers , doctors and therapists say they are hearing stories like phillip s more and more frequently in atlanta and their counterparts in other cities echo their growing concern about the connections between hiv infection and the use of recreational drugs the use of inhibitionrelaxing drugs , they say , is compounding another alarming trend noted by researchers and social workers in the aids field with new drug therapies showing remarkable success in controlling hiv before it progresses into fullblown aids , some gay men have grown disturbingly complacent about safe sex in recent years , studies have shown in a report released today , the centers for disease control and prevention said complacency caused by medical advances and improved hiv drugs were at least partly responsible for an increase in risky sexual behavior among gay men , particularly among young gay men the report said the number of gay men in san francisco who reported having unprotected anal sex increased to 39 percent in 1997 from 30 percent in 1994 those who said they had had unprotected sex with multiple partners grew to 33 percent from 24 percent , with men 25 and under accounting for the largest increase those who are using recreational drugs , typically young men in their 20 s and 30 s , often are also those most susceptible to complacency , said helene d gayle , director of the national center for hiv , std and tb prevention , an arm of the disease control agency in atlanta that age group tends to use alcohol and recreational drugs most aggressively , often to escape the stigma and confusion associated with their newly embraced homosexuality , dr gayle said because they have come of age at a time when the death and debilitation caused by aids is less visible in the united states than it once was , young gay men are also more likely to ignore warnings about the perils of unsafe sex , she said the connection between recreational drug use and hiv has been apparent for years but has often gone unaddressed because of a greater focus on the hiv risks associated with needle drugs officials with some aids groups said there had also been resistance by gay people to discussing the problem because of a fear of creating the perception that gays use drugs disproportionately it s hard to talk about things in the gay community that do n't make us look good , said mark s king , the director of education and communication at aid atlanta , this city s largest aids service organization we like being portrayed on tv as the doctor or lawyer we 're into positive role models and we do n't want to be portrayed as drug users but in recent months , the topic has gained public exposure in new york late last month , the aids service group gay men s health crisis canceled its secondlargest fundraising event , a fire island social gathering known as the morning party , in response to criticism that it encouraged illegal drug use and unsafe sex in seattle , the northwest aids foundation recently distributed 10 , 000 pamphlets explaining the links between party drugs and hiv and last week , aid atlanta kicked off an aggressive new educational campaign on the nexus between drug use and unsafe sex the group grew concerned after seeing a 50 percent increase last year in hiv tests that yielded positive results , to 27 percent of 4 , 144 tests in 1998 from 18 percent of 4 , 290 tests in 1997 while the group has no statistical proof , its leaders said anecdotal evidence suggested that much of the increase had been among young gay men and that many had become careless about sex while high on libidoenhancing drugs like ecstasy \( x \) , gamma hydroxybutyrate \( ghb \) , ketamine and crystal methamphetamine aid atlanta has produced a series of seven advertisements that will appear in gay publications and as posters in gay bars and clubs taking risks with drugs or alcohol means your sex could be risky too , one typical ad says the group kicked off its educational effort last wednesday night with a forum called buzzed a gay men s forum on party drugs , which was held in the auditorium of an atlanta high school some 70 people attended , and the discussion clearly illuminated the severity of the problem all of the questions asked by audience members concerned the pharmacology of various drugs none concerned hiv although the speakers at the forum made a point of not moralizing about drug use , they said after the event that they were disturbed by the cavalier attitudes of the questioners the crowd was thinking about what they could use to cause the least amount of damage and get the best high , said charles r dickey , an atlanta psychotherapist who served as a panelist aid atlanta does not maintain that drug use has necessarily increased among gay men but it does say the use of inhibitionrelaxing drugs is feeding the complacency generated by lower aids rates today s young folks did not grow up in the trenches of watching people die , said mr dickey , whose clientele is predominantly gay they do n't see kaposi s sarcoma they do n't see people wasting away back in the old days , when people were dropping like flies , there was real fear now people think hiv is no big deal , that it s like diabetes you take some pills and it s no problem and so what we 're seeing is that people s guards have been let down , and then the use of recreational drugs is an avenue that lowers inhibitions even more dr lee r anisman , an atlanta physician who treats a large number of gay patients , said he saw a significant correlation in his practice between substance abuse , unsafe sexual behavior and an increased prevalence of hiv because states are required to collect data on aids but not on hiv , it is unknown whether hiv is on the rise among gay men but several recent studies , including a number that have found alarming increases in cases of gonorrhea in gay men , suggest that both the prevalence of hiv and of risky sexual behavior remain high among young gay men in my travels around the country , i 've encountered a number of young gay men who are cavalier in their attitude about both recreational drug use and hiv risk , said daniel zingale , executive director of aids action , a national advocacy group we saw one generation of gay men nearly decimated , and to see a new generation complacent about it is just disheartening photo a pamphlet from a forum held by an aids service group to combat an increase in drug use

of all the triumphs that have marked this as america s century breathtaking advances in science and technology , the democratization of wealth and dispersal of political power in ways hardly imaginable in 1899 none is more inspiring , if incomplete , than our pursuit of racial justice the milestones include theodore roosevelt s inviting booker t washington to dine at the white house , harry truman s desegregating the armed forces , dwight eisenhower s using federal troops to integrate little rock s central high school and lyndon johnson s electrifying the nation by standing before congress in 1965 and declaring , we shall overcome i came by my support of that year s voting rights act naturally thirty years before selma , i was a university of michigan senior , preparing with my wolverine teammates for a football game against visiting georgia tech among the best players on that year s michigan squad was willis ward , a close friend of mine whom the southern school reputedly wanted dropped from our roster because he was black my classmates were just as adamant that he should take the field in the end , willis decided on his own not to play his sacrifice led me to question how educational administrators could capitulate to raw prejudice a university , after all , is both a preserver of tradition and a hotbed of innovation so long as books are kept open , we tell ourselves , minds can never be closed but doors , too , must be kept open tolerance , breadth of mind and appreciation for the world beyond our neighborhoods these can be learned on the football field and in the science lab as well as in the lecture hall but only if students are exposed to america in all her variety for the class of '35 , such educational opportunities were diminished by the relative scarcity of africanamericans , women and various ethnic groups on campus i have often wondered how different the world might have been in the 1940 s , 50 s and 60 s how much more humane and just if my generation had experienced a more representative sampling of the american family that the indignities visited on willis ward would be unimaginable in today s ann arbor is a measure of how far we have come toward realizing , however belatedly , the promises we made to each other in declaring our nationhood and professing our love of liberty and yet in the last speech of his life , lyndon johnson reminded us of how much unfinished work remained to be black in a white society is not to stand on level and equal ground , he said while the races may stand side by side , whites stand on history s mountain and blacks stand in history s hollow until we overcome unequal history , we cannot overcome unequal opportunity like so many phrases that have become political buzzwords , affirmative action means different things to different people practically speaking , it runs the gamut from mandatory quotas , which the supreme court has ruled are clearly unconstitutional , to mere lip service , which is just as clearly unacceptable at its core , affirmative action should try to offset past injustices by fashioning a campus population more truly reflective of modern america and our hopes for the future unfortunately , a pair of lawsuits brought against my alma mater pose a threat to such diversity not content to oppose formal quotas , plaintiffs suing the university of michigan would prohibit that and other universities from even considering race as one of many factors weighed by admission counselors so drastic a ban would scuttle michigan s current system , one that takes into account nearly a dozen elements race , economic standing , geographic origin , athletic and artistic achievement among them to create the finest educational environment for all students this eminently reasonable approach , as thoughtful as it is fair , has produced a student body with a significant minority component whose record of academic success is outstanding times of change are times of challenge it is estimated that by 2030 , 40 percent of all americans will belong to various racial minorities already the global economy requires unprecedented grasp of diverse viewpoints and cultural traditions i do n't want future college students to suffer the cultural and social impoverishment that afflicted my generation if history has taught us anything in this remarkable century , it is the notion of america as a work in progress do we really want to risk turning back the clock to an era when the willis wards were isolated and penalized for the color of their skin , their economic standing or national ancestry \? to eliminate a constitutional affirmative action policy would mock the inclusive vision carl sandburg had in mind when he wrote the republic is a dream nothing happens unless first a dream lest we forget america remains a nation with havenots as well as haves its government is obligated to provide for hope no less than for the common defense drawing \( alexander gelman \)
rain or not , the remnants of hurricane dennis continued to menace the united states open players who , unlike topseeded martina hingis , had trouble recalibrating the tools of their trade inside a virtual wind tunnel yesterday time and again , the wind treated the tennis balls like stunt kites , snatching them from the launcher and sending them on wild trajectories that tried the receiver s retrieval skills it made for ugly tennis , and uglier tempers all except for hingis , who squeezed out just 15 unforced errors in her 62 , 60 victory over anke huber to advance to the open s semifinal round for the third consecutive year in the night session , thirdseeded venus williams struck a bold figure in her backless turquoise ensemble and struck a bold ball as well in her 64 , 63 victory over 12thseeded barbara schett of austria schett , who had lost just one service game during her breakthrough rush to the open quarterfinals only to learn monday that her grandmother had died , kept her sorrow to herself and , with a little advice from hingis , pushed williams in two tight sets but three dropped service games by schett , and her inability to handle the winddriven pace of williams s serve , helped send williams into her third straight open semifinal there she 'll face hingis , who leads their rivalry by 73 some people have street smarts hingis has court smarts just ask her i would n't be the no 1 player if i would n't think a little bit on court , hingis , the open s 1997 champion , said you do n't get born with that thing some players have more and some less some hit the ball hard some do n't some are tall , she said , casting an eye toward the 6foot2inch williams , whom she beat in the final two years ago i have to use other weapons to stay at the top yesterday , hingis added a natural ingredient , the wind , to the skills her coach and mother , melanie molitor , has taught ever since hingis was an infant today i used the wind very much , and i was , you know , able to handle it better than her because she was getting frustrated , hingis said of huber , who took 10 years to get to her first open quarterfinal and had just 57 minutes to savor it in arthur ashe stadium when you 're hitting against the wind , you have to play smart , and that s what she did , said the dejected huber , whose whimsical plan to tie the knot with her beau , andrei medvedev , if they won this open had to be jettisoned once both lost she s just a smarter player than anybody else on the tour williams said she would n't be distracted by the contretemps that ensued after hingis took exception to richard williams s prediction of an allwilliams open finale and described him as a big mouth that remark prompted venus s sister serena williams to bemoan hingis s lack of formal education the sniping supposedly ended last friday when hingis autographed a shirt for the williamses' father , and last night venus williams kept her distance from the mess i really was never involved , she said , adding that she was here to win her first grand slam title , not play mind games with opponents in the men s side of the draw , tommy haas , seeded 14th , admitted to being driven to the brink of insanity by the unpredictable gusts that his unpredictable opponent , 30yearold cedric pioline , handled without flinching haas s irritability was evident in the xrated monologue , punctuated by slashes at the air with his racquet , he conducted with himself while being upended , 64 , 75 , 63 , by the 26thranked pioline after diving in vain after a windborne pass from pioline , who is happily settling into his role as old man open , an angry haas sprayed a forehand wide at break point to put himself at a twosetstonone disadvantage if you had a little mishit or you were not setting right with the ball , you 'd miss it because of the wind , the 20yearold haas said i do n't know if he was difficult , i think it was more the tough conditions , you know , with the wind i'm usually not a very calm person i go pretty crazy easy things can bother me it s very tough for me to keep quiet and calm and just play but pioline , who made open history by becoming the first man to dethrone a defending champion in the first round with his 46 , 46 , 63 , 75 , 10 ejection of a soreshouldered patrick rafter , proved unflappable against haas and the tricky weather i think i'm much better when i am with my wind because i try to mix up a little bit my game it s more comfortable for me because i have experience , pioline said after reaching the open s quarterfinal round for the first time since 1993 if i'm 30 years old and i do n't have experience , i have a problem gustavo kuerten , the amiable fifthseeded brazilian whose preopen practice serve put the fourtime champion pete sampras out of commission with a herniated disk , had his mojo working again in the round of 16 this time , another serve from the unwitting kuerten inflicted a lowerback strain on sweden s magnus norman , who cringed away from their match on the losing end of a 76 \( 74 \) default kuerten , uncomfortable about being cast as this event s grim reaper , said he could have suffered the same fate as norman everybody could see we could not play our tennis , just try to pass the ball over , run and see who is going to miss first , kuerten said norman became the seventh man to exit the open on an injury default but he refused to rise to the bait when the fourtime open champion john mcenroe , wearing his broadcast hat as usa network s expert color commentator , suggested that creatine use might be responsible for the rash of breakdowns here i think i already have enough muscles , norman said i 've never taken it i'm actually against it match points as anticipated , the united states tennis association confirmed that its president , judy levering , would make an announcement this morning regarding the future of the davis cup team levering s search for a

the american league will announce its starting allstar team tomorrow do not look for any members of tom kelly s kindergarten to be on it kelly is the dean of major league managers , and in his 13year tenure with the minnesota twins he has won a pair of world series championships but this year he is saddled with his most inexperienced team , one that has had 10 to 12 rookies on the 25man roster at any given time teams with a dozen rookies do not think about events like the allstar game or the world series they just try to survive and improve a little while they 're at it actually , kelly said , assessing his team , i believe a few of those young fellas are getting better they 're starting to show some progress and an understanding of the game so i'm happy about that there s a few who are maybe not showing the progress we would like to have seen you 'd be very naive to think they 're all going to improve that s ridiculous we 're not miracle workers kelly has so many rookies that he often fills the outfield and threefourths of the infield with them in the outfield he has chad allen , torii hunter and jacque jones in the infield he has doug mientkiewicz at first , cristian guzman at shortstop and corey koskie at third none of those names has appeared among the top 10 votegetters at any position in the allstar voting the only member of the twins who has received enough votes to make the top 10 is terry steinbach , their veteran catcher and chief babysitter nor will any of the twins' rookie pitchers be selected for the game mike lincoln , dan perkins , joe mays and benj sampson can use the threeday hiatus next week to become bigger names in their own households the twins are loaded with rookies because their owner , carl pohlad , directed the front office to lower the payroll into the teens kelly could have opted out after last season and most likely have moved to a competitive club , but he chose to remain out of loyalty to his employer and a desire to stay home probably none of the rookies should be in the big leagues , kelly said in response to a question you could probably make an argument for koskie because he played triplea last year and did well but he was n't ready to play major league baseball this year when the season started kelly and his coaches are literally providing onthejob training the indepth type stuff that we have to instruct on is something i probably felt we would n't have to do , he said as an example , he mentioned a session he planned to have with one outfielder to see if we can help him throw the baseball better more than once i 've heard some coaches comment to former players , 'come on , this is the big leagues , ' he went on but it s not the case i keep explaining to the coaches you have to instruct them like they 're in triplea or doublea you have to lower your sights a little in the educational process , kelly said , he himself has learned i found out that i 've made a few mistakes , the 48yearold minnesota native said sometimes i fall into the trap of trying to get more out of them than maybe they 're capable of giving i tried hitting and running with a fellow and he did n't hit the ball five times he s just not capable of doing it at this time maybe i 'll try again later you have to keep trying as we go along to see what they can do and ca n't do the twins , not surprisingly , have the worst record in the american league , but they are only one game behind fourthplace detroit in the clevelanddominated central division they also can point to their defense , which has committed the fewest errors in the league , and their pitchers , who are among the leaders in giving up the fewest walks the season seems to be moving along fairly quickly so it must be good , kelly said when it drags and goes slow , you feel that kind of effect so there have to be some good things going on at times how those good things translate into progress and improvement for next season could be another matter if you think the double and triplea players are going to gain enough knowledge in one year that they 're going to be set to go next year , that s foolish , the stoic manager said i do n't think that s going to be the case i'm sure there will be different things that happen in the course of a game that we 'll have to learn you ca n't have a false sense of security we 'll have to wait and see what happens , but i do n't think it will be all ice cream and cake well , at least this kind of experience builds character , right \? i do n't know about that , kelly said it builds gray hair and ulcers no , i do n't think so i think that s a bunch of baloney someone said that a long time ago and it sounded good so people repeat it reds' top 10 list by knocking the houston astros out of first place in the national league central last week , the cincinnati reds were responsible for abbreviating their own remarkable run the reds played a firstplace team in 10 consecutive games , and they won every game
east rutherford , nj during the warmup before the jets' 166 loss to the jacksonville jaguars last night , bill parcells sauntered over to talk to tom coughlin bill s big on that , coughlin said he 'll invariably have a story to tell you he 'll have something good to say about your team or about a problem he s having with his team it s usually straight talk no ulterior motive no con you can trust in bill tom coughlin does now in his fifth season as the jaguars' only coach , coughlin is a summa cum laude graduate of the parcells school of design and motivation give 'em a good design , parcells has often said , meaning a game plan , and get 'em to play hard that s what coughlin learned in three seasons as the giants' wide receivers coach under parcells from 1988 to 1990 , when he earned a super bowl xxv ring he took that knowledge to boston college as head coach for three seasons and then to the expansion jaguars , who , with a 41 start , loom as a super bowl xxxiv contender it s a familiar protegementor coaching story in the national football league don shula , bill walsh and weeb ewbank learned from paul brown dan reeves and mike ditka learned from tom landry marv levy learned from george allen and last night , coughlin the protege finally mastered parcells the mentor after three losses by 3424 to the jets in last season s american football conference division playoffs , and two in 1996 to parcells s new england patriots , including that season s afc championship game i do n't try to read bill s mind , coughlin said yesterday in a telephone interview i know his philosophy , he knows mine there s no mystery how either one of us is going to play much of coughlin s philosophy developed during those three seasons on the giants' staff after two years on the packers' staff and two on the eagles' staff i was looking for a wide receivers coach , parcells recalled i did n't know much about tom , but marion campbell , who had been his eagles coach , mentioned him to me i met him in mobile at the senior bowl i spoke to him for only 10 minutes , but i said to myself , 'i like this guy' he s irish catholic , and so am i he was at rochester , and i was at hastings we both paid our dues he just needed an opportunity now 53 , coughlin had been a young head coach at rochester institute of technology from 1970 to 1973 , just as parcells had been a young head coach at little hastings college in nebraska in 1964 the thing about bill , coughlin remembered , every fiber of his being was about winning and the entire concept of everyone being involved and understanding the big picture there was no selfishness none of the assistant coaches was ever allowed to get away with talking about 'my position this , my position that' if you made a mistake and made a comment that was not team oriented , you were going to pay for it he was going to fire away at you you always knew where you stood with bill in every circumstance you did n't need a conference at the end of the season to sit down and have bill parcells tell you what he thought about you he told you every day that was a quality i 'd never been around , and i was appreciative of that then as now , parcells , who had been the giants' defensive coordinator before succeeding ray perkins as head coach in 1983 , was thought of mainly as a defensive strategist but he 'd come into our offensive meetings with three or four ideas that sometimes i would look at him and wonder , coughlin said but in the game when we did exactly what he thought about doing , we were successful at it like everybody else on the jets now or on the giants then , staff or players , coughlin was a verbal victim of parcells his sarcasm , his sense of humor , coughlin said with a smile when he starts with you , you know it s not going to be your day he s going to start on you and he s going to go down through your players some of it was humor and some of it was to get a point across that point , of course , was how to win the game and last night , tom coughlin did photo bill parcells , left , and tom coughlin they worked together for years and know each other s moves well \( barton silverman the new york times \)
mccook , ill mike lynch would probably have stumped the panel on the old what s my line his twinkly blue eyes , impishly salty language and wellcut suits would point to harddriving real estate type , maybe , or brash young entrepreneur actually , michael w lynch has been both those things but at 39 , what he is incongruously to many , but logically in his mind is a metals man who loves playing david to corporate goliaths he burst into the public consciousness in august , when his real estate investment company , michigan avenue partners or , more accurately , its mccook metals subsidiary offered to top a bid by alcoa inc to buy reynolds metals neither reynolds management nor its shareholders paid him much mind , and reynolds has accepted alcoa s offer but anyone who thinks that is the end of mccook s bid has not met mr lynch i'm a street fighter , and if someone tells me i ca n't do something , i get an endorphin rush , mr lynch said in his rapidfire style neither reynolds shareholders nor justice department regulators , who recently asked alcoa and reynolds for more information , have passed on the merger so he has not abandoned the dragon slayer his nickname for his reynolds project his tenacity does not surprise friends and colleagues mike is very competitive , and capitalism gives him the biggest scoreboard , said scott miller , who was a chi psi fraternity brother of his at the university of wisconsin dominic forte , one of mr lynch s partners , agreed he gets an emotional charge from taking on the corporate giants , he said he s flamboyant , and he s not intimidated by anyone the oldest of seven children , mr lynch grew up with mixed messages all over the place , as he tells it money was ample , but his father kept the purse strings tight , and mr lynch had to work odd jobs in college his parents split 11 years ago , and he has not spoken with his father in eight years the only blood relative to whom he is really close is his maternal grandfather he loved my grandmother to the end he is the epitome of loyalty , he is my mentor , mr lynch said his grandfather turns 90 in february , and mr lynch is chartering a jet to treat him to a weekend trip but none of this answers the obvious question what is michael lynch , political science and economics major and real estate pro , doing in the grubby world of metals \? in one sense , it was a logical progression he gravitated naturally toward real estate , an area in which competitive instincts and a gift of gab go far after a stint as a broker for cb commercial , he and a partner formed michigan avenue partners to develop a property on that famous chicago street it was 1991 , the depth of the real estate depression , and michigan avenue picked up several plum properties at bargain prices i saw grown men cry in bankruptcy court , and i vowed i 'd never live off debt , mr lynch said he eventually bought out his partner , took on new ones and continued trawling for depressed real estate then , last year , he heard that reynolds wanted to sell its mccook works , an old aluminum plant that sprawled across 265 acres just west of chicago most prospective buyers viewed the plant in terms of its products but he saw a prime piece of real estate , ripe for an industrial park he bought it and realized almost immediately that mccook was overpaying for everything , from materials to electricity to insurance they had people negotiating contracts who should have been teaching school , he said mr lynch convinced reynolds s former suppliers to cut prices he modernized the plant and he successfully fought alcoa in court , retaining the right to use technologies alcoa had licensed to reynolds the results may give mr lynch the best of both worlds he is moving the aluminum operations onto half the site and may build an industrial park on the rest he has since bought scottsboro aluminum , great lakes metals and various other metals plants , bringing the book value of mccook s metals asset base to nearly 1 billion mike lynch is an oldtime wheelerdealer who knows how to buy cheap , cut costs , and make a whole lot of money , said lloyd t o'carroll , a metals analyst at scott stringfellow inc mr lynch is also spreading that cash around a lapsed catholic but a devout christian i believe in the bible , but the church is run by dysfunctional men , he said he has designated 2 million for a mccook charitable foundation as a little boy he dreamed of owning businesses , making millions , and using them to help others , said kimberlee lynch , his wife of seven years , who is expecting their third child , a son , later this month people say he s pompous , but he s not he s incredibly focused , and he wants to do good in this world he puts in grueling days and rarely sleeps more than five hours in august , after he became so distracted during a phone conversation that he nearly lost control of his car , he finally hired a driver the driver picks him up at 5 30 am and rarely delivers him back home until 7 30 pm still , mr lynch finds time to read the bible with his 7yearold twin daughters , to garden at his home in lake forest , the chicago suburb , and even to take some naps that practically makes him the household sluggard his wife , who never naps , gleaned her own sevenfigure income last year as a parttime insurance agent and distributor for starlight international s health food supplements many of which mr lynch takes at her behest he chills and winds down at home , she said when he s here , he s really all here photo michael w lynch , the chairman of mccook metals , with rolled metal products at the company s plant , a former reynolds aluminum mill in mccook , ill , just west of chicago \( steve kagan for the new york times \)

denver , april 30 gathering here for their annual convention just a day after littleton finished burying its slain children , officials of the national rifle association today rejected any suggestion that the gun lobby was responsible for the shooting rampage that left 15 people dead , and insisted that they would stand fast against any new gun control in interviews and in remarks prepared for the convention , the officials said that no additional laws could have prevented the shootings , that prosecutors needed to enforce existing laws and that as long as 18yearolds could be sent to war , they should be allowed to have firearms at home the convention has already been scaled back from three days to saturday only , in sympathy with littleton , just 10 miles away in fact , there will be only a business session no celebrations or gun displays and the leaders expect it to last no more than two hours or so some high school students planned to join a demonstration on saturday morning against the nra short term , we want to show the nra that we are not going to be receptive , said ben gelt , 18 , a denver high school senior who has distributed leaflets to about 20 area high schools for the protest but the nra , in the cross hairs once again , as after earlier mass shootings , is determined to go forward with what remains of the convention , even as the mayor of denver , wellington webb , and others call on the group to scrap it altogether and hundreds of protesters plan to demonstrate against it on saturday we 're not peddling heroin , the actor charlton heston , president of the association , said in an interview in remarks prepared for the meeting , he said that the gun lobby was often unfairly cast as the villain after shootings and that any new controls would be a slippery slope toward losing the right to bear arms our mission is to remain a steady beacon of strength and support for the second amendment , even if it has no other friend on the planet , he said we cannot let tragedy lay waste to the most rare and hardwon human right in history in interviews today , mr heston and other nra officials rejected calls for them to stay away , saying they were part of every community workers , teachers , parents and lawenforcement officers are all members of the rifle association every community in america is our home , mr heston said james jay baker , the association s chief legislative lobbyist , added , we 're not going to be chased out of any venue wayne lapierre , the executive vice president , said the association was proud of upholding the freedom of americans to own firearms mr lapierre added that the nation needed to focus on prosecuting lawbreakers he said that 6 , 000 students were found to have brought weapons to school in 1997 and 1998 and that only 13 were prosecuted he said that the young gunmen in littleton had violated at least 20 laws already enacted and that one or two more statutes would not have prevented the killing spree gun control advocates say the association s stance is disingenuous , since it is calling for more law enforcement on one hand while fighting current restrictions on gun owners , particularly through state legislatures , on the other josh sugarmann , executive director of the violence policy center in washington , said that he agreed current laws needed to be enforced but that they did not adequately deal with the problem the bulk of laws on the books try to address possession or pointofretail sales , mr sugarmann said few deal with the manufacture or distribution , and that s the big problem mr sugarmann agreed with nra officials that most of the guncontrol measures proposed this week by president clinton would probably have little effect on the real world of gun violence , although he supports one such proposal to require background checks , currently mandated on gun buyers at federally licensed dealers , on those who buy at gun shows as well mr lapierre , in remarks prepared for delivery on saturday , said the rifle association too would consider support for checks at gun shows , if congress rather than the purchaser paid the cost the president s proposals also include limiting handgun purchases to one a month per person and raising the legal age for handgun possession to 21 from 18 , both of which the rifle association officials said they opposed mr baker , the association s legislative lobbyist , said that limiting purchases to one a month could lead to none a month of raising the legal age for possession , he said if you can be sent to kosovo and serve in our armed forces , we certainly think you ought to have the right to have a firearm mr lapierre said the rifle association was backing its own package of legislative proposals , which , he said , were more comprehensive and promised greater effectiveness than the president s they include a zerotolerance policy on guns in schools violators would be expelled and an increase in penalties for people who transfer guns to minors mr lapierre said he supported the president s proposal for a lifetime gunownership ban for any juvenile convicted of a violent crime the nra has canceled the public part of its longplanned convention here in gunfriendly colorado , where before the littleton shootings gov bill owens , a republican , had said he looked forward to 20 , 000 cashcarrying conventioneers \( the governor has had nothing to say about the convention since the killings \) the nra will not hold the exhibition of new weapons that is usually a staple of its annual meeting but it is sticking with the business portion the association s leaders said they expected more than 500 members to show up photo charlton heston , president of the national rifle association , in an interview at a colorado

chris antley , riding afternoon and night at two tracks , once won nine races in a single day in 1991 , he guided strike the gold to victory in the kentucky derby and he was a savvy enough player of the stock market that he turned the 6 million he had earned riding race horses into a fortune big enough to insure that he would not have to work again but none of that mattered 17 months ago antley , 32 , was back in an alcohol and drug rehabilitation clinic worse , his body was as wrecked as his psyche , crumpled from years of trying to shrink himself into a saddle fitted for a 117pounder there had been too many mornings of throwing up his day s one meal , ingesting laxatives , wilting in a sauna the stay in the clinic , scheduled for 18 days , lasted four months antley said he found himself more comfortable among recovering addicts than pretending he was not one around his fellow jockeys when he got out in april 1998 , he still was not ready to ride instead , he returned home to his parents in south carolina and hid out in a bedroom filled with newspaper clippings of his accomplishments as a rider directionless and overwhelmed by selfdoubt , antley s highlight of the day was making the morning coffee i thought nobody would like me , said antley , whose weight rose to 147 pounds i thought everybody hated me i got big old fat cheeks i wore extra large tshirts fixing dinner was a huge task i was crying inside , he said but two weeks ago , only months removed from his most despairing moments , antley rode a 311 long shot named charismatic to his second kentucky derby crown this time , he wept right there in the winner s circle i had dug deep into the depths of my soul and faced down some monsters , antley said later antley is far from the first jockey to inhabit the dark world of substance abuse in fact , in today s preakness , antley will race against two hall of fame jockeys , jerry bailey and pat day , who have battled alcohol or drug problems of course , every tale of addiction is shaped by its own particulars , and there is no evidence to suggest race riding is disproportionately rife with substance abuse but for jockeys , the struggles with addiction are often very public and frequently driven by aspects of their unforgiving work addiction afflicts young riders who suddenly make big money in a grueling yearround sport it hits jockeys who are forced to be obsessive about their weight , men often struggling with lifelong concerns about being undersized it grows out of a need to numb oneself after another day of courting catastrophic injury and it can be a costly consequence for jockeys working in an industry with a reputation for hard living in the past five years , state racing commissions around the country have investigated and taken action against at least 160 jockeys for alcohol or drug abuse there are roughly 900 licensed jockeys in the united states , although not all of them are active at any given time bailey and day count themselves fortunate not to have permanently harmed themselves or their livelihoods with their addictions but patrick valenzuela was not so lucky valenzuela , whose mounts earned 95 million in purses , including the 1989 kentucky derby , is broke at the age of 36 and has not ridden in two years drugs and alcohol are the reasons you leave the nest pretty early and begin to fly pretty quick , day said of the life of a jockey we 're competitive people , maybe because we 've always been small and the brunt of jokes coming up there s a macho element , too , where we do n't talk about problems and our addictions long before bailey and day became famous bailey is third and day sixth in 1999 earnings they were awkward kids alone at small tracks day was a harddrinking teenage bull rider from colorado bailey was 17 when he left el paso to become a jockey the closest he had been to athletic fame before was being manager for his high school s football and basketball teams suddenly , both day and bailey were winning races both had money both had a lot of time at night and spent it drinking away maybe it was because i did n't have that education or family foundation , bailey said , but instead of facing everyday life , i chose to numb it with alcohol antley , a high school dropout , left his native south carolina as a boy to find his talent he began galloping horses at delaware park , and by age 19 was the leading rider in new jersey he moved on to new york , and on oct 31 , 1987 , he won four races in the afternoon at aqueduct and five more that night at the meadowlands but in 1988 , he tested positive for marijuana and cocaine and soon surrendered his racing license antley got his license back a year later , and won his first derby with strike the gold but he remained troubled he weighed well beyond the necessary 114to117pound range , and so he flipped , or stuck a finger down his throat to induce vomiting he ate laxatives and sat in the sauna for an hour he even used lasix a diuretic that is often used on horses to reduce internal bleeding
melvin mora s mother first saw the boy telling his sad story on venezuelan television the boy said he could not locate his parents following the massive mudslides and then said that he was related to mora he asked for the mets' outfielder to rescue him i have to go and see him and see if he is family , mora said yesterday from maracaibo , venezuela , in a conference call arranged by the mets if he is , i will adopt him , mora said , speaking in english later , in the conference call , answering questions from spanishspeaking reporters , he said that it did not matter if the boy was related , stating , i'm taking him in for december mora s venezuelan teammates edgardo alfonzo , who was also in the country yesterday , and roger cedeno , who was in florida , participated in the conference call with him none of the three mets or their immediate families were affected by the mudslides even though mora had never met the boy and did not know his name , his mother , felipe , told him that she believes the boy is their cousin because he is originally from the same town where mora s family once lived mora said he planned to travel the eight hours from maracaibo , where the 27yearold met played in a venezuelan winter league game last night , back to his current home in valencia , where the boy was apparently waiting after leaving the ravished town of la guaira on the coast i'm scared , mora said i 've never seen that before everything over there smells like people died , he said of reports from the coastal area where the mudslides hit last week , resulting in major casualties it smells real bad i'm scared' the crisis has caused people in venezuela and outside the country to seek ways to offer assistance the mets have become involved in this relief effort through the players and have already donated 10 , 000 alfonzo spent yesterday delivering water , diapers and other supplies to firehouses and sports complexes that were serving as relief centers in miranda mora has been doing the same in the morning and playing baseball at night while cedeno , who is staying in florida , journeyed from his home in sarasota to miami last weekend to help load boxes of supplies for shipment to venezuela it s really , really bad , said alfonzo it breaks your heart mora has been enjoying a stellar season with magallanes , hitting 306 with 4 homers and 13 runs batted in going into last night s game peter greenberg , mora s agent , said he was primarily playing right field , which was requested by the mets because he could contend for a starting spot there next season greenberg said mora was reluctant to return to playing so soon after the devastation alfonzo said the country is in mourning and that the league should have canceled its schedule for a longer period than it did other than alfonzo , mora might be the most popular player in venezuela because he plays winter ball every year greenberg watched him hit a critical threerun homer in a game this month and then watched as fans mobbed him outside the clubhouse , chanting melvin ! melvin ! but like thousands of other venezuelans , mora is dealing with his emotions after the mudslides melvin sounded down before this happened , but i 'd ask him if he was ok and he told me it was because he s tired , greenberg said now you can really hear it in his voice he s very sad about this everyone is
dulles , va over the last year , the walls of america online s rapidly expanding headquarters here have been dotted with plaques declaring the company s mission to build a global medium as central to people s lives as the telephone or television and even more valuable but wait are n't telephones everywhere \? and do n't americans watch seven hours of tv each day \? how can stephen m case , chairman of america online , dare to think that his company which just a few years ago lurched from one crisis to the next and was largely a chat service for lonely teenagers belongs in the same league \? the answer is that america online , confounding the skeptics , has emerged over the last two years as the biggest , most powerful company on the internet indeed , an astounding 39 percent of americans' time on line is spent using services the company controls , 10 times the share of its nearest competitor , microsoft aol expects to hit 5 billion in sales this year , more than the next 20 internet companies combined and roughly the revenues of nbc its market value of 125 billion is bigger than that of any other media concern in the world so now mr case , who has been talking for years about taking on television , has a plan to realize the ambitions of his most audacious rhetoric for aol to leap off the computer and be everywhere , all the time the plan has these parts the company will try to roughly double the number of subscribers , now 17 million , to its flagship america online service over the next five years or so and it will aim to add several times as many users overseas and through its other brands , like compuserve , icq and netscape it will develop new services to lure users to stay on line as long as three hours a day the current average is 55 minutes and , in the process , make advertising revenues as important to the company as subscriber fees and it will set out to subsume all other media by delivering its service on television screens , cellular telephones and myriad other devices , in addition to computers our goal is to establish aol as a more important part of tens of millions of people s everyday life , mr case said a few weeks ago , nibbling jelly beans in his office and to do that , we have to move beyond the pc in the den if america online performs as planned , fending off media giants and the rapidly growing army of wellfinanced internet startups , mr case may be able to fulfill yet another ambition for aol to be the most valuable company in the world that would mean achieving a market value surpassing that of its longtime rival , microsoft , now worth some 470 billion , or almost four times aol s current value outlandish \? that depends on how you look at it america online s estimated 378 million in earnings for 1999 is barely 6 percent of microsoft s , so by traditional measures the company has a long way to go but for an internet stock , it remains cheap after a 300 percent runup over the last year , the stock is selling for about 31 times revenue , far less than the comparable 150 for yahoo aol closed friday at 11525 a share overtaking microsoft is an especially fitting goal , because much of mr case s plan resembles the playbook of none other than bill gates , microsoft s chairman just as microsoft has come to dominate the operating systems for personal computers , aol , microsoft and many other companies are fighting to control a new and crucial form of operating system , in essence for daily life as people wire their families , their finances , their jobs even their household appliances into one vast network , whoever ties it all together will have much say in how the electronic future unfolds , and possibly capture much of the profit windows is the past , mr case says flatly in the future , aol is the next microsoft also like microsoft , aol has adopted a fast follower strategy it can afford to invest in the sort of longterm projects that smaller companies cannot but to avoid becoming too bureaucratic and introverted , it hopes to buy some of the most creative startups indeed , its 42 billion acquisition of netscape communications last year was meant to inject silicon valley culture into aol and to create a home base from which to acquire more west coast startups , which might balk at moving to virginia america online has a grand vision and a size that lets them achieve it like no one else , said edward a bennett , the former head of prodigy , whose online service aol vanquished because they have so many customers , they can sell more products and services to them and they get the pick of the content and services because everyone else out there who is smaller comes to them for exposure to their audience microsoft certainly is n't ceding any ground it is spending billions of dollars to insure that windows is widely used in internetlinked devices ranging from cable television boxes to cellular phones and a big part of its antitrust fight with the government is over its desire to funnel windows users to its internet browser and the services that flow from it
vallejo , calif , aug 31 with summer slipping away , 16yearold dhar basra was losing his chance to get his fill of hairraising excitement on the day he and five friends made it here to six flags marine world , two of the amusement park s three roller coasters were closed for repairs , including the nownotorious boomerang , which jerked to a halt last week , leaving passengers hanging 70 feet in the air in 100degree heat for up to four hours dhar and his buddies had to be content to find their thrills on kong , a ride with enough corkscrews and plunges to have them coming back for more in fact , more people were waiting for kong than for any other ride here , suggesting that a recent spate of deadly accidents on amusement park rides has yet to deter the coaster faithful accidents \? they do n't worry me , dhar said with a shrug i do n't even think of them such words are no doubt music to the ears of operators of the nation s amusement parks six deaths on rides , four of them in the last two weeks , and a host of mishaps like the one on the boomerang are raising new questions about the safety of amusement rides as amusement parks are becoming more popular , and bigger , taller , faster coasters are built \( 59 opened in the nation this year alone \) , are they becoming more dangerous \? are ride operators not getting the training they need \? are riders taking more foolish risks and causing their own injuries \? are parks not maintaining their rides properly \? or are the deaths and accidents this year an unfortunate coincidence \? no one knows for sure there is no federal oversight of amusement parks 40 states have their own safety regulations , the others have none but as the industry grows , an increasing number of critics are calling for stricter , more uniform regulations there is a problem here , said ann brown , chairwoman of the united states consumer product safety commission , which compiles the data on amusement park accidents but , since congress amended regulations in 1981 , has no authority to investigate them the labor day holiday , the last hurrah of the summer , traditionally brings more visitors to the nation s 750 amusement and theme parks than any other weekend of the year besides memorial day , so a panicked industry is rushing to defend itself citing federal statistics , amusement park officials say the deaths this year are indeed a horrible coincidence a statistical anomaly in an industry that serves nearly 300 million visitors , up from 250 million eight years ago since parkgoers take roughly 900 million rides a year , and permanent parks \( as opposed to the mobile , carnivaltype \) average two deaths per year , industry officials say , riding a coaster is safer than driving to the park while the accidents this year are terrible , it s important to keep them in perspective , said joel cliff , a spokesman for the international association of amusement parks and attractions , based in alexandria , va even as park attendance has mushroomed , the average number of people killed in parks each year over the last 20 years has remained the same , he said , adding that there were 100 fewer accidents in 1998 than the year before and of the 4 , 500 injuries on rides last year , he said , citing federal statistics , only 36 required hospitalization the recent deaths at parks all over the country offer no clear pattern a woman and her 8yearold daughter were killed last saturday on the wild wonder coaster in ocean city , nj , when both the hook and chain towing their car to the top and the safety device designed to hold the car in traction failed , plunging the passengers backward before hurling them to their deaths on aug 22 , a disabled 12yearold boy at paramount s great america in santa clara , calif , plunged about 100 feet to his death on the drop zone , a ride that lifts fourperson cars 200 feet into the air and drops them at 62 miles an hour park inspectors said a preliminary investigation found no mechanical failure on the ride , though the police are still investigating the drop zone and three similar rides in other paramount parks have been closed the shockwave , a standup coaster at another paramount park , kings dominion in virginia , has reopened after a 20yearold college student fell to his death on aug 23 \( a paramount spokeswoman said that the two deaths were an unfortunate coincidence and that the company , with five theme parks in this country and canada , had just five fatal accidents in the parks' 27year history \) park officials said the passenger on the shockwave had deliberately wriggled free of his safety harness most recently , across the nation s northern border , a swing ride at an amusement park in toronto collapsed in midair on wednesday , sending 14 children to hospitals with neck and back injuries mr cliff of the amusement parks association said analyses of accidents had shown that rider misconduct was responsible for 65 percent to 85 percent of all accidents that can range from not paying attention to ride signage that says you should n't go on a ride if you 're pregnant or have certain conditions , to not paying attention to verbal commands , especially not keeping hands or arms inside , to just plain common sense , mr cliff said while ride operators should do everything they can to make sure patrons have a safe , enjoyable ride , he said , there s only so much you can do with a human being critics say the industry s statistics are selfserving and unprovable , because in many states , injury reports are confidential we just do n't know , said ms brown of the consumer product safety commission , who would like her agency to regain its regulatory control over permanent amusement parks , much the way it regulates and inspects carnivalstyle portable amusement rides nonfatal accidents at amusement parks have increased in the last five years , according to statistics compiled by the safety commission a report shows a jump to 4 , 300 injuries in 1996 from 2 , 800 in 1995 but mr cliff of the amusement park association said the increase reflected a different method of compiling and analyzing accident data california has the highest rate of rideaccident deaths in the country , with 15 in the last 25 years , and the largest number of roller coasters 48 while the number of deaths is relatively small , industry critics say there is no way to examine california s accidents because the state has no regulations for the industry tom torlakson , a state assemblyman , introduced a bill in january that would regulate inspections , accident reports and training records by state inspectors the bill has been vigorously opposed by industry lobbyists despite the recent deaths , thrillsandchills seekers seem undaunted amusement park officials say that they are still on track to improve attendance over last year patrons interviewed at six flags marine world , as in other parks , said they would continue to go on their favorite rides sheryl miles of sacramento chalked the accidents up to bad luck and while she never goes on rides , her husband and 13yearold daughter were not concerned , she said the rides are probably safer now than ever , she said , with all the scrutiny they 're getting throughout the afternoon , work crews walked up and down the tracks of the boomerang , inspecting and changing parts to prepare the coaster to reopen by the big labor day weekend parkgoers stopped and stared and pointed , but the most popular question they asked a security worker posted at the entrance was when will it open \? photos almost a week after the boomerang malfunctioned at the six flags park , inspectors for the park examined part of the rollercoaster ride on tuesday a host of

frankfurt , nov 9 it is almost impossible to walk into an office in europe and not bump into desktop computers that run windows 95 and other microsoft programs like word and excel so it was hardly surprising that the scathing appraisal issued in the microsoft case by judge thomas penfield jackson last friday has been frontpage news across the continent bill gates has had it now , die tageszeitung , an irreverent leftofcenter paper in berlin , said the conservative die welt predicted that the giant will pull its head out of the noose european competitiveness officials have not been shy about challenging microsoft five years ago , they cooperated with american regulatory authorities in an antitrust investigation the company settled by changing contracts with personal computer producers and eliminating some restrictions on software makers in addition , the competitiveness office of the european commission , the european union s executive arm , is investigating at least two formal antitrust complaints against microsoft , one from a personal computer manufacturer and the other from a software maker , a spokesman , michael tscherny , said he would not identify either company but said their complaints concerned microsoft s operating systems for personal computers and for the larger machines called servers over the last year , europe s competition officials , who are based in brussels , have deferred to american prosecutors pursuing their antitrust case against microsoft the europeans hoped to avoid a long and expensive investigation of their own referring to judge jackson s finding of fact , mr tscherny said on monday that officials would study the judgment and carefully monitor how the case was finally resolved such a strategy makes sense because microsoft might be expected in europe to duplicate any changes in its policies or structure that were imposed or negotiated in the united states the europeans have been aggressive about challenging other american companies karel van miert , who recently stepped down as head of the competition directorate , forced the boeing company to abandon some of its longterm contracts with airlines before he signed off on boeing s acquisition of mcdonnell douglas though both aerospace companies were american , they needed european approval to do business here but in that case , american antitrust officials took a much more benign view of boeing s practices than the europeans did european officials were concerned with protecting boeing s big continental rival , airbus industrie by contrast , microsoft s most prominent critics are united states companies like america online and sun microsystems , with european software companies largely on the sidelines that could change if microsoft and the justice department settle the antitrust charges with measures the european authorities consider too mild , the competitiveness agency could initiate its own proceedings based on evidence that has come up in american court proceedings the european regulators , though , are already straining under other pressures they oversee hundreds of routine merger approvals a year and mount dozens of more intensive investigations these officials have also acted against alliances in european digital television , charged car makers with trying to hinder crossborder transactions and recently opened an investigation into the pricing of internet access services by european telephone companies given all that , the competitiveness authorities in brussels have generally chosen to steer clear of questions involving microsoft but microsoft has hardly avoided europe as it has in the united states , the software giant has been looking for deals with european cable television operators and mobile phone companies that are rolling out wireless internet services microsoft reached an agreement to acquire 297 percent of telewest , the british cable tv operator , from mediaone it has also held discussions with bertelsmann and deutsche bank , both of which have been interested in buying cable television systems from deutsche telekom none of that is expected to be much affected by the outcome of microsoft s court battle in washington with the justice department
joe adams and his crew of art handlers at the guggenheim museum were standing in front of a crated giacometti sculpture called the chariot mr adams carried a clipboard and wore a pair of blue latex gloves like a surgeon about to perform a delicate operation , he approached the open crate , which with its pockets and padding resembled a piece of sculpture itself , and tenderly touched the giacometti then he turned to consult the curator , who had planned the exhibition , and the registrar , who had tracked the shipment of the sculpture from texas a dance began , meticulously choreographed first , a series of measurements , a positioning of bodies juxtaposed against other bodies , and , finally , a mimed rehearsal of the dance after 20 minutes or so , the giacometti was nearly out of the crate four handlers were lifting it by the chariot wheels they were all looking up at the body so spindly , a shadow one , two , three , they said , then held their breath for a minute or so , the chariot was in the air as the handlers moved it laterally to a pedestal one , two , three , and it was down they stood back , exhaled , and examined their work they had done well the sculpture was solidly placed and did not need to be shifted art handlers they go by many titles are the unsung workers who keep objects of art moving through the everchanging displays in new york city s museums , art galleries and private collections some are union members who work full time , starting anywhere from 25 , 000 to 40 , 000 a year , but most are freelance workers , earning 20 to 25 an hour their tools are rope , twine , ladders , wood , hammers , foam and electronic lifts they must be comfortable working at heights and talking with artists about their visions like many occupations that demand physical labor , art handling is still mostly a man s world , and with a few exceptions , the handlers are artists themselves , who feel privileged to touch great works that have inspired their careers mr adams , who has worked for the guggenheim since 1986 , first as a freelancer , now fulltime his official title is assistant manager , art services and preparations began his creative life as a sculptor when he finished art school in new orleans and came to new york , he asked some friends what he could do to survive as a novice artist art handling is a wordofmouth business , and positions are rarely advertised one of mr adams s friends told him about an opening at the mark rothko foundation he went for an interview and , because someone had vouched for him , he got the job though resumes and interviews are important , such a recommendation is taken extremely seriously security is tight everywhere at the metropolitan museum , the handlers , called technicians , are not permitted to give interviews i was terrified my first day , mr adams remembered here i was handling these unbelievably valuable paintings what if i dropped one \? but he never did unless a piece has an inherent flaw , those in the business say art is rarely damaged by handlers , whose mindfulness on the job is reminiscent of zen practitioners they move deliberately , thinking before each action there may be moments when there is a lack of attention , said joshua rosenblatt , a senior art handler at the whitney museum but then you click back a close call is ok it s when you are past close that there s a problem you 're threading a needle all day that s the way it is done mr adams , who now hires handlers himself at the guggenheim , said he knows just what to look for first there is the recommendation , then other criteria , he said i observe their coordination , their body language i try to assess temperament , which must be phlegmatic , and the level of ego handlers are collaborators they have to work in a corps , not singly , which is different from their solo endeavor as an artist , mr adams added a sense of humor helps and then , of course , there s the sensitivity to the artist s work and a knowledge about the work and there s more much of contemporary art requires onsite construction by handlers called fabrication in collaboration with the artist the installation coordinator for the new museum of contemporary art , tom brumley , said that the museum s founder , marcia tucker , wanted a place dedicated to living artists so his job requires working closely with experimental artists mr brumley , an artist himself , is comfortable with that his own work is constructed on site , often outdoors , with found objects and audio tracks sefa saglam , an assistant registrar at the small museum , on lower broadway in soho , is also involved in handling art everybody is working toward the success of the artwork , she said i feel satisfied when i know i have added to the work s completion although no handler s name ever appears on the credits in museum or gallery brochures , press handouts and identifying tags , handlers do not seem to mind ultimately , their own work remains the focal point of their creative energy and any interest they have in gaining recognition many have had their own shows only about 1 to 10 percent of the handlers in new york s museums are women , a fact that those who hire handlers acknowledge with regret like the men , the women who do the work need to be strong , smart and sensitive , and they , too

with them you do have to watch out for some of the guys , their attitudes , he said it s very important that none of that goes on i 've had to step in in such a demanding job , the most important attribute is caution , the handlers say they see themselves as stewards who must protect the beautiful and valuable objects in their care , many of them centuries old as an opening day approaches , the pressure can be extreme but as gilbert robinson , who has worked at the modern museum for 39 years , graduating from janitor to senior preparator , sees it , we have no problems here , only challenges one of few handlers who is not an artist himself , mr robinson is a collector of sculpture and photography being in the presence of great art day after day has moved him deeply , he said we just received 12 large crates of photographs , he said they 're all boxed up , have no meaning , just boxed then you begin to unravel them , put them up in their prospective places it s marvelous what can happen out of a little box i call it my little theater reverence for the works of art they are privileged to touch is a given , the handlers say i feel honored in some regards , said larry barns ,

washington , jan 22 in defending president clinton , his lawyers portrayed the case against him as one cobbled together from events that were often trivial and open to varying interpretations above all , they argued that the charges fell below the constitutional standard for removing him from office while not defending mr clinton s personal behavior , the lawyers repeatedly reminded senators that they were being asked to overturn an election on what the lawyers contended were flawed conclusions and disputed facts it was a staggering thought , gregory b craig said , that a president could be turned out of office over such ambiguous issues as the number of times he engaged intimate relations with monica s lewinsky the house managers cited as perjury the discrepancy between mr clinton s statement that he had inappropriate contact with ms lewinsky on several occasions and her testimony that there were 11 sexual encounters the president s lawyers argued that the case for removal was wrong in three fundamental ways the conclusions that the house managers drew from the facts were wrong , the accusations did not meet the legal requirements to prove the charges of perjury or obstruction of justice , and none of the accusations rose to the high level of wrongdoing needed to overturn an election the perjury charge silly , ' 'frivolous' math in arguing that the president did not commit perjury before the grand jury , mr craig derided many of the house managers' accusations as meaningless and trivial in one instance , the managers asserted that mr clinton had committed perjury with his statement that he and ms lewinsky had engaged in sexual talk on the telephone on occasion while she testified it had occurred 17 times any dispute over this immaterial issue is silly , mr craig said another example involves the prepared statement mr clinton read to the grand jury on aug 17 in which he acknowledged intimate conduct , saying i regret that what began as a friendship came to include this conduct the house managers told the senate that such a statement amounted to perjury because ms lewinsky has testified that their relationship began with flirting , including ms lewinsky showing the president her underwear , and not as a friendship that , mr craig said , was fundamentally frivolous an issue that the white house lawyers did not portray as trivial was whether mr clinton lied when he told the grand jury that he had not engaged in sexual relations with ms lewinsky , as the term was defined in his deposition in the paula jones sexual misconduct lawsuit at the heart of this issue is the conflicting testimony about the explicit details of the intimate acts between ms lewinsky and the president without being specific , mr clinton essentially portrayed the relationship to the grand jury as one in which she stimulated him sexually but he did not reciprocate ms lewinsky has testified that the president touched her intimately on several occasions the true nub of the managers' allegation that the president committed perjury is that he described some of the contact one way and she described it another , mr craig said the president s defenders told the senate that such a discrepancy could not amount to perjury because courts have ruled that perjury cannot be based simply on two differing sworn accounts representative ed bryant of tennessee , one of the 13 house managers , or prosecutors , emphasized today that ms lewinsky had told her version of the intimate contact to as many as 10 people at the time it occurred , the kind of testimony that lends weight to one side in a swearing contest he also cited as corroboration white house logs and secret service testimony the president s lawyers also complained strongly that the perjury case was unfair because it included statements made by the president in the jones deposition on jan 17 , even though the house voted down an impeachment article specifically accusing the president of lying at the deposition the house managers' claim that the deposition testimony may be included rests solely on one statement mr clinton made in his grand jury appearance that he had tried to testify truthfully in the jones deposition six months earlier in that deposition , the managers noted , mr clinton said that he could not remember if he had ever been alone with ms lewinsky or had exchanged gifts with her the white house argued that the effort to bootstrap the deposition testimony was improper and that , moreover , mr clinton told the grand jury that he was alone with ms lewinsky and did exchange gifts with her the house managers also charged that mr clinton had committed perjury when he stood silent at the jones deposition as his lawyer , robert s bennett , declared there was no sex between the president and ms lewinsky when asked in the grand jury appearance if mr bennett s statement that there is no sex of any kind was flatly untrue , mr clinton began his answer with the widely criticized phrase , it depends what the meaning of 'is' is the president s lawyers have offered two defenses in rebuttal first , they argue that mr clinton did not speak up because he was not paying close attention to mr bennett at the time
princeton it has a brilliant international faculty , but no students its researchers have made some of the most significant scientific discoveries of the 20th century , but it has never had a laboratory to many academics , it is , in the words of jack matlock , a former ambassador to the soviet union , the closest thing you can find to a paradiseonearth , but to almost everyone else it is a mystery hidden on a wooded square mile in central new jersey the institute for advanced study , a private community of scholars devoted to theoretical inquiry in mathematics , natural sciences , social science and history , may be the most elite academic institution in the world since its founding in 1930 , the institute as the initiated call it has been home to a remarkable number of worldclass thinkers , the most famous of whom is everyone s stereotype of absentminded , wildhaired genius albert einstein a jewish refugee from nazi germany , einstein worked there on fundamental problems in physics from 1933 until his death in 1955 over the years , others who have passed through its halls include kurt godel , perhaps the greatest mathematical logician of the century john von neumann , widely credited with inventing the computer and game theory j robert oppenheimer , the institute s longestserving director who was the lead architect of the atomic bomb george f kennan , a primary author of america s cold war policy of containment and an ambassador to moscow and edward witten , a mathematical physicist and the subject of a recent manchester guardian article whose headline asked , is this the cleverest man in the world \? not surprisingly , the institute seems to exist largely beyond public consciousness few residents around here have ever even visited the eclectic collection of buildings set on 800 acres of woods and fields equidistant to two rival symbols of the modern princeton the commercial behemoths of route 1 and the gothic towers of princeton university , which is often mistaken as an affiliated institution the institute s buildings range from the nostalgic colonial revival of fuld hall , where einstein had his notoriously cluttered office , to the fashionable postmodernism of wolfensohn hall and the mathematics building a passerby on olden lane might easily mistake the campus for one of the several private schools in the area were it not for the solitude and the distinct absence of jeansclad students it s located right on the edge of town , but people who have lived in princeton for their whole life often ca n't tell you where the institute is or how to get there , according to ed regis , who wrote who got einstein s office \? eccentricity and genius at the institute for advanced study \( addisonwesley , 1987 \) , the only booklength study of the institute if few princetonians can say where the institute is situated , fewer still can actually define it 'think tank , ' which implies scholars for hire , is wrong , according to dr phillip a griffiths , a mathematician who since 1991 has been the institute s director perhaps the best short definition has been put forward by vartan gregorian , a trustee of the institute and currently the president of the carnegie corporation he calls it the university to universities in coining the phrase , dr gregorian said in a recent telephone interview that he wanted to convey the idea that many academics come to the institute to develop their scholarly skills and to do their most intense research before returning to teaching so despite the lack of students , he said , the institute provides a postgraduate education to people already committed to a career in scholarship and research a hallmark of the institute , dr griffiths said , is freedom freedom to work on research and scholarly projects of one s own design and freedom from such demands on one s time as teaching , attending meetings , serving on committees or consulting there is also the freedom from financial worries since the researchers and scholars are paid well enough to live comfortably in princeton , the majority of them in the institute s own housing complex conditions for scholars are as close to ideal as you can get , frank e taplin , a longtime benefactor and former trustee , said in a recent interview not everyone agrees with mr taplin , however the british historian arnold toynbee , even though he worked at the institute on five occasions in the 1940 s and 50 s , feared that detachment from the everyday world might lead to scholarship that was sterile and in 1996 , derek bok , president emeritus of harvard university , wrote in the new york times book review that the idea that genius needs added resources to escape worldly distractions \( such as teaching students \) is a beguiling notion warmly endorsed by those most likely to benefit from it he went on in his review of narcissism and philanthropy , an evaluation of foundations by gerald freund the most ambitious attempt to put the theory into practice is the institute for advanced study in princeton , but no one has demonstrated that those fortunate few who are elevated to the institute produce more or better work than before they arrived
pretoria , south africa we are battling with the problem of too much spending on the wages and salaries of public employees , president thabo mbeki said it takes 90 percent of our health budget , for example , leaving 10 percent for drugs , building hospitals and so on we ca n't go on like that he was explaining , in an interview , why his government had taken a step that the sunday times of south africa said represented a watershed moment in our political life the government said no to a wage claim by teachers , firefighters and other public employees then it withdrew from negotiations and unilaterally imposed a smaller wage increase the striking quality of that decision was that it came from a government of the historically leftwing african national congress , one that includes members of the communist party and is formally allied to the labor union federation the government gave the unions only 1 percent less than they were asking a 6 percent raise instead of 7 but the symbol was powerful when the national party won power , in 1948 , it set out to uplift poor whites especially afrikaners by giving them civil service jobs by 1991 a third of all employed whites had jobs with the state or state corporations the bureaucracy , still heavily white , is notoriously overmanned and inefficient we underestimated the problem , president mbeki said we had a program of voluntary severance , to downsize public employment but it failed because we did not count on the need to add to the public service when you say you have to bring clean water to the rural areas , you find that the only thing the civil servants know how to do is to sit in an office you have to bring in new people to lay the pipes ! \( since 1994 the government has brought clean water to 25 million rural people , one of its premier accomplishments \) the unions reacted angrily to the government s decision , holding oneday strikes and threatening more they foresaw that the government s next steps would be to lay off public employees and tie wage increases to performance none of this should come as a great surprise to those who knew thabo mbeki in his exile years , when he was the anc s chief diplomat he always was a realist , with a powerful intellect inside the anc , he questioned the idea that the apartheid system had to be overthrown by military force in 198889 , despite severe criticism by anc colleagues , he met with afrikaner intellectuals and south african business leaders , allaying their fears about the anc after president f w de klerk released nelson mandela and others in 1990 , mr mbeki persuaded an anc conference to suspend armed struggle and go for negotiations his stand on public employee pay is not unionbusting but a decision on where priorities lie in spending on education , encouraging investment to create jobs and changing the country s gross inequalities of wealth as you can see , he said in an interview last week in the presidential residence , racial separation is in the past but in socioeconomic terms the divisions remain we 've got to build a nonracial society that means everything economics , education , the creation of nonracial towns the legacy of apartheid has consequences poverty , the low skills level , corruption , the difficulties we 're having with crime one factor in crime , he said , was a very serious problem of police corruption white police the level of rot that set in some police are involved in crimes themselves president mbeki will come to the us at the end of september he will address the united nations , but investment will be much on his mind he expects to meet president clinton and business and financial leaders we 're in the fortunate situation , he said , that poor people understand how long it takes for us to get them out of poverty that s why the anc did so well in the election in june they have seen progress they 're convinced that more was not done because there are constraints our people understand the extent and nature of the challenge we will move faster in the next five years i'm convinced that the economy will grow , and that we 'll deal better with crime and corruption

with just a year to go before high school students must pass a tough new english regents test to graduate , new york state education officials released test results yesterday showing that more than a quarter of all seniors and more than a third of those in new york city would have failed if the requirement had been in place last year the outcome made little difference to those students , because they were able to graduate with nonregents diplomas but this year s 11th graders will have to pass the english regents this year or next with a score of 55 or better and the new version of the test , to be given for the first time this june , will be harder , lasting six hours over two days and putting more emphasis on analytical writing i have to conclude that this still is n't good enough , said richard p mills , the state education commissioner we have a long haul ahead of us , and it s going to be particularly challenging for the highneeds school districts mr mills , who has led a statewide drive for higher standards , did say he was encouraged that nearly threequarters of last year s 12th graders would have met the standard and he and other officials called for stronger efforts to help students prepare for the tougher regents the regents results were among a welter of test scores released yesterday by education officials in albany and new york city , with mixed news for schools chancellor rudy crew in his own campaign to raise citywide achievement results from last year s statewide reading and math tests showed that third and sixthgrade scores had stayed about the same throughout the state but had dropped by four percentage points in new york city \( the city s scores were released in the fall the statewide scores that put them in context were released yesterday \) at the same time , the city released schoolbyschool rankings of performance based on its own english language arts test , given to all third through eighth graders last year none of the results released yesterday involved the muchheralded , muchmaligned reading and writing test given to all the state s fourth graders in january those results are expected by may of all the many standardized tests that have been added to students' plates in recent years , the new english regents has received particularly close attention because the stakes are so high in the past , students could take a basicskills competency test to graduate by next year , the vast majority will need to score 55 or better on the more rigorous regents exam , which was intended for those going on to college exams on other subjects will be added in subsequent years , and the passing score will be raised to 65 students who do not achieve passing scores by the end of the 12th grade will be allowed to stay in school until they meet the standard even students without a firm grasp of english and eventually , under certain circumstances , students with learning disabilities will be required to pass the exam , although the board of regents is weighing whether to grant exemptions for newly arrived immigrant students , said alan ray , a spokesman for the state department of education those students can now take the lessdemanding competency exams to graduate the state reported that 73 percent of last year s 12th graders had passed the english regents exam at some point , whether in the 12th grade or earlier the figure for new york city was 63 percent this means that of last year s seniors , 27 percent statewide and 37 percent citywide did not pass the exam before graduating whether those numbers will improve this year is hard to tell the state , which administers the test in january , june and august , has not finished compiling results from this year s first round of testing yesterday , the new york city board of education released its own early results showing that nearly 80 percent of the 11th graders who took the exam passed it but those results were from a limited sample just 55 percent of the city s 49 , 260 high school juniors took the exam in january those who did not take it were deemed not ready for it by their school s administrators or skipped it for personal reasons the figure of 27 , 000 taking the exam was the highest ever for a january sitting , in part because students know they must pass the regents to graduate next year and in part because it was their last chance to take the old threehour version instead of the sixhour version that begins in june dr crew said students who failed the january exam or are scheduled to take it in june will have added preparation in the form of double periods of english class and more tutoring before and after school and on saturdays the board has already spent 115 million to reduce english class sizes for high school juniors from an average of 34 students to 25 , said karen crowe , a board spokeswoman at a news conference yesterday as part of his annual report on student performance , dr crew said the january results were very good and telling but some experts and educators said they were troubled by last year s figure of 37 percent who had not passed the exam by the end of 12th grade

last friday , top executives from three of the nation s top copper companies secretly convened in a room at the trump international hotel in manhattan to try to resolve one of the nastiest , most convoluted corporate takeover fights in recent years when they emerged more than two hours later , it was nastier and more convoluted than ever the meeting brought together douglas yearley , chairman of phelps dodge , the nation s largest copper producer , with the chief executives of two competitors , asarco inc and the cyprus amax minerals company , that had agreed last july to merge with each other mr yearley , rather than see his smaller rivals join hands , had started his own 28 billion hostile offer to acquire both of them for phelps dodge finally , after weeks of rebuffing mr yearley , francis mcallister of asarco and milton ward of cyprus amax had agreed to talk mr yearley presented his best offer , he recalled but he was not willing to meet their demand 31 billion for the combination when the meeting broke up , mr yearley was still determined to own both companies and mr mcallister and mr ward , eager to protect their interests , quickly began a search for a white knight , adding yet another player to the corporate chess game six months ago , a brawl in the copper industry was unthinkable ailing economies in asia and latin america had left demand for copper waning prices plummeted to a 12year low then a paltry 63 cents a pound profits at copper mining companies tumbled , with some companies forced to cut production to help arrest the price slide in fact , it was the industry s bleak prospects that proved to be the catalyst that prompted mr mcallister to talk to mr ward in the first place last may how quickly that world has changed copper prices have risen 33 percent since then now , asarco and cyprus amax , instead of being left alone to embrace each other out of desperation , have , in effect , become much more valuable prizes on the auction block indeed , as soon as they walked out of the meeting last friday , the two sought a bid from grupo mexico , a mexican copper producer and asarco s largest shareholder grupo mexico , which had been watching the action for a while , immediately offered to pay 103 billion in cash for asarco , barely edging out phelps dodge s 101 billion stock and cash offer asarco and cyprus amax , essentially acknowledging that their original deal was no longer viable , postponed shareholder votes scheduled for today on the merger , giving each other until tuesday to reconsider their options the fourway fight is indicative of what has happened in stagnant commoditydriven industries seeking some way to shore up production without losing their shirts in the process low prices in slowgrowing industries , including oil , aluminum , copper and chemicals , have made even the most unattractive partners appealing to formidable competitors hoping to cut costs and restore profitability to their slimmargin businesses and with 1980 s style corporate takeover tactics back in vogue , properties expected to benefit from rising prices are now worth fighting over when copper was 65 cents per pound , no one thought anyone would have been fighting over these two companies , said tom burnett , founder of merger insight , which is based in new york the worm has turned commodity prices are on the move and companies do n't want to be left behind spokesmen for asarco and grupo mexico said executives would not comment on recent events executives at cyprus amax did not return phone calls but people involved in the talks said cyprus amax had been scouting for another partner and could possibly strike a deal soon with phelps dodge asarco , too , has been negotiating with other suitors this week mr mcallister of asarco , who became chief executive last spring , never planned for his company to become a target , executives close to him said instead his solution to asarco s woes was for him to act as buyer , squeezing savings out of any merged entity mr mcallister wanted to turn asarco s fortunes around , one person said , and he found a willing partner in the older mr ward , who was looking for a successor several people involved in the negotiations said mr ward had already approached a handful of potential merger partners for cyprus amax last year so it was with little fanfare on july 15 that mr ward and mr mcallister announced that their companies would join forces in a merger of equals , valued then at 737 million in stock stock traders yawned at the news the stock of both companies dropped 3 percent on the day the deal was announced analysts at the time said the hohum response came because shareholders of neither company were paid a premium and they did not understand how the duo could successfully improve profit margins without cutting production people wanted to see how they 'd perform before they bid up the stock , said ali agha , a metals and mining analyst at donaldson , lufkin jenrette but the merger did catch the attention of mr yearley , who said he thought a threeway merger with asarco and cyprus amax could be just the ticket to make phelps dodge the premier lowcost global copper producer
the giuliani administration vowed yesterday to appeal a state court decision that has temporarily blocked the mayor s plan to require homeless people to work in exchange for their beds in city shelters city officials , including the corporation counsel , michael d hess , derided the court decision issued wednesday as legally baseless and fraught with misguided emotion tied to the holiday season the decision is an emotional one , not a legal one , mr hess said yesterday they talked about the christmas season that s not how you decide cases , based on what month it is or what temperature it is outside he said a notice to appeal would likely be filed sometime today meanwhile , mayor rudolph w giuliani defended the new homeless policy and pledged to carry it out as soon as possible at an emergency hearing on wednesday , justice helen e freedman and justice elliott wilk of state supreme court in manhattan issued a temporary restraining order barring the administration from imposing its new rules the judges called the policy frightening because it could put children in foster care if their parents failed to meet the work requirement mr giuliani , at his daily news conference yesterday , criticized the judges and said that higher courts had already affirmed the city s right to impose the new rules there is no question the decision is wrong , he said the policy actually has been upheld by the very judge who entered the stay , in a written opinion , and the policy was upheld by the appellate division and not reversed by the court of appeals in their appeal , the city s lawyers plan to argue that the legal issues in the case had already been litigated and decided in previous cases , and then upheld in the higher courts the mayor insisted the workforshelter policy would be carried out this policy will go into effect , he said and it s a good policy and it s a humane policy and it s a decent one and it s one that flies in the face of years and years of ideological opposition to it that ended up in people being poorer , more dependent and made into victims as opposed to people we can actually help to help themselves the temporary restraining order delays the new rules at least until jan 14 , when another hearing is to be held to determine whether the plan violates an earlier court ruling that the city cannot seek to place children in foster care because their families lack housing mr giuliani has said the children would be put in foster care because their parents , by refusing to work , could not properly care for them mr giuliani and mr hess said yesterday that they believed that , by filing a notice to appeal , the city would automatically get a stay overriding the restraining order and allowing them to put the policy into effect but steven banks , a legal aid lawyer and counsel to the coalition for the homeless , said he would fight the city s efforts to overturn the restraining order but hoped the city would negotiate rather than appeal if they are intent on invoking a statutory stay even where none exists , we are certainly going to contest that , mr banks said i really hope , though , that instead of pursuing an appeal , the mayor or anyone he designates would sit down with us and try to craft a shelter plan that is going to work and not hurt people he also defended the judges' reference to the holiday season the courts in this state have equitable power to protect vulnerable new yorkers like homeless children from irreparable harm , and the judges exercised that power yesterday , he said the fact that it s the holiday season and the onset of winter are clearly not irrelevant he added , we 're perfectly willing to sit down with anyone on the city s side to work out a better plan

at a tony manhattan private school for boys last week , the headmaster , a brit , confided that even after many years here he was still desperately struggling to understand baseball could he ask a rudimentary question \? i nodded politely and tried to remember if the infield fly rule had been rescinded or if the strike zone had been relocated again so , under the circumstances , he said , with a sudden bolt of intensity , do you think the david wellsforroger clemens trade was justified \? and , also , about david cone s free agency are you anxious \? no , just stunned here we are in the belly of football , in the early heat of basketball and hockey , with boxing rocking , and none of it seems more urgent than the gossip around the hot stove league twoleague cy young award winners , will the mets or the yankees get the japanese pitcher , are john franco and junior griffey coming or going \? are we in another diamond cycle , is the national pastime reasserting itself , or are the other sports just going through emotional bear markets \? if bill parcells had n't invented ray lucas last week , there would be no football talk that did n't involve a bone chart or a court appearance the death of walter payton and the failing health of tom landry seem to signal the end of a certain kind of national football league , and certainly the end of a certain boomer innocence about it , and mortality on the pro basketball court , we are still in uneasy transition from air jordan to all the notsofresh princes as hiphop culture informs the mainstream , the fauxoutlaw image of tattoos , clunky gold , posses and attitude is getting old for the suburban boys who buy music , beer and sports college football and basketball are not in much better shape a recent conference created by the former drake provost jon ericson was able to begin with the premise that bigtime intercollegiate sports is corrupt what evolved seems hopeful , a group called the national alliance of faculty for college athletics reform faculty involvement is essential without the compliance of professors , the nurturing of nonscholar athletes would be impossible the pro sports that are periodically boomed never quite go bust hockey is still simply too demanding , a wonderful game played by immensely skillful toughs , but it is marketed as a series of wintry crashes , and now that we have pro wrestling , who needs violence without a story line \? once , wrestling was merely a parody of boxing , but now that boxing can handle its own mockery , wrestling is free to expand and become a parody of the olympics , with its hyperpomp , systemic corruption and designer drugs then there is soccer , always just about to save us a young nigerian , henry iwuchukwu , who has been refereeing youth games in manhattan this season , said recently soccer will never make it in america until little boys sneak out of the house against their parents' wishes to kick the ball around in the park with their friends all i see is parents driving kids to organized games iwuchukwu , you may remember , along with his countryman bishop dike , starred for martin luther king jr high school last year as coach martin jacobson s team won its third straight city title iwuchukwu and dike dropped out of school in the wake of an eligibility controversy that caused games to be forfeited and jacobson to be suspended they have since begun classes to get equivalency degrees an executive with major league soccer says the pros would be interested in giving them tryouts yesterday , the reinstated jacobson and his latest team lost to newtown high , 21 , at the long island university brooklyn campus for the city title fewer people were at the game than were talking about baseball in the city even i was n't there of course , i told that private school headmaster , i'm anxious about cone s free agency and , yes , how could you not still be ambivalent about the trade \? clemens is merely a great pitcher wells is a great role model
montreal , jan 17 the rangers had looked at their last four games , a span in which they played four teams occupying last place in their divisions , and had seen an opportunity as they walked slowly and quietly to the bus here on saturday night , through a small crowd of encouraging family and friends , they saw an opportunity lost the rangers had just been shut out by the montreal canadiens , 30 , less than than 24 hours after a disappointing defeat at home to the chicago blackhawks the two losses gave the rangers a split of the four games , and rather than lift themselves back into the playoff picture as the allstar game break approaches , the rangers dropped into a threeway tie with the surging canadiens and the florida panthers for ninth place in the eastern conference , 4 points behind boston and carolina for the final playoff berth this is a tough conference , wayne gretzky said every game is a battle it s going to be a battle to the end how the rangers can be a part of that battle is a question even they do n't profess to have an answer for their scoring has been inconsistent , particularly recently in their past 12 games , they have scored five or more goals three times , but have scored two or fewer seven times their power play , which has carried them for much of the season , ranking second in the national hockey league , has failed them now , too , coming up empty on the past 15 attempts it s been either feast or famine , rangers coach john muckler said we 're either scoring six or getting one or none and even the fiveonthree advantage has failed on saturday , the rangers had a twoman advantage for 1 minute 2 seconds , but took only one shot and never threatened that marked the third consecutive twoman advantage that has failed to produce a goal for the rangers in the losses friday and saturday , the rangers scored only one goal we know what we have to do , brian leetch said we have to work hard and find some ways to score the power play is still getting it in the zone and creating chances when you 're accustomed to the puck going in all the time for you , it seems like a big drought it s certainly a big part of our team and when it s not there , it s very noticeable we ca n't explain goals you can control the work ethic , try to create chances but you ca n't always control the puck finding its way in troubles like these are certain to bring back the cries for trades , but even the acquisition of a strong shooter and scorer may not be the solution the rangers have displayed other flaws , surrendering goals on the first shot in three of their past five games , and falling behind in 28 of their 43 games if i had the answer , i 'd be a great coach , gretzky said we do n't have a natural goal scorer our goals come from hard work , from guys like adam graves , todd harvey and john maclean we do n't have that guy who can look at the net and it goes in we battle hard for all the goals i do n't know if the lack of a goal scorer is the reason why we lost throughout the year our guys have worked hard in practice that has n't been our biggest liability photo kevin stevens \( 17 \) being knocked off the puck saturday the rangers scored 1 goal in their past two losses \( reuters \)
the corruption of american politics what went wrong and why by elizabeth drew 278 pp secaucus , nj birch lane press 2195 in a dazzling display of disingenuous politics , president clinton and speaker newt gingrich shook hands one sunday afternoon in new hampshire four years ago , vowing to establish a blueribbon commission on campaign finance reform the idea , by design , got no farther than manchester elizabeth drew explains the feint in her book the corruption of american politics clinton , knowing that gingrich did n't really want reform , made some let spretend moves toward naming commission members exploiting , as he so often did , wellmeaning and even distinguished figures that scene in new hampshire exemplifies the utter resistance by leaders in both parties to tampering with a campaign finance system that many of those same politicians denounce as corrupt it also helps explain why , after interminable publicity about fundraising transgressions in the 1996 presidential campaign , nothing has changed while drew is a respected chronicler of the washington scene , her book does not depict the debasement of politics over the last 25 years with exceptional new insights or heartstopping revelations yet she nimbly brings to life the machinations on capitol hill and the white house with fresh perspective , behindthescenes detail and convincing analysis the book reads as if she had set out to recount the congressional hearings two years ago on campaign finance irregularities but broadened her scope because the proceedings never drew much public interest and what notice they did get was quickly drowned out by the lewinsky imbroglio in fact , drew s examination of campaign finance makes a compelling narrative she had access to pivotal players , most notably senator fred thompson , the tennessee republican who was chairman of the senate hearings and comes off as a sympathetic if at times nave figure she skillfully shows how tom delay of texas , the house majority leader , and senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky , head of the national republican senatorial committee , suffocated attempts at reform broadly speaking , it is the same tired story politicians do not want to mess with the system that brought them to washington in the first place but drew demonstrates how democrats and republicans were so determined to protect themselves that they successfully shut down thompson s hearings republican leaders feared that the committee would turn its spotlight on conservative groups and fundraising practices of the republican senatorial committee clinton was not eager for reform because his pollster , mark penn , repeatedly told him , the public does n't care moreover , the white house feared that prolonged hearings would prod attorney general janet reno to appoint an independent counsel to examine vice president gore s fund raising beyond campaign finance , drew paints a picture of a congress that is sullied more than ever by personal pettiness and furious partisanship a disconcerting thread running throughout the book is that drew , not known for hyperbole , offers choice assessments of the intellectual capacity of this nation s elected leaders among republicans , senator rick santorum of pennsylvania was unburdened by brilliance senator don nickles of oklahoma was energetic and none too bright representative dan burton of indiana was so hapless that thompson and other republicans were uncomfortable about sharing the stage with him recalling the role of democrats at the hearings , drew writes that senator john glenn of ohio was a whiny bore senator daniel k akaka of hawaii was often a roomemptier because of the thinness of his thought and senator max cleland of georgia was out of his depth given this cast of characters , drew offers a conclusion that is unsettling but not surprising she questions whether there can ever be a dispassionate , nonpartisan and closein examination of the campaign finance system by the congress
moscow , saturday , june 12 the arrival of russian troops in pristina before dawn today raises disturbing questions about the kremlin s control of the military after the troops moved into yugoslavia on friday , foreign minister igor s ivanov assured the clinton administration that the force would not enter kosovo until russia had reached an understanding with nato just hours later , however , mr ivanov was reading a statement at dawn on the cable news network that said that the kosovo deployment was a colossal mistake and announcing that the troops would be immediately withdrawn since the end of the cold war , russian troops have been bedraggled , dispirited but obedient they have done what the kremlin has told them , despite their poor pay , declining status in russian society and resentment of nato expansion into central europe but after the nato air raids against yugoslavia , senior russian military officials increasingly seem to have had their own foreign policy alarm was generated today when a senior defense ministry official , col gen leonid ivashov , publicly warned that moscow might unilaterally send troops to kosovo if nato did not drop its insistence that it command all the forces there general ivashov raised eyebrows this month when he denounced as a sellout the settlement supported by the special russian envoy in the balkans crisis , viktor s chernomyrdin with moscow a battleground of intrigue , several possibilities could explain what occurred on friday , none particularly reassuring top military officials may have simply ignored their civilian counterparts and urged on the troops in a mad rush to beat the nato forces to pristina or the military system of command and control may be so frayed that moscow found it impossible to stop the forces before they had entered kosovo , after the initial deployment orders had been given the most pressing questions concerned the role of president boris n yeltsin , the ultimate commander of the military would he back mr ivanov and hold russian military leaders to account or has his authority dissipated to the point where the military is free to challenge the civilian leaders \? disturbingly , mr yeltsin s top spokesman , dmitri yakushkin , was initially unaware that the troops had left bosnia for yugoslavia when he was asked about it earlier the controls on russian nuclear forces is generally considered to be strict but the movement today is bound to generate searching questions about the checks on the military in that area , too the smallsale crisis began without warning when 175 russian soldiers left their posts in bosnia and drove into serbia the troops had painted kfor on their vehicles , the initials for the security force designated for kosovo , indicating that they intended to take up positions there the movement prompted fears among nato leaders that the kremlin was preparing to seize its own sector in kosovo even after mr ivanov had assured washington wrongly , as it turned out that the troops would not enter kosovo , american concern about a potential political and , perhaps even military , confrontation with the russians was so great that deputy secretary of state strobe talbott , en route to brussels by plane , was instructed to turn around in midflight and return to moscow the column from bosnia was not nato s sole worry an additional russian 1 , 000 paratroopers were on alert , waiting to be flow to yugoslavia , the defense ministry said an american official said washington had anticipated additional troops would be sent to yugoslavia , because hungary had granted a russian request for overflight rights for its trooptransport planes the official added that the united states had received conflicting reports that a russian il76 transport might have landed in belgrade it was the abruptness of the troop movements and the fact that they moved after a deadlock about the role of russian forces in kosovo that alarmed nato the allies have insisted that all the troops in kosovo have to be under a unified command led by a nato general russia , however , has adamantly refused to put its troops under nato control and has insisted that it be given a sector of its own to control although nato insists that the russians have never been under any illusion about its demand , the issue was dealt with indirectly in the resolution that the united nations security council adopted this week an annex to the resolution refers to the need for unified command and control , but does not say explicitly that nato has to lead the force after generals from united states joint chiefs of staff and the russian defense ministry had failed to agree in talks here today on a solution on the question of command , the chief russian negotiator issued a blunt warning if this agreement is not reached , the negotiator , general ivashov , said , russia has the same right as nato we shall announce a sector that will be agreed with the yugoslav side and which will meet our interests coupled with reports of russian troop movements that statement set off alarm bells at the nato military headquarters in belgium and at the skopje , macedonia , headquarters for the allied forces
saipan , northern mariana islands no place on this entire island , a tropical teardrop of land in the pacific ocean , has an address there are no names on the roads that meander alongside the lazy palm trees , nor on the streets that crisscross the island s modest capital city no house has a number not the humble shacks up on the hilly inland roads nor the fancy estates that stretch out beside a lengthy beachfront , not even the modern office buildings that may sound forlorn , but it is not it is a way of life the sun shines every day in saipan , where the fragrant and summery air rarely dips below 70 degrees or climbs above 80 the locals , a mix of pacific islanders and caucasians and chinese and filipinos , wear shorts and flipflops yearround there seems to be little sense of urgency about anything in saipan street names and numbers , many people here say , would be an unnecessary bother an unwelcome intrusion of modern life why do you need an address , when you know where everything is \? asked lou drenian , a legal secretary , giving voice to a nonchalance as pervasive as hawaiian shirts if i go someplace new , i just ask and ask and how ! people in saipan are so accustomed to asking and giving directions that they think nothing of lengthy and roundabout discussions involving odd landmarks bumps in the road , funnylooking trees , anything distinctive can help , since the streets are nameless that may have seemed logical in the old days , early this century , when saipan was a distant outpost populated by only a few hundred people , and everyone knew everyone and where they lived but now , saipan s population has climbed to 70 , 000 after being ruled by spain , then by japan , then by the united nations , saipan became a united states commonwealth in 1978 as part of the northern mariana islands saipan may be remembered by many americans as the site of a fierce battle with the japanese during world war ii , but today modern features of life like fastfood joints and luxury beach resorts make it look like any other tropical corner of america except , of course , that there are no addresses postal delivery in saipan is no problem there is none instead , residents all have boxes at the central post office , which naturally has become a lively social center , since everyone goes there regularly at first , finding one s way around saipan can be confusing but many newcomers settle into a comfortable addresslessness before long when i first got here , i thought it was the dumbest thing in the world , said terry mclaughlin , librarian at the joetian public library , who moved to saipan last year after a couple of months , it becomes quite normal it personalizes things , keeps things local naturally , a portion of saipan s work force is getting impatient for addresses , even if they are a minority just imagine how hard it is to deliver a pizza it s a real headache , said robert brilliantes , a pizza deliverer for pizza forum , just off saipan s main road inevitably , mr brilliantes takes down a detailed explanation of how to find a customer s house , and relies on his mobile phone for even more specific directions after he gets lost he is always getting lost up navy hill , left by the broken pump , the white house across from the basketball court , mr brilliantes said , reciting the directions he was given earlier in the day but when i got there , there were three white houses i had to call twice before i figured it out even the slowmoving local government , which one local businessman described as alternating between laziness and vacation , has recognized the need to name and number streets a commission was set up to do so , in 1988 the commission apparently got bogged down as soon as it came to picking the names a dozen large and extended families own most of saipan , and each one wanted roads and streets named for a family patriarch or illustrious relative frustrated by the bickering , the saipan senate passed a new bill in january , recommending action to date the task of naming and numbering the streets has yet to be completed , said the bill the situation is reaching crisis proportions and , especially in these tough economic times , the legislature finds that saipan needs organization of this sort to encourage economic efficiency gellyn villajuan is all for efficiency she runs saipan s federal express office and making deliveries without addresses , as she put it , is not always express you think it s easy \? she asked , laughing , apparently pleased that anyone sympathized with her predicament i think i have the hardest fedex job in the world some saipan residents have more mundane concerns victoria s secret wo n't deliver to a postal box , complained jill howard , a teacher who has lived on saipan for more than four years it s a real pain you have to have them deliver to your family in the mainland , and have them send it out photo on saipan , the streets have no names , the houses no numbers and there is no mail delivery , either a couple of new arrivals from china went strolling on one of the pacific island s larger unnamed roads \( seth faison the new york times \) map of saipan saipan can be a really big headache for the pizza delivery man
the two names almost rhyme , watkins and watson , like an oldtime songanddance team they did not know each other , but amy watkins and marvin watson were both young , both archetypes of the new york newcomer she was the midwestern idealist come to the big city , a graduate student hoping to become a social worker he was the striver from jamaica , an immigrant who became an electrician and was saving money for the birth of his child they both came to the city to better themselves , and they lived barely a mile apart in brooklyn they could have shared the same subway into manhattan and never known it early on jan 16 , mr watson , 22 , was stabbed to death outside his father s ninthfloor apartment in a crown heights public housing project he had tried to save his brother from the attack and ended up dead himself last monday night , about seven weeks later , ms watkins , 26 , was walking from the subway to her prospect heights apartment when she was stabbed in the back and left for dead on the sidewalk the police say the two attacks are not related , but they are paired nonetheless they are the only two homicides reported so far this year in the threemile rectangle that comprises brooklyn s 77th precinct but if ms watkins s death has attracted national attention , mr watson died anonymously her death led mayor rudolph w giuliani to reassure the public , and more than two dozen investigators were assigned to the case , which remains unsolved , within a day the police handled his case as an ordinary homicide and made an arrest a month later her death inspired sensational tabloid covers last week and had television reporters camped at the scene of the crime his death went unreported by the tabloids and the new york times yet if the killings were treated differently , they each touched on fears held deeply by many new yorkers , even as crime has fallen in the city ms watkins s death evoked the image of a woman brutally attacked on a dark street she lived in a diverse , gentrifying neighborhood much like other onceneglected areas that are now attracting middleclass professionals her photographs show a smiling , brownhaired woman to many people , she looked too familiar , like a favorite friend or a relative in a picture on the mantel mr watson s death represents the immigrant s nightmare he was a poor black man who died in the projects a slender man who wore his hair in short dreadlocks , he came to new york to do better than his father and to have his son do better than him instead , he was buried in a new jersey cemetery two weeks before his son was born i still do n't understand why a person who was doing so good , who had so much going for him , had it all taken away from him for nothing , said doris mckenzie , the mother of mr watson s baby in a city where most homicides occur in poor minority neighborhoods , the circumstances of ms watkins s death did not fit the usual profile the case of mr watson did the amy watkins killing broke out of the pattern of the usual carnage , said robert mccire , chairman of the department of law , police science and criminal justice administration at john jay college that grabbed the attention of the public because people say , 'that could have been me , my friend or my children in that situation' unacceptable as it is , he added , marvin watson s death does not appeal to public sympathy as amy watkins s does immigrant with dreams awoke to a nightmare marvin watson was his father s favorite son he had his father s high cheekbones , his narrow chin and his wiry , muscular build the father , vivian watson , came to new york in 1986 after his wife died , leaving his four children with another family in kingston , jamaica he worked as a security guard , saved his money , and sent for his children in 1994 when they arrived , he moved into the albany houses , a public housing complex in crown heights where he could rent a threebedroom apartment for 305 a month his three sons shared a small bedroom less than 10 feet wide marvin watson had been asleep when , at 5 30 on a saturday morning , he heard shouting in the ninthfloor hallway his youngest brother , nakia , had been playing cards with friends for much of the night one floor below the police said one of the players was a convicted felon named phillip gardner an argument erupted and the players scattered investigators say mr gardner chased at least one card player upstairs to the watson apartment , waking marvin , who opened the door when marvin stepped into the hallway , the police said , mr gardner stabbed him in the chest but vivian watson said mr gardner was chasing three people , including nakia marvin heard nakia yelling in the hallway , vivian watson said , and jumped from bed to help him with a knife in his chest , marvin staggered back into the apartment and collapsed in the doorway of his father s bedroom when i turned him around , vivian watson said , the blood was coming so fast , like a river mr gardner , 34 , was arrested a month after the attack and charged with seconddegree murder sgt ellen tietjan , a police spokeswoman , said mr gardner had prior convictions dating back to 1982 for larceny , assault , burglary , drug and weapons possession and menacing vivian watson said mr gardner lived on the 14th floor despite laws prohibiting convicted felons from living in public housing those types of people are not supposed to live here , vivian watson said they 're like pit bulls a painter who took an interest in people
the chief executive of new york city s public hospital system said yesterday that north central bronx hospital , with 1 , 200 unionized health care workers and room for 450 beds , would almost certainly close in the next two to three years because of a steady decline in the number of patients it treats over the last several months , the hospital has already scaled back considerably it has closed its pediatrics ward and reduced the number of patients in its medical wards from 90 to 60 , according to letters from the hospital s administrators officials also plan to close the hospital s rehabilitation services , which will further trim the average daily patient census from about 195 now , to about 150 , said dr luis r marcos , president of the city s health and hospitals corporation all the patients once treated in the closed wards will be transferred to jacobi medical center in the northeast bronx , which is part of a health care network that controls both hospitals a senior official at north central bronx said he and other officials there had been told recently by joseph orlando , the administrator who oversees both north central bronx and jacobi , that the shuttering of the wards was part of a plan to shrink the hospital quietly but faster , so the city can justify closing it the goal , the official said , is to sell the 16story building to montefiore medical center , the huge private hospital across the street , which once owned the land beneath north central and is physically connected to the hospital by covered walkways mr orlando , in a telephone interview yesterday , denied that any such plan was afoot , but both he and dr marcos said it made little sense particularly as private hospitals have begun to compete fiercely for poor patients covered by medicaid to keep the struggling city hospital open right next door to montefiore here it sits , cheek and jowl with montefiore , mr orlando said there are two emergency rooms on the same city block dr marcos said , unless something dramatic happens in health care in this town and in the bronx in particular north central bronx will reach a point where there will not be a sufficient number of patients to justify a 450bed hospital late last year , dr marcos predicted that the rise of managed care in the city , especially the beginning of mandatory managed care for people on medicaid , would prove to be the biggest fiscal threat that the hospitals corporation has ever faced he said then that some of the city s 11 public hospitals might have to close the dire picture that he painted yesterday suggests that north central bronx may well be the first there s a point at which you say , 'this does n't make sense , ' he said , later adding have we discussed what happens the day north central bronx stops being a hospital \? yes he said that most of the union workers at the hospital would probably not be absorbed elsewhere in the strapped city system , which will probably run a deficit of 60 million in the next fiscal year is is realistic to think that we can find jobs for 1 , 200 people \? he asked no the hospitals agency has already planned to shrink the system s work force by 1 , 000 jobs during the next fiscal year because of the deficit the reduction would be in addition to the elimination of 500 jobs through attrition in the current fiscal year at north central bronx , dr marcos said , the average daily number of patients in the hospital has dropped from 350 in 1990 , to about 195 now , because of shorter patients stays and more outpatient services mandated by managed care , and because private hospitals like montefiore have lured away patients with insurance and those covered by medicaid as a result , hospital officials said , north central bronx often operates in the red in the 1998 fiscal year , the hospital had a 46 million operating deficit both dr marcos and mr orlando said the closing of the pediatrics ward and the shrinking of other hospital services were to make the hospital , and its sister , jacobi , more efficient as a health care system but dr marcos conceded that despite the logic of closing the hospital , there remains one group of patients who truly depend on north central the uninsured , who can obtain only emergency care at montefiore hospital officials said probably about 10 percent of inpatients at bronx central hospital have no insurance and about 30 percent of those who receive outpatient services have none their options will likely be to go to lincoln hospital , many dozens of blocks to the south , or to jacobi , also several neighborhoods away that is a serious question and one that we have to answer , he said how inconvenient is that inconvenience \? and what is reasonable \? the senior official at north central bronx , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said mr orlando had told top managers that when the hospital was reduced to an average patient census of 80 or fewer , the city could justify closing it montefiore has a first right of refusal on sale of the building , constructed in 1976 but it remained unclear yesterday how the hospital would ever drop to 80 or fewer patients without significant further closings by administrators dr marcos said the psychiatry ward , with 47 beds , and the medicine and surgery wards , with a total of 55 beds , have stayed relatively full , as has intensive care , with 19 beds nevertheless , he said he gave the hospital about two to three more years but that s all speculation , he said you can always conceive of a situation where there is a chain reaction and things happen faster than that
inglewood , calif , june 19 soon after turning on his computer , alfredo lambour , 15 , shot and killed the same zombie six times , saw countless gallons of blood splatter and ran among the decapitated heads and other body parts that littered a fortress floor in the video game quake ii alfredo spends nearly two hours a day in his living room , here in this los angeles suburb , looking down the barrel of a gun as he roams dimly lit corridors in search of monsters on a recent day , he played the role of a marine , outfitted with body armor , fatigues and a weapon called a blaster that he fired at anything that moved , using his computer keyboard it can just split people in half , he said of the blaster video games have come under increased scrutiny after the shootings at columbine high school in littleton , colo , that left 15 people dead the students who carried out the attack , eric harris and dylan klebold , have been described as players of doom , a violent video game released in 1993 that is not considered to be realistic compared with newer games but still includes ample amounts of blood and numerous explosions no one knows whether the gory scenes in the game influenced the minds of the columbine shooters but the issue of the violent influence of video games has been seized upon by many politicians and others who believe that such entertainment is inappropriate for minors and needs to be toned down president clinton singled out video game advertising as particularly excessive when he announced the beginning of two federal investigations on june 1 into whether the entertainment industry is marketing violence to children a proposal by representative henry j hyde , republican of illinois , to prohibit the sale to children under 17 of all violent entertainment , including video games , failed in a house vote on wednesday while video game enthusiasts often concede that some of the games sold in stores have violent content , they are adamant that the games do not encourage players to imitate what they see on screen to them , fighting animated enemies is merely thrilling competition and no more harmful than football , professional wrestling or a cartoon in which wile e coyote battles the road runner with anvils and dynamite there would n't be a lot of people foaming at the mouth over video games if littleton did n't happen , said jon dempster , a video game enthusiast from grand rapids , mich , who sometimes plays games like quake ii with his twin 11yearold boys as long as children can separate fantasy from reality , they leave any aggressive thoughts behind once they turn off the computer it has no effect for the past five years , video game boxes have been printed with ratings as part of a voluntary program of software publishers however , even games that are rated as mature , like postal , which says on the box that it is so realistic that your victims actually beg for mercy and scream for their lives , can be legally sold to children of any age yet most video games are actually bought by adults , according to the interactive digital software association , the video game industry s trade group if parents are not already aware of the contents , most soon learn , and judging from the widespread use by children , do nothing to intervene these ratings are completely neglected , said dave sparks , owner of interact , a computer video game store in pasadena , calif maybe one out of a hundred moms pay any attention to them many video game enthusiasts blame the media and what they see as political opportunism for the blows to their hobby s reputation the recent rash of school shootings , they said , was more a consequence of action movies , news reports about crime , bad parenting and mental disturbance than of video games randy matulewicz , 15 , from san jose , calif , said that reducing the violence in the games he played would not diminish his interest in them because he did not stop to admire the dead bodies he added that changing the content was not necessary because thousands of people play video games every day without hurting others proof , he said , that some other factor must be responsible for violence like that at columbine the federal government s attention to the video game industry is met with skepticism by many video game players steve merz , a longtime video game enthusiast from forest city , nc , who has two small children , said the content of video games and the age of the people who play them was none of the government s business mr merz said parents should be the ones to decide what children played dismissing the violence in video games as inconsequential , he allows his 7yearold son , danny , to play games like quake , but not those with foul language , satanic imagery and nudity because they , he believes , can be harmful but some parents support strengthening video game ratings , which are being reviewed by the industry trade group they also want more manufacturers to install switches in video games that would allow parents to block parts of the action david lepore , a 30yearold computer analyst in tacoma , wash , is among the parents who encourage the industry to adopt some voluntary changes for now , his two boys , ages 5 and 10 , are not even allowed to watch the screen when , for example , he assumes the role of a

millions of americans have rushed into the brave new world of electronic stock trading armed with fast computers and sophisticated software , they see themselves not only at the market s epicenter but also on the same plain as professional traders for extra enticement , there are low commissions , sometimes less than 10 a trade what many investors may not realize is that their trades particularly in the sizzling internet stocks with which online traders are infatuated are not finding their way to the market through traditional channels instead , much of that trading is being piped through new types of electronic networks systems that , in theory , are ideal marketplaces , where buyers and sellers can trade stocks without paying a markup to the professional traders who have long served as middlemen in the nasdaq market the new trading systems , called electronic communications networks , or ecn s , are pitched as a way for investors to gain instant access to the markets and to compete head to head with professional traders yet for all their promise , the ecn s have distinct downsides they and the investors who use them including the growing numbers of rapidfire day traders are contributing to the wild ricocheting of prices in internet stocks moreover , although commissions to trade on line are indeed rock bottom , there are hidden costs in using the networks prices on these networks are inferior on 8 out of 10 stocks they trade , according to the national association of securities dealers in large part , that is because investors are trading only with other investors who are using the same network , rather than meeting all other investors in the broader nasdaq marketplace frustrations over poor prices or trades that were not executed at all have led some experienced investors to wonder whether something is amiss between the time orders are placed and the time they show up on an ecn the upside is that investors are getting that meeting possibility , said richard g ketchum , president of the nasd the downside is that they are not getting any execution guarantee the networks now account for about 20 percent of trading in nasdaq stocks more than the volume on the american stock exchange and all the nation s regional stock exchanges combined but even investors who are not using the networks have reason to be concerned , as volatility jumps and total trading costs increase we 're in a period of disequilibrium right now , said bruce weber , assistant professor of information systems at new york university s stern school of business anybody that s trading a nasdaq stock these days has to work harder to find the best price and ideal counterparties than they did maybe three or four years ago with the nasdaq composite index up 10 percent so far this year , the problems have been largely papered over by investor profits not until a fullfledged market dive will investors find out whether the fragmented marketplace created by the rise of the ecn s will make it harder to sell or harder to sell at a good price such difficulties could make jittery investors panic , turning a trickle of selling into a flood and pulling down more established stocks , too regulators opened the door wide to the new networks after they found in the mid1990 s that traders in nasdaq stocks were profiting from artificially wide spreads the difference between the price at which traders buy shares from sellers and the price at which they will resell them to buyers in the most important change , regulators forced nasdaq traders to display customers' orders that fell at prices within the spread they also encouraged the creation of new networks that would allow investors to meet rather than taking a markup on trades , the networks profit by charging a small fee for each transaction most of the electronic networks operate today for institutional investors the oldest is instinet , a unit of reuters group plc but two fastgrowing services cater to individual investors island , a twoyearold network owned by datek holdings , a discount brokerage firm in iselin , nj , and archipelago , a chicago company whose owners include goldman , sachs and e trade group the 200 , 000 customers of datek online have trades funneled to island ecn s are one of the most dramatic forces reshaping the equity markets , said david cushing , director of research at itg inc , a research and trading company that runs a tradematching service for institutional investors called itg posit i think ecn s have a very valuable role in improving the efficiency of the market the downside is , many of the benefits of ecn s have been coopted by the professional day trader some of the ways they are being used right now are not in the market s best interest wide and wild swings ecn s play a significant role in the increasing volatility in many nasdaq stocks a growing number of day traders , who buy and sell furiously all day long , hoping to capture tiny pershare profits on large trades , execute their orders on the networks their lemminglike behavior in stocks that are already moving has made 15point singleday swings common

mineola , ny , march 9 nassau county officials are considering issuing bonds backed by the county s portion of the state s 25 billion tobacco settlement to plug a hole in the budget that has grown to 300 million for 1998 and 1999 the county presented the plan last week in its discussions with bond rating agencies that have threatened to downgrade the county s bonds because of officials' reliance on shortterm borrowing and onetimeonly asset sales in the end , the county faces no risk here , said peter white of nixon , hargrave , devans doyle , nassau county s bond counsel tobacco money stands behind this asset , and all risk will be held by holders of the instrument nassau officials are counting on receiving 684 million over 25 years as part of the 206 billion tobacco industry settlement with 46 states the money is compensation for the costs of tobaccorelated illnesses but questions remain as to how much money the county would actually receive and when it would receive the money the plan would begin this year with the sale of 170 million in bonds backed by tobacco payments , and then possibly continue with sales of the same amount over the next three years , officials said financial analysts described it as a creative plan while calling it premature and risky the proposal would need the approval of the nassau county legislature this was a real trump card for the county , said helen cregger , a vice president for public finance at moody s investors service , who met county officials on monday it could help them cover their shortfalls the problem is that none of this money is set in stone steven murphy , managing director in public finance at standard poor s , pointed to uncertainties in how much money nassau would receive for instance , mr murphy said , new york city is challenging its 67 billion share , claiming that it is too little when compared with the amount of poor people it has treated for smokingrelated illnesses the federal government has also suggested that it may be entitled to 57 percent of the total settlement , since it too , made large medicaid payments to the states the senate has recently pulled back from that stance but bruce a blakeman , the presiding officer of the county legislature , said one benefit of the plan was to make the bondholders assume the risks of those uncertainties uncertainty is the whole point behind the plan , mr blakeman said he added , we are testing the waters to see how much the county could receive up front opponents of the plan call it another shell game in the county s finances , another quick infusion of capital without addressing deeper financial problems i 've seen more photoops and heard more speeches about breast cancer and cancer rates on long island than you can possibly imagine , said thomas r suozzi , the mayor of glen cove now with the first opportunity to address those issues , we 're instead spending the money to plug a fiscal deficit instead of using it for what it was intended for the requests for proposals to major investment banks went out on feb 19 and are due on friday
during the next three weeks , mtv viewers might feel as if they have stumbled into one of those james bond movie marathons only this one will be celebrating just one film the world is not enough , the latest james bond film , will be the centerpiece of as many as 100 hours of programming on mtv channels worldwide among other things , there will be multiple showings of the music video of the movie s theme song a special on the making of the video , which includes scenes from the film and a contest to give away a 200 , 000 bmw featured in the movie , to be conducted on mtv s highestrated program but what will not be apparent to mtv viewers is that much of the programming will be part of a financially based arrangement between mtv , a unit of viacom , and the studio behind the film , metrogoldwynmayer the two entertainment companies have joined in a huge promotion aimed at building a more youthful following for a bond movie franchise old enough to be the father of most mtv viewers the arrangement will not be overtly disclosed , even on mtv programs like a special devoted exclusively to the film , including interviews with its stars , whose production costs are paid for , wholly or in part , by mgm mtv and studio executives said that the bond promotion , like many other mtv movie promotions in recent years , is a hybrid one part programming maneuver , intended to appeal to the channel s filminfatuated audience , and one part elaborately conceived and externally financed promotional announcement with elements of what is otherwise known in television as an infomercial in this case , the stakes are particularly high mtv is calling the campaign , pointing toward the opening on nov 19 of the world is not enough , the first global movie promotion mgm , which is controlled by the tracinda corporation , has taken the unusual step of releasing the film throughout the world within the same twoweek window and mtv , which has more viewers than ever before , is singing the movie s praises in music videos and special programs on affiliates reaching more than 300 million homes around the world for mgm , the deal adds up to worldwide access to mtv s audience of teenagers and college students for mtv , it adds up to another lucrative payday from its best customers , the movie studios as much as we are in television , said john shea , a senior mtv executive , we are also in business to say anything else would be naive this campaign is an understanding between smart marketing people the very title of mr shea s job suggests how business considerations go hand in hand with programming at the channel he is the senior vice president of franchise and sponsor development for mtv mr shea described the process of promoting films as a onehandwashinganother kind of arrangement he said that mtv had a specific movie team that meets each week to assess upcoming releases and identify ones likely to appeal to its young audience some recent examples included austin powers , the waterboy and both scream movies once a film is deemed a likely favorite for mtv viewers , mtv executives approach the studio that is distributing it about participating in a promotion if the studio agrees , it may be asked to put up money to produce a movie special for the channel , perhaps to supply the prizes for a giveaway and often to increase its purchase of ad time on mtv if a studio deems us a promotional partner , mr shea said , they also ought to deem us an appropriate mediabuy partner the studios , he said , were all already in business with mtv because of the amount of advertising money they committed to the channel before every tv season the socalled upfront market van toffler , the general manager of mtv , said that the channel s negotiations with movie studios as advertisers were no different from the negotiations any network would hold with clients but some studio executives complain that mtv s standing in the youth market gives it enough leverage to let it set a specific figure that a studio must spend in advertising before any promotion deal can be closed one executive , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said that mtv was far from alone in this practice that it had become widespread on cable television channels and even some broadcast networks but that mtv was the most aggressive a senior executive with another studio described mtv movie promotions as basically paid political advertising this executive called mtv a very efficient monopoly on youthful viewers and said of the channel s demands on advertisers to go along with the promotions , they drive a hard bargain , and it does n't matter how big you are mr shea did not agree it s not accurate to say there is a quid pro quo for the studios to buy more advertising , he said that s putting the cart before the horse first and foremost , he said , mtv s movie team , which includes representatives of several departments advertising and promotion , programming and even news must decide if the film will appeal to the channel s viewers and mr toffler disputed the idea that mtv creates infomercials for movies the studios do n't pay the whole costs of movie specials , he said we take on the decision to produce a program it s not as if they 're paying us for air time regarding the bond project , mr toffler was supported by gerry rich , the president of worldwide marketing for mgm , who said his studio had not been asked to increase its advertising budget despite the elaborate promotion he also said that while mgm had contributed cash to some of the productions connected to the promotion , it has been a harmonious arrangement it felt balanced in finding a welcome at mtv , mr shea said , the bond film was aided by its producers' decision to recruit the rock band garbage to sing its title song and to make the video that goes with it mtv also came up with the idea of tying the film promotion to its production of the mtv europe music awards , the european version of mtv s video music awards that event is set for nov 11 in dublin , and pierce brosnan , the current james bond , and denise richards , his costar in the world is not enough , will appear as presenters before the show , mtv will give away one of the bmw s that mr brosnan drives in the film another will be given away by ms richards on total request live , a daily mtv show mr toffler contended that no promotion decision , whether for advertising money or money for production , was ever made by mtv s programming department i do n't know what our ad guys say when they talk to the studios , he said , but none of that impacts any programming decisions he cited a number of independent films like the blair witch project and go , which he said mtv had backed with programs and other forms of coverage even though their production companies could not afford much , if any , advertising we are a slave to our audience , mr toffler said what our audience is desirous of seeing is our priority
under the dominating influence of bill parcells , who had to reshape the team in his image , the jets drafted 23 players over the first two years of his regime only the miami dolphins , led by the equally exigent jimmy johnson , drafted more now the jets appear to be closer to the team parcells wants so they go into the weekend s draft not having generated the wholesale deals and moves that led to all those previous draft choices the jets have only eight draft picks , none in the first round , and no more than one choice from the second through fifth rounds the jets could fail to come out of this draft with a starter , but they may find one if a quality guard a position at which they have virtually no starting experience is there for the taking at no 57 and yet , with the selfdescribed proactive parcells at the helm \( he made a halfdozen moves in his first two jets' drafts \) , draft analysts believe the jets will try to move up , even though they do not appear to have much to trade parcells insists that linebacker james farrior , his disappointing first pick of 1997 , is not on the trading block the coach did say , however , that he will listen to reasonable offers for the running back kick returner leon johnson , an impact performer in 1997 who was injured and less effective last year i do n't have much ammunition to move up , parcells said the jets recently cut todd burger , the starting left guard right guard matt o 'dwyer is still trying to land a job as a free agent the jets need two guards if they do not resign o 'dwyer , or if he goes elsewhere o 'dwyer s agent , tom condon , did not return phone calls seeking comment the draft is deep in offensive linemen doug brzezinski of boston college , an acclaimed guard , is unlikely to be around when the jets go shopping so far down in the second round but according to russell s lande , the former scouting administrator for the rams and editor of the draftrating publication gm jr there are guards who could be there when the jets pick one guy i like is craig heimburger of missouri he s the kind of player parcells goes for he attacks every play some teams may pass him over because of size i also think brandon burlsworth of arkansas and anthony cesario of colorado state are viable picks it will be sometime after 5 pm today , more than five hours after the draft begins , when the jets will finally have their chance perhaps by then parcells may even have a cornerback he covets he also wants a wide receiver out of this draft , and will consider a quarterback the agent whose career has been built on quarterbacks , leigh steinberg , describes this draft as the best for quarterbacks since 1983 jim kelly , john elway , dan marino and others there will still be a good quarterback at 57 , when the jets draft , he said the jets seem almost certain to take a quarterback this weekend vinny testaverde , 35 , is one of the club s strongest players and a workout workhorse he also is younger and healthier than marino and elway but the jets have to think of a quarterback for the future , and their experiment with ray lucas has been inconclusive the jets will also be taking a cornerback ray mickens , their no 3 corner , recently signed a oneyear deal he is unhappy that he is not more highly regarded , and his future as a jet remains problematic cornerbacks who could be available in later rounds include daylon mccutcheon of southern california and fred vinson of vanderbilt vinson is recovering from a foot injury and has not been seen at the scouting workouts extra points for the third year , the jets will be host to a free draftday party at the official all star cafe in times square more than 3 , 000 fans attended last year s party today s guests will include two of the newest jets , safety steve atwater and linebacker roman phifer , as well as the former jets joe klecko , marty lyons and bruce harper
charlie tabesh , the vice president of turner classic movies , a cable television channel devoted to classic movies , knew that despite being a confessed film fanatic , he had a significant gap in film knowledge , one that corresponded to a gap in his channel s programming i had seen 'hoop dreams' and 'the thin blue line , ' and they really had an enormous impact on me , mr tabesh said and i thought there had to be other films that had had enormous impact on people over the years resolving to learn more , mr tabesh began collecting books about documentaries , then decided to provide an outlet for the classics of the form the result is a festival that tcm is calling a century of reality , an assemblage of the top examples of documentary film in the 20th century these include early efforts like nanook of the north , robert flaherty s portrait of an eskimo hunter , and south , frank hurley s exploration of the polar expedition of sir ernest shackleton , on through examples of the soviet avantgarde films of the late 1920 s to a collection of world war ii films and contemporary classics like harlan county , usa and hoop dreams the festival begins tonight with three films by robert drew about the political career of john f kennedy primary , widely labeled as the first use of cinema verite as we have come to know it , is a behindthescenes look at kennedy s underdog campaign against senator hubert h humphrey in the wisconsin presidential primary in 1960 it is followed by crisis , a minutebyminute account of the confrontation between the kennedy administration and gov george c wallace over the admission of the first black students to the university of alabama in 1963 the drew trilogy concludes with a short film made the weekend after the kennedy assassination , faces of november , which has never been presented on television all three films have freshly restored prints a fourth film , four days in november , by mel stuart , follows the festival , which runs on tuesdays throughout this month , may be the most comprehensive exploration of the best documentaries of the 20th century ever presented on television but tcm did not do it because its vast libraries contained these films in fact , the channel owned almost none of them until mr tabesh set out to acquire the rights to them mr tabesh found himself fascinated by the history of the documentary but realized he knew little about it i 've never been to film school , he said i'm just a buff he consulted some film experts , including the director of the independent film association , betsy mclane , and bought a batch of books , including documentary film classics and documentary a history of the nonfiction film the research turned up lists that had many of the same titles there were films i knew we just had to have , mr tabesh said we had to include the leni reifenstahl films from before the war we needed those early classics like the shackleton film and i wanted to have the soviet movies because they were so experimental his research turned up some gems that are not widely known outside documentary circles , including one made by john huston in world war ii , the battle of san pietro , which presented combat so realistically that the army decided not to release it , and a film about the spanish civil war called the spanish earth , narrated by ernest hemingway assembling the collection was timeconsuming , mr tabesh said , but not expensive the time was spent locating the films , because , mr tabesh pointed out , there is no central studio library that houses many of them many are owned by governments , including the german government , which mr tabesh said still has a claim on the reifenstahl nazi films educational institutions own some , and so do museums the museum of modern art has the rights to the hemingway spanish civil war film , for example some had to be purchased from the britishbased film library , janus films , mr tabesh said but with interest in them not especially intense , and with few television outlets willing to present them , none of the films were dauntingly priced for the most part , this was very inexpensive , mr tabesh said he declined to put an overall price on the festival still , mr tabesh said , he became convinced early on that the key to the festival was the acquisition of the three kennedy films made by mr drew and the filmmaker had them now 75 and living in brooklyn , mr drew is still an active filmmaker he has two in the early stages of production , one about pain and what can be done about it , the other about his exploits in world war ii , when he was shot down behind enemy lines in italy and survived many close calls mr drew was relatively unknown in the late 1950 s when he first encountered john kennedy he had been looking for someone with the qualifications for a film idea he had long been contemplating having read the education of henry adams , mr drew said , he was struck by the author s contention that he was the last man who would truly know everything , but that someone would be born at about the time of his death who would come to think he could see it all mr drew said he saw kennedy give a speech in detroit early in his campaign , and at once i knew i had found that man kennedy really did believe he could see it all convinced he was in the presence of an extraordinary figure , mr drew approached kennedy and asked if he could be allowed what was then unprecedented access to his campaign
the chief executive of the warnerlambert company described the drug maker s rationale yesterday for proceeding with its proposed 72 billion merger with the american home products corporation and spurning a hostile , though more lucrative , overture by pfizer inc warnerlambert , which is headed by lodewijk j r de vink , agreed to a 72 billion merger with american home products on thursday but within hours of announcing that deal , pfizer , the maker of viagra and other drugs , began its own 80 billion hostile bid , an uncharacteristic move that rocked the usually genteel pharmaceutical industry and was rebuffed by warnerlambert mr de vink said in an interview from his office yesterday that even after meeting with william c steere , pfizer s chairman and chief executive , almost two weeks ago , pfizer has stopped short of a real offer mr de vink confirmed that he received a letter on oct 25 from mr steere regarding speculation that warnerlambert was considering a combination with another partner and that mr steere was interested in talking mr steere was right since july , warnerlambert and american home executives had been discussing a merger but before that letter , mr de vink said , he had no indication that pfizer was interested in anything other than the agreement the two companies had to develop and market warnerlambert s cholesterol treatment , lipitor there was never an expression to do more than expand the marketing agreement , said mr de vink during the next two days , mr de vink said , he met with his investment bankers at bear , stearns company and his board , which recommended that he meet with mr steere and find out what s on his mind at an oct 27 meeting in mr steere s offices at pfizer s headquarters in new york , mr de vink said , the conversation was vague and the two discussed several issues , including what role warner s management team would have in a combined company , what the makeup of the board would be , how a combination would affect shareholders and what the synergies between the two companies were it was not my question , 'what s in it for me \? ' mr de vink said he said that mr steere told him he had not discussed the combination with his board and asked whether the two men could talk at later date because he was busy with another transaction mr de vink would not say what company was involved , but industry executives said pfizer was trying to negotiate a merger with the monsanto company mr de vink told mr steere that a later meeting would be too late in an interview last week , mr steere declined to discuss his talks with mr de vink yesterday , mr steere was traveling and could not be reached for comment the next day , on oct 28 , mr de vink said the board of warnerlambert met and he apprised it of his meeting with mr steere it was no specific offer , mr de vink said , regarding the overture from pfizer it was nothing more than a letter he said he called mr steere and told him warnerlambert was not interested , in part because of the size differential and the fit is not in the best interest of the company or its shareholders he also said mr steere wished him good luck for almost a year , warnerlambert has examined its strategic options for the business going forward , mr de vink said , and hired consultants from mckinsey company to explore alternatives the merger with american home , mr de vink said , is for us a deal based on strategy further , i kept the board informed on every word with pfizer but despite mr de vink s explanation and despite the initial applause from analysts concerning the combination if warnerlambert shareholders were to vote for an merger with american home today , the most likely answer would be no as of friday s market close , pfizer s offer was higher , valued at 86875 a share for warner stockholders , despite the stock tumbling 67 percent american home s proposed offer was worth 8195 a share investors are expecting pfizer to sweeten its offer , either in more stock or some kind of price protection to offset any decline in their share price pfizer has to win , thomas mckillop , chief executive of astrazeneca , a rival european drug company , said in an interview in his london office yesterday if you put in a bid , you have to be prepared to see it through still , mr de vink lamented the recent turn of events warnerlambert executives are reviewing their liptor agreement with pfizer we did n't start this mudslinging thing , and i would n't want it to come to that , he said the company also plans to meet with its investors next week and the days ahead may be even more interesting that the last few in response to mr de vink s review of his meetings with mr steere , a pfizer spokeswoman said this none of this is relevant to what we 're trying to accomplish
seton hall university is moving up in the world ranked the 10th top party school in the nation last year by the princeton review , the 143yearold catholic university in south orange was promoted to 4th place in the guide s latest rankings made public last monday much to the consternation of school officials indeed , university officials insist the survey is clearly at odds with a university with nine schools and colleges that has a mission statement citing academic excellence , ethical development and valuescentered curricula but as edward t custard , an independent educational consultant who was the lead author of the guidebook , the best 331 colleges , explained , a party school is one where students report plentiful drug and alcohol use , popular fraternities and sororities and limited time spent studying outside the classroom seton hall ranked 13th in the category of students almost never study in the annual guide , florida state university in tallahassee was named the no 1 party school , just above its rival , the university of florida , in gainesville michigan state university in east lansing , was no 3 , followed by seton hall and the university of mississippi , in oxford the most sober campuses , according to the review , are brigham young university , wheaton college , the california institute of technology , the coast guard academy and the naval academy the guidebook lists the top 20 schools in 62 categories the university of arizona in tucson was named the number one jock school , the state university of new york in stony brook was the top school with dorms like dungeons , smith college was named the school with the most birkenstock wearing , treehugging , clovesmoking vegetarians and wheaton college was ranked the school with the most future rotarians and daughters of the american revolution the guide is based on surveys of 59 , 000 students conducted on 331 campuses during one of the past three academic years at seton hall , 83 of 4 , 500 undergraduates responded to a questionnaire in 1998 , said mr custard the university jumped in the charts because other more recently surveyed schools received fewer points , he said for example , last year s top two party schools , the state university of new york in albany and the university of wisconsin in madison dropped off the list but the college of new jersey in ewing township broke into the rankings at number 20 mr custard declined to give the exact results of the survey we do n't want to insert some kind of false precision in this we have never said that this is scientific result and we even say so in the book , he said we are doing a qualitative anecdotal survey we are going to colleges and talking to students much in the way that an individual student and his or her parents might do , the difference being that we speak to more students still , officials at seton hall are none too pleased lisa e grider , a university spokeswoman , called the results misleading and absurd she criticized the princeton review for not even visiting the campus last year we have a concern for our reputation because it s a false perception , ms grider said seton hall is a campus that has 2 , 000 residents the freshmen residence halls are dry we have no campus pub we have no fraternity or sorority houses a survey by the university s health and counseling services found that half of the student body does not drink , she said we have a hard enough time helping students through the peer pressure of drinking , ms grider said then we have to deal with this thing out there that sort of glorifies drinking we are swimming against the tide not only with peer pressure but also with the media jason d rowe , a sophomore and the director of sports for wsou , the seton hall radio station said he was concerned that parents would take the ranking seriously i would say it s not accurate at all , mr rowe said we laugh about it because it s so wrong about 50 percent of undergraduates commute , according to the university and most go home on the weekends , said mr rowe if there s anything going on , i do n't see it , he added mr custard said that people should lighten up about the party school status we do n't regard it as a negative at the princeton review what we are trying to do is give students and parents a sense of the personality of the school , he said they 'd never be in the book if we did n't think they were a top college and a place worth considering photo seton hall university in south orange was ranked the no 4 party school in the country by the princeton review , which listed it as no 10 a year earlier \( ozier muhammad the new york times \)
christ the king high school , where allen watson starred 11 years ago , is just a few miles from shea stadium , and his family home in middle village is close enough that dozens of his friends and family members sat behind home plate last night in his first outing as a met starting pitcher 12 days ago , watson said he had been distracted for a few innings by the excitement of pitching in a park so near to so much that mattered after he gave up consecutive home runs and trailed by 30 to montreal after just eight pitches that afternoon , watson did n't even look to his father in the stands , figuring that the rough outing had sent his father home early none of the 40 friends and relatives left last night they blew into their hands to stave off the cold and were rewarded with a controlled and mature performance by watson in the mets' 72 victory over the san francisco giants , one of the teams he pitched for before returning home to queens watson tied a career high with eight strikeouts he struck out the side in the fourth and gave up just three hits and three walks in five innings watson s second victory of the season came over the team that began the game with the national league s best record \( it is now 168 \) and figures to be the mets' primary competition for a wildcard spot at the end of the season he did not look to his father last night , either , but this time because he figured his father was so anxious , he was outside smoking he gets really nervous , watson said my mom does n't even come , so that tells you something i want to do well for them , my friends and family watson did so well that he is making himself a candidate to remain in the rotation , even when rick reed returns from a calf injury , probably next week watson had command of all of his pitches last night , but particularly relied on a twoseam changeup he had worked on with reliever john franco given a 40 lead after the first inning , watson struggled just once , in the fifth inning as he was running out of gas but he allowed just one run , and then struck out ellis burks and jeff kent , the third and fourth batters in the order , to end the inning we gave him a lead and he knew what to do with it , said manager bobby valentine , whose team improved to 149 for them to get just one run with the middle of the order coming up was the key to the game we like what we see he s doing exactly what we hoped he 'd do he used up everything he had and it turned out to be enough giants pitcher shawn estes was not nearly as composed as watson he walked rickey henderson to open the first inning , then yielded a single to edgardo alfonzo \( whose four hits tied a career high \) that sent henderson to third after striking out john olerud and with a 31 count on mike piazza , estes was called for a balk by bob davidson , the home plate umpire , for what appeared to be a slight bobbing of his head henderson came home at the same time as estes the pitcher stalked toward home plate seeking an explanation but was pushed away first by catcher scott servais and then by manager dusty baker but estes remained rattled he walked piazza , then gave up a double to robin ventura that scored alfonzo on four straight pitches he walked mike kinkade to load the bases on a 10 count to brian mcrae , estes threw a wild pitch and piazza scored the third run of the inning estes walked mcrae to load the bases again rey ordonez s grounder to third base was fielded by charlie hayes , who tagged kinkade on the run but allowed ventura to score to give the mets a 40 lead estes settled down briefly after that , until ventura smashed an 01 fastball into the rightfield bullpen in the fifth inning for a 51 lead but watson had been threatened in the top half of the fifth , too , and his artful escape from potential disaster with just that one run scored served as the coda to his evening dennis cook yielded a home run to servais in the sixth , but after cook walked two straight batters in the seventh , turk wendell came in to strike out kent , which , valentine said , was virtually the save wendell got an official save , too , his first of the season inside pitch it now seems less likely that rick reed , who has been on the disabled list since april 12 with a slight tear in his right calf , will pitch tomorrow either in new york or in a rehabilitation assignment reed will throw on the side today , manager bobby valentine said , and general manager steve phillips said the team would probably determine the rotation sometime this weekend bobby bonilla , who has a partial tear of the posterior cruciate ligament in his right knee , hit in batting practice yesterday with no pain bonilla last started a week ago photo robin ventura stroking a double and driving in a run last night \( g paul burnett the new york times \)
he was the pavarotti of his age thus thomas hampson describes mattia battistini , whose nearly fivedecade reign as don giovanni and rigoletto , as the william tell of rossini and the hamlet of ambroise thomas in opera houses from rome to london by way of st petersburg at the turn of the century featured no episode stranger than his assumption of the title role of jules massenet s werther goethe s manicdepressive standardbearer of sturm und drang , you see , entered the operatic realm as a tenor , while battistini was a baritone the king of baritones , according to a phrase that stuck mr hampson is a baritone , too , and it is battistini s werther that he introduces at the metropolitan opera in the revival opening on monday evening massenet would no doubt approve , having prepared this version himself how singular is this case \? in some ways , not at all since the dawn of opera in the early 17th century , with or without authorization from the creators , scores have been adjusted every which way to capitalize on performers' gifts or to accommodate their limitations in the original printed score of monteverdi s orfeo , the genre s first lasting masterpiece , we discover the hero s climactic address to the king of hell in two parallel settings one is plain , the other flamboyantly embellished in the mouth of the right singer , either stirs the heart stars of handel s and mozart s day studded revivals of past seasons' novelties with arias customtailored for them , often by hands not the original composer s as for switched vocal categories , they are scarcely rare to look no farther than the stable of warhorses , light sopranos monopolized rosina in il barbiere di siviglia for generations , never mind that rossini intended the role for a mezzosoprano still , none of these instances match that of the baritone werther , whose lines massenet s pencil rethreaded into the surrounding musical fabric , leaving the rest untouched we may never find out just how and why this curio came to be paul thomason s article darkening 'werther , ' in the current opera news , summarizes the tale of its genesis , recent rediscovery and only previous modern revival , by the seattle opera in 1991 , starring dale duesing rodney milnes , the great massenet champion , provides other background in his article on the work for the new grove dictionary of opera but mysteries remain some key points on the time line are these massenet completed werther in 1887 leon carvalho , the director of the operacomique in paris , dashed the composer s hopes for a premiere at that most desirable of houses , finding the subject too morose not until 1892 did the work reach the stage , in vienna , on the coattails of the local premiere of manon the first werther was ernest van dyck , a belgian renowned as wagner s parsifal and lohengrin , though he failed to win massenet s approval as goethe s byronic suicide , shipwrecked on the reefs of bourgeois respectability over the next decade productions followed in paris , the french provinces , the united states and italy , but the work began really to catch on only when the operacomique \( now directed by albert carr \) revived it in 1903 massenet felt that among the early exponents of the title role , only jean de reszke , of poland , was on the right track in 1894 , his werther made the rounds in chicago , new york and london another prize wagnerian but less prone than the rest to demonstrative operatic convention , de reszke , at 44 , captured the character s unhinged quality , his vulnerability the singer s timbre dark and seductive was greatly admired , too as it happens , he began his career as a baritone the battistini version , a footnote in the performance history , dates from 1902 , when the dedicatee was 46 who knows \? if the paris audience , which never heard de reszke as werther at all , had heard him perform the part in his prime , the baritone version might not exist but should the role ever have been entrusted to wagnerians in the first place \? \( nowadays impresarios cast werther no heavier than a spinto the most distinguished interpreter of the role in the last quartercentury was alfredo kraus , of spain , a lyric tenor and proud of it \) maybe the battistini experiment represents massenet s lastditch attempt to rescue a score he loved from encroaching oblivion maybe once the original found its place in the affections of the public , the alternative lost its raison d'etre in any case , it vanished with battistini , unperformed and unsought until mr duesing learned of it by chance mr hampson will be only the third singer to perform it onstage , the more you suffer , the better , placido domingo has said it s what i like best suffering is werther s stock in trade , as goethe s title , the sorrows of young werther , attests the novel , in epistolary form with editorial interjections , contrives to present the hero both from his own tempestuous point of view and with chilling clinical detachment understandably so , since , as the young goethe knew all too well , werther s fate might have been his own the hallmark of massenet s portrayal is compassion , yet he does not play goethe false
three by martha graham pyramid home video 2995 distributed by dance horizons videos \( 8002207149 \) with nothing like a picasso s picassos imprimatur or a stravinsky conducts stravinsky selling point , the modestly titled three by martha graham dramatically plays down the fact that the aweinspiring graham herself performs in two of the three choreographic works specially filmed for television made in 1969 , the year of graham s final performances on stage as a dancer , when she reluctantly left the stage at the age of 76 , these films probably reminded her of that painful period for one reason or another , therefore , the video of cortege of eagles , seraphic dialogue and acrobats of god , with graham leading the first and last of these , has had a low profile during the past 30 years it deserves a higher one in advance of bringing her company and repertory to lincoln center in 1984 , graham recalled that when she performed she danced not for 3 , 000 people , but for the one ! that singular focus dominates every moment of graham s performing captured on in these films , even those that reveal the debilitations of age as the purplecloaked hecuba in cortege of eagles , which concerns the calamity of the trojan war , and , in a cerise caftan as the implacable yet teasing mistress of the dance classroom in acrobats of god , graham is consistently riveting betraying a tragic dignity in the former and wielding a delicate comic demeanor in the latter , the maker of these dances remains their incomparable interpreter none of this goes to say that graham is presented in a vacuum the savvy of her stagecraft , supported by isamu noguchi s marvelous settings and props , makes her study of greek drama , or her sly look at classic carryingon in a dance studio , as rich as any classical edifice the supporting players are all strong and vivid mary hinkson s splendid joan of arc in seraphic dialogue and matt turney s soaring helen of troy in cortege of eagles are but two standouts john bulter is credited with adapting these stage works for television , but it would seem that graham s keen eye was as much over his shoulder as center stage except for a few tracking bands that appear toward the end , the tape s production is very good , and even if it were less so , the records of graham s performing are priceless anyone interested in catching graham work live can drop in at the joyce theater in chelsea , where her company is performing through feb 21 robert greskovic photo seraphic dialogue , choreographed by martha graham in 1965 \( pyramid media \)
cologne , germany , june 19 the european union today announced plans to provide 15 billion during the next three years for the reconstruction of kosovo as the west tried to map out a strategy that would channel money to the wardevastated area without giving financial support to a serbia controlled by slobodan milosevic gunter burghardt , the directorgeneral for the european union s balkan policy , said the 15nation bloc would provide 500 million annually over three years to kosovo irrespective of whether milosevic is there or not he added that the yugoslav president , indicted by the international war crimes tribunal last month , had to be isolated we have to get rid of the source of the cancer that has been spreading throughout the region over the past eight years , mr burghardt , that means we have to isolate mr milosevic and put democratic institutions in his place but on the second day of a summit meeting of the seven leading industrialized countries and russia , sharp differences emerged between moscow and the west on whether any aid should be given to serbia following nato s 11week bombardment samuel r berger , the white house national security adviser , indicated that russian objections had foiled plans to include in the group s final communique on sunday a statement that no funds for reconstruction would be given to serbia as long as mr milosevic was in power i believe the communique probably , therefore , will not address the issue , he said , adding , i do n't know whether the russians would agree to a statement that money would not go to serbia as long as milosevic is there the dispute illustrated the ways in which kosovo continues to complicate relations between washington and moscow and suggested that the agendas pursued by nato and russian forces in the province may not always be identical or even similar the european union s announcement came on a day that leaders devoted largely to kosovo and possible financial support for the debtridden russian economy russia s prime minister , sergei v stepashin , is also attending the talks , and president boris n yeltsin is expected to arrive on sunday french officials said mr stepashin , who took office last month , had argued forcefully for aid for serbia , saying that the conduct of mr milosevic could not be allowed to prejudice millions of serbs other officials said italy , whose relations with belgrade are better than those of most western powers , had given some support to the russian position , arguing that the serbian people should not be collectively punished russia s broad support for its traditional orthodox christian serbian allies has been strong throughout the kosovo war , but tempered by the fact that mr yeltsin has no personal affection for mr milosevic mr berger said we will not take part in a reconstruction program so long as mr milosevic is the president of yugoslavia but he added that the united states would be prepared to participate in limited programs of what he called humanitarian assistance to serbia through the united nations , the red cross or other agencies it was clear today that a sea change has occurred since the 1995 dayton peace for bosnia , reached with mr milosevic s help there is a decisively new level of outrage against the serbian leader but the exact direction of policy toward mr milosevic still appeared unclear aggressive financial aid for kosovo , while largely isolating the rest of serbia as long as he remains in power , presents several difficulties , western officials said these include the fact that kosovo formally remains part of serbia , that it has no independent financial institutions capable of negotiating for loans , that its long border with the rest of serbia is likely to be porous , and that it cannot indefinitely survive in institutional limbo it may also prove extremely difficult to help montenegro , the other surviving republic in today s truncated yugoslavia , while avoiding support for mr milosevic the west has indicated that it wants to accentuate the isolation of the serbian leader by supporting montenegro s democratically inclined government another problem is that it may prove extremely difficult to draw a line between the emergency aid for food , medicine and shelter that the united states today indicated a willingness to give to serbia , and the kind of broad support for reconstruction and development that washington wants to avoid as long as mr milosevic is in power there is a very important distinction to be drawn between human assistance and reconstruction , mr berger said , but where the line lies is not selfevident he added that food was on one side of the line and rebuilding industry or their basic infrastructure is on the other side of the line but he asked is getting electric lights back on for the winter humanitarian , or is it reconstruction \? he said he did not know the answer britain took a harder position than the united states today , saying it would not take part in a financial aid program of any kind to serbia as long as mr milosevic was in power charities could provide any necessary emergency assistance , british officials said mr burghardt said that the european union had decided to set up a special agency to deal with aid for the balkans and that a special international donors' conference for kosovo would be convened in july on emergency assistance , with another later this year on more detailed aid joly dixon , a senior european union financial official , said financial support would be concentrated on kosovo in a first stage , to be followed by other countries affected by the war and finally the balkan region as a whole the clinton administration official said teams from the united states were already in kosovo assessing needs for the first conference in july between july and the fall , he added , there would be a more intensive effort involving the world bank , the european union and others just how much the united states will spend on kosovo reconstruction remains unclear , although europe has indicated that it will bear most of the burden in bosnia , more than 5 billion was pledged over four years , with europe paying more than half but actual payments proved slow , holding back reconstruction it was clear in the leaders' discussions today that for the first time since the wars of yugoslavia s destruction began eight years ago , the west has decided to approach the crisis in the balkans in a broad way after a long period of hesitation , the specific prospect of membership in the european union has been held out to croatia , bosnia , macedonia , albania and yugoslavia itself , providing that democracy and a market economy are convincingly installed but just how stability can be reached while kosovo s status and future remain so vague was an issue that none of the western powers appeared inclined to address today in effect , the west has decided to help the province as if it were independent while adhering to a policy that says such independence will not be granted the leaders also devoted sometime today to the question of who should occupy the pivotal top civilian post in kosovo , without taking a decision in effect , the official , to be known as the special representative of the united nations secretary general , will be a kind of proconsul in a province marked by an extraordinary administrative void among the tasks facing the administrator will be coordination and channeling of the various forms of assistance now being offered by the west , and the delicate management of any relations with belgrade photo leaders of the major industrial powers and russia posed for a photograph at european union summit talks in cologne , germany europe announced a threeyear , 15 billion plan yesterday to reconstruct kosovo \( reuters \) \( pg 12 \)
frankfurt , may 24 it is still europe s biggest telephone company and it still seems intent on spending billions of dollars on acquisitions around the world but deutsche telekom ag lost more than just a takeover battle when olivetti spa trumped its 81 billion bid to acquire italy s dominant phone carrier , telecom italia it also suffered at least two costly blows to its global aspirations all but destroying its alliance with france telecom , which accused deutsche telekom of doubledealing when it made its italian bid the french utility is now suing that rift threatens to destroy global one , the two companies' moneylosing joint venture with sprint of the united states that provides worldwide business services olivetti s victory also greatly strengthens a formidable rival of deutsche telekom , mannesmann ag mannesmann is its biggest competitor in germany in both wireless and traditional phone services , and it has important stakes in other european countries as part of olivetti s plan to finance the takeover , mannesmann will buy olivetti s stake in italy s secondlargest cellular phone carrier , omnitel pronto italia , as well as infostrada , a competitor to telecom italia in fixedline services mannesmann will pay 76 billion euros , or about 81 billion mannesmann struck gold , said dwayne taylor , a telecommunications analyst at robert fleming securities they paid a reasonable price for a very good property , which is n't too easy to do these days ron sommer , deutsche telekom s chairman , is to meet with the board on tuesday to sort through the company s options over the weekend , mr sommer hinted that he had not given up and was ready to discuss an alliance with olivetti s chairman , roberto colaninno but while mr colaninno left himself open to such talks , most analysts doubt that olivetti has any interest in giving up its hardwon control people close to deutsche telekom say that mr sommer is certain to attempt other international moves in the months ahead both deutsche telekom and mannesmann are believed to have bid about 16 billion for one2one , the british cellular phone company that has been put up for sale by its owners , cable and wireless plc and the mediaone corporation mr sommer has made it clear that he is looking for acquisitions in the united states , as well deutsche telekom plans to raise more than 10 billion through a stock offering later this year , and mr sommer has said that the money will be used to finance international expansion it already owns 10 percent of sprint , one of the largest longdistance carriers in the united states but france telecom also owns 10 percent of sprint and would almost certainly try to block a german takeover mr sommer seems increasingly pressed by hostile challengers within germany , deutsche telekom has lost nearly 30 percent of its domestic longdistance market to new rivals since the market was deregulated at the start of 1998 though mr sommer stabilized the decline by cutting prices as much as 70 percent in recent months , the cost has been high deutsche telekom s revenue declined 67 percent in the first quarter of 1999 and earnings from continuing businesses fell 19 percent at the same time , mannesmann has become an extraordinarily powerful rival once an oldline manufacturing conglomerate known for industrial pipes and automotive equipment , mannesmann has transformed itself into a fastgrowing telecommunications business it controls germany s second cellular phone license through mannesmann mobilfunk , whose partners include att and airtouch communications , and is running about even with deutsche telekom s cellular subsidiary mannesmann has also become the biggest rival in fixedline phone service it controls a competing german telephone network called arcor , and recently bought the country s thirdbiggest competitor , otelo , from veba ag in some ways , mannesmann is ahead of deutsche telekom in building a paneuropean business as a partner in france with vivendi sa , it owns minority stakes in the country s secondlargest wireless carrier , sfr , and in cegetel , france telecom s competitor in traditional phone services mannesmann also owns a majority stake in telering , an austrian company that acquired that country s fourth cellular phone license earlier this month telering already operates highspeed phone networks in austria for business customers now mannesmann appears to have outmaneuvered deutsche telekom in italy , europe s fastestgrowing mobile phone market though competition has been slow to take off in italy s traditional telephone market , it has been booming in cellular phones by acquiring control of omnitel from olivetti , mannesmann will control national franchises in europe s two biggest markets the highly profitable mobile phone business will make it easier for mannesmann to finance its attack on the traditional telephone market , including deutsche telekom mannesmann has also been fortifying its war chest it recently raised 31 billion through europe s biggest corporate bond offering to date mr sommer and deutsche telekom face competition , as well , from companies building highspeed european fiber optic networks these include british telecommunications plc colt telecommunications plc , which is building highspeed fiber optic rings in cities across europe , and mci worldcom , which is building a broad network as well yet as olivetti s remarkable success made clear , mr sommer failed to convince institutional investors that combining the two former national monopolies could overcome these competitive threats when deutsche telekom executives paraded their forthcoming stock offering in a road show on both sides of the atlantic , many were sharply critical they did n't provide enough information , said michael schneider , portfolio manager at deka telemedien , a large german mutual fund as olivetti proceeded with its own tender offer , deutsche telekom s shares stagnated to the point where its allstock offer was only marginally higher than olivetti s offer of 1150 in cash and securities their big miscalculation was thinking that this would be the panacea for investors , mr taylor of robert fleming securities said the industrial plan was not brilliant by any stretch of the imagination and it seems hard to believe that mr sommer can patch up his alliance with france telecom asserting that deutsche telekom broke contractual agreements by making the italian bid without consulting its partner , france telecom filed a lawsuit last week seeking damages thus far , neither the french nor the german phone utilities have said that they would break up global one , which provides global networking services for multinational companies that venture has lost hundreds of millions of dollars , and none of the partners have been happy but without it , analysts say deutsche telekom will be hard pressed to keep up with other international alliances

washington the republican pollster linda divall and the republican presidential candidate elizabeth dole are , in many ways , an odd couple they differ in style , with ms divall s blunt , matteroffact demeanor containing none of the sugary flourishes that garnish mrs dole they disagree on some issues , with ms divall supporting a woman s right to a legal abortion and mrs dole expressing deep moral qualms about it in fact , after ms divall was hired to work on mrs dole s bid for the republican presidential nomination earlier this year , a few republicans contacted the dole campaign to protest the decision they did n't think i was conservative enough , ms divall said over lunch last week , smiling wryly at the thought the criticism , ms divall said , ignored her work in the past for politicians who are not exactly considered moderates the former house speaker newt gingrich sprang quickly to her mind more important , the critics were missing a larger point that spoke to just how hard ms divall would be willing to fight for mrs dole , just how much ms divall cared about this candidate s success for ms divall , the dole campaign is not just another contract , another source of income , another line on her resume it s history , ms divall said , referring to the fact that no one before mrs dole had attempted a serious , viable female candidacy for the presidency to be part of that was something that i thought would be terrific so much so that in january , on the day after mrs dole announced that she was going to leave her job as president of the american red cross , ms divall visited the organization s headquarters to introduce and pitch herself to mrs dole it was a case of one republican trailblazer hooking arms with another in 1985 , when ms divall started her firm , american viewpoint inc , which has offices in alexandria , va , she was the first female pollster in the republican party to strike out on her own today , ms divall , 46 , is one of the halfdozen bestknown pollsters in the party because she is the only woman on that list , she is assumed to be particularly attuned to the way female voters feel about republican candidates over the last two decades , women have generally shown a stronger preference for democrats that gender gap has been a subject of enormous frustration and intense study for ms divall , whose own lifelong allegiance to the republican party arises from her belief that the federal government should be leaner and less quick to assume that it has the prescriptions for all social maladies a significant part of the gap , ms divall said , has to do with women s less certain purchase on economic security and more ingrained roles as caretakers those realities , she said , incline women to expect the government to play an actively protective role that is more in line with democratic ideology and oratory but , she added , another force pushing women away from republicans is more easily fixed , and that is what she described as the judgmental , intolerant , scolding and dour attitude that too many republican politicians project much of the polling she has done for republicans is intended to help them find the right terms and tenor for articulating their smallergovernment message without seeming callous ms divall similarly coaches candidates who oppose abortion on less preachy enunciations of their beliefs there s not always going to be a softening , ms divall said , referring to a candidate s position and i'm not trying to do that but i'm trying to say that there are others out there with different views , and they are not irrelevant she would rather be golfing when she left mount prospect , ill , the chicago suburb where her mother and her father , an extremely successful accountant , raised her and two younger sisters , she headed to arizona state university with the goals of getting rid of my hay fever and becoming a professional golfer i failed on both counts , she said a political science professor with his own polling company exposed her to that line of work , which appealed to her appreciation for measurable truths i thought , who could possibly dispute the person who had the numbers in a campaign \? ms divall said little did i know ms divall , who is unmarried and childless , first did research and other work for the republican national committee and for the national republican congressional committee by the time she struck out on her own , she had made all the right moves she was a real pioneer , said christine matthews , 35 , a republican pollster for another company additionally , ms matthews said , she challenges the party s status quo , and she challenges assumptions that the party ca n't be inclusive ms divall can often be found with a five iron at the mount vernon country club , which allows women to play golf at any time of the weekend not just during prescribed periods of the day unlike some other clubs around washington she loves the game enough that last year , when a political trade journal asked her to name her favorite books , she listed ben hogan s five fundamental lessons of golf alongside the ayn rand novel atlas shrugged ms divall knows that mrs dole lags far behind gov george w bush of texas in the polls , but she is not discouraged she said that mrs dole could yet prove to be a magnet for those who do not typically vote republican anybody s who s paying attention to this race is probably guilty of deviant behavior , ms divall said most voters wo n't tune in until a year from now photo linda divall , elizabeth dole s pollster , wants to close a gender gap \( shana raab for the new york times \)
for 60 years , pierre matisse , the youngest son of the painter henri matisse , shaped american taste in modern art through his gallery in new york he was the first dealer to show the works of miro , balthus , giacometti and dubuffet and championed many others artists , including chagall , rouault , de chirico and tanguy among the collectors who sought him out were james thrall soby \( from 1933 \) , wright ludington \( from 1934 \) , edward g robinson \( from 1935 \) , walter p chrysler jr \( from 1935 \) and joseph pulitzer jr \( from 1936 \) matisse s particular appreciation of soby , later a trustee and benefactor of the museum of modern art , is recounted in the following excerpt from matisse father and son , a biography by john russell published this month by harry n abrams , inc other things being equal , pierre matisse preferred not to sell to people for whom he had no respect what he really liked was to work consistently with collectors whom he knew well discerning clients were fundamental to the longterm plans that pierre had for the gallery this was not simply because of the financial support for which some of them could be counted upon it was because , through them , the work of joan miro , alberto giacometti and jean dubuffet not to mention others would become a part of the imaginative climate of the united states pierre did not want his artists to come into town , like a traveling circus , and go away again he wanted them to stay a prime catch , in that context , was james thrall soby , a loyal and longtime patron of the gallery he did not need to be led to the new and the good he was the complete professional , whether as a curator , a collector , a writer on art or an exhibition organizer in all these contexts he was mr modernism convivial by nature , he had known alberto giacometti in paris since the early 1930 s in 1933 he was a pioneer among american enthusiasts for balthus he could describe exactly how joan miro had once danced the tango at a gallery opening with not a slide , nor a figure , nor the least step forgotten later , he was to sit side by side with piet mondrian in the early 1940 s as a member of the jury that chose the artists for peggy guggenheim s forthcoming exhibitions he was to know brancusi well in paris after world war ii , and he was one of marcel duchamp s two witnesses when duchamp became an american citizen in 1955 when buying a picture , he had a deadcenter sense of honor when taken to call on giorgio morandi in bologna , he asked that seraphic and undemanding master of still life if he could buy a recent painting that he especially liked and , if so , what it would cost morandi named a figure that was absurdly small soby could not help saying that dealers in milan were asking almost exactly a hundred times as much for comparable paintings by morandi talking about prices makes me nervous , said morandi if you go on objecting , i 'll cut the price in half soby also had a sense of joy in life that made him an irresistible and not seldom ribald companion after a visit to the matisses in new jersey , he wrote i noticed that the new jersey air is a decided aphrodisiac noticed anything unusual \?

brussels , june 5 despite the apparent imminence of a peace deal , nato kept up the bombing of yugoslavia today an act that allied diplomats said riled russia so much that moscow delayed a meeting with secretary of state madeleine k albright of the united states and the foreign ministers of the six other leading industrial nations the meeting had been planned for bonn on sunday german officials said ms albright , foreign minister igor s ivanov of russia and their counterparts were now expected to meet on monday to draft a united nations security council resolution approving the peacekeeping mission for kosovo and putting the serbian province under international civil administration so that reconstruction can begin the british general who will command the peacekeepers met today with yugoslav officers on the macedonian border to present them with the terms for their withdrawal within seven days from kosovo as soon as yugoslavia inactivates and withdraws air defense radars , missiles , and antiaircraft artillery from serbia , and lowflying allied aircraft can see that serbian forces are actually starting to move out of kosovo , nato officials said , the alliance will halt the bombing but they said that would probably not happen before sunday evening , and that monday was probably the earliest that peacekeepers would be ready to start moving in russia was insisting that mr ivanov would not attend the foreign ministers' meeting in bonn until the bombing stopped , according to one diplomat here russia apparently also failed to take up an invitation to send an observer to the talks between lieut gen sir michael jackson of britain and the yugoslav army in macedonia president slobodan milosevic of yugoslavia told european union and russian negotiators in belgrade on thursday that , after 10 weeks of bombing , he was ready to accept allied terms , pull his 40 , 000 troops , paramilitaries and police forces out of kosovo , and allow international peacekeepers to escort nearly 15 million ethnic albanian refugees back to their ruined homes one thing we have learned about president milosevic is that we cannot take his word on anything , jamie p shea , the alliance s spokesman , said in explaining this morning why the allies had not stopped their attacks we are determined to put belgrade to the test , he said allied ambassadors planned to meet in brussels on sunday to approve an operational order enabling general jackson to start moving his forces in as early as monday the order would determine how the peacekeepers would respond to attacks against them or to violations of the withdrawal terms , and would spell out what the peacekeepers should do if they find people indicted by the international tribunal in the hague for war crimes committed by yugoslav and serbian forces in kosovo , mr shea said serbian forces were still engaged today in intense fighting with ethnic albanian rebel soldiers of the kosovo liberation army on the border between albania and kosovo , mr shea said nato forces concentrated most of the bombing on friday and saturday on serbian units in that area , attacking 9 tanks , 21 armored personnel carriers , 30 artillery pieces , 5 mortar positions and fortified troop positions maj gen walter jertz , a spokesman for the allied military command , said only antiaircraft guns and a shoulderfired missile had shot at nato planes today , but that none had been hit allied planes flew 536 separate missions between friday and saturday , officials said besides agreeing to a very specific and complete withdrawal of military and police forces , mr shea said , the yugoslavs are also expected to give general jackson complete information about all mines in kosovo , and withdraw all aircraft , air defense , radars and communications systems the peacekeepers would also be expected to see to it that the kosovo liberation army is disbanded and disarmed , though general jertz said today that this was a difficult issue ethnic albanian leaders agreed to disarmament when they signed an accord in paris in march mr milosevic s refusal to accept that agreement led to the start of nato s bombing campaign on march 24 with the allies now focused on planning for peacekeeping , british defense ministry officials in london announced today that 7 , 500 more british troops would move to general jackson s command in macedonia by june 13 , making the british , with 13 , 000 soldiers , the largest single contributor to the peacekeeping force britain , france , germany , and other european countries now have about 15 , 000 troops in macedonia , most of whom would go into kosovo as peacekeepers the united states and france have said they would provide 7 , 000 troops each for the peacekeeping operation , which nato plans to call joint guardian the rest of the 47 , 868 soldiers already pledged would come from other nato european countries and 11 other eastern european and nonaligned nations , all of which have confirmed their offers of participation with the allied command , mr shea said today the allies would like to have russian forces join them , but have not yet worked out command arrangements with moscow , which is unwilling to put its soldiers under nato command we hope in coming days to sit at a table and see what russia can contribute and how , mr shea said nato will do its best to find a formula that could associate the russians chancellor gerhard schroder of germany has proposed a longterm stability pact for the balkans to encourage international investment romano prodi , the new president of the 15nation european union s executive commission , has estimated the costs of reconstructing and supporting the two million people of kosovo at about 6 billion a year for at least five years  serbs shell refugee area in albania tirana , albania , june 5 \( ap \) serbian forces shelled an albanian town crowded with refugees late today , killing one person and sending relief workers and residents fleeing into cellars , international officials said eight shells , directed at an albanian army barracks , exploded in kruma , five miles west of the yugoslav border , officials of the organization for security and cooperation in europe said late friday , serbian forces shelled albanian territory near the border , killing an 18yearold woman in the village of golaj , the officials said the kla news service said serbian forces attacked villages around malisevo , 21 miles southwest of pristina , the capital of kosovo , with tanks and mortars
paris , june 6 andre agassi played the first two sets of the most important match of his life like a petrified pretender today then , when the shock and embarrassment failed to destroy him , he gathered his wits about him and played like someone who deserved to be in the company of rod laver , fred perry , roy emerson and don budge by capturing the french open singles title with a 16 , 26 , 64 , 63 , 64 victory over andre medvedev , agassi became the fifth man in tennis history to win all four grand slam events the australian , french and united states opens and wimbledon and completed the latest and most significant turnaround in a career marked by flashes of brilliance amid unfilled promise ranked no 1 in the world for 30 weeks in 1995 , agassi went into a spiral that dropped his ranking as low as 141st in november 1997 he took a long hiatus that year during which it was uncertain whether he would return to the sport but he resurrected his career , beginning by accepting wildcard entries to several satellite tournaments after his victory today , his ranking will rise from no 14 to no 4 it almost feels like it was just sheer destiny , agassi said but this was destiny abetted by his will and mobility when he puts his mind to it , there are few hurdles in tennis that the 29yearold agassi , a professional since 1986 , cannot clear he won his first grand slam tournament at wimbledon in 1992 , even though he has never had the serveandvolley power game that tournament favors when he won the 1994 united states open , he was unseeded and he collected his third grand slam title , at the 1995 australian open , on his first visit there agassi is the only man to win the four grand slam events on three different surfaces when laver , perry , emerson and budge captured the tournaments , the french open was played on the clay of roland garros and the other three were played on grass now the australian and united states opens are on hardcourts while wimbledon remains on grass his opponent today , the no 100ranked medvedev of ukraine , was the lowestranked man to play for the french open championship he played the most inspired tennis of his life to gain his first grand slam final , defeating secondseeded pete sampras along the way , but ultimately gave way to a force beyond his control i'm human , medvedev said i left my heart and soul on the court , i played 110 percent of my human abilities but you have to remember on the other side of the net is andre agassi medvedev added when we went to the third set , he was n't yet the greatest player of our decade now he has an argument to be the best player he s making the history he has the right to say now that he s a greater player than , let s say , pete , by winning all four grand slams like the veteran steffi graf s comeback victory over martina hingis in the women s final on saturday , today s theatrics by agassi , a loser in french open finals in 1990 and 1991 , seemed the stuff of fairy tales he was not only returning from the depths of the tennis ranking , but playing just a few months after the end of his twoyear marriage to the actress brooke shields i'm a proven war dog , agassi said after extricating himself from a twosetstonone deficit for the third time in his career he added although i could have lived with it , losing would have been devastating to me the truth of it is that anything can happen if you keep working , but you also fear the worst that s the nature of competition there s always battles in your head an apprehensive but optimistic agassi strutted onto center court and was promptly dwarfed by the 6foot4inch medvedev and the power tennis clinic he conducted agassi lost the first set in 19 minutes and surrendered the second 33 minutes later with flashbacks of his failures in his first three grand slam finals forcing him onward , agassi buckled down spurred by some terse advice from his coach , brad gilbert , during a 20minute rain delay after the first game of the second set , he stopped playing from panic and began pacing himself like a pro i was pulling triggers i should n't have pulled in some cases , agassi said while recalling his conversation with gilbert he assured me that he felt shot for shot i was better , if i would just work hard , hustle , move my feet and strike the ball effectively while his fans chanted his name and exhorted him with the wave , agassi began to make inroads on medvedev s serve in the third set he broke medvedev with a forehand line drive to take a 42 lead and then , with rain sprinkling the court , immediately gave back the break by losing a game at love after doublefaulting to break point at 44 , he held for 54 and broke medvedev at love for the set with a perfectly timed backhand drop shot determined to maintain his momentum , agassi broke serve for a 20 lead in the fourth set and never let medvedev back into it by the final set it was the 24yearold medvedev who was doubting himself and rushing his shots agassi , a veteran of some 30 fiveset matches , closed in like a bloodhound and broke for a 32 lead trailing by 53 , medvedev saved three match points , the first of them with his

the boy on the green bicycle a memoir by margaret diehl 309 pp new york soho press 25 toward the end of margaret diehl s memoir , the boy on the green bicycle , she describes a typical moment from her , or anyone s , adolescence i opened the bakery box , let the smell drift out , picked up whatever novel i was reading my eyes hooked to the first sentence my hand brought the eclair to my lips , i bit through chocolate and pastry the skill and terror of this memoir are such , however , that the reader now understands that this is a violent scene , as potentially lethal to the young diehl as a speeding car ostensibly , diehl s book concerns another , very literal , speeding car the one that killed her 14yearold brother , jimmy , who was riding his new green bicycle home from a friend s house one february evening in 1965 she traces the impact of that tragedy on the family her mother , her father , her older sister , herself and her younger brother with impressionistic density , describing in thick detail their life before the accident the aftermath of jimmy s death is all the more painful when juxtaposed with the years before we can see the size of the loss but as with many family tragedies and crises , jimmy s death sets in motion a chain of events that reveal much darker truths about the diehls like an earthquake shaking a building to the ground , the death of the oldest diehl child rocks the structure of the entire family , and the personality of each family member it becomes clear that the title refers to the last image they all saw a lyrical , ordinary thing , a boy on a bicycle before the world fell apart it had been a privileged world we had seven bedrooms and seven baths , diehl writes of her family home in montclair , nj , halls long enough to play soccer in , a wine cellar , the dungeons and an attic her father worked in publishing her mother was a charming , bookish housewife both , says diehl , were beautiful and sexually charismatic though her father drank too much and sometimes raged , her mother made up for it by sewing and cooking and gardening everything in sight to a faretheewell under the tree on christmas morning , unwrapped , were our presents , arranged in intricate tableaux , diehl remembers among the children , jimmy was the shining leader who taught his siblings what sarcasm was , charlotte was hard and cool , johnny was volatile and margaret was the shy , plump one who was always reading she was , in other words , the loser , frequently referred to by her sister as blubber baby and booger booger s revenge is the construction of a glimmering , fortresslike interior life , built of fairy stories and c s lewis s narnia chronicles and her own nearly autoerotic powers of observation instead of hitting back , she thinks constantly about magic , invisible doors to the underworld , the souls of mermaids at one point , diehl describes her young self as defusing a frightening moment by margareting the room , engulfing the scary places with coils of thought , sticky and luminous strands this aggressive , sexual , alienlike figure of her own imagination echoes throughout the book , which is gorgeously suffused not only with metaphor but with metaphors for the making of metaphor , the action of thought and the selfhypnosis of cerebration it comes as no real surprise when diehl indicates that she later became an alcoholic , because she describes herself as a child as existing in a glamorous state of nearconstant intoxication she regularly got drunk on reading , on sugar , on perception , on dreams , on grief , even on the house itself she recalls her personal mythology of the stairway the top stair , the second , the third territories , alliances royal beings who lived inside the wood when we were present they had to hide , but sent messages up through our skin death has a hard time gaining a foothold in such a universe if everything can be converted through magic or language into some other , winged creation , nothing can ever really be lost in one respect , this is a theology , but in another , as diehl recognizes , it s madness madness is turning the information other people give out into dreams , occult sightings , messages from oneself , she writes after jimmy dies , diehl s particular madness the madness of losing oneself in fancy winds around her with increasing force , sealing her off from the harsh events around her and from her own grief one can hardly blame her shortly after her brother died , her father committed suicide , her younger brother began staying out until 2 am with the rough kids and the intoxicating , manyroomed house was sold by the age of 10 , she has experienced a lifetime s worth of loss the book ends not long after what s left of the family moves to new york city , where they slowly tumble into the unhappy versions of themselves one imagines they remained fixed in for many years thereafter diehl s two novels , men and me you , concern young women who quest for themselves through drinking and sex , with mixed results diehl s descriptions of both the terrible events in her family and the golden stuff of her own interiority are so entrancing that one realizes too late just as she does that fairyland can be a gravityless hell what could be more innocent , more wholesome , than a girl reading a book \? but diehl is bold enough , and maybe sad enough , to turn this classic image inside out the meaning of a girl reading a book depends on the girl and the book and , though it may not be visible in the scene , what s happening in the world all around her under certain circumstances , swooning on words is itself a kind of death the boy on the green bicycle scared me , and i mean that as a compliment instead of simply valorizing or sentimentalizing the imagination , diehl gives it its due as a ferocious , druglike force the lion who looks like a friend to the fanciful child is also , as the adult knows , a wild animal diehl fearlessly inhabits both points of view the subject of her book is less her brother and her cracked family than it is the ambiguous power of her own fantasy life friend or foe \? she seems to be asking lover or murderer \? the day her brother died , she went to her room and read a mystery magazine , then realized that though people were dying in the stories , none of the tales were really about death she felt comforted , guilty , anxious , unpleasantly aware of herself , reading instead of grieving what i was thinking , the very fact that i was thinking this newborn \( deathgenerated \) intelligence itself a perversity consider this book her history of that perversity

there is no precise form of words for giving thanks today the number of placesettings depends on the weather , on longdistance travel plans and lastminute arrivals the menu is only partly foreordained by custom once , the turkey was stuffed with cornbread instead of chestnuts , and now the idea of cornbread stuffing seems almost venerable as the years pass , the dinner hour drifts from early afternoon to early evening and back again the setting shifts from house to house as the family grows older , younger , more scattered it is even hard to say just who is indispensable at this feast , for memory has a way of bringing everyone living and dead , present and absent into company at the table yet these variations , these adaptations , raise a sentiment of surprising consistency on this holiday , as coherent and resonant as if there were indeed a changeless form of words to be spoken , a prescribed menu the gracesayers and toastmakers try hard to convey the blessings of the day , but their phrases nearly always fall short , an acknowledgment that holiday feelings are a little hard to put into words everyone at the table , however , knows without saying how thanksgiving should feel they know that if the welcome is warm , thanks will follow , as surely as the sound of the dishwasher follows dessert someone down the table is stern about the tradition of thanksgivings past , unforgiving , in fact , about the cornbread stuffing someone else is mourning the loss of an ordinary thursday , straining to find some corner of the afternoon that is just its normal self , untouched by formality the children are distracted by each other a pertinacious uncle watches the sweet potatoes go round the table , hoping for seconds and thirds a nervous sisterinlaw watches them too , because the recipe is hers the man with the carving knife looks composed , but only because he knows that the secret to disbursing a turkey is faking it , though he still believes that his father knew what he was doing no one is quite pure of heart none of them know quite what to do with their expectations and yet it does not matter for at some point you look up to discover that the meal has enclosed everyone at the table the day seems different than it did a halfhour ago , as though the outer world suddenly fell away for a moment , leaving only the momentary intimacy of a circle of friends and family , all facing each other over the growing disarray of the dinner table before they know it , all those present are caught in the improvisation of their feelings every november , thanksgiving is reinvented in just this manner we pull it out of thin air we watch it gather in front of us and then , because a feeling so rich and supple cannot be sustained for long , we watch it vanish until it is time to reinvent the day all over again next year
mineola , ny , nov 3 the morning after the most remarkable electoral upset here in 100 years , nassau democrats straggled into county offices today like zombies , awestruck at the stunning victory they had just won over the supposedly allpowerful republican machine , and nearly overwhelmed by what lay before them the time for celebrating had come and gone sometime after 1 this morning , when it became clear that democrats had captured control of the legislative branch in nassau county for the first time , unseating five republican incumbents to take a 10to9 majority now their challenge is to govern in a place where the old rules from the balance of power between the parties to the balance of power between the county executive and the legislature have all been thrown out the window instead of government as tightly scripted pageant , it is suddenly government making up the rules as it goes along the soontobe presiding officer of the legislature , judith a jacobs , a feisty longtime civic leader who never held elected office until 1996 , says she will bring a new openness to county government , where lawmakers have been heard ridiculing residents who air their grievances as clueless , where party affiliation was a prerequisite for getting a pothole filled , and where the proposals of the opposition party almost never got a public hearing , let alone a vote yet ms jacobs , 60 , until now a mere witness to the efficient functioning of the republican organization , came to work today to find her democratic colleagues already jockeying for leadership positions before she even takes office on jan 1 , she must wrestle with the prospect of another budget deficit next year figure out how to deal with an unpopular but unbowed county executive , thomas s gulotta , a republican whose handling of the county s finances was widely blamed for his party s devastating losses on tuesday , and begin to foster bipartisanship in a legislature where none has ever taken root this is going to be almost like starting from the beginning , ms jacobs said it s going to be very strange it s not going to be easy for the republicans on the legislature to accept this change in balance but we will all adjust and i think it s going to be for the better practically speaking , she added , democrats will have to cooperate with republicans , who will have enough votes to block an override of a veto but the details of what must be done could make such cooperation quite difficult next year s budget was enacted by the republican majority last saturday , with a 105 percent property tax increase in addition to a 1 percent tax on real estate sales even after the new taxes , however , the republicans had still not been able to balance their 2000 budget fully without relying on at least 35 million in dubious revenues , aides to ms jacobs said with another budget deficit looming in 2000 despite the cuts through attrition of hundreds of highly paid jobs and the elimination of some appointed positions , ms jacobs vowed today to begin a linebyline examination of patronage jobs , and to restrict the use of county cars to emergency workers she did not , however , commit herself to repealing the new taxes against which democrats had campaigned so aggressively ms jacobs and other democratic officials said that they would need first to assemble a professional legislative staff although nassau s government , with a strong executive , is similar to new york city s , it has managed its 22 billion budget with a financial staff more comparable to that of a mediumsize town than a county of 13 million people the county democratic chairman , thomas p dinapoli , said he had received calls today from hillary rodham clinton and from the assembly speaker , sheldon silver , each offering help in finding experienced budget analysts and financial consultants in washington and albany while democrats will inherit a problematic financial plan , they also will benefit from a series of laws passed by republicans last month that were intended to prevent such budget deficits from arising in the future among other things , the laws will cap the amount mr gulotta s administration can spend in any threemonth period , forcing him to seek legislative approval to exceed that amount , and allowing lawmakers to detect new shortfalls as they emerge , rather than after they have accumulated for months mr dinapoli , who took over the hapless nassau democratic organization in april and was being hailed as a miracle worker today , called tuesday s elections a mandate for a new vision for nassau county , and choked up as he described the looks of exultation on the faces of longsuffering democrats who , he said , never had a night like that in their political lives but for all his optimism , mr dinapoli was quick to lower expectations for the democrats , saying they had not led the county government into trouble and should not be blamed if the damage to its finances defies easy solutions it s not going to be undone in a few weeks or a few months , he said it s not going to be undone without pain or difficult choices
claiming that the city university of new york is much more effective than mayor rudolph w giuliani s task force concluded in june , a group calling itself the friends of cuny has issued a rebuttal that it hopes will convince cuny s new chancellor and the state board of regents that cuny s senior colleges should not be permitted to close their doors to students needing remediation cuny s trustees adopted a policy last year to remove remedial students from their senior colleges that policy , which is now to become effective in january , was also a key recommendation of the mayor s task force but is being reviewed by the regents they say cuny needs their approval before it can move ahead with its 20page response to the task force report , the friends of cuny , an advocacy group headed by julius c c edelstein , a deputy mayor of new york city under mayor robert f wagner and a former cuny vice chancellor , hopes to show that cuny is a considerably stronger institution than the mayor s task force and other critics maintain , and to persuade the regents to withhold their approval the group sent its rebuttal to the regents and to cuny s new chancellor , matthew goldstein , on friday open admissions and remediation at city university have been effective and productive , the rebuttal says , adding that the task force ignores this fact and cites data to its own purposes herman badillo , cuny s chairman and a member of the mayor s task force , has said he plans to use its report as a blueprint for remaking the university the rebuttal says that the task force merely confirmed the premature judgments put forward by the mayor in his initial charge , and that it omitted or ignored all countervailing data the friends of cuny build their argument around several measures of student success most cuny graduates find work , and many go on for further education among the bachelor s degree graduates of the class of 199697 , for example , 96 percent were either working or pursuing additional degrees or both , by january 1999 many remedial students graduate students who require remedial work in one subject graduate at almost the same rate as those who need none although cuny s sixyear graduation rates are below national averages , reflecting financial and other problems of its student body , its eightyear graduate rates are above national averages the friends of cuny also contend that other proposals offered by the mayor s task force , also known as the schmidt commission , for its chairman , benno c schmidt jr , would be counterproductive the rebuttal said that separating remedial work from other college level courses could hinder student progress , since studies have shown that integrating the two works well , especially for adult students it also argues against proposals to put more emphasis on national tests like the sat , saying they would discriminate against women , and lowincome and minority students , since sat scores are strongly correlated with family income the friends of cuny also say that cuny s loose governance structure a major target of criticism by the schmidt commission works well in pursuing this 'grass must be greener someplace else' vision , the commission again makes the mistake of assuming another model is right , the rebuttal document says and it maintains that greater financial support is critical to any improvement at the university despite their substantial disagreements with the giuliani task force report , the friends of cuny say there are several areas where they agree , including the need for faculty renewal , better data collection and more technology development besides mr edelstein , the friends of cuny include a former cuny president , the student and faculty representatives from cuny s board of trustees , dozens of cuny professors , and members of other educational and nonprofit institutions who are concerned that cuny s trustees are trying to limit access to the university to disadvantaged students who need education one cuny professor who disagrees with many of the points in the rebuttal document and its efforts to preserve remedial classes in the senior colleges is barry latzer , a government professor at john jay college of criminal justice and a member of the executive committee of the cuny association of scholars , which has applauded the trustees' efforts to change cuny they overlook the destructive effect of admitting remedial students into regular courses , he said , adding that putting remedial students into college courses forced professors to water down their material or to fail many students i 've been in that situation , he said , and it s very uncomfortable
london , aug 26 provoking a furor among protestant politicians , britain sought today to prevent the collapse of peace efforts in northern ireland by ruling that recent charges of murder and gunrunning against the irish republican army did not constitute a breach of its ceasefire the assessment by mo mowlam , the northern ireland secretary , was apparently intended to insure that sinn fein , the ira s political affiliate , does not pull out of a planned review next month of the labored effort to bring peace to the british province the review is to be conducted by george j mitchell , a former united states senator announcing her longawaited decision to reporters in belfast , however , ms mowlan indicated that she was seeking to walk a narrow line between maintaining the peace effort and letting the ira and its political arm know that , if violence continues , the political process , which depends on confidence and trust , will be increasingly at risk she had , she said , come very close to judging that the ira ceasefire is no longer for real but , she said , the peace we have now is imperfect but better than none although the situation in relation to the ira is deeply worrying , i do not believe that there is sufficient basis to conclude that the ira ceasefire has broken down , she said nor do i believe that it is disintegrating or that these recent events represent a decision by the organization to return to violence nonetheless , ms mowlam said , we are very close to the edge of a breakdown in the peace effort the ira declared a ceasefire in july 1997 , paving the way for the socalled good friday peace agreement last year under the terms of the deal britain has released around 280 paramilitary prisoners and 200 more are scheduled to be freed by next may if the peace effort remains intact before ms mowlam s decision , northern ireland s largely protestant unionists , who want continued ties with britain , pressed her to declare the ceasefire over and to suspend the release of ira prisoners but sinn fein dropped broad hints that it would withdraw from next month s peace review if the prisoner releases ceased on wednesday , sir ronnie flanagan , head of the royal ulster constabulary , accused the ira of involvement in the slaying on july 30 of charles bennett , a 22yearold cab driver , who was killed by a gunshot wound to the head the slaying has been depicted as the vengeance murder of a suspected police informer ms mowlam said she accepted mr flanagan s version of events , calling the killing savage and disgraceful she said information is also clear about ira links to illicit arms deals with suppliers in the united states that has led to arrests in ireland and the united states but she maintained these developments did not constitute a formal decision by the ira to break the ceasefire there is no example of organized violence , she said the decision drew protests from leading unionists , including david trimble , the province s first minister , who called the ruling deeply disappointing , deeply flawed other unionists demanded ms mowlam s resignation , but mr trimble did not go that far , saying only that ms mowlam had been unable to tell people the simple truth it is quite clear that the ira is not keeping what we would recognize as a ceasefire , mr trimble said she appears to be accepting the ira definition of events he added that her assessment had done serious damage to public confidence in northern ireland other unionists went further , saying , in the words of jeffrey donaldson , a hardline unionist , that ms mowlam s decision was a sick joke she has lost all credibility and should do the honorable thing and resign , mr donaldson said but sinn fein s chairman , mitchel mclaughlin , welcomed the decision , saying it protected the troubled effort for peace since last year s peace , the agreement has been repeatedly strained by a series of incidents attributed to the ira and other republican groups and to protestant paramilitary groups many killings have been depicted as acts of vengeance on both sides of northern ireland s sectarian divide fortyone people have died in 11 incidents , including the bombing in the town of omagh on aug 15 , 1998 , which killed 29 people a dissident republican faction called the real ira took responsibility for the bombing others strains are also emerging unionists are complaining about leaked versions of a british report to be published in three days' time suggesting that the province s police force is to be revamped newspapers have said the report urges that the royal ulster constabulary s most overt ties with britain like its name and its oath of allegiance to the monarchy should be abolished
a passion for books drives the dedicated group of men and women who own and operate independent bookstores they have what i call a missionary zeal for what they do , said oren j teicher , chief operations officer of the american booksellers association in tarrytown , a trade group founded in 1900 to meet the needs of independently owned bookstores it s a very personal business booksellers really feel books are more than a product to deal with competition from chain bookstores , like barnes noble and borders books , independent booksellers are about to mount a brandrecognition campaign , under the name of booksense the concept was tested in northern california , where it was studied by focus groups , mr teicher said the brand name proved to be valuable in drawing attention to our members' bookstores , which , although they are different and diverse , have certain traits in common now we are going to launch booksense nationally in late april at our convention the booksense brandname drive , identifying independent bookstores nationwide , will be similar to the recognition campaign used by independent hardware stores under the true value name booksense will stress that independent booksellers are local business people , committed to the community , service oriented , who have vast knowledge about the products they sell , said mr teicher , who takes care of the daytoday operations of the association in 1984 , mr teicher was defeated by 3 , 000 votes in a congressional race against joseph j dioguardi the association s chief executive officer , avin mark domnitz , began his tenure a year ago a former trial lawyer who ran his own law firm for 10 years , mr domnitz gave up his practice in 1979 when he bought a small bookstore in a suburb of milwaukee running a bookstore was a lifetime dream of mine , he said i did what every independent bookseller does , from ordering , selling , advertising to unpacking and shelving i guess i like new challenges i taught fifth and sixth grades for two years before starting my law practice , and that , too , was a good experience in 19 , mr domnitz merged his company with the harry w schwartz bookshops we eventually had six stores , he said i ran the company in partnership with a david schwartz until i started full time with the aba mr domnitz views his job as chief executive officer of the american booksellers association as work that really means something he continued books will always be in the hearts and minds of people it s inconceivable to imagine a world without knowledgeable , interested independent booksellers to serve customers but the number of members and their needs have changed in the last decade mr teicher observed that increased competition from mass merchandisers , mall chain stores , wholesale clubs and nontraditional outlets has reduced the number of association members to 3 , 300 last year from 5 , 200 in 1991 provisional members , those who are serious about becoming retail booksellers but have not yet opened stores , have dropped to 750 from 1 , 200 the association is holding a twoday course for prospective booksellers at a book expo in los angeles in april the numbers make it clear that there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of independent booksellers , mr teicher said and although stores are still closing , we have seen leveling off this past year the good news is that the independents who have survived are stronger and expect to continue to survive the association , he added , is equally determined to see that its members play on a level field what is unusual for us is that in order to help our members , we have become aggressive in the litigation area , he said for instance , in 1994 we filed a suit alleging that major publishers made special deals to bookselling chains in 1997 , penguin books , owned by pearson britain , paid out 25 million to the aba to settle a violation of the consent decree in order not to be adjudicated in court based on a formula determined by the number of penguin books each store sold , the funds were disbursed in 1998 to our members last march , the association filed a suit on behalf of 26 bookstores against barnes noble and borders books , alleging that the two chains had obtained special deals from publishers it s illegal not to give the same deals on a proportional basis to all booksellers , mr teicher said the suit is pending in united states district court in san francisco the 26 booksellers who were plaintiffs with the association in the suit represented a cross section of the 3 , 300 independent bookseller members nationwide none of them were store owners in westchester , but that fact had no particular significance , mr teicher said despite the number of new bookstores being opened by the large chains , sales of books in bookstores has remained flat nineteen ninetysix was the first year more than onehalf the sales of books did n't take place in bookstores , he said books were bought in supermarkets , computer stores , toy stores and other nontraditional outlets , including the internet even the increase in sales of children s books is in single digits yet there are bright spots people continue to make a living as independent booksellers , mr teicher said main court in white plains has been in business for decades , and so has anderson s in larchmont and those who have made bookselling into a successful second career include 116 of our members who were former presidents of large companies reading clubs have also turned into a small profit center for many of our members who guide and advise them in addition to helping its members through advocacy , education , research and information dissemination , the association supplies material to members on the internet the web site , www bookweb org , lets members know what is happening in the business , alerts them to changes in the industry and acts as an advocate although figures for the holiday season will not be available until march , mr teicher said early reports have ranged from the best holiday season ever to very flat photos oren j teicher , left , with the

teams do not choke , bobby cox , the atlanta braves' lowkey manager , said yesterday they just get beat all right then , orel hershiser did not choke in the first inning last night , but boy , did he get beat hershiser was the boy with his finger in the dike he was horatio at the bridge both the dike and the bridge collapsed , and along with them went the mets' eroding chances to extend their baseball year with postseason games next week mathematically , the mets live but after the first inning at shea stadium they would be better off dead anyone with the slightest touch of compassion could see that the braves , who are already in the playoffs , were playing for nothing more than homefield advantage , but their 93 victory was no contest between their playoffhardened veteran pitcher and the mets' playoffhardened veteran pitcher the first inning told the whole tale tom glavine emerged from it unscathed despite a mets threat hershiser did not survive it hershiser , in fact , experienced the briefest start of his 16year career in 458 previous regularseason starts and 18 in postseason games , he had never failed to get at least three outs in his 477th start , the 41yearold righthander faced seven batters and secured only one count it , one out he did n't choke , but boy , did he get beat he made some pitches up and they did a good job of hitting them in front of our outfielders and in between our infielders , manager bobby valentine , headed for his second successive seasondying disaster , said hershiser , who with other teams earlier in his career pitched critical games and won , was unable to stop the losing streak that has now reached seven games and threatens to keep growing , especially in the next two games with the braves you work a whole year with a group of guys and you want to rise to the occasion in things like this , but it just did n't happen , hershiser said you hope you can have a really good outing and give the team a good solid start when things have been spiraling down for us , you would hope that something like that would n't happen hershiser had such a poor start that even the out he got figured in the four runs the braves scored in a hurry brian jordan hit a fly ball to short left field , and chipper jones tagged up and scored , showing disdain for rickey henderson s left arm if anything can be said in hershiser s behalf , it is that none of the five hits he allowed was crushed none was even hit hard but the balls were n't hit at any of the mets' fine defensive players all eluded them it was n't that they were getting some gappers and we were watching a merrygoround , hershiser said we were just watching balls fall in front of outfielders and the runs scoring hershiser , who pitched creditably \( three runs in seven innings \) in the middle game of the disastrous threegame series in atlanta last week , created trouble for himself instantly with his third pitch of the game , he plunked gerald williams , the braves' leadoff hitter division championship in hand , cox was not going to sit back and play this one leisurely he sent that signal to the mets by calling for a hit and run , which bret boone executed beautifully , bouncing a single to right field as williams raced to third boone sticks his bat out and gets probably the most solid hit of the inning , hershiser lamented that brought up the destroyer , a k a chipper jones if any player has ever displayed most valuable player credentials any more emphatically , his name does n't come to mind in three victories over the mets , jones hit four home runs and drove in seven runs with them , one more run than the mets scored in the series the debate that arose from the ashes of the mets' flameout in atlanta was whether or not the mets should have walked jones rather than toss up pitches that he could whack out of the park dave wallace , the mets' pitching coach , said that strategy would have to be considered for this series but the mets passed up the first opportunity they had to make such a bold move instead of walking jones and loading the bases , hershiser pitched to him and jones looped a single to rightcenter field , driving in the first run ryan klesko followed with a single to left field that sent boone home with the second run and jones to third , from where he scored on jordan s popup to left successive singles by andruw jones and greg myers , the fourth and fifth hits of the inning , loaded the bases , and one pitch later , a ball to jose hernandez , hershiser was gone most likely for the season octavio dotel s first relief pitch was wild , enabling klesko to score the fourth run the mets would never catch up they tried in their half of the first inning henderson reached first when boone booted his bouncer , and shawon dunston bunted for a single but unlike hershiser , the talented glavine was able to extricate himself from trouble he threw a thirdstrike fastball past john olerud , threw a good changeup that mike piazza hit in the air to left and struck out edgardo alfonzo i just stayed under control , glavine said i just tried to stay with my game plan , stay within myself , try and get a groundball double play it did n't work out that way , but i was able to make good pitches in losing eight of 10 games to the braves this season , the mets have batted 217 against their pitchers they are hitting 284 against the rest of the league in the space of seven days , the mets learned that reports of glavine s demise were premature he pitched against them twice and allowed them only three runs in 14 innings hershiser s quick demise , on the other hand , will help send the mets home for the winter prematurely photos the braves' chipper jones sliding safely

to the editor i am surprised at the coverage given to the nonsensical spouting of someone like dr robert zubrin \( a new frontier aboard the mars direct , nov 2 \) , whose idea of a free market is to have the government give lockheed 200 million for a space launching without inquiring where the money is going reading the front pages to get an idea of the main problems facing the united states , one would quickly conclude that none of them can be attacked by trying to settle on mars we have plenty of challenges to attract the passion of our kids without this kind of boondoggle dr william f schreiber cambridge , mass
many of the foreign asylum seekers held at the immigration and naturalization service detention center in queens were infected with the tuberculosis microbe this month through contact with a west african detainee who reportedly entered the country already in the infectious stage of the disease , federal health officials said yesterday in all , 90 detainees were infected during the man s twoweek stay at the center , but none have developed active tb , the officials said the ill detainee , whose name and nationality were not released , is now being treated at jamaica hospital medical center doctors said that his initial skin test to screen for tuberculosis was negative , but that after he complained of a cough at the detention center clinic , he was given a chest xray and found to have the active form of the disease although not everyone who is infected will develop the active form of the disease , the standard procedure once a skin test shows a positive result is to take a chest xray to discover if the tuberculosis is active if it is , the patient is hospitalized and treated but tb may not become active for months after exposure , so even if the xray does not show a problem , the accepted procedure is to administer drugs to kill the microbe neal collins , an officer with the public health service who is the clinical director of the queens detention center , said that all the detainees exposed to tuberculosis had been started on a regimen of drugs to kill the tb microbe letters have been sent to the people already released , advising them to see a doctor tuberculosis in its active stage is highly contagious , and the microbe can be spread when the sick person coughs , sneezes or sometimes merely talks although the united states has seen an overall decline in tb cases in the last 10 years , most immigrants come from parts of the world where the disease is rampant the world health organization has estimated that onethird of the world s population is infected all immigrants entering detention centers are given a skin test to screen for tuberculosis exposure a large number of the immigrants who come to the queens detention center are already infected and receive treatment during their stay , dr collins said , but active tuberculosis cases in detention centers in the new york region are rare a few immigration centers around the country , like the port isabel detention center near brownsville , tex , give chest xrays to every detainee who is taken in that way , officials said , active tuberculosis can be spotted almost immediately , rather than after the two or three days needed for results from a tuberculosis skin test , which may indicate only exposure to the disease by the end of next year , digital xray machines to screen for tb are expected to be installed at every immigration center in the country , said gene migliaccio , director of immigrant health services at the public health service in washington
blacksburg , va , nov 28 hordes of ecstatic football fans poured into this university town over the holiday weekend , but perhaps none gave more meaning to the spectacle than little patrick sullivan patrick , a dimpled 7yearold , came all the way from boston , his hometown , to watch his favorite team play football boston college was taking on virginia tech , and patrick sat in the stands with his father , william , a 42yearold firefighter unlike his father , though , patrick roots for virginia tech he already plans to attend the university when he finishes high school in 2010 they 're really good and they 're ranked second in the whole country , patrick said by way of explanation thus has a run at a national championship propelled this outoftheway appalachian town into the national spotlight on friday , the virginia tech hokies defeated boston college to end its season with an undefeated record of 110 and set the stage for a likely slot in the sugar bowl to decide the national championship on jan 4 the school is enjoying the kind of publicity that reams of press releases about academic programs could never equal sports will do that , said roger hedgpeth , a virginia tech alumnus who has been blacksburg s mayor for the last 18 years nobel prizes certainly get a lot of attention , but there s nothing like having a football team that s no 2 to get attention applications to virginia tech have increased 30 percent over last year , university officials report , while requests to use its logo have increased from about 3 or 4 per week to as many as 10 per day hokie memorabilia is disappearing from store shelves as quickly as it can be made everyone wants to watch virginia tech now , said paul torgersen , the university s president , who was busy over the weekend entertaining congressional representatives from other parts of the state and members of the virginia general assembly , some of whom have only recently caught what has been dubbed hokiemania \( the team nickname comes from a nonsense word in a 19thcentury school cheer \) blacksburg s main street is typical of many college towns around the country , with rows of bars and restaurants , broken up by the occasional barber shop or boutique lately , though , this street has had an audible buzz that comes with espn trucks and outoftown journalists , with weekly articles in sports illustrated and live reports on cnn the town now boasts two national celebrities in the hokies' head coach , frank beamer , and its star freshman quarterback , michael vick to understand what all the attention means here requires a knowledge of the history embedded in the region the original settlers of southwestern virginia were scotsirish pioneers , who made a living on hilly corn and cattle farms and , later , in coal fields they were a different lot than the landed english who owned sprawling plantations to the east virginia tech , founded in 1872 as virginia agricultural and mechanical college , has long played second fiddle to the university of virginia , in charlottesville , some 150 miles to the northeast although virginia tech boasts one of the best engineering schools in the country and an excellent reputation in computers , it still suffers the stigma of being a school for farmers university of virginia students never fail to remind virginia tech of its supposed place in the intellectual pecking order when the hokies handily dispatched the virginia cavaliers in charlottesville in october , virginia students were heard to chant hey , hey , that s ok you 'll all be working for us someday virginia tech fans have always been loyal , even when their team was known more for court appearances than for its play on the field in 1995 and 1996 , 21 football players were arrested in a 12month period on charges ranging from alcohol violations to rape mr torgersen responded in early 1997 by instituting a tougher disciplinary policy for athletes the school s football players have had only occasional runins with the law since then , and this year the eyes of the state , and of much of the nation , have been fixed firmly on the field to some extent , at this point , i think we 're carrying the flag of virginia , said mr torgersen , who will retire at the end of the year everybody is a hokie but not everyone at virginia tech is excited about the school s arrival as a sports power i do n't like it and i'm not the only one , said henry h bauer , an interdisciplinary studies professor and former dean professor bauer said that sports might give alumni something to do on the weekends but that they had little connection to a public university s academic mission i can remember when the reason for college sports was to build character , he said that s gone by the board the reason now is to get attention and tv revenues that is just fine with some people people seem to be nicer , and they tip better , said bill thran , a virginia tech senior who works as a bartender at pk s , a popular nightspot , speaking of the mood in town i think it s good for the school , he said hopefully we 'll get more funding , more attention and better students photos fans celebrated on friday after the virginia tech football team beat boston college to finish the season undefeated the team s head coach , frank beamer , has become a national celebrity \( photographs by associated

it was a perfect screen moment the senators rose at their desks in turn , the camera closing in on each face as he or she pronounced the weighty words guilty or not guilty and there you have the difference between movies and real life it was easy to play out such a scene in the imagination yesterday , but that was the only place it existed in reality , it was impossible to look into the senators' eyes as they voted the stationary senatecontrolled cameras offered distant , wide shots of the floor , and a viewer could only strain to glimpse a faroff figure briefly standing \( thank goodness for christopher j dodd s white hair it made him easy to spot as he rose \) it was a frustrating position to be in after weeks of watching closeup , inyourface pronouncements paradoxically , though , that empyrean view fostered yesterday s brief but surprisingly dramatic aura a sense of gravity and historical import , so conspicuously missing throughout president clinton s trial , even made its way through the visual clutter on screen on every network and cable channel , the image of the senate floor was placed in a small box as they voted , each senator s photograph and party affiliation was flashed on screen with running tallies of how many republicans were defecting by voting to acquit \( the only suspense left , though one largely limited to political junkies \) the day s grave tone came partly from the language of guilt or acquittal , partly from the sense of \( at long , exhausted last \) finality , and partly from diminished expectations for , this eerie combination of sober drama and frustrating distance from events was in keeping with a television day marked by unusual caution from anchors to mr clinton , everyone suddenly seemed gunshy around the cameras , wary after so many botched television moments in the morning , frank sesno asked a pertinent question on cnn is there a sense of history here or a sense of something to get through \? five weeks ago , when the trial began , commentators were assuming history happened every minute by yesterday , they had abandoned any rash or overblown assumptions cokie roberts of abc news said , in what turned out to be an accurate prediction about the voting , it s not suspenseful , but it is dramatic and after votes were over , brian williams of nbc news captured its feeling when he said , it was chilling , unexpectedly chilling , to hear the words yet when peter jennings signed off abc s coverage of the president s brief speech in the afternoon , he hedged his bets , calling the day a little anticlimactic for some , but a great , historic civics lesson for others as dan rather wryly pointed out on cbs , commentators have been making wrong predictions about this crisis for a year they will probably spend the next year assessing what it all meant , with no greater success it was mr clinton s rose garden speech that qualified as the television anticlimax of the day despite his opening reference , now that the senate has fulfilled its constitutional responsibility bringing this process to a conclusion , he did not grapple with the import of what had finally happened offering one more apology and looking forward to reconciliation , mr clinton safely fulfilled the minimum requirements senators and pundits had laid out for the speech it had to be short \( it came in at two minutes \) and nongloating \( he called himself humbled \) if mr clinton seemed uncharacteristically diffident in front of the cameras , the senate s relationship to television was true to form cameragreedy everywhere else , in the chamber senators sometimes protect their decorum and secrecy with such passion it seems startling cameras are allowed at all their dilemma is genuine the alternative to congress s bland , stationary cameras would create a scene unthinkable anytime soon a halfdozen people with handheld cameras traipsing the floor of the senate as if at a political convention yet the staid , cspan style of senate television coverage is archaically out of touch with this mediadriven story as if offering a reminder of the tawdry betrayals at the heart of this scandal , the television day was bookended by none other than linda r tripp , in a 20minute interview on the today program that was excerpted everywhere all day and replayed on dateline at night mrs tripp s most inflammatory statement was that she felt her life and her children s lives had been threatened by the president through monica s lewinsky her mantra was that she had just been trying to help ms lewinsky , the friend she still cares about mrs tripp sent the impression of a woman seriously detached from reality , and the message that any visceral sense of dignity attached to this story is fleeting
what about tudjman \? this question comes to mind after the long overdue indictment of slobodan milosevic , the president of yugoslavia and the prime villain behind the carnage that has engulfed the balkans for the past decade but president franjo tudjman of croatia is hardly an innocent lamb , and if the warcrimes tribunal in the hague hopes to be seen as an impartial arbiter of justice , it should match its indictment of mr milosevic with a move against mr tudjman for this to happen , the clinton administration , which belatedly offered the tribunal crucial intelligence about mr milosevic , should let the tribunal know whatever it knows about mr tudjman s links to croatian forces that committed atrocities in bosnia unfortunately , it s unclear whether the administration can summon the moral wherewithal to help the tribunal pursue a dictator who has become a useful american ally in the balkans croatia s ports and airports are key staging grounds for the natoled peacekeeping operation in bosnia mr milosevic is far more responsible than mr tudjman for the bloodshed in the balkans , and of course mr tudjman is not involved in the cleansing of kosovo but ground zero for balkan war crimes remains in bosnia , not kosovo the tragedy in kosovo is horrendous and should not be understated , but the known death toll there does not approach the several hundred thousand deaths in bosnia from 1992 to 1995 serbian forces are responsible for the bulk of those killings \( and rapes and cleansings \) even so , croatian forces linked to mr tudjman used similar tactics the ethnic croatian militia in bosnia , the hvo , which received crucial support from croatia proper , conducted vicious cleansing operations in central bosnia , among other areas if justice is blind , why should mr milosevic be indicted and not mr tudjman \? the initial answer is that mr milosevic , along with four associates , has n't been indicted for crimes in bosnia but the reality is that kosovo is for mr milosevic what incometax evasion was for al capone an offense that prosecutors can nail him on again , that s not to underplay the outrageousness of what has happened in kosovo but had there been no war in bosnia , it is unlikely that mr milosevic would have been indicted last week for the most part , he s being made to pay for crimes committed by his forces in sarajevo , srebrenica , zvornik , foca and many other bosnian towns mr tudjman should face the same music some may say this is cruel , or at least moot , because the croatian leader has cancer and may not have long to live this excuse has been used for several years but if someone is suspected of war crimes , should he be granted more mercies than the innocent men , women and children who have perished \? mr milosevic and mr tudjman kept their distance from the scenes of war crimes and refrained from issuing public orders for the cleansing of bosnia the best evidence against them is believed to be found in electronic intercepts gathered by american and other western spy agencies phone or radio conversations and telexes or cables that link mr milosevic and mr tudjman to cleansing campaigns conducted in bosnia until recently , virtually none of it was shared with the tribunal the tribunal s hardworking investigators have labored under a number of handicaps as they have pursued indictments the local authorities have been reluctant to cooperate , often refusing outright at the outset , the tribunal received thin financial support from western nations that did n't want their diplomatic apple cart upset by a powerful prosecutor nato forces in bosnia have so far arrested only a handful of indicted war criminals these handicaps have made it difficult for the tribunal to accumulate concrete evidence linking mr milosevic and mr tudjman to the military forces in bosnia that they controlled from behind the scenes kosovo changed the equation for mr milosevic because unlike bosnia , kosovo is part of yugoslavia , and the forces at work there are under his direct control the chain of command is as unmistakable as a tank on high ground what also changed was the administration s willingness to provide incriminating intelligence once the white house went to war against mr milosevic over kosovo , it began releasing satellite imagery of mass graves to the media for the most part , this was n't done in the bosnian war and providing classified intercepts to the tribunal louise arbour , the chief prosecutor , has not hesitated to issue indictments once she accumulates enough evidence this sort of cooperation was long overdue but raises the specter of retribution rather than justice by turning on and off the flow of intelligence to the tribunal , the administration can influence indictments if this means that mr tudjman escapes judgment for lack of evidence , even if the evidence exists in the vaults of the cia or the national security agency , the serbs will have reason to accuse the tribunal of prosecutorial bias in the realm of war crimes , there s a name for regrettable outcomes of this sort victor s justice
boston as we enter the new millennium , the population of america s prisons and jails is approaching two million it will pass that mark , according to the justice policy institute in washington , around feb 15 in the entire world about eight million people are incarcerated , so a quarter of them are in this country the number of prisoners has been growing at an extraordinary pace , up 70 percent in the last 10 years we have overtaken russia for the honor of having the world s highest incarceration rate all this has a profound social cost since 1995 the states have spent more on prison than on university construction operating prisons in the year 2000 will cost about 40 billion and of course it is not just the money twothirds of the prisoners are there for nonviolent offenses chances are good that by the time they are released after sentences that are among the longest anywhere they will be thoroughly brutalized the figures are so stunning that even some experts known for taking a hard line on crime think it is time for a reappraisal of criminal justice policies one is prof john j diiulio jr of princeton he summed up his view in the wall street journal in march under the headline two million prisoners are enough the value of imprisonment is a portrait in the law of rapidly diminishing returns , professor diiulio said he noted that correctional costs were squeezing money for policing he urged officials everywhere to maintain gains in public safety while keeping the prison population around two million and even aiming to reduce it over the next decade to that end he suggested , first , repealing mandatoryminimum drug sentencing laws since 1973 the rockefeller drug laws in new york state have imposed fixed terms running from 15 years to life for all kinds of offenses federal laws also include many mandatory minimums the result of fixed sentences is to put hundreds of thousands of nonviolent drug offenders away for many years , at great cost to them and to us about a quarter of those in american prisons and jails are drug violators , according to the justice policy institute their number has gone up sevenfold in the last 20 years professor diiulio called for the release of nonviolent offenders imprisoned only for drug violations he also urged that drug treatment be required for users , in prison and afterward legislation that requires extremely long sentences for drug and some other crimes is a political phenomenon of the last 25 years or so few politicians , state or national , have been willing to challenge the mantra of toughness on crime willing to look at the harsh consequences of such rigidity , human and societal mandatoryminimum sentences seem to me to reflect the delusion that eliminating the element of judgment will make the criminal justice system work better absolute rules assure certainty but they also assure injustice leaving too much discretion to judges risks uneven sentences leaving none produces equally harsh sentences for situations and individuals that demand different treatment the same delusion mars the 1996 immigration act , with its requirement of automatic deportation for minor crimes the other distinctive feature of criminal justice in the united states is capital punishment all other western countries have given it up as an atavistic barbarity it continues here despite a growing number of releases of deathrow prisoners after lastminute proof of their innocence study after study has shown that executions do not deter further murders yet george w bush has defended the death penalty on the ground that it will save other innocent lives as governor of texas , mr bush has presided over 113 executions , more than any other governor in modern times a compelling boston globe story by john aloysius farrell pointed out that in the next five weeks governor bush must deal with five more scheduled deaths , one of a prisoner with a mental age of 7 , two others who committed their crimes as juveniles mr bush s action in those cases , and the public reaction , will tell much about the quality of his and our humanity
a warm light slants through an empty concrete courtyard at rikers island and into a small visiting room where dozens of blue and green plastic chairs are arrayed in rows jennifer willis sits by the window , her thin body swallowed by a slategray jumpsuit resting her chin in her palm , she purses her lips do i look ok \? she asks her bright eyes are underlined with dark puffy rings her hair , in a tight ponytail above her head , is twotoned , blond and brown , from an old dye job gone bad though she has been on suicide watch , she still giggles jennifer , who has pleaded guilty to a gun possession charge , has one reason to seem happy at her next court hearing , just four days away , she expects to be released from jail by then , she says , someone will have found her a place in a treatment program that can address both her drug abuse and her mental illness , which her social worker and her lawyer say has been diagnosed as depression if she can get into a program like that , she says , she can get on with her life but the hearing four days later will come and go , just as all the others have jennifer will arrive at bronx supreme court in handcuffs and sit on the edge of her chair while her lawyer , her social worker , her caseworker and the judge discuss her fate in hushed voices at the bench at the end of the day , she will end up back at rikers , where she is in detention , the authorities say , for her own protection like countless teenagers across the country , jennifer has descended into a nether world between two bureaucracies the child welfare system and the adult criminal system her story raises questions about what happens to young women who were put into state custody as children and who have never quite been able to get on their feet those who reach adolescence and get in trouble with the law often find themselves in a landscape almost barren of resources that can help them move in a new direction a year ago , a family court judge discharged jennifer from the foster care system in which she grew up she had no home , no high school diploma , no money and no job six weeks earlier , she had been arrested though she has been offered a second chance drug treatment and counseling instead of prison there are few places where she can get those services since feb 2 , jennifer willis has been inmate 2109900131 , one of some 50 in the adolescent wing of the rose m singer center , the rikers island women s jail her situation , said ann l jacobs , executive director of the women s prison association of new york , a nonprofit social service and advocacy group , is probably no better or worse than those of the other young women in the wing some who study women s pathways into the criminaljustice system say she is remarkably typical how many jennifers are there \? said meda chesneylind , author of the female offender girls , women and crime \( sage publishing company , 1997 \) and a professor of women s studies and criminology at the university of hawaii at manoa thousands , she said , perhaps tens of thousands nationwide there are a lot of girls on the streets , and a lot of them get minor criminal records like jennifer s our jails and prisons are full of these women jennifer is now at a critical juncture , with two paths before her , ms chesneylind and ms jacobs said one path heads toward a life of crime and incarceration the other , paved with assistance from programs that can teach her skills for living on her own and determination on her part , could lead to some kind of stability it ca n't be that much longer now , jennifer said in early june , trying to muster confidence i'm just waiting for a bed but at least i know where i'm going an abandoned child grows into a wild one in truth , no one knows for sure where jennifer is going in part , that s because no one knows where she came from she was born on jan 1 , 1981 , somewhere in the bronx her mother , terri diane willis , died of aids in 1992 , leaving three children , each with a different father no one knows who jennifer s father was at 22 months , she was abandoned in an apartment somewhere in lower manhattan or brooklyn no one remembers where with her brother born justice , then 4 the police called a distant relative , alma king , who was listed as terri willis s next of kin , and mrs king called her son , leward hunter jr , a construction worker who lived in the hunts point section of the bronx he agreed to take in the children socorro c hunter , his widow , said they were filthy when they arrived they had no clothes , she said they had splinters on their feet like if you 're walking on a bare wood floor that is all chipped their shoes were too small for their feet there were cigarette burns on jennifer s soles and her inner thighs , mrs hunter said , and a huge gash on her temple i remember something about a marble staircase , jennifer said recently but who would push a 2yearold down a marble stairs \?

washington , june 14 three months ago , a research mathematician was dismissed from his job at the los alamos nuclear weapons laboratory for security violations today federal authorities say it is most unlikely that the mathematician , who is at the center of the uproar over the suspected theft of nuclear secrets by china , will ever face criminal charges of espionage moreover , the officials are unsure whether the scientist , wen ho lee , will be accused of any wrongdoing , even though investigators found in march that he had downloaded thousands of secret codes used in the design of the most sophisticated american nuclear weapons the uncertain status of the case has infuriated some government officials and lawmakers , primarily republicans , who say mr lee may be responsible for the most damaging espionage of the postcoldwar era that conclusion was reinforced last month , when a congressional panel found that china had used nuclear secrets stolen from american labs to develop advanced miniature warheads and a mobile ballistic missile mr lee s lawyer , mark holscher , said his client was an innocent scientist who had been branded as a spy even though he had not even been charged with any crime mr lee has been unfairly injected into a politically charged debate over americachina relations and has been subject to improper leaks in violation of federal law , mr holscher said the extent and nature of evidence against mr lee remains obscure but interviews with officials about the still classified evidence including details about mr lee s work , his meetings with chinese scientists and his overseas travel help explain why after three years of investigation lawenforcement officials acknowledge that they will probably never learn the truth over all , officials said , the evidence is a mosaic of fact and conclusions that suggests why counterintelligence cases are frustrating and often fail to result in prosecutions these are some of the points there are no witnesses who saw mr lee engage in espionage there is no evidence of a motive in the form of unexplained income or a change in his style of life nor are there indications that mr lee , a naturalized american who was born on taiwan , was ideologically allied with beijing even the evidence that a theft occurred is circumstantial still , counterintelligence officials said , they strongly suspect that china stole the important information data in the mid80 s the loss was apparently not found at the time , when an investigation might have had the greatest chance of success authorities did not realize that the information had been stolen until 1995 , when suspicions were aroused at the lab in new mexico by an analysis of chinese nuclear tests and when the central intelligence agency obtained a document with esoteric computations indicating that beijing had acquired nuclear secrets mr lee emerged as a suspect because he was one of the few researchers in the area that is thought to have been compromised , computational fluid dynamics many people at the energy department were aware of the information but officials said mr lee was the sole scientist with full access who had also visited chinese counterparts in beijing from there the evidentiary trail followed a meandering course investigators pieced together an account of mr lee s contacts with chinese over the years , producing an outline of circumstantial information some of it seemed to raise questions about mr lee some of it seemed too speculative to shed significant light on his activities and none of it was solid enough to form the basis for an indictment , government officials said one crucial component is missing there is no direct evidence that mr lee ever passed or tried to pass on to china any classified national security information although the evidence is apparently insufficient to prosecute mr lee , the federal bureau of investigation thought that the case against him was compelling enough to ask the justice department in 1997 for permission to eavesdrop on mr lee under the foreign intelligence surveillance act the law lets the government monitor subjects electronically , not to assemble evidence of a crime , but to gather intelligence in national security cases the still classified fbi application cited questions about mr lee dating from the early 80 s , when he contacted a scientist who had been ousted from a weapons lab in california after an inquiry into the theft of secrets about the neutron bomb the application , made up of drafts of documents exchanged between the fbi and the justice department , described how chinese intelligence differed from espionage by the united states' traditional adversaries the chinese , the document said , usually seek information from overseas chinese who are traveling in china through scientisttoscientist contacts , a more elusive form of espionage because it does not rely on identifiable intelligence officers the fbi request said mr lee had failed to disclose the identities of all the scientists whom he contacted in china on visits in 1986 and 1988 the energy department had approved the trips and authorized his meetings and discussions of nonclassified matters with chinese officials after the trips , mr lee and his wife met american security officials and identified a number of chinese scientists whom they had met but counterintelligence officials apparently suspected that mr lee might have held back some pertinent information about his activities during vacations taken after each trip on the vacations , the officials said , mr lee had undisclosed contacts with scientists , including one identified as side hu , a top official at an institute of engineering physics involved in nuclear weapons research other officials said the omissions might have been inadvertent , in light of the numerous contacts that mr lee did report in 1992 , mr hu led a delegation of chinese officials on a tour of los alamos that the energy department had authorized , documents show on the visit , mr hu spoke privately with mr lee and embraced him in a congratulatory manner later , counterintelligence agents surreptitiously analyzed mr lee s spending and found what they thought might be another puzzle piece they found two charges on a credit card at a travel agency while mr lee was in hong kong in 1994 one charge was for 100 , the other for 700 , enough to pay for what officials said might have been an airline ticket to china republican senators like fred thompson of tennessee and at least one democrat , robert g torricelli of new jersey , have expressed outrage that the justice department blocked the fbi request for a warrant to eavesdrop on mr lee , a step that they suggest would have accelerated the investigation at a critical time , before mr lee realized that he was under suspicion in mid1997 , the office of intelligence policy review at the justice department found that the evidence was so nebulous and dated that it refused the fbi request for electronic monitoring after a bureau official questioned the decision , attorney general janet reno ordered a second review by the justice department , which also found that the bureau had failed to produce enough evidence to justify the request ms reno has said bureau officials dropped the issue for her part , she said recently , i assumed that since i did not hear from the fbi that the matter had been resolved to their satisfaction instead , bureau officials said investigators decided to pursue other avenues an agent who was posing as a chinese intelligence officer approached mr lee the scientist rebuffed an invitation to spy for beijing , government officials said , but he did not tell authorities about the contact until they had approached him to explain it
once upon a fortnight , jana novotna s tears were even more public than jennifer capriati s during a sad spectacle yesterday at the united states open they were global , on the shoulder of royalty , at the tennis tournament that , for her , mattered most i always wanted to win wimbledon , novotna said eventually , five years after she choked her first chance away to steffi graf and broke down in the company of the duchess of kent , novotna did claim victory on the hallowed center court grass , enabling her to say yesterday , with no regrets , that she would retire from tennis later this year millions could tell you that novotna should have beaten graf in the final that july afternoon in 1993 , and many would argue , given her serveandvolley skills , that she should have won more often she was too fragile , people said did n't measure up to societal champion standards novotna was here to have none of that tennis , she said , had been her ticket out of communist czechoslovakia it had shown her the world and made her fluent in english and more than enough money and so many friends i'm happy with the one grand slam , novotna said i 've had a great , long and healthy career with her 31st birthday next month , novotna was declaring that the only career definition that mattered was the one she had made for herself this is what is otherwise known as a healthy life s perspective , a place that would some day be nice for capriati to reach capriati , once a prodigy , returned to the open this year in vastly improved shape , with a renewed competitive spirit her 64 , 63 fourthround defeat by monica seles was closer than it sounds , but far more onesided yesterday was her longtime struggle to combat the expectations of others the fans the agents the sponsors the parents the press she said she had prepared a 10paragraph statement prior to the open to address her teenage path of quiet rebellion , of a little experimentation of a darker side the weeklong dilemma was when to share it , when would be the best time , and the answer , unfortunately , was that there was none the statement , rambling in generality , begot a line of questioning that ended with someone asking if capriati viewed the news media as an adversary suddenly , she looked more 13 than 23 , the staged performance dissolving into an improvisation of tears it needs to be done , she gasped , her face in her hands , when a tour attendant asked if she wished to stop i just wish i did n't have to talk about this all the time , she said , in what was less a contradiction , more of a plea she was led into the corridor , into the arms of her father , stefano his exwife , denise , was nearby , weeping parents who were once painfully unschooled in adolescent psychology had suffered dearly , and now their daughter was still paying for her family s mistakes and her youthful transgressions , in the form of perceived public debt how much time do we have to punish her \? stefano capriati said later she did nothing except damage herself it would have been wonderful , primarily for jennifer capriati , if she could have sat down , regaled the world with introspective insights then again , darryl strawberry and too many soldiers of sporting dysfunction have rehearsed the lines , mouthed the words , until critics had to beg them to stop redemption is a process , not a news conference the fact that capriati has shed 30 pounds to become a competitive player again is its own example for others , speaks to a level of determination and courage yet the tears unceremoniously shed suggested that 10 paragraphs or 10 hours up close with roy firestone cannot set a timetable for the emergence of a secure young adult , independent of her folks it s difficult when you 're young because it s hard to find a place for it all , said the 29yearold sage andre agassi after continuing his stroll through the men s draw by straightsetting arnaud clement i find the position of media focus a good one it gives me an objective platform to look at myself without having to take it personally stefano capriati said he hoped yesterday s experience could be cathartic for his daughter , a cure , as if the problem had been a lingering case of acne , or a hitch in her serve maybe the decision to placate the public was actually hers eventually , if she is to get where jana novotna is , if she is to walk away from tennis with any selfesteem , jennifer capriati will realize that she needs to make her most convincing statements to herself photo jennifer capriati \( barton silverman \)
cairo , feb 25 local elections on friday in iran are shaping up as an important test of strength between moderates and the conservatives who remain the dominant political force the elections will be the first local contests since the islamic revolution of 1979 ushered in an era in which conservative clerics have held sway more than 300 , 000 candidates are seeking posts , including women , secularists and others wholly unconnected to the mullahs who hold most central authority a screening panel aligned with the conservatives has disqualified a number of wellknown moderates , a tactic used in past elections to limit choices but in a reflection of internal rivalries , the interior ministry has rejected those disqualifications , leaving open the question of who might be permitted to hold office the outcomes could provide an important gauge of the ability of president mohammad khatami , whose election in 1997 opened a fissure in the conservatives' grip on power , to maneuver around obstacles planted by his rivals the most telling indicator is most likely to be the fate of one of his closest advisers , abdollah nouri the conservativedominated parliament ousted mr nouri as interior minister last year mr nouri is seeking election to a local council , and his candidacy has been the source of the sharpest contention between the supervisory council , which is aligned with ayatollah ali khamenei , the hardline conservative who is the supreme leader of iran , and the interior ministry , which reports to mr khatami on sunday the supervisory council rejected the candidacy of mr nouri and 50 other prominent moderates because their loyalty to ayatollah khamenei had been questioned or because they were seen as having suspect records from the past , according to the official islamic republic news agency the interior ministry overruled that finding , meaning that the candidates' names will probably appear on the ballots but in a sign of the seriousness of the struggle , the supervisory council has threatened to nullify the election results the president , his deputy or his interior minister none of them can have a say in the decision of the council , said the head of the panel , ali movahedi savoji in telephone interviews from teheran , western diplomats and iranian political analysts said the lines had been sharply drawn both sides are digging in their heels , one diplomat based in teheran said in a clear sign of the tensions , a gunman opened fire on wednesday on the election headquarters of a moderate party in teheran no one was hurt for 20 years , authority across iran , with its population of more than 60 million , has remained within the closely circumscribed central hierarchy , which has appointed governors , mayors and religious leaders but the election of the local councils , with 200 , 000 seats , has the potential to begin to shift the balance , putting at least some power in the hands of vast numbers of ordinary people mr khatami has promoted the elections as an important step in developing iranian democracy the candidates whom the supervisory boards rejected are a tiny fraction of the candidates , but the number of nonclerics who seek office seems to have overwhelmed the screening panels
if ken griffey jr should somehow get out of his rut and hit more than 56 home runs this season , say 71 , just to pick a nice round number , tom lampkin might have to go into the hall of fame as the best goodluck charm in history lampkin was a teammate of mark mcgwire s in st louis last season , and now he plays in seattle , where griffey is the resident threat to mcgwire s still fresh record if it happens again , sure i would love to be on the club where it happens , lampkin said that ride we were on last year was just unbelievable and indescribable lampkin , a journeyman backup catcher , actually had more than an observer s role in mcgwire s successful pursuit of roger maris s record they were close friends , and when mcgwire took days off from speaking with the news media , lampkin served as a surrogate not that he could speak from vast experience on the subject of home runs in his sixteam , sevenyear career \( spread over 11 seasons \) , lampkin has hit only 27 home runs \( mcgwire had that many by the end of may \) , including two this season , both in the last week but he certainly has learned to know a home run when he sees it because he saw mcgwire hit plenty given his unique vantage point , lampkin was asked if it was farfetched to think that he could witness the record being broken a second successive season that s a good question , he said i 've thought about that i really do n't see anybody breaking that record , at least not in my lifetime not only do you have to have a bona fide home run hitter , but that bona fide home run hitter has to stay healthy all year he has to play on basically a noncontending team and he has to basically play noncontending clubs otherwise people are going to try to get him out he might end up taking more pitches to get his walks , to get himself on base there are just so many factors that go into a guy hitting 70 home runs despite his doubts , much of what lampkin said describes griffey s situation with their pitching , the mariners do n't figure to be much of a contender , and they will certainly play many noncontenders because the league is full of them in the same game that lampkin hit his first home run , against orlando hernandez at yankee stadium , griffey hit his 11th he entered last night s game with 12 in the mariners' 35 games in 35 games last season griffey had 14 home runs the year before he had 15 mcgwire hit 13 in the cardinals' first 35 games last season griffey , who has hit 56 in each of the last two seasons , countenances no talk about home runs , let alone home run records he steadfastly maintains that he is not even a home run hitter i try to hit the ball hard , he said if it goes out , it goes out i try to hit the ball the other way i get a bigger kick out of hitting a ball to left field than i do hitting a home run even when it was mentioned that none other than hank aaron has anointed him the most likely to break his career home run record , if any current player has a chance , griffey said he does not and will not try to hit home runs but 361 career home runs and 161 the past three seasons , which tie babe ruth for secondmost hit in three successive seasons , defines junior as a home run hitter he s demonstrated year in and year out he s a bona fide home run hitter , lampkin said when he gets a ball in the air , he has such a nice swing and such good extension that the ball is going to go out of the park i'm nobody to tell him he is or he is n't a home run hitter , but his approach is to hit the ball hard somewhere and that s a great approach lampkin , of course , feels privileged to have had the opportunity to play with both mcgwire and griffey they both have great work habits , he said both are very intense when it comes to their business and their job they both take their work seriously and they 're both great competitors lampkin noted one difference in their personalities junior s maybe a little more jovial than mark is during the course of the game , he said it seems like he takes it a little more easy and relaxes mark is more consistently intense from start to finish mcgwire , who has hit a record 180 home runs the past three seasons , is off to a slow start , with eight , to approach that average lampkin said mcgwire has told him in one of their many telephone conversations that he has n't been getting pitches to hit i 've watched some of his games on tv and he s getting balls four inches off the plate both inside and outside , lampkin said they 're pitching him tough once he gets his patience back , like he says he thinks he s starting to get around to , he 'll start taking those pitches and if it means walking , it s walking but could it be that mcgwire suffers from lampkin s absence \? without a question , the catcher said , laughing i told him i helped him hit a lot of those home runs now he s helping griffey al west has offense it looks as if a prerequisite for playing in the american league west is an incendiary offense
throughout november , with the st louis rams amassing victories as the giants were compiling losses , the scheduled date when the teams would meet dec 19 at st louis drearily loomed ahead for the giants , a cruel rendezvous , it seemed , between franchises with contrasting karma things change fast in the national football league buoyed by an unlikely twogame winning streak , the giants head to st louis today confidently in the chase for a playoff berth the rams , having had a remarkable season , await with the kind of detached cool that comes when you have clinched a division title with about a month to spare and yet , the 112 rams , like all budding ragstoriches stories , have had to hear often to their dismay that they have not yet tested themselves at the elite level the rams have lost at tennessee and at detroit , their only chances this year to defeat a winning team so the 76 giants will be seen in st louis as a stepping stone , an opportunity , however meager , at validation and what was once expected to be a matchup of two ships passing in the night with st louis s much more fortified could be a bellwether game for one team or the other st louis can earn a small measure of authentication , or the giants can say they are in a full sprint to the playoffs we have n't been as tested as other teams , the rams coach dick vermeil said last week i look forward to being tested the giants , meanwhile , have appeared anything but awestruck reminded that the rams have the league s toprated offense and are undefeated at home , giants free safety percy ellsworth said am i not supposed to show up because of that \? none of that scares us i know they 're very good i know they 're not undefeated , too confidence and optimism levels will no doubt have shifted by the end of this afternoon on one sideline or the other at the trans world dome giants fans , in fact , may know early how today s game will unfold in their 11 victories , the highpowered rams have scored a touchdown on their first possession of the game eight times in their two losses , the rams' offense has not scored in the first quarter it s all about momentum , and the rams have plenty of it they are a team that has not scored fewer than 21 points in any game and has scored 40 points or more three times at home this year , they have averaged 36 points the giants have not averaged 36 points for any two consecutive games for 11 years with kurt warner , the league s toprated quarterback marshall faulk , the national football league s most productive running back and wide receiver isaac bruce , the national football conference s thirdleading receiver , the rams' offense is precise , balanced and explosive and they should be motivated a victory today will give them homefield advantage throughout the conference playoffs and a bye in the first week of the postseason the giants , curiously , do not need to win today as much as they need to win their final two games , at home against minnesota and at dallas but turning the current twogame winning streak into a fivegame streak would assure the giants a playoff berth , if not a division title besides , the giants , unlike vermeil s rams , believe they have been tested plenty already this year they have played four likely playoff teams this season , and defeated two of them , tampa bay and buffalo , on the road they have a certain conviction about today s game , a selfassurance they also had traveling to buffalo last week ellsworth was not the only giant who seemed quietly anxious to see what today brings they 've got a bunch of good players , defensive tackle keith hamilton said you know , we 've got good a bunch of good players , too and finally , consider this lesson from giants history with a 56 record , a certain giants team once seemed lifeless and certainly out of the playoff chase then it went on a lateseason charge to finish 97 and become the first giants team to have a losing record in november and still end up qualifying for the playoffs that team was the 1981 giants its circumstances may someday describe the 1999 giants , but the '81 team has gone down as the one that spawned the modern era of success for the franchise when it made the playoffs on the season s final weekend , it set up the giants' first postseason game in 18 years if this year s giants are looking for role models , or thinking of establishing a new era of prosperity for the franchise , the 1981 team makes a good archetype already , the two squads have much in common the 1981 team was 53 at the midpoint of the season , then lost its next three games , just like the 1999 giants the 1981 team got back in the race , then won its final three games , something the 1999 team would now like to do the '81 team even won a playoff game and it defeated the dallas cowboys in the final game of the regular season to sneak into the playoffs the last game of this season for the giants , one they will most likely have to win to make the playoffs , is jan 2 in dallas photo giants safety percy ellsworth , left , on the rams i know they 're very good i know they 're not undefeated , too \( norman y lono for the new york times \)
when carlos figueroa was questioned by the police after the killing of a gas station owner in the bronx in 1980 , he admitted that he was at the scene that night , but he said that as soon as he heard gunfire , he darted out and hid i ran outside , he said i did n't want nothing to do with it nevertheless , mr figueroa was tried and convicted with two other men and was sentenced to 25 years to life he has been in prison ever since but now , 19 years later , a federal judge in manhattan has ruled that mr figueroa should not have been found guilty and has ordered him released if the state does not decide to retry him or appeal citing errors by the judge who presided at mr figueroa s trial , the prosecutor , and even mr figueroa s own lawyer , judge alvin k hellerstein of federal district court in manhattan said in a ruling issued wednesday that there was no physical evidence linking mr figueroa to the robbery or homicide , nor any eyewitness who said he had taken part in it thus , the judge ruled , mr figueroa had been convicted solely on the basis of confessions by a codefendant who did not testify at the trial , a violation of mr figueroa s right to confront witnesses against him without those statements from the codefendant , the judge added , it is doubtful that the jury would have convicted mr figueroa judge hellerstein ruled through the unusual step of granting a writ of habeas corpus through such writs , prisoners can ask a federal court to review a conviction or sentence from a state court , but only after going through the state s appeal process habeas requests flood the federal courts , but in recent years , congress and the supreme court have made it more difficult to obtain such reviews the number of requests that are actually granted , particularly in murder cases , is extremely low somewhere near zero , said gerard e lynch , a law professor at columbia university judge hellerstein also rejected arguments by the bronx district attorney s office that too much time had passed for mr figueroa to seek federal court review my duty , he said , is to apply the united states constitution to this case regardless of how long ago the conviction occurred when mr figueroa was originally tried and convicted of seconddegree murder in 1981 , mario merola was the bronx district attorney he has since died mr johnson s office , in papers filed with judge hellerstein , contended that mr figueroa had waited too long to seek federal court review and that his claims of unfairness were unsupported and meritless judge hellerstein gave the district attorney , robert t johnson , 30 days to decide whether to retry mr figueroa because of the veterans day holiday yesterday , mr johnson s office was closed , and a person who answered the phone said neither a spokesman nor a prosecutor from the case was available for comment mr figueroa , who is being held in the shawangunk correctional facility in ulster county , could not be reached for comment one of his lawyers , norman l reimer , said what happened to him was a terrible injustice my goal is for this young man to go home and pick up the pieces of his life , and hopefully we 'll get to that point after an exhaustive review of mr figueroa s arrest , trial and conviction , judge hellerstein found that mr figueroa had been a victim of the legal system at almost every step james s liebman , coauthor of a treatise on habeas corpus that was cited in the judge s opinion , said after reviewing the 42page decision that there had been a pretty egregious violation of mr figueroa s rights by the state courts you do n't see violations this clear most of the time , said professor liebman , who also teaches law at columbia for example , judge hellerstein criticized mr figueroa s former lawyer for making a closing argument that was disjointed and rambling , and for failing to raise on appeal the issue of the prejudicial effect of the codefendant s statements mr figueroa had admitted to the police that he had driven with three friends to a shell station on bruckner boulevard early on the morning of oct 3 , 1980 , judge hellerstein wrote but , in three separate statements to the police , mr figueroa , who was then about 20 , said he had not realized his friends had decided to stick up the gas station when he told one of the men that he did not want to participate , the man told me to shut up , mr figueroa said he said he left the shell station when he saw guns being drawn i was just hiding , he said , because i was there , you know , and i did n't have no place to go none of the government s witnesses placed mr figueroa at the scene at the time william hendricks was killed , and no fingerprints or other physical evidence linked him to the crime , judge hellerstein wrote one of his codefendants , hector rivera , implicated him in a statement to the police and in testimony before a grand jury , mr rivera confessed his own role in the crime , and indicated mr figueroa had been involved in the robbery but mr figueroa had denied this , and his new lawyers , mr reimer and susan j walsh , argued that the state judge , in allowing mr rivera s statements to be read to the jury , had violated mr figueroa s right to confront witnesses against him , because mr rivera did not testify judge hellerstein agreed , citing a united states supreme court case that makes it unconstitutional to introduce the confession of a codefendant who is exercising the right not to testify at a trial and thus cannot be crossexamined codefendants are often tried separately for that reason the judge noted that the prosecution had deleted mr figueroa s name from mr rivera s statements , but said it was obvious who he was referring to the sixth amendment to the united states constitution , guaranteeing fair trial and confrontation of witnesses , was violated , judge hellerstein wrote
after the mets clinched a trip to the national league championship series with a victory saturday , bobby valentine spoke of the ghosts the atlanta braves would face a new york team that chipper jones mocked less than two weeks ago but which has risen from the ashes of its selfimmolation we were supposed to be dead , right \? valentine asked as he searched for a full bottle of champagne in the mets' clubhouse saturday afternoon our fans were supposed to change gear they 're supposed to be watching football it was just three weeks ago it seems at least three months that the mets made their fateful trip to atlanta , beginning an odyssey of despair that nearly evicted them from the playoffs of which they are now the darling the yankee caps are still in the closets , defying the biting suggestion of jones who rained home runs on the mets as the braves beat them in five of six games in 10 days that the mets' fans might as well switch allegiances because their team s season was over yesterday , in preparation for game 1 tomorrow night in atlanta , valentine engaged in a bit of trashtalking that would have made a college football player proud , essentially telling jones in your face , pal it was n't personal with me , it was personal with anybody associated with the mets , the fans and players alike , valentine said of jones s remarks it was a premature statement and an incorrect statement i think he was very confident he would n't have to deal with the fans again this year guess what , he s going to have to deal with them again this year there was more valentine raced on , even conjuring images of whispered slights by the braves i think we really love the braves , valentine said 'they have nothing but our love and admiration , ' sarcastically said by bobby valentine i see no reason that we should have any affection for them we have great respect for them i think we still have to earn our respect they 've shown us very little there s been a lot of comments if the comments and actions they 've made over the years were in new york , as a new york team , they 'd be wellknown and documented a lot has slipped by asked for an example , he said i do n't want to get into specifics we know it and those who have been watching know it we 'll just go on to earn our respect the enmity between the braves and mets is , in fact , welldocumented , and it was heightened in the last few weeks of the season by flippant remarks from jones , reliever john rocker who announced his hatred of all things new york and valentine himself when asked whom he would give a manageroftheyear vote to , valentine said it would go to braves manager bobby cox because he had to manage this year while these teams poke each other in the eyes , though , the fact remains that the mets were only 3 of 12 against the braves this season their final six meetings were particularly abysmal , bracketing the miserable streak that left them two games behind in the wildcard race with three to play the mets inexplicably beat up on greg maddux in their lone victory , scoring nine runs , but they scored a total of 12 runs in the five losses for futility , it was hard to top the heart of the lineup robin ventura went 4 for 23 \( 174 \) , edgardo alfonzo was 4 for 25 \( 160 \) and john olerud was 3 for 26 \( 115 \) only mike piazza , whose availability tomorrow will be decided at game time , held fast to his average , batting 304 \( 7 for 23 \) now , though , the mets are riding a wave of good feeling from their recovery in the season s final weekend and their threegamestoone elimination of arizona in the division series after saturday s 43 victory over the diamondbacks , valentine was maniacally hugging the same players he had said were not too smart or professional in a magazine interview last week and they are convinced that things will be different this time in atlanta with the slight bit of swagger that comes from beating randy johnson and dismissing an arizona team that had 100 regularseason victories , the mets figure that they are the loosest and hence , most dangerous team left in the playoffs general manager steve phillips said before the mets made the playoffs that the minimum goal at the start of spring training had been to get to the postseason by that standard by any standard , really their race into the nlcs has been a raging success , especially in light of how close they came to letting the braves destroy them i think we 've tried too hard against them , phillips said we pressed a little bit i think we 'll go in as loose as we could , compared to any point in the year they 've handed it to us all year and they 're supposed to do it again but it feels different the pressure was on then to get them now we 're going in with nothing to lose the players have been more sanguine in the glee of their champagnescented celebration , they were careful with their words it s always been the situation all decade that you had to go through atlanta , al leiter said for the most part , they 've had our number now , it s the ultimate challenge for us valentine was having none of it jones has cooled off since the mets left town , and he batted 231 against houston in the division series with one run batted in and no extrabase hits but he still haunts mets fans , who remember the september home runs and who wonder , still , if it s really necessary to pitch to the probable most valuable player in the national league valentine had one zinger left , and he was going to use it i do n't think we 're playing against chipper jones , valentine said i saw the last series and i saw the series at the end of the year and i did n't see chipper doing all the damage and i saw people pitching to him and getting him out i

marion motley , one of the national football league s first black players of the modern era and one of its best fullbacks ever , died yesterday in cleveland he was 79 motley , a star with the cleveland browns from 1946 to 1953 and a member of the pro football hall of fame , had been suffering from prostate cancer , according to joe horrigan , a spokesman for the hall motley s first four years in pro football were the four seasons that the allamerica football conference existed the browns , with a 4743 record , won the league championship every year in 1950 , the nfl absorbed three aafc teams the browns , the san francisco 49ers and the baltimore colts and the aafc went out of business many football people felt that the browns would be outclassed in the established nfl , but in motley s four years in that league the browns won their conference title every year and the league championship in 1950 , when motley led the league in rushing with 810 yards on 140 carries those browns had such celebrated players as quarterback otto graham , wide receivers mac speedie and dante lavelli , the offensive tackle and kicker lou groza and offensive guard bill willis none contributed more than the 6foot1inch , 238pound motley , who was fast , explosive and hardworking in eight seasons with essentially a passing team , he rushed for 4 , 720 yards and 31 touchdowns he was the aafc s career rushing leader with 3 , 024 yards motley was an inside blaster who had the speed to go outside he made most of his yardage on trap plays , on which a defensive lineman was allowed to penetrate the line of scrimmage , then was trapped , allowing motley to run through the vacated area the trap was a fantastic play , he said , but i was seldom sent outside there s no telling how much yardage i might have made if i ran as much as some backs do now motley was also an exceptional pass blocker for graham the quarterback called him the best fullback i ever saw , a better allaround player than jimmy brown blanton collier , a browns assistant coach then and later the head coach , rated motley the greatest allaround football player i ever saw he had no equal as a blocker , collier said he could run with anybody for 30 yards or so and this man was a great , great linebacker motley was born on june 5 , 1920 , in leesburg , ga he was raised in canton , ohio , and played for mckinley high school paul brown , who would become the cleveland browns' founder and coach , first saw him there when brown was coaching massillon high school , mckinley s rival motley was an undistinguished college player for one year at south carolina state and three years at nevada after college , he joined the navy and played for the 1945 great lakes naval training station team , coached by brown my dad always felt marion was the greatest back he ever had , paul brown s son , the cincinnati bengals' owner , mike brown , said yesterday until the browns signed willis in 1946 , there were only two black players kenny washington and woody strode of the los angeles rams in the nfl and none in the aafc the browns had turned down motley once , but now they wanted a black roommate for willis and gave the 26yearold motley a tryout as motley later told the story after a few practices , one of the white linemen , mike scarry , told paul brown , 'either you get motley for our side or i go over to his side' after that , i did n't worry about being bill willis s roommate i wanted to be the best fullback he became that , but he played his last four seasons with knee trouble and quit just before the 1954 season he attempted a comeback in 1955 with the pittsburgh steelers , supposedly as a linebacker he played five of the first six games , mostly as a blocking back for punts and field goals , but his knees were still bad and the steelers dropped him his salary was 4 , 500 as a rookie and 15 , 000 in his last year with the browns after his playing days , motley wanted to coach in the nfl , but black coaches were scarce he coached a women s team in 1967 in cleveland and did occasional scouting for the browns he worked in a post office and a parking lot and was a supervisor for the ohio lottery in 1968 , he became the second black player \( after emlen tunnell of the giants \) to be voted into the pro football hall , which is in canton as his presenter , he chose willis , his old roommate motley said he was glad he played pro football i was fortunate , he said , to be able to be one of the few to excel at something i liked to do he is survived by three sons , a brother and a sister photo none of the postwar browns , including otto graham and lou groza , contributed more than marion motley , the team s powerful fullback \( united press international \)
in the first inning last night , david cone threw to first base five times , which was five more times than he threw to first during the entire game in his last start cone did n't throw to first in his last start because the montreal expos never put a runner on first base , or any base , for that matter perfection does not last long in baseball in cone s case it lasted nine innings last sunday and ended abruptly against last night with the cleveland indians' first hitter the first pitch cone threw since he retired orlando cabrera on a foul pop for the 27th out last sunday was a strike but his next four pitches to kenny lofton missed the strike zone , and , just like that , the indians accomplished something with one batter that the expos failed to do with 27 coming off this game , cone will not be asked to appear with regis and kathie lee or read david letterman s top 10 list no key to the city for this performance no platform to make intended or unintended political comments no , the only significance this game will have in cone s record is that , to date this season , it was the briefest of his 19 starts the difference can be discerned from his pitching lines last sunday 9 0 0 0 0 10 last night 4 6 6 2 4 7 not a very good encore , huh \? cone said after the yankees had rescued him with a 98 , 10inning victory on derek jeter s tworun single i was really pumped up , he added i got a great ovation walking out to warm up and then walking in i was probably overly excited i wanted to do so well with the big crowd i actually felt good i had probably my best fastball of the year most of the strikeouts were on fastballs , but i did n't have much else to go with it last sunday , cone had the overmatched expos flailing at sliders that broke well off the plate last night roberto alomar hit a grand slam on a slider that stayed over the plate felipe alou , the montreal manager , was concerned when he was making out his lineup last sunday because he realized none of his nine starting players had ever seen a live pitch from cone as the game progressed , those players showed alou that he had reason to worry the indians' lineup , on the other hand , was filled with veteran players , who collectively had amassed 215 atbats against cone eight of the batters had batted those 215 times russell branyan had not branyan is the indians' highly touted rookie third baseman who was summoned from their class aaa buffalo club yesterday he had never faced cone , but branyan swung at the second pitch the righthander threw him , a splitfingered fastball that stayed up , cone said , and sent it soaring into the rightfield stands for a tworun home run alomar , a more seasoned batter against cone , applied the coup de grace , smacking a grand slam on the third pitch after chuck knoblauch threw away the third out in the fourth inning last sunday , knoblauch , the enigmatic second baseman , preserved cone s perfect game by snaring jose vidro s hard grounder near second base and throwing him out for the second out in the eighth inning with two out and runners at first and second in the fourth inning last night , omar vizquel rapped a similar grounder , though not as hard and not as far away from knoblauch the pitch i threw to vizquel was a slider and it came off of his bat with kind of a corkscrew spin , cone said it took a little bit of a quick hop knoblauch could n't save cone this time instead , he did him in with his 17th error the miscue came on cone s 89th pitch of the game last sunday , cone dispatched those 27 expos with 88 pitches i really wanted to pick him up in that situation , cone said he s been playing great defensively lately it s the most disappointing i 've been in a while i did n't want that error to be magnified it was as a result of my giving up the grand slam as cone was throwing his first five pitches , the fans in the rightfield stands were engaged in their nightly ritual of chanting the name of each player in the yankees' lineup until the player acknowledged the salute after cone threw his first pitch , another ball , to the second batter , vizquel , the fans began chanting , david coone , david coone virtually all of the yankees' pitchers ignore the fans david wells , in fact , was the only one who waved that s right , that david wells , the one who began this annual yankeesperfectsundayafternoongame event before throwing his second pitch to vizquel , cone paused and acknowledged the fans i do n't usually do that , he said , but they were exceptionally loud it did n't sound like they were going to stop i figured i better wave at them the perfect game already gone , cone still had his nohitter but that did n't last long either richie sexson , the first batter in the second inning , lined a single to left , and cone suddenly was mortal again but did he have to become so mortal that he would give up two home runs for six runs and last only four innings \? baseball can be that cruel one start does not necessarily have anything to do with the next one after all , in his start before the perfect game , the detroit tigers battered cone for six runs and 12 hits in seven innings who would have known he would be perfect in his next game \? now about his next start against the white sox in chicago next week photo against the indians , the yankees' david cone could not recapture the form that produced a perfect game \( chang w lee the new york times \)
the new york city board of education has canceled a vote scheduled for today on an 11 billion , fiveyear school construction proposal after angry complaints from queens officials that the plan would leave the borough with cramped classroom space for tens of thousands of students one alternative approach , drafted at the urging of queens officials , would shift perhaps 400 million worth of additional school construction to queens but nearly half of that money representing several thousand new seats would have to be siphoned from the allocations for the bronx and brooklyn , whose needs are also great , board officials said the squabbling over how best to carve up the school system s precious construction resources comes just weeks after the sevenmember board split bitterly over an effort by mayor rudolph w giuliani to create a taxpayerfinanced school voucher program at the center of both debates are claire shulman , the queens borough president , and her appointee to the board , terri thomson , who is considered the swing vote on vouchers faced with a threat from schools chancellor rudy crew to resign if the board approved the mayor s voucher plan , mr giuliani said this month that he would seek a compromise that would somehow satisfy the chancellor but the mayor has insisted that he has not given up on the idea of vouchers to pay for private or parochial schools , and board officials say his persistence has served to increase the political leverage of ms thomson and ms shulman ms thomson need only secure the votes of the mayor s two appointees to the board , ninfa segarra and irene h impellizzeri , and the vote of the staten island representative , jerry cammarata , a consistent mayoral ally , to rewrite the capital plan in queens s favor and that calculus has members from other boroughs worried when you 're a swing vote , and you want something , does it give you a greater ability to wield a bigger club \? said one member , who spoke on the condition of anonymity absolutely the question is , the member said , is terri really going to trade vouchers for capacity \? in an interview yesterday , ms thomson said the two issues were entirely unrelated she said easing crowding in queens schools , overrun by a continuing rush of immigration , was her most serious priority , with some projections showing queens having 60 , 000 more students than seats by 2007 she said she would not begin to contemplate her position on vouchers until after the construction budget was settled is there any way that i would bargain a philosophical issue for the added money for queens \? she asked no a spokeswoman for the board , karen crowe , said officials were trying mightily to devise a plan that would help queens but not substantially hurt any other boroughs one alternative , she said , would shift money that was earmarked for computers , or set aside for emergencies , to build more classrooms in queens but expanding the construction budget beyond 11 billion to accommodate queens would require substantial effort as it stands , it will be a challenge for the board to wring 11 billion from the city , federal and state governments weighing the classroom needs of one borough against another is a tangled undertaking on the one hand , queens s schools appear more crowded than those of other boroughs the borough s high schools , for example , are operating at 123 percent of their capacity , a higher rate than at schools in the bronx \( 118 percent \) , brooklyn \( 115 percent \) , manhattan \( 104 percent \) and staten island \( 92 percent \) , the board says but those calculations do not reflect that brooklyn has many of the oldest and most decrepit school buildings in the city and that the bronx relies heavily on converted libraries , partitioned classrooms and leased spaces like churches to hold its capacity to 118 percent i could not vote for a budget that does not address the needs of the borough of the bronx , said sandra e lerner , the bronx board member where would we cut \? under the original fiveyear construction plan , which the chancellor introduced in november , queens would have to convert a disproportionate number of schools to yearround calendars to accommodate enrollment growth for instance , while brooklyn would be expected to create 800 new seats using expanded calendars , in which students would effectively share desks by attending school on staggered schedules , queens would have to convert enough schools to yearround calendars to create 11 times as many seats for a total of 8 , 800 and if the state legislature does not approve such yearround calendars , as is required , the board has no immediate backup plan even under the existing plan , queens stands to receive a disproportionate share of new construction in an effort to accommodate a student population swollen by immigration under the november draft , there would be 25 , 350 new seats in 36 new schools in queens , compared with 8 , 500 in brooklyn , 7 , 800 in the bronx , 3 , 250 in manhattan and none on staten island

it is embarrassingly clear , if you study the hollywood reporter s current list of the world s most bankable actors , that neither movie makers nor movie audiences give a damn about conventional romances or unconventional women there are 3 women on the list of the 18 said to have maximum star power , and only one of those , jodie foster , regularly makes films in which she is the cerebral and solitary action hero tom hanks does just fine without meg ryan , but what about meg ryan without a leading man who can dote on all those intractably winsome tricks and manners \? charming julia roberts , the third woman on the list , makes every man she plays opposite look better , but she only met her actorly match quite recently in susan sarandon \( ed harris was relegated to the role of underwritten love object in the sappy stepmom \) it has never really mattered whom you put opposite mel gibson , harrison ford , jack nicholson or clint eastwood , and it wo n't ever matter whom you put opposite john travolta , nicolas cage or will smith all that seems critical to leonardo dicaprio s leading ladies is that they die , and that he die along with them so of course part of the disgust \? fury \? resignation \? that accompanies the old plaint about the lack of good roles for women lies in the fact that so few women can carry a movie on the strength of star appeal then there s the inevitable belief that the good stories are deemed more appropriate for men why not good will hunting with young workingclass women and a female therapist \?

fort worth the nation s biggest military contractor , lockheed martin , has a long history of making fighters , but lately the company has been hammered on a number of fronts its breadandbutter product , the f16 , is coming to the end of its production cycle , with around 4 , 000 planes already made the future of the f22 , on which lockheed is the prime contractor , is uncertain the company has suffered production delays on its c130j military cargo plane and has experienced costly launch failures in its military missile program so the view from fort worth , where lockheed s version of the joint strike fighter is being designed and where the f16 is made in a milelong plant that could , someday , turn out the new plane , is that this program is the ticket to the 21st century we are the fighter house of america , said james a blackwell , president of lockheed s aeronautics sector the joint strike fighter is the future of this house our corporation has made it the top business priority , bar none there s no one that does n't work on jsf daily harry blot , lockheed s deputy program manager for joint strike fighter , added this is the main design effort for the next century in tactical aircraft unless you are designing this , there are not many other things out there to design we need to be prime on this program with that level of urgency , lockheed is spending 719 million in government funds to develop a relatively traditionallooking plane that resembles a scaleddown f22 its major innovation is in the marine version , where the vertical liftoff system allows for a heavier plane with a smaller engine visiting lockheed s fort worth facility is like coming to a military installation officers from around the world fill the lobby south africa s defense minister , a delegation from britain and one from the united arab emirates were all there on a single day tall , slim men in test pilots' jump suits wander the hallways the company says this activity sets it apart from boeing a sign of its longstanding ties to foreign military buyers and its history as more of a military than a commercial airplane maker long dogged by cost overruns on its military projects , lockheed is engaged in a largescale reengineering effort on the factory floor where f16 s are churned out japanesestyle production techniques have helped cut the manufacturing cost of each f16 to around 25 million , a 40 percent reduction in the last decade , even with lower production runs , according to a recent congressional report bluecollar workers with texas twangs now sprinkle their language with terms like kaizan , meaning continuous improvement , and talk about japanesestyle meetings in the workplace despite this new corporate attention to costs , lockheed still managed to roll up 100 million in overruns on the joint strike fighter program some because of accounting problems , some due to production issues by altering its plans for how it will use its two concept planes to demonstrate the three versions of the fighter in next year s flyoff , the company is back within budget with such a strong emphasis on costs in the program , lockheed knows it cannot win on the plane s performance alone just off the factory floor , the company is building a display for workers about the benefits of lean manufacturing the final panel \? a mock front page of the fort worth startelegram with the headline , lockheed wins the jsf contract photo the lockheed x35 joint strike fighter in the skunk works hangar

except for the yankees and their legendary succession of home run hitters , championship teams and home run champions have shown no significant correlation throughout baseball history but the 1990 s have produced even fewer home run champions on firstplace teams than in previous decades that development has been punctuated by the twoyear onslaught of mark mcgwire and sammy sosa , who entered last night s games tied for the national league lead with 61 home runs a year after they became the first two players to break the 61homer barrier sosa hit his 62d in the cubs' victory over the phillies last night as exciting and remarkable as their exploits have been the second time around , much attention has been focused on the negative aspects of the astronomical number of home runs mcgwire and sosa have hit until the chicago cubs won four consecutive games last week , they threatened to become the first team in baseball history to have one of its players hit more home runs than it had victories from aug 31 , when sosa hit his 55th home run , until last wednesday , when the cubs gained their 61st victory , sosa was ahead of his team now the cubs are leading him at least the cubs have a winning record \( 2927 \) in games in which sosa has hit home runs the st louis cardinals have a losing record \( 2131 \) in games in which mcgwire has homered mcgwire , in fact , has hit more home runs in losing games \( 38 \) than any player in baseball history none of this , however , suggests that mcgwire somehow contributes to cardinal losses with his home runs in their third and fourth losses in a fourgame sweep by cincinnati earlier this week , mcgwire s home runs were instrumental in triggering scoring sprees that put the cardinals ahead of the reds , only to have the reds come back themselves and win based on developments in this decade , home runs and victories do n't necessarily go together only twice since 1989 has a league s home run champion played for a team that finished in first place albert belle hit 50 home runs in 1995 when cleveland won the american league central title and the league pennant ken griffey jr hit 56 in 1997 when seattle finished first in the al west belle and griffey represent the smallest collection in their category since the 1940 s , when only two players combined individual and team championships they were hank greenberg , who hit 41 home runs when the detroit tigers won the al pennant in 1940 and dolph camilli , who socked 34 when the brooklyn dodgers won the nl pennant in 1941 it was n't until 1954 in the al and 1956 in the nl that home run champions again finished first in the wonlost standings larry doby \( 32 \) did it with cleveland in '54 and duke snider \( 43 \) with the dodgers in '56 the yankees have had far more instances of team and home run championships than any other team , but even they have not achieved those dual honors regularly in the 37 years the yankees have finished first in the league or their division , they have produced the al home run champion 14 times babe ruth five times mickey mantle four times and lou gehrig , joe dimaggio , roger maris , graig nettles and reggie jackson once each in recent years the yankees have n't had that type of home run hitter since they resumed finishing first in 1996 , they have had lineups that featured a collection of good hitters , though not prolific home run hitters the 44 home runs tino martinez hit in 1997 were an exception the title teams in the 1990 s , however , have n't been completely devoid of home run hitters firstplace teams have had players with impressive home run performances they just have n't been good enough to put the players at the head of their leagues for example , last season greg vaughn whacked 50 home runs for san diego , the nl west winner in another season , his total would have stood out and he would have been the league champion but not in 1998 , when mcgwire hit 70 and sosa 66 in the same league similarly last season , two of the al division champions , cleveland and texas , had players with 45 home runs \( manny ramirez and juan gonzalez \) , a once hefty total but ken griffey jr hit 56 for the second successive season in 1996 gonzalez connected for 47 home runs and belle 48 for al division champions , but three players topped them , led by mcgwire with 52 for oakland in 1992 mcgwire hit 42 for al west champion oakland , but gonzalez won the league title with 43 one factor that has made a major difference in nl home run races in the 90 s has been the creation of the colorado rockies playing at a home runfriendly altitude , rockies' hitters won three consecutive league titles before mcgwire and sosa began their slugging act last season dante bichette won with 40 in 1995 , andres galarraga with 47 in '96 and larry walker with 49 in '97 , but the expansion rockies were n't good enough to finish first last year , when galarraga played for a team good enough to win , atlanta , he clouted 44 home runs , but he was easily eclipsed in the greatest home run race in baseball history photos the cards have a losing record \( 2131 \) in games when mark mcgwire has hit a home run \(

a new operatic project could hardly receive a more auspicious introduction than that to be accorded over the next five months to central park , a trilogy of oneact operas by three american composerlibrettist teams that s why the flak that the project has stirred up among many people concerned about the future of american opera , especially american composers , has been so noteworthy the short operas that make up the trilogy are linked thematically only in that each story is set in new york s most famous park central park will have its premiere on saturday evening at the glimmerglass opera in cooperstown , ny , which commissioned it jointly with the new york city opera , which will present the production in november the third partner in the project was pbs s great performances series , which will videotape the production at glimmerglass and broadcast it nationally in the fall to an anticipated audience of six million so what s the problem \? this new trilogy , the critics say , has been a librettistdriven venture from its inception the librettists , each working for the first time in opera , are eminent playwrights wendy wasserstein \( the heidi chronicles , the sisters rosensweig \) , terrence mcnally \( master class , love ! valour ! compassion ! \) and a r gurney \( the cocktail hour , sylvia \) the youngergeneration composers , deborah drattell , robert beaser and michael torke , were selected during a later stage of the planning it is unfair to compare the relative status of playwrights and composers playwrights can have works produced on broadway and write film scripts composers , by and large , have nothing like that kind of visibility in popular culture that said , the pairings in central park would seem to be stacked against the composers what fed this perception early in the twoandahalfyear genesis of central park was the fact that the composer originally brought in to work with mr mcnally , aaron jay kernis , was edged out of the project when he and the playwright had creative disagreements more recently , some illadvised publicity materials in which the names of the librettists dwarfed those of the composers did not help matters paul kellogg , the managing and artistic director of city opera and the artistic director of glimmerglass , a man fired by a desire to produce opera , including new opera , as vibrant musical theater , has acknowledged that the venture was created backward , meaning that the librettists were hired first but in a recent conversation he contested the notion that central park was writerdriven that perception occurred because the presence of the librettists in a certain world is so substantial that one might assume their presence would be large in this other world , he said but all three were intrigued by the idea of giving opera a shot and were partners in the best sense , rewriting texts with the composers at hand , often in the same room 'central park' has turned out to be an amazing collaboration , and deeply touching the balance of power between composers and librettists is a touchy subject composers had to fight for control in the early days of opera , a fight they assumed they had won more than 200 years ago in the mid18th century , opera was essentially dominated by librettists take the italian poet pietro metastasio , a lapsed lawyer with an impeccable education , an elegant verse style and powerful champions all a new opera needed to attract attention and an audience was metastasio s illustrious name on the top of the placards as librettist , and he always got top billing his 27 librettos , lofty creations on serious themes , received more than 300 different settings by composers with such varying degrees of recognition today as porta , uttini and handel and his librettos kept getting set , though at a dwindling pace , for a good 40 years after his death in 1782 then gluck came along , followed by mozart , and opera got reformed , meaning , in effect , that the balance of power shifted definitively to composers for example , in his youth mozart set two metastasio texts more or less faithfully but in his last opera , la clemenza di tito , he boldly had metastasio s classic libretto adapted to his own musical needs since then opera has been primarily composerdriven the proof is unambiguous no opera with a good libretto but negligible music has survived , including dozens on texts by metastasio \( ever heard of myslivecek s antigono \? \) but many operas with hapless librettos are timeless repertory works \( simon boccanegra and il trovatore come to mind \) in recent decades , composers have been losing clout and control , as john harbison , whose opera gatsby will be given its premiere at the metropolitan opera in december , asserted recently i welcome the bigname librettists to opera , mr harbison said stravinsky did a great thing for opera by bringing in auden , a major figure , to work on 'the rake s progress' but auden behaved with the utmost humility it is important that librettists and the producers understand that they are in a secondary position that s the nature of the beast my fear is that bringing in prominent writers will be a marketing ploy rather than a genuine attempt to improve the quality of the work

princeton , nj , oct 12 with none of the protests that have marked his previous appearances on campus , peter singer , the princeton university professor whose support of infant euthanasia in severe cases of disability has made him a lodestone for controversy , debated his views publicly for the first time tonight before 500 students and faculty members the debate , sponsored by the university s bioethics forum , focused on two main issues when , if ever , it would be appropriate to kill a disabled infant , and the relative worth of living with a profound disability professor singer , who was named the university s first ira w decamp professor of bioethics a year ago , did not break any new philosophical ground his most provocative statement tonight essentially repeated what has led so many of his critics to protest his appointment and none of what he presented in the discussion , titled ethics , health care and disability , seemed to come as much of a shock to his audience , mostly students , or his debate opponent , adrienne asch , a professor of ethics at wellesley college i do not think it is always wrong to kill an innocent human being , professor singer told the rapt audience in harold helm auditorium simply killing an infant is never equivalent to killing a person professor singer , 53 , an advocate of animal rights who also has said he donates a fifth of his salary to famine relief , went on to challenge the idea that human life , simply because it is human , is worth more than that of any other animal and he said that , all things being equal , it is better not to have a disability i do n't think anyone seriously disbelieves that , he said but professor asch , who is blind and referred to her notes in braille as she spoke , disagreed while she acknowledged professor singer s willingness to present his views and said she did not believe he was a monster , as some critics have charged , she said , if there is a monster , it is not peter singer , it is the views he purports in particular , she contested his implication that a disabled person s life was not as complete as that anyone else s i think it is simply wrong to put all desires , pleasures , goals on one calculator and say that life without disabilities is always better than life with it , she said since last year , when his appointment was announced , professor singer has been a lightning rod on the day he began his graduate seminar , questions of life and death , the police arrested 14 demonstrators , including several people in wheelchairs , after a rally outside the university s administration building to protest his views on euthanasia the group that led that protest , not dead yet , was not in evidence tonight , nor were there other protests caroline nuffort , a princeton senior , said , i'm not all that disturbed , because it s just philosophy i 'd be a lot more disturbed if he were trying to implement it , she said , referring to the professor s view that sometimes it is better to end the life a severely disabled infant jed seltzer , a senior from philadelphia , said he came out of curiosity how do you judge the ethics of an ethicist \? he asked before the debate i feel like i would n't consider myself wellinformed until i 'd read every single one of his books diego von vacano , a graduate student from bolivia , said he felt that professor singer s views were not being fairly represented in the media i do n't think he s all that extreme , mr von vacano said the main thing is to be openminded and to listen to what he has to say i think princeton should have more professors like this professor singer seemed to appreciate a chance to offer his views it s obvious that the events relating to my appointment were a factor in choosing this as a topic for a debate , he noted photo dr peter singer says euthanasia is right in some circumstances \( associated press \)
throwim way leg treekangaroos , possums , and penis gourds on the track of unknown mammals in wildest new guinea by tim flannery illustrated 326 pp new york atlantic monthly press 25 it is always slightly unnerving arriving at a new location in new guinea , tim flannery says you have no idea what the locals will be like or how you will be received what an understatement ! this man walked alone into a village for the first time and overheard three locals agreeing to kill him , and that is far from the most threatening situation he found himself in the title of his book , throwim way leg , is pidgin for going on a journey flannery , a celebrated mammalogist and paleontologist at the australian museum in sydney , made 15 long research excursions into new guinea beginning in 1981 , when he was 26 in a dozen years he identified at least 17 new species of mammals , and his mammals of new guinea \( 1990 \) is the standard scientific guide but throwim way leg is more than an account of his fieldwork it is an enthralling introduction to the mountain people of new guinea unimaginably remote , charming , cunning , cruel , subtle and appealing and to their magnificent land flannery is not always an eloquent writer , but his evocations of the new guinean landscape carry you away about 12 , 000 years ago , when the ocean swallowed an iceage land bridge between australia and new guinea , life on the island was cut off from the world in a place with no pack animals , where walking is the only locomotion and passage in any direction requires scaling mountains rising from 5 , 000 to 15 , 000 feet , people became so isolated from one another that today almost 1 , 000 languages are used equatorial monsoons sweeping the mountains create alpine swamps in the clouds , and on such wet vertical terrain arable tracts and dwelling spaces are few and distant , so the islanders formed tribes in tiny villages , warring with one another for 500 generations no common identity developed and there is no political history kingdoms , pyramids , common religion , shared culture , all that early in this century the netherlands claimed the western half of the island and australia the eastern half but they stuck to the coast only in the late 30 s was much contact made with mountain people , the vast bulk of the population now the world is moving in in 1963 dutch new guinea became irian jaya , a province of indonesia , and in 1975 the australian territory became a nation , papua new guinea there are still almost no roads on the island , and none across it but small airstrips multiply , and international companies operate gold and copper mines so the tribesmen are moving in a lifetime from the neolithic period into the global westernized economy flannery s intimacy with them was necessary to find unknown species of mammals he needed local hunters they could eat their prey and he got the skin and bones for his natural history museum soon he needed the tribesmen for their rich companionship readers will share his respect for their intelligence and his delight in their cutting sense of humor , especially about sex , and in their practical jokes , childish but shrewd tests of the wit of their targets rightly , flannery honored the tribesmen in scientific names he gave a few species \( he had an amusing payback in kind through a youth who helped him clean dead animals and took as reward a gut parasite from them , which he swallowed alive a parasitologist to whom flannery sent one of these creatures found it was a new species and named it flannery s tapeworm burtiela flanneryi \) the tribesmen spring vividly from these pages , speaking in their own voices , and you will remember many by name some are cannibals a lot of lurid speculation has been published about new guinea cannibalism over the last 50 years , so the sobriety of flannery s account is a relief a village headman told him a revealing story about where his son , a young man flannery admires , came from the headman s village staged an attack on a neighboring community , killed all the adults , gutted their carcasses to carry home for food and raised the children as their own , among them a baby hidden in a tree his son his wife added we ate his parents they gave me all the milk i needed to nourish two children flannery says cannibalism was never ubiquitous in new guinea nothing is but other cannibals appear here , including a great hunter who , in a fit of blinding grief , hatcheted his daughter and commanded his family to feast on her flannery offers no excuses , and few judgments he does say that in some tribes child mortality nears 100 percent and , with governments now curbing the traditional village raids , certain communities face extinction in fact , the whole population does , every day , from cholera , malaria , ringworm , amebic dysentery , pig tapeworm , tropical ulcers , intestinal roundworms and scrub typhus \( not to mention hypothermia on mountain passes where people wearing little more than penis gourds or grass skirts can easily end up as wilddog food \) flannery s own experience of several of these diseases is grim reading you know he must love his work
monica lewinsky and linda tripp bill clinton and vernon jordan sidney blumenthal and christopher hitchens in a case about sex and the purported attempt to cover it up , these are the couples and they are couples hovering beside each other in some distant circle of historical purgatory , forever , like paolo and francesca the glare of kenneth starr s investigation has illuminated one of the most complicated and unpredictable of human relationships friendship but what we see exposed in the harsh lighting is not the comradely bond or sentimental loyalty that usually passes for friendship in the public forum what we see is an ambivalent , vulnerable , awkward thing there was always something off about this tale it did n't follow the narrative line it was supposed to the love affair had none of the operatic passion of classic drama both parties too consciously conceded its boundaries nor was it proper tabloid exploitation mighty zeus embracing a helpless swan as the story unfolded , we were expected to become ever more shocked instead , we became less shocked with each squalid detail , we felt a chill of possibility , a queasy stir of human sympathy sometimes it seemed as if the whole impeachment saga was about friendship for linda tripp , now on the rehabilitation trail , the heart of her defense is to call herself a friend i always saw monica as a kid , she said this week i believe she and the country will never understand that i believed this was in her best interest , and that makes me very sad yet even as she recites her revised version of the relationship , ms tripp cannot edit out her disgust and disdain for the recalcitrant little child she only wanted to help and what she cannot edit in is affection other , real friendships have emerged , though sickly and dazed , blinking idiotically in the daylight of public exposure monica lewinsky s girlish chitchat friendship was the first to wobble out into public derision pundits clucked at the valley girl but chitchat , unlike punditry , is not meant to sweat on a sound stage it s meant to meander through telephone lines toward someone who absorbs the words rather than just listening , who has entered an unspoken pact of fondness and trust that person is a friend , a partner in a gossipy , needy , recklessly generous kind of friendship then there was vernon jordan , at first referred to as mr clinton s golf buddy , then dismissed as an almost feudal loyalist , a man tied to the president by some beltway arrangement of honor and fealty but mr jordan clarified the relationship the president is my friend and there , again , on screens lining the senate walls , we caught a fleeting glimpse of affection mr jordan reclaimed his friendship from crude public characterizations he and ms lewinsky both found ways to keep their relationships personal , if not private at the culmination of this epic social text , their efforts felt almost heroic we were already in the last chapter when christopher hitchens was accused of betraying his friend sidney blumenthal the public betrayals of friendship in this drama were the real scandals , what people talked about , what continue to make us queasy we get why someone betrays a lover or husband or wife we recognize appetite , and longing and we share the sadness and outrage and resigned disgust of the lover betrayed but the betrayal by linda tripp did not arise out of human weakness the damage they caused seemed to be the point , not just the outcome kenneth starr had no use for the oddity and nuance of friendship but in human relationships , and in any serious story , that s all there is maybe , this account of affection and betrayal would have worked better in the form of a poem it s hard to explain this it s like \( sigh \) that s a line from the lewinskytripp transcripts it s a line kenneth starr and the house managers should have paid more attention to everybody else did

all i know is that the first ever woodstock was here , said the 10yearold , dolores rowen and what was the first woodstock \? a band playing , she explained her chaperone , ed peters , 44 , elaborated , but they had instruments none of ms spears s four opening acts had instruments or backing singers onstage either , despite music that included lots of instruments and backing vocals the openers included three acts manufactured from the same mold as ms spears , the backstreet boys and 'n sync they were michael fredo , c note and third storee also performing was the odd group out , the sugar hill gang , the act responsible for hiphop s first hit , rapper s delight , and now the genre s first bona fide oldies act the show was the inaugural event in what is planned as an annual concert series on the original woodstock site , said alan gerry , the local cable billionaire who bought the farm and the surrounding area in 1996 renamed a day in the garden \( after a lyric from joni mitchell s woodstock \) , the former farm will now stage eight shows a year , mr gerry said , with the construction of an indoor theater and a large outdoor stage being planned although it took a large stretch of the imagination to envision woodstock occurring on this patch of land 30 years ago , the atmosphere laid back , well organized and dotted with baby strollers was perfect for a spears concert at which families could celebrate independence day together despite a capacity of 30 , 000 and free tickets for the neighbors , attendance was only 6 , 500 \( about 393 , 500 fewer than were estimated to have shown up at woodstock 1969 \) explaining his choice of ms spears to open the first season , mr gerry explained that he wanted to get young people used to coming to the site as it begins to expand with everything from a farmer s market to a possible amusement park , from hotels to a concert complex does n't ford want to get the 15 and 16yearolds used to driving a ford \? he asked despite her young following , ms spears s music and image is shot through with a strange ambiguity it s not just her looks , simultaneously sexual and presexual that look is emphasized in her first video , in which she wears a slightly raunchedup schoolgirl outfit , and in her stage show on sunday , for which she wore a pink spandex tube top so slick it looked wet it s also her lyrics in her first single , baby one more time , she begs a lover to come back , singing , give me a sign hit me baby one more time it is never specified whether the word hit is meant in the sense of rob base and dj ez rock s call to hit it , or begin , in their song it takes two , or in the sense of he hit me \( and it felt like a kiss \) by the crystals in her second single , sometimes , ms spears tells a suitor , if you really want me , move slow , explaining that , sometimes i run sometimes i hide sometimes i'm scared of you but all i really want is to hold you tight much less clear a message than the spice girls' singing that if you want to be their lover , first you have to be their friend , sometimes could also be interpreted as an invitation for a man to keep pursuing a woman over her objections of course , these meanings the hitting , the fear , the implication that when ms spears says no she means yes are not so much intentional as they are evidence of careless songwriting , glitches in the pop machine on sunday ms spears , an overachiever who won star search by age 10 and became a mouseketeer two years later , performed baby \( one more time \) and sometimes along with born to make you happy all the songs were written for ms spears by male collaborators , and each one said the same thing you can leave her , break her heart and mentally \( if not physically \) abuse her , but just call out her name , as she sings , and she 'll be right back by your side loving you if only she were as faithful to her fans , who were probably hoping for the full show she has been performing on her tour \( which arrives at the hammerstein ballroom in manhattan on wednesday \) instead of this terse , wellchoreographed , faithfully recorded preview her stablemates mr fredo , c note and third storee performed similar shows , disciplined and choreographed to contend for the throne of ms spears and the backstreet boys like ms spears , not one of them said a word in praise or recognition of woodstock s legacy mr fredo , a model for and nephew of tommy hilfiger , sang upbeat love songs as dancers in hilfiger bikinis twirled around him c note s hint of newness was that it put a latin spin on manufactured boy pop , tossing in the occasional spanish lyric , vague suggestions of latin rhythms and sexual innuendoes intended for a slightly more adult crowd third storee , the best of the three , was a newer edition of new edition , with girlteasing , fleshbaring dance moves performed with spry enthusiasm and songs that mixed singing , rapping and calls for girls to scream the sugar hill gang proved that a band did n't have to be under 20 with choreographed routines to incite highpitched screams as the group turned oldschool rap hits made famous by its contemporaries the message , white lines and excerpts from newer hits by eminem and puff daddy into family singalongs with naughty words omitted , it provided further evidence that time neutralizes all rebellions , be they woodstock or rap music photo britney spears was the headliner for the initial concert of a series at the original woodstock site \( alan e solomon for the new york times \) \( pg e4 \)

there is a man who works for the city housing authority named steven cymbrowitz for years he toiled in relative anonymity people in power rarely had cause to utter the name cymbrowitz then his wife was elected last fall to the state assembly the ascension of lena cymbrowitz granted minor distinction to mr cymbrowitz , now the spouse of an elected democrat from brooklyn even so , his name did not turn heads in government that changed last week , when assemblywoman cymbrowitz followed assembly leaders and voted to repeal new york city s commuter tax in defiance of the giuliani administration suddenly the cymbrowitz name was being dropped in city hall , but with a thud now steven cymbrowitz cannot be found governmentally speaking , he has been disappeared and those who are paid by the public to answer its questions about government suddenly view the telephone as a conduit for electric shocks from city hall one government aide returned a call only to say this is a courtesy call to say that i'm not calling you back here are the alltoosketchy details of l'affaire cymbrowitz early last week , the state legislature voted to repeal the commuter tax , punching a hole in the city s budget plans while committing to memory the names of legislators from the city who had voted against the city s interests , mayoral aides found this cymbrowitz , lena the very next day , a city official said , steven cymbrowitz was handed a letter postmarked city hall it informed mr cymbrowitz , the director for intergovernmental relations , that he was being demoted , and would soon be receiving lighter paychecks mayoral aides said that mr cymbrowitz had been , shall we say , reassigned but this particular employee , of the more than 250 , 000 who work directly or indirectly for the city , had long been in their sights because his job performance was , they said , unsatisfactory that he was demoted the day after his wife s vote , they said , was merely unfortunate timing coincidence \? and the giuliani administration \? assemblywoman cymbrowitz did not think so phone calls were made , accusations were traded , and rumors flew the new york post reported that mr cymbrowitz had indeed been banished , but assemblyman vito j lopez , among others , said he was n't so sure through other people i heard he is going to come back , and the next thing is he s not coming back , mr lopez said and can i say this \? i'm not so sure he s no longer there in pursuit of the truth and of mr cymbrowitz four messages were left at the assemblywoman s office and one at home none were returned and several calls made to mr cymbrowitz s office at the housing authority prompted the same verbatim response he is not available thankfully , the housing authority has an office of public information , where several telephone messages were left over four days for the office s director , hilly gross but mr gross did not return those calls for the longest time cymbrowitz , it seems , had become the name too dangerous even to whisper to find out why , a reporter paid an unannounced visit to mr gross s office the deputy director , tim sullivan , assured him that mr gross would be along any minute , then walked away three minutes later , mr sullivan called a secretary sitting near the reporter to pass on the message that mr gross was unavailable when the reporter asked to speak to mr sullivan instead , she said that he was also suddenly unavailable the quickfooted deputy director , she said , had somehow placed the call from outside the building plaintive messages were left thursday for various housing authority officials , including john g martinez , the authority s chairman , after which mr gross finally performed the duty for which he is paid he returned a call when asked why he had been avoiding phone calls , he said cryptically , it just did n't work out and all he would say about the cymbrowitz matter was he has been reassigned , pending review of his job performance mr gross dearly wanted to hang up the telephone , but the barrage of questions prevented him was the authority acting on orders from city hall \? was it related to the commutertax vote \? does mr cymbrowitz now work god forbid in the bronx \? he said he would call back , but he did not perhaps he cannot bring himself to utter the name cymbrowitz

as far as he is concerned , his way of going about things has not changed at all since his chartdominating days of the mid80 s 'we want you to do this we want you to do that' i 've had people talk to me like that and loud , he said 'everybody has to answer to someone , ' they 'd tell me his sense of insult and , again , his voice rose i 'd say , 'i answer to god , fool' clive davis , the renowned founder and chief executive of arista and a nononsense industry veteran , is betting that rave will please mammon as well as god while he has supported outsiders like the grateful dead and patti smith , mr davis is best known as a hit maker , a man with sharp commercial instincts and ambitions most recently , he signed the guitarist carlos santana one of the artist s idols to arista , helped produce his new album , supernatural , and guided him to the top 10 for the first time in decades typically , the artist professes no awareness of mr davis s relationship with mr santana or anything else about mr davis s career i knew nothing about him , he said simply , explaining that their meeting came about at the suggestion of l londell mcmillan , the artist s business partner but he knows me we agreed that the album is full of hits it was just a question of whether or not we would agree on how it should be put out and , the artist added , mr davis agreed that i own the master tapes a crucial issue in the artist s war with warner brothers for his part , mr davis has long wanted to work with the artist , and he is determined to make rave a success indeed , when mr davis speaks about the artist , rave is the operative word this is a poet , a renaissance man , an iconoclast , mr davis said this is someone who is bringing the state of music further and further along i do n't want to get involved in whether this is hype or not the man is at the top of his form he s coming back peak i do n't think it s an accident that the album is produced by prince that says it right there but that says what , exactly \?

san bernardino , calif , sept 13 for more than a decade , representative george e brown jr , an oldline liberal democrat first elected to congress in 1962 , was a top target for republicans eager to win a seat in california s sprawling inland empire of semidesert suburbs and commuter communities and more than once , mr brown came close to losing , so when the congressman died in july at 79 after complications from heart surgery , a close race to succeed him seemed all but inevitable but for the moment , that close race is between two democrats vying for their party s nomination in a special election on sept 21 and the contest , the first congressional election of the 2000 cycle , says much about the changing demographics of a district where the first mcdonald s drivein opened in the years after world war ii once a solid bluecollar steelmaking center on the path of route 66 , the area became a beachhead of reagan republicanism , and in recent years there has been a steady rise in the influence of hispanic voters , who are expected to exert growing power in california s politics in the coming years both leading democratic contenders are hispanic mr brown s widow , marta macias brown , who was also his chief adviser and press secretary , is hoping to hold on to the family seat but is facing a stiff challenge from state senator joe baca , an aggressive local politician who in recent years had been nonetoosubtly hinting that it was time for mr brown to step aside the republican party s first choice for the seat , state senator jim brulte of rancho cucamonga , decided not to run the leadership s current choice is elia pirozzi , a businessman who lost to mr brown by 15 percentage points last year since the beginning of the 1990 s , republican registration has dropped from about 39 percent of the voters in the district to about 33 percent now , with the democrats , fueled by newly registered hispanic voters , picking up the difference it s very much what s happening in california , said richard ross , a veteran sacramento political consultant who is advising mr baca it s probably a little ahead of a lot of the rest of the older suburbs ten candidates will appear together on the open primary ballot on sept 21 , and if no one gets a majority , the top finisher from each party will advance to a general election on nov 16 to fill mr brown s unexpired term until the regular election in november 2000 mr baca began the race as the perceived frontrunner , and is still said to lead in private polls of likely voters he and mrs brown have similar stands on most issues , including support for a patients' bill of rights and broader access to health insurance or , as mr baca put it in a debate here tonight , no person should go without fear of knowing that there is no insurance but in this year of highly publicized gun violence , mr baca has been criticized for his longtime resistance to gun controls say it ai n't so , joe , another democratic contender , mayor david eshleman of fontana , said in the candidates' forum , denouncing mr baca s acceptance of contributions from the national rifle association and his status as the gun lobby s favorite democrat in sacramento in june , mr baca was the only democrat to vote against a bill later signed by gov gray davis banning assault weapons , and in early july he was the only democrat to vote against barring californians from buying more than one handgun a month but after declaring his congressional candidacy , mr baca abstained from voting on a bill to ban cheap handguns that he had opposed , and supported a measure to require trigger locks on handguns and another regulating gun shows he said in the debate tonight that he favored good laws and good policies with respect to gun owners , and emphasized his support for the death penalty and other anticrime credentials mrs brown accused mr baca of flipflopping , and said afterward that mr baca s longstanding opposition to most gun controls was one of the defining issues of the race mrs brown has won the support of groups like emily s list , which raises money for democratic women who support abortion rights , helping her raise more than 244 , 000 through sept 8 , most of it from individuals mr baca raised nearly 120 , 000 in the same period , most of it from union political action committees none of the candidates have been able to afford television advertising this is the hardest place on earth to communicate , because of the cost of tv , said bill carrick , a democratic consultant in los angeles not involved in this race this one is being fought out in the mailboxes photo david eshleman speaks at a recent candidates' forum also seeking the democratic nomination to congress are from left , marta macias brown , bernard mcclay , joe baca , hal styles , rick simon and john ballard \( monica almeida the new york times \)
as coach john muckler had demanded of them , the rangers came out with more emotion last night for muckler s sake , they started out by trying to play a simpler game but what the rangers' fans , players , team president and coach wanted most a goal , a victory the rangers were not able to deliver for the second time in three nights , john vanbiesbrouck , a former rangers goalie , slammed the door shut on new york , leading the philadelphia flyers to a 20 victory at madison square garden it was his second straight shutout against his former team the 461 rangers have little to show for their national hockey leaguerecord 588 million payroll and had their fans not become tired of jeering , the rangers would have been booed out of their own building last night after their third straight loss instead , what remained of the rangers' faithful had to be content with the fights in the stands involving flyers fans we 're not getting any offense off the rush , muckler said the rangers have not scored in 174 minutes 31 seconds , dating from early in the first period of tuesday night s 21 loss to san jose that goal was a rarity a powerplay goal , the only one the rangers have scored in their last 23 opportunities they were scoreless in three power plays last night the rangers who have scored just 21 goals in their first 11 games are now 4 for 51 on the power play this season they have scored one goal or none six times vanbiesbrouck had to stop 34 shots in a 50 victory in philadelphia on wednesday night last night the goalie had a much easier time as the rangers were able to muster only 20 shots against him muckler now must find some way to pick up the pieces of what has increasingly become a crumbling team in time for tomorrow night s game against mark messier and the vancouver canucks and there are some interesting questions muckler will face is petr nedved capable of being a firstline center \? will brian leetch regain confidence in his shot \? and what is wrong with theo fleury s game \? petr , theo and myself , we 've got to be on the scoresheet , leetch said it s my job , it s petr s job and it s theo s job to get out there and somehow create a goal and we have n't done that fleury s best chance last night came 8 37 into the second period , when vanbiesbrouck robbed him with a pad save at the right post on what looked like a sure goal the flyers responded by taking the final 10 shots of the period and left the ice with a 20 lead the rangers went the final 11 23 of the period after fleury s chance without a shot and left the ice to the sound of boos philadelphia took a 10 lead on daymond langkow s first goal of the season at 8 11 of the second period it came just as a roughing penalty to stephane quintal had ended quintal drew the penalty at 6 07 , when he hammered marc bureau seconds after valery zelepukin hipchecked valery kamensky in the open ice the rangers , who were able to kill the penalty to quintal , allowed dan mcgillis to wheel from the right point and send the puck on net langkow , who was alone in the bottom of the right circle , roofed the rebound to give the flyers the lead a mistake by nedved led to philadelphia s second goal with eight and a half minutes left in the period , nedved coughed up the puck to mark recchi in the rangers' zone as if the turnover was not costly enough , nedved immediately drew a penalty by hooking recchi out of frustration with time running out in the philadelphia power play , mcgillis shot the puck on net from the right point as sylvain lefebrve was upending sandy mccarthy at the goal s left post whether mike richter was distracted by the wrestling , or simply fooled by mcgillis s onetimer , the puck dipped between richter s pads , and the flyers were up by two goals at 13 21 of the second period richter called both goals flukes but the rangers would no doubt take a goal of any kind slap shots center tim taylor was scratched from the lineup as he recuperated from surgery on his left palm taylor had had a splinter from his stick embedded in his hand and it had to be surgically removed in philadelphia early friday morning p j stock was recalled from hartford to take taylor s place stock played opposite eric lindros s line and did well he and his linemates , kevin stevens and todd harvey , kept the lindros line scoreless the coach kept calling my name and i kept looking back , said stock , as if to say , you 're sure \? lindros called out other things all night but i just heard the echo , said the 5foot10inch stock , who conceded at least six inches to lindros i did n't really catch the whole conversation photos flyers defenseman luke richardson \( 22 \) clearing the rangers' valery kamensky from the goal crease \( bernie nunez for the new york times \)
washington , aug 8 making her way last week through a new exhibit of photographs commemorating richard m nixon s fall from power 25 years ago , an elementary school principal who was just 5 years old when he resigned wondered aloud just why the disgraced president had to go when she heard how the president had ordered hush money paid to the watergate burglars , she gasped told about his use of the internal revenue service against political enemies and how his plumbers broke into daniel ellsberg s psychiatrist s office , she recoiled then she retraced her steps through the smithsonian institution s national museum of american history and looked at some more of fred j maroon s striking photographs of the basement door that burglars taped open to get access to the watergate , of nixon aides who were implicated in the coverup , of their appearances before the senate watergate committee , of the house judiciary committee s voting for impeachment , of the president saying farewell the oregon educator said the exhibit fills in some of the gaps in my history those gaps are hardly uncommon in a country where news organizations have treated so many scandals that followed watergate as if they , too , were constitutional crises and where three americans in four say nixon s offenses were no worse than the others treating them all with the same level of breathlessness that watergate deserved has done nothing but reduce the amount of oxygen to our brains , said james m naughton , director of the poynter institute for journalism in st petersburg , fla he said that if the public could not tell the difference , there is a measure of responsibility of the media , particularly journalists in washington , for having cried 'wolf' it was 25 years ago this monday when the 37th president told his staff never be petty , always remember , others may hate you , but those who hate you do n't win unless you hate them and then you destroy yourself he climbed into a helicopter and had alexander m haig jr , who was running the white house , deliver his resignation to secretary of state henry a kissinger at 11 35 am , while nixon was airborne like the principal from oregon , half of americans who are alive today had not yet turned 10 , if indeed they had already been born , when nixon stepped down and with the events of watergate often given short shrift in the last few weeks of a high school survey of american history , the principal s ignorance was not unusual but almost everyone still has an opinion about the most controversial president of the 20th century a man generations grew up admiring for his anticommunism , his doggedness and his humble , nonestablishment background , or opposing for his rough campaign style , his falsehoods and the four years he took to end the vietnam war a gallup poll in february showed that 34 percent of the public approved of how he handled his job as president , up 10 points from the week he resigned three percent said he was the best president since world war ii , and 28 percent said he was the worst an nbc news wall street journal poll last month was slightly more positive it asked when you think back to the high and low points of his term in office , do you think , on the whole , that it was good for america or bad for america that richard nixon served as president \? fiftytwo percent said it was good that number had dropped sharply from the time of his death in 1994 , when eulogies that dealt only with the high points had produced 73 percent saying his presidency was good for the country but perhaps the most telling finding in the poll last month was that while 18 percent of the public said watergate was worse than other political scandals in the past 25 years , 76 percent said there have been other political scandals that were just as bad peter hart , who conducted the poll with robert teeter , said there was little variation by age in the results twentythree percent of those 65 and older said watergate was worse only 14 percent of those 35 to 49 thought so agreeing with mr naughton , mr hart said the media had dulled watergate s prominence by attaching the word 'gate' to each and every scandal , making them equivalent to watergate richard norton smith , a presidential scholar and the director of the gerald r ford library and museum , said he thought the decline of watergate was at least as much a matter of forgetfulness as anything else he said nixon s unpopularity was a result of his status as a political orphan , disowned by the right because it has discovered he did not want to abolish government but make it work , while still disdained by the left americans are now most likely to learn about watergate in high school , where it is often an object lesson on the separation of powers among the legislative , executive and judicial branches of government the amount of detail varies greatly from one textbook to another tedd levy , a middle school teacher in norwalk , conn , and the immediate past president of the national council for the social studies , said most textbook presentations were drained of the emotion of that time , and generally end with an upbeat lesson the constitution worked he said an alert student with a decent teacher will have at least a cursory understanding of what happened and why nixon resigned
after sitting in pieces in jars for more than 40 years , albert einstein s brain is poised to make yet another contribution to science scientists in canada who have studied it now say they have identified something that might explain the great theorist s brilliance and might eventually offer clues to the general workings of the brain they say a crucial region in einstein s brain a region that processes mathematical thought , threedimensional visualization , spatial relationships and other mental processes was significantly larger than the same area among people with normal intelligence the region , the inferior parietal lobe , is situated about the level of the ear , starting in the front of the brain and extending twothirds of the way back in his life , einstein had submitted to brain studies , and at least one biography says he hoped his brain would be studied after his death but he surely did not imagine what would actually happen to it when einstein died in 1955 , in princeton , nj , the pathologist who performed the autopsy removed the brain and kept it when he left princeton according to several accounts , the pathologist , dr thomas harvey , kept the brain in a jar and at one time it sat in a cardboard box that once held apple cider behind a beer cooler in his office in lawrence , kan dr harvey had permission from einstein s estate and his son , hans albert einstein , to perform scientific studies of the brain toward that end , he took careful photographs and measurements of the brain and then cut it into 240 pieces of varying size for further study , but he published none of his findings he did give a few sections of the brain to a few researchers , two of whom reported that einstein had an unusual preponderance of certain cells , oligodendroglia , that support the brain s networks of neurons dr harvey could not be reached for comment yesterday in 1996 , a onesentence fax from dr harvey arrived at mcmaster university in hamilton , ontario did researchers want to study einstein s brain \? dr sandra f witelson , the leader of a team of neuroscientists there , did not even know who dr harvey was when she learned of his role , she gladly cooperated the result was a research project combining a method similar to phrenology with the newer techniques of neuroscience dr witelson s team was aided in its work by its access to mcmaster s large collection of normal brain samples these samples enabled the team to determine which features of einstein s brain were ordinary , and which were unusual their report appears tomorrow in the medical journal the lancet it remains to be seen whether the unusual physical features of einstein s brain can explain his phenomenal success as a theorist of physics over the years , scientists have often advanced theories that one aspect or another of the brain s shape related to mental functioning , only to have the theories fail still , the researchers in canada feel they have strong scientific backing for their theories einstein s inferior parietal lobe was 15 percent wider than normal because a groove that typically runs through the parietal area of the brain took an unusual course this finding is unique among the brains the team studied , dr witelson said , and it may have allowed more brain cells , or neurons , to establish connections between each other and work together more easily dr harvey apparently chose the mcmaster researchers after reading dr witelson s reports of research conducted at a brain bank that she started in 1982 , largely through funding from the united states national institutes of health the bank contains brains willed for research by more than 100 people who also underwent tests of verbal , mathematical , iq and other functions the aim was to relate structure and function in the normal brain , said dr witelson , who veered into neuroanatomy after earning her phd degree in psychology at least 35 brain banks exist in north america and europe most collect brains of people with neurological and psychological disorders the mcmaster university bank has what is believed to be the largest collection of brains from people documented to be cognitively normal so dr harvey s invitation offered an extraordinary chance to study an extraordinary mind in an interview yesterday , dr witelson said she realized at the outset that the work might conclude in a dead end but she said , if there is going to be any relationship between structure and function , you might see it more clearly in an extraordinary case researchers have long studied the brains of brilliant people after their death , but this work has been hampered by several factors such studies were confined to the brain of a single person , and brains from other people with different levels of intelligence were not available for comparison and scientists lacked theories about the relation between brain structure and psychological function to test in such studies in examining einstein s brain , dr witelson relied on findings from other scientists that relate the size of a brain region to the level of certain cognitive abilities such findings suggest that differences in people s ability to perform certain cognitive functions may be due in part to physical differences in the regions of their brains that control the functions dr witelson theorized that if any difference were found it would most likely to be in the parietal lobes but she said she did not confine her studies to that region
obilic , kosovo , june 22 frightened by albanians streaming back into this central kosovo town , snezana ivanovic and sabrija popic sought out a newly arrived british soldier on saturday and asked for guarantees of protection the two women , one serbian and one gypsy , feared retaliation as albanians returned here to find their dwellings and shops looted or burned ms popic told the soldier that masked paramilitaries were responsible for the damage , not her there are people who were robbing and beating people who have escaped from the town , she said and now the innocent people will pay for it abdullah restelica , a 49yearold albanian passing by , started to protest i came today from macedonia , he said angrily my family was beaten here before my own eyes ! my house was robbed ms ivanovic , the serbian woman , shot back who robbed your house \? i did n't innocent people did n't do anything we should n't have to leave the british soldier answered , we are trying to provide a safe environment for every community but his words did little to calm the tension in virtually every corner of this haunted province , exchanges like that illustrate one of the most difficult issues in this bitter atmosphere who is guilty or innocent of the killings , beatings and burnings in kosovo and how will the guilty ever be brought to justice \? long after the peace accords were approved in belgrade , those questions are likely to remain unresolved for months , even years , here repeated clashes are almost certain as returning albanians and serbs attempt to resume living together today in slovinje , another small village about 20 miles from obilic in the middle of the province , jasmina stanisic ran into the center of the road and blocked this reporter s car pounding her fists on the hood , ms stanisic , a serb , demanded that british nato soldiers immediately search its trunk her brother , she shrieked , had been kidnapped by albanians 15 minutes ago they took him ! she thundered nothing was found in the car and for the next chaotic hour , lieut graham shannon and 30 other british soldiers struggled to keep this ethnically mixed village from exploding during the last two nights , albanian refugees and kosovo liberation army soldiers have been returning home here to find houses looted and burned in retaliation , some have pillaged the homes of departing serbs today s kidnapping , the first of its kind in the area , threatened to start a new , more deadly cycle of retribution by early evening , ms stanisic s brother had not been found while sorting out responsibility for any of the atrocities is difficult , the task is especially daunting in kosovo because reports show that the violence was carried out by a combination of yugoslav army soldiers , paramilitary units and internal security forces some serbian paramilitaries wore masks while they committed many crimes some had local guides point them to the homes of wealthy albanians many followed orders from a central command led by a top military aide to the yugoslav president , slobodan milosevic some albanians are convinced that they recognized the voice of a paramilitary who abused them as that of a local serb or gypsy others insist that a local serb must have guided the paramilitaries , asking how else would they have singled out houses that belonged to prosperous local albanian businessmen the international war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia and whatever local justice system is eventually established here faces a daunting task in sorting through tens of thousands of crimes committed a tribunal official who spoke on condition of anonymity said investigators are initially concentrating on who had command responsibility for the most serious crimes in some cases , masks may prevent tribunal officials from identifying specific perpetrators unless a fellow paramilitary , soldier or policeman becomes a cooperating witness , they said kosovo liberation army officials , for their part , said they are discouraging revenge attacks hydajet hyseni , the acting justice minister of the selfappointed kla provincial government , said his group would fully cooperate with the tribunal the consequences will be very grave if we find anyone carrying out reprisals , he said but fear and rumors are rampant in the few communities where serbs remain nato officials said they do not have a complete tally of the serbian civilians killed since they arrived last saturday there have been dozens of snipings and at least four serbian civilians have been shot dead revenge attacks are already occurring here in obilic a gypsy s home here burned on monday night set afire by angry albanians , according to a local albanian farmer the bodies of five men , two teenagers and three middleaged , were found shot dead in a field outside of town on saturday morning british soldiers investigating the shooting said the men appeared to have been killed recently but they did not yet know their identities local serbs said they believed that the victims were serbs albanians said they believed that the victims were albanians problems in obilic are not surprising zeljko raznatovic , the belgradebased serbian paramilitary leader known as arkan who has been indicted by the war crimes tribunal , made this his base in kosovo he owned a soccer club here and the town was a major center of paramilitary activity albanians emerging from hiding or returning home from macedonia or albania were divided over the issue of guilt most interviewed in obilic and slovinje said they believed that some local serbs and gypsies took part in killing and pillaging here but none could identify a local serb who was involved they disagreed about whether serbs and gypsies should be allowed to stay here they should go , said ingi nasuri , 17 , who spent the last three months in hiding they do n't belong here they do n't have any place here barije kostanica , 34 , who also hid , said serbs and gypsies with clean hands should be allowed to stay when asked the question at the heart of the problem who should determine guilt or innocence ms kostanica gave a simple answer i do n't know , she said
washington , march 15 flush with optimism about the way their case is progressing , the 19 state attorneys general who joined the federal government in the landmark antitrust suit against the microsoft corporation say they will not be satisfied , should they win the case , with any remedy that does not revamp the company no specifics have been decided about how that should be done and probably none will be until the judge issues his ruling this summer but as equal partners in the lawsuit , the states hold something of a veto power over the kinds of remedies the federal government can recommend , and the offices of the attorneys general are alive with discussion of the various options the one receiving the most favor right now would force microsoft to license the source code for the windows operating system to several other companies instantly creating competition in the operating system business in addition , many of the states including new york , ohio , minnesota and utah are eager to use provisions in their own laws that would allow them to fine microsoft for every antitrust violation incident the amount for each incident varies , from 2 , 000 in kentucky to 100 , 000 in new york , but there is little if any case law to suggest how an incident is defined in this context officials in several states said they were hoping to establish that every purchase of a copy of windows constituted a violation with per violation or per occurrence , that would be millions and millions of dollars , said doug davis , an assistant attorney general in west virginia but state officials acknowledged that it was far from certain that the courts would uphold that interpretation so far , the states have stayed out of the spotlight , relying primarily on the justice department s lawyers , most notably its lead trial lawyer and hired gun , david boies , to argue the case in court yet the states are key players thirteen states researched the case cooperatively with the justice department when it came time to file the suit last spring , one of those states , texas , decided to drop out of the effort , while a handful of additional states , including west virginia and maryland , decided to join that brought the total to 20 in december , south carolina s attorney general announced that he was leaving the group , asserting that competition in the software industry remained strong , making the suit unnecessary the 19 remaining attorneys general say they remain strongly committed to the case after the justice department and the states filed similar but separate antitrust suits against microsoft last may , the cases were merged and are being tried together so , although justice officials say they have not yet decided on what remedies to propose should they win , whatever they recommend to judge thomas penfield jackson must have the approval of the states as colitigants in the end , the remedy judge jackson imposes might or might not be based on the recommendations of the plaintiffs because state attorneys general are elected officials , their motives are not always the same as those of the justice department they must be more responsive to their constituents or , viewed more cynically , play to the voters when the suits were filed last may , we got some constituent mail asking why we were harassing microsoft , said mark r weaver , ohio s deputy attorney general but now , said richard blumenthal , attorney general of connecticut , we feel vindicated the public , he added , has a much better understanding of microsoft s abuses and violations of law while microsoft insists that it will win the case , the hardened position on remedies is fueled by a growing perception among the attorneys general that their side has gained the upper hand in court in interviews last week , attorneys general or their assistants in more than a dozen states said they had been pleasantly surprised , even thrilled , with their accomplishments in court though all acknowledge that the judge could ultimately rule in microsoft s favor the government and microsoft have both completed presentation of their cases , and the trial is now in recess until midapril , when each side will present rebuttal witnesses so far , mr blumenthal said , our case has been more powerful and vivid than we ever anticipated jennifer granholm , michigan s attorney general , said we feel very good it s safe to say our confidence has improved the credibility of the microsoft defense seems to have been seriously damaged that perception has emboldened the states to consider asking for stronger remedies than they might have originally contemplated in a broad sense , antitrust remedies fall into two classes conduct relief and structural relief if the court imposed conduct relief , microsoft would remain intact , and its business incentives would not be changed instead , the company s ability to engage in illegal conduct would be limited one example might be to regulate the sorts of contracts the company could write
boston , june 26 draft day was supposed to belong to the islanders , who had three of the first 10 picks in today s national hockey league entry draft but much of the islanders' thunder was stolen by the rangers , who made two major trades to move up in the first round and take two players that the islanders coveted the islanders still drafted four highquality players in the first round with the fifth pick over all , they took tim connolly , a center and the toprated american player in the draft , and they followed with taylor pyatt , a left wing , at no 8 and two big defensemen , branislav mezei at no 10 and kristian kudroc at no 28 but the islanders were upstaged by the rangers , who traded goalie dan cloutier , wing niklas sundstrom and their first and thirdround picks in next year s draft to tampa bay for the fourth pick over all the rangers selected pavel brendl , a player the islanders had hoped to take with the fifth pick moments later the rangers traded up again , moving from 11th over all to ninth once again , one spot ahead of the islanders this time the rangers took jamie lundmark , another player the islanders had coveted i'm satisfied , said gordie clark , the islanders' director of player personnel referring to the draft s first four picks , he added , it pretty well went the way we had it mapped out none of the team s firstround choices is considered ready to play in the nhl all four will probably spend at least another season in juniors and possibly one season in the minors before joining the islanders the rangers' brendl , however , could make his nhl debut next season while the islanders' firstrounders are not likely to join the team s barebones roster next season , the fact that they are a few years away means the cashstrapped team has that much more time to come up with the money to sign them of the four , the 19yearold connolly has the best chance of becoming a star in the nhl connolly , at 6 feet and 186 pounds , has good speed , and scouts raved about his stickhandling and oneonone abilities however , connolly missed most of last season with erie of the ontario hockey league because of a broken right leg , which required surgery and from which he is still recovering in 46 games with erie he had 34 goals and 68 points it feels great , said connolly , who grew up in baldwinsville , ny i broke it on feb 18 and doctors said that it would n't be ready until august but i 've been skating for two weeks so i'm two months ahead of schedule clark said i think tim s the most skilled player in the draft he can skate , he can beat you oneonone and he can beat you with his shot i love him pyatt , a 64 , 220pound left wing from thunder bay , ontario , is considered a power forward whose main strength is crashing the net and causing havoc in front of the opposing crease scouting reports call him a good skater who is hard to knock down and has a very good shot in 68 games with sudbury of the ontario hockey league last season , the 17yearold pyatt scored 37 goals and had 38 assists when pyatt was introduced to the fleet center crowd , earl ingarfield , an islanders scout , referred to him as nelson pyatt , drawing some laughs nelson pyatt , taylor s father , played for the detroit red wings , washington capitals and colorado rockies in the 1970 s mezei , a 65 , 221pound defenseman who is 18 years old , was one of the more obscure names in the top 10 , but the islanders feel his size could make him a force in the nhl he has been compared to the islanders' other giant defenseman , the 69 , 245pound zdeno chara , who is also from slovakia in slovakia , you are either very big or very small , mezei joked , referring to the towering chara and the diminutive zigmund palffy , the former islander i'm very happy because i did n't think that i would be drafted in the first round photo isles general manager mike milbury with the draftees branislav mezei , left , taylor pyatt and tim connolly \( reuters \)
hong kong there is no shortage of explanations for why asia s stock markets have popped up and down like targets in a carnival shooting gallery over the last week taiwan and china are turning up the volume in their heated war of words north korea is developing missiles that could threaten japan or south korea ethnic strife is on the rise in politically tense indonesia as it happens , though , none of these flashpoints caused the bumpy ride in asia s markets instead , shareholders from seoul to singapore were thrown into a tizzy by a team of anonymous numbercrunchers in geneva , who made changes in a closely watched asian stock index that a stock index could exert so much influence across so many markets says a lot about the changing nature of investing and the herd mentality of investors as they venture back into recessionravaged asia it s very hard to find people who think independently about how to invest in asia , said mac overton , a former fund manager in hong kong they are terrified about underperforming the benchmark the benchmark of choice here is the msci , which stands for morgan stanley capital international from its offices in geneva , this subsidiary of morgan stanley dean witter calculates 3 , 000 stock indexes a day , covering 24 , 000 stocks in 51 countries it bundles these country indexes into regional indexes analysts say morgan stanley s asian indexes are by far its most influential on aug 12 , morgan stanley announced it would reinstate malaysia in two of those indexes , the allcountry far east free and emerging markets free indexes , as of next february it had dropped malaysia last september when prime minister mahathir mohamad imposed controls on malaysia s currency market morgan stanley also said it would adjust its portfolios to double the weighting of taiwan a nod to the greater openness of taiwan s markets to restore malaysia and bolster taiwan , morgan stanley will reduce the relative weighting of other asian countries in the indexes that could be crucial to how much foreign investment flows to these countries a growing number of overseas funds use these indexes to judge their own performances when morgan stanley changes the weighting of various countries , fund managers rush to align their own portfolios not surprisingly , the news had a drastic effect on the markets stock exchanges in malaysia and taiwan soared , while other markets , like hong kong and singapore , swooned when morgan stanley announced a later adjustment that could lift singapore s weighting , singapore bounced back the changes are likely to have the most lasting impact on malaysia , which has been spurned by foreign investors since dr mahathir effectively dug a moat around the country s capital and currency markets it s a very symbolic step for us , said razak baginda , the executive director of the malaysian strategic research center , a research firm in kuala lumpur having been seen as a pariah state , the morgan stanley listing signifies that we are once again a legitimate place to invest executives at morgan stanley capital international said they were well aware of the influence they wield they seemed the slightest bit sheepish about the market tumult they set off over the last week it s not our business , strangely enough , to move markets , said john fildes , the executive director of morgan stanley capital international in hong kong we aim to be a lagging indicator , not a leading indicator stock indexes are popular in asia for the same reason they became popular in the united states and europe funds that manage billions of dollars for endowments and pension funds want benchmarks against which to measure their performance some funds are bound by their charters not to invest in stocks or countries that are excluded from these indexes but mr fildes said stock indexes have become even more influential here in the aftermath of the regional economic crisis burned by the spectacular market meltdowns in south korea , thailand and indonesia , fund managers are counting on indexes as a way to hedge their bets when the asian tigers were generating high returns , people were not so reliant on the benchmark , mr fildes said but the volatility of the last two years has made people much more careful in effect , fund managers are substituting the research and analysis of morgan stanley for their own judgment given morgan stanley s vast influence , it is no surprise that its changes have drawn criticism several experts said it was premature to restore malaysia to the index , since it was not clear whether the government would fully eliminate capital controls after they expire on sept 1 officials in malaysia have said they are unlikely to allow its currency , the ringgit , to trade freely in taiwan s case , some fund managers said morgan stanley should have treated the escalating tensions with china as a disincentive others noted that while taiwan s government has loosened some restrictions , like foreign ownership of local companies , it still routinely restricts capital flows the changes in the morgan stanley index have led to some dubious investment decisions , according to bill kaye , the senior managing director of the pacific group , a hedge fund in hong kong he noted that the taiwan market had risen by more than 8 percent since last week despite the fact that taiwan and china may be edging close to an armed conflict there is no intelligent basis for that kind of investment whatsoever , mr kaye said it s absolutely byzantine mr fildes has spent the last week responding to these criticisms he noted that morgan stanley left open the possibility that it would not reinstate malaysia if the government did not phase out capital controls as for taiwan , political risk is something for a fund manager to decide about , he said still , as mr fildes acknowledged somewhat wearily , any changes in the indexes can be emotive
shepard sobel has some truly radical notions about the theater , and if they start getting around , there s going to be trouble i think the most interesting take on chekhov is chekhov s take , he says i'm not going to improve on that my basic thing is , trust the playwright and the text hold on there who does this guy think he is \? mr sobel not only preaches this wild heresy , he also practices it in his own little hotbed of classicism , the pearl theater company and in what unlikely outpost does this audacious experiment occur but the heart of the east village , spiritual home of the avantgarde the pearl , with its faithful mountings of ibsen , marivaux , sophocles and shakespeare , is as expected a resident of st mark s place as a spinoff of le cirque would be on coney island other neighborhood establishments sell nipple rings and tshirts bedecked in expletives the pearl at theater 80 \( for 80 st mark s place \) hangs out a shingle for moliere s miser a few blocks away , a major new york company might be staging a streetcar named desire with stanley and stella naked in the bathtub , or a king lear set in bosnia ellen stewart s legendary la mama is a fiveminute walk five minutes farther on is richard foreman s ontologicalhysteric theater these bastions of bohemianism might as well be on pluto for all they have in common with the pearl in mr sobel s shop , they stick to the period period there is no space in the pearl s dressing rooms for a shylock in a nehru jacket or a hedda gabler in designer jeans and a serape i'm an explorer , not an inventor , mr sobel insists , sitting in the bar of his theater with the blackandwhite photos of pearl productions of shaw and strindberg on the walls for 15 years , mr sobel , as the pearl s artistic director , has been exploring the universes conjured by the world s great dramatists in an innocent way , he s a rebel in the new york theater world , struggling against a prevailing tide that says it is the director who gets the last word with a classic , that the mandate that comes with an old play is to gutrenovate it , equip it with shiny appliances and sell it as something new some playgoers might see mr sobel s approach as outmoded or even reactionary indeed , some of the pearl s prodigious output five major classics per season can seem a bit on the dry side , as was the case with a twee version of carlo goldoni s 18thcentury comedy mistress of the inn , retitled mirandolina , that ended last month yet there is nothing stuffy or superfluous about the niche the pearl fills as an intimate outlet for the presentation of important works , both famous and obscure , in conditions that allow the playwright s words to speak louder than the director s conceits a few other off broadway companies ring in the old the jean cocteau repertory theater , a few streets away on the bowery , stages modern classics by the likes of genet and pirandello , and the classic stage company , on east 13th street , aspires to more stylish adaptations and revivals , with betterknown actors and directors \( the roundabout has a similar mission , on broadway \) but none poke quite so deeply into the nooks and crannies of the canon as the pearl where else but the pearl can a theaterphile regularly sit down to plays by congreve and farquhar , goldsmith and scribe \?

the pearl is about the long haul , the development of an ear for the language of the theater and the astonishing breadth of the writers it has produced you go to the pearl for an education in how it all began in its modest way , the pearl has become , like katz s delicatessen , the strand bookstore or the chelsea hotel , another certifiably quirky new york institution , sticking stubbornly to its guns , paying little heed to what the rest of the world deems fashionable mr sobel , in a sense , sets his own fashions , sometimes to the detriment of his own coffers dana keefer , president of the pearl s board of trustees , says that lively discussions erupt at meetings with mr sobel over whether to make a more commercial choice in a play over a less commercial choice one guess as to who is the advocate for the less

even hardened veterans of the manhattan singles scene were depressed by michael russo s performance in unmade beds , the quasidocumentary film by nicholas barker that came out last year mr russo was one of the four people who played themselves in reenacting the worst moments of their dating careers in new york mr russo , who was 53 years old , was using personal ads and dating services to search for a very specific partner a woman between 25 and 45 who looked like cindy crawford , linda evans or veronica webb i only go out with beautiful women , he said into the camera as he sat alone in his small apartment in greenwich village for quality control , he carried a beeper on blind dates so that he could activate it to make a quick escape they say they are all beautiful women , and when they show up , they 're mutts , he said disgustedly i 've never gone out with a mutt , and i'm not going to now why would someone who looked like cindy crawford want to go out with him \? that remained a mystery in the film mr russo freely acknowledged that he was balding and overweight and looked nothing like robert redford he said that women often disdained him for lacking money and social status and glamour he admitted that , despite trying to pass himself off as a screenwriter , he had never sold a script yet he still considered himself a catch michael is michael , he explained the woman who gets me now is going to get one hell of a deal he seemed to be suffering from a form of selfdelusion that psychologists call the lake wobegon effect , in honor of garrison keillor s fictional town in minnesota where all the children are above average people habitually overestimate their own talents , as demonstrated by studies in which huge majorities of the respondents rate themselves above average in intelligence , in work productivity , in driving skill in just about anything single new yorkers are particularly vulnerable to this delusion , judging from the many who ca n't find anyone worthy of marriage , but mr russo s case was so extreme that further research seemed in order when i tried to track him down last year , i discovered that his problems were even more complicated than i 'd imagined his sister , susan russo , told me that shortly after the movie was filmed in 1997 , he began acting strangely and lost his job as assistant director of new york university s security force then he stopped paying his bills and eventually lost his apartment he was occasionally spotted living on the streets , wandering around in ragged clothes and a long unkempt beard eventually , in october of last year , he collapsed and was taken by the police to bellevue hospital center , where doctors discovered the cause of his personality change an enormous tumor in his brain after recovering from three operations , he moved home with his mother in the village , and last week he felt strong enough to talk once again about life and love sitting with his sister in her apartment in the flatiron district , he sounded much more charming than he had in the movie his ordeal on the streets and in the hospital had made him reconsider his dating philosophy i 've been feeling lonely , he said i spent 30 years avoiding longterm commitments now i want to find someone who would like to make a commitment i'm ready to start making compromises his sister looked relieved he s just starting to learn you ca n't live your life alone none of those beautiful women he was chasing in the old days came to visit him in the hospital it was a lovely moment , but then mr russo said there was a limit to his spirit of compromise she ca n't be a mutt , he said if she s a mutt i 'll lose interest but what about his own liabilities in the marketplace \? despite his sister s efforts to get him rehired at nyu , he still had no job , and he was still trying to make the first sale of a screenplay i'm not in the best position to go after someone now , he acknowledged cheerfully i do n't have any money and i'm living with my mother but i can show someone a good time if they 're willing to give me a try i always have to set my standards high so he was still looking for cindy crawford \? well , she does n't have to be cindy crawford , he said with a grin martha stewart would be fine perhaps , by the standards of the new york singles scene , that qualifies as emotional growth photo michael russo does not want to date mutts

cambridge , mass as we try to make sense of the school massacre in littleton , colo , we suddenly find ourselves swept up in a national debate about whether the internet , with its dazzling array of interactive mayhem and violence , is partly to blame should the internet be available to anyone , of any age , with a computer and a telephone connection \? many who have long wanted to muzzle the internet are making symbols of eric harris and dylan klebold , who used the internet to play violent computer games and promote their racist views how much protection should internet speech receive under the first amendment \? and , under the fourth amendment s search and seizure provisions , may the government browse web sites without a warrant in order to nip mass murder plots in the bud \? while nearly every possible view has its champions , most of the opinions expressed reflect more confusion than clarity the point to remember is that basic constitutional principles do not arise and disappear as each new technology comes on the scene we have come to this conclusion rather slowly early in the 20th century , the supreme court expressed doubt that freespeech principles had any application at all to motion pictures , and in 1981 , justice byron white introduced his analysis of a law regulating outdoor billboard advertising by saying , we deal here with the law of billboards only in recent years has the court recognized that new technology does n't affect basic constitutional principles the court has found that technological details , however , can be relevant to certain applications of the law , especially because , in principle , speech may not be restricted any more than necessary for instance , the supreme court struck down provisions in 1997 of the communications decency act because they blocked pornographic materials from being transmitted over the internet , when technology already existed that allowed parents to selectively censor such materials even though the internet allows nearly anyone to obtain or transmit information instantaneously to and from anywhere on the planet , it does not deserve more or less freespeech protection than older media a web page simulating , or even glorifying , violence and hatred is not outside the first amendment s protection any more than are disgusting board games , magazines or political tracts the same first amendment that safeguards the right of nazis to march through skokie protects the right of an adult to put virtual machine guns aimed at lifelike human targets on his or her computer screen at the same time , internet speech does n't have more constitutional protection than speech disseminated in a more oldfashioned and limited manner in particular , direct threats or other messages that by their very utterance cause harm receive no more protection on the internet than anyplace else releasing a computer virus through email deserves no greater immunity than crying fire in a crowded theater what about someone who posts a web page with detailed , stepbystep instructions on how to assemble an explosive device from readily available materials \? such instructional materials are not quite like yelling fire in a theater they do not cause harm in a purely reflexive or automatic manner instead , they change the mix of ideas and information in the heads of the speaker s audience speech disseminating such instructions on the internet , however reprehensible , is thus entitled to a degree of first amendment protection but it is not entitled to the same level of protection to which speech advocating ideas is entitled because it is rarely part of any dialogue about what is true or what ought to be done distributing such materials does n't try to persuade anyone to take a course of action , but instead provides the means for committing a crime thus , the united states courts of appeals have held that distributing pamphlets on how to evade taxes , make illegal drugs or kill someone can amount to aiding and abetting a crime and may be punished as such , depending , of course , on the particular facts the first amendment , therefore , should shoulder none of the guilt in the littleton killings in truth , the first amendment leaves considerable room for government to exert control , and the advent of the internet neither broadens nor narrows government s options nor , for that matter , is the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures among the culprits here those who launch murderous plots by posting their deranged plans on a web site are exposing their schemes in a public space , one that government agencies may freely browse without a warrant despite the fanciful argument that all talk on the world wide web is as private as email messages might be at the same time , it would be a grave mistake to assume that either government surveillance or control can play an important role in preventing violent crimes doing more to keep lethal weapons out of youthful hands something the second amendment , under any reading , does not prevent and trying to diagnose all forms of rage before they erupt into violence , are likely to be far more effective than anything government could do either by spying on the internet s users or by suppressing their speech drawing \( david miller \)
dr heinz l fraenkelconrat , whose research in biochemistry allowed scientists to peer into the innermost workings of viruses , died on april 10 at kaiser permanente medical center in oakland , calif he was 88 and lived in berkeley dr fraenkelconrat , a professor emeritus at the university of california at berkeley , made scientific history in the mid1950 s , when he dismantled a tobacco mosaic virus and then put it back together again , still living the accomplishment garnered dr fraenkelconrat , who disdained publicity , considerable attention along the lines of life created in a test tube , recounted in the 1959 book virus hunters , by greer williams but for scientists , the value of dr fraenkelconrat s work lay in its proof that the genetic information controlling viral reproduction was contained in the rna at the core of each piece of a virus this was not an entirely happy discovery for dr fraenkelconrat , who had sided with those scientists who believed that the tobacco virus s infectivity was contained it its protein coat i'm a protein chemist , he told mr williams when he was being interviewed for the book i hoped protein was the determining factor it was against my personal inclinations to have a greater interest in nucleic acid while other scientists before dr fraenkelconrat had taken viruses apart in an effort to understand how they worked , he was the first to put one back together in effect , making the world s first synthetic virus his goal was to determine which part of the virus infected tobacco plants to do this , according to virus hunters , required some exacting work the scientist used a common household detergent to strip away the hides of one set of viruses , and a different solution to remove the cores of another set then he took the virus parts up to the greenhouse on the top of his laboratory and , keeping them separate , rubbed them on the leaves of tobacco plants none of the plants were infected when dr fraenkelconrat mixed the two solutions together , however , he found that the virus reformed and when he placed the newly whole virus on tobacco plants , they became infected \( later , he found that , if handled correctly , the delicate rna alone was sufficient to infect the plants \) dr fraenkelconrat worked often during this period with his wife , dr beatrice b singer , who survives him dr singer is a biochemist at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory heinz fraenkelconrat was born in breslau , germany , and received his medical degree from the university of breslau in 1933 he earned a doctorate in biochemistry at the university of edinburgh in 1936 that same year he moved to the united states he joined the berkeley faculty in 1952 , and won numerous awards , including an albert lasker award for basic research in 1958 , which he shared with dr alfred d hershey and dr gerhard schramm for their work with nucleic acid dr fraenkelconrat also received two guggenheim fellowships photo dr heinz l fraenkelconrat \( associated press , 1958 \)
washington , feb 10 shameful , despicable , untrustworthy , a disgrace to his office , said one lawmaker reprehensible , said another , and morally wrong the adjectives and phrases , employed to describe president clinton and his conduct could not have been more damning but the senators using them paul wellstone , a minnesota democrat , in the first case and james m jeffords , a vermont republican , in the second were formally announcing that they would vote to acquit mr clinton on both articles of impeachment and their comments , made public outside the chamber as examples of what the senators had said or would say inside , opened a peephole into private deliberations that featured divergent assessments of the president s fitness to inhabit the white house but widespread agreement that he was , at best , a woefully disappointing tenant an aura of sadness and sometimes , outrage permeated senators' speeches in the chamber today and hovered over the lawmakers themselves , according to interviews with senators and the statements that some of them released this impeachment process has been distressing on a personal level because i came into it with a great deal of respect for president clinton , mr jeffords said in the statement he released this afternoon whatever the final outcome , the senator said , i will leave this trial with the knowledge that the president has indeed committed shameful acts , misled the american people and brought disrepute on the office of the presidency he added , the president has lied to his family and the nation , and this he must live with that the stinging words of mr jeffords and mr wellstone accompanied decisions to acquit the president reflected many senators' belief that mr clinton s wrongdoing did not represent the kind of high crimes and misdemeanors that warrant expulsion from office the statements that several senators made public on tuesday and today marked a shell game of sorts because senate rules prohibit the lawmakers from discussing the content of closed sessions , senators were careful to portray the statements as something other than texts of the speeches they had given , or were planning to give , in the chamber but it was obvious that in most cases , the statements were condensed , expanded or slightly altered versions of those remarks during breaks in today s deliberations , senators said the tone of the sessions was collegial , candid and , at times , somber this is a solemn , grave occasion , senator max baucus , democrat of montana , said at the end of today s session referring to the senators' speeches , he added , they reached down quite deep to explain their conclusions senator charles e schumer , democrat of new york , agreed , saying people are reaching for history this would have been one of the senate s finest hours if it was public but senator bill frist , republican of tennessee , said it was in part so dignified because it was a private session people are not playing to the cameras , mr frist said they 're not delivering hollywoodstyle speeches , but are talking from the heart few if any of the senators who walked to the well took less than 10 minutes to deliver their remarks , their colleagues said , while some speakers hit the 15minute limit and were reminded of it by a crisp rap of the gavel the statements that some released suggested that the speeches in the chamber frequently homed in on the tiniest nuggets of evidence and subtlest nuances of testimony but beneath that analysis , or appended to it , were expressions of overarching disillusionment with mr clinton that undoubtedly reflected some senators' efforts to make certain , in case a push for a censure resolution fails , that they had remarks on the record condemning the president s behavior he is not trustworthy , senator richard g lugar , republican of indiana , declared in a written statement saying he would vote to convict mr clinton of both perjury and obstruction of justice simply to be near him in the white house has meant not only tragic heartache for his wife and his daughter , but enormous legal bills for staff members and friends who admired him and yearned for his success , mr lugar added although senator christopher j dodd , democrat of connecticut , announced he would vote to acquit the president on both counts , he offered a rueful commentary on the events of the past year this scandal has seriously bruised every institution that has come in contact with it , but none has been battered more than the executive branch itself , mr dodd said in a statement released several hours after he addressed his colleagues in the chamber the culpability for this damage lies first and foremost with president clinton , the senator added history will judge his actions and significant lapses of judgment harshly , as it should it seemed at times that senators from both parties wanted to make sure they had given mr clinton the most forceful oratorical spanking possible before he was set free from the political limbo of the last year while senator john h chafee , republican of rhode island , said today that he would vote to acquit , he did not stop there in a statement that revisited many aspects of the case , the senator referred to mr clinton s reckless , tawdry behavior and said it had undermined the dignity of the presidency and brought about a divisive and unpleasant chapter in our history
he lost a threeshot lead on the final hole of the british open , but jean van de velde , the french golfer who will always be associated with that strange and soggy misadventure at carnoustie , has not yet lost his sense of humor golf is a risky business , he said last friday particularly if you stay in the grandstand while i'm coming down the 18th for van de velde , humor is a reflex , a selfdeprecating tic that has proved an effective public defense against his tragicomic experience in scotland last month and he wants the golf community and the casual fan to know that while he lost considerable sleep after the british open , he is neither wallowing in selfpity nor struggling to keep his sanity as he prepares to play in his first major in the united states this week s pga championship at medinah country club outside chicago he has played in european tour events in dublin and malmo , sweden , since the open , making the cut on both occasions but failing to finish in the top 30 i am aware that there is a feeling i will not be able to recover from the way things ended in carnoustie , but i do n't believe that , he said to be honest , i am convinced that i can get back in the same position again that position was an enviable one as he walked to the 18th tee in carnoustie after scrambling and putting with aplomb for four days on what was quite possibly the most demanding british open course in history , van de velde , a 33yearold qualifier , needed only a doublebogey to become the first frenchman in 92 years to take possession of the claret jug what followed was as agonizing to watch as it was fascinating an errant drive onto the 17th fairway a twoiron that ricocheted off the stands and bounced back over a waterfilled trench called the barry burn into the deepest sort of rough , and then a wedge shot that was airborne only long enough to land in the same trench after removing his socks and shoes and descending into the water , van de velde ultimately and sagely decided to take a penalty drop and ended up with a triplebogey seven enough to salvage a place in a playoff with justin leonard of the united states and the eventual champion , paul lawrie of scotland , but not quite enough to salvage his dignity though he would prove witty and gracious in defeat , when he walked off the 18th after the playoff he stumbled redeyed into the scorer s trailer , where he found a chair , buried his face in his hands and cried as an open official patted him gently on the back that night he told reporters he would play a wedge instead of a 2iron next time , but he no longer feels that way knowing myself , i think i hit the 2iron again you just go with what you feel comfortable with , said the man whose role model has long been the swashbuckling spaniard seve ballesteros the only shot i would like to hit again would be the third one , he said of the wedge that landed in the water the lie was so bad , and i thought about chipping it sideways instead of going forward but it was so bad that i thought there was no guarantee i would make even the fairway chipping it sideways but in any case , i probably would have improved my lie and i could have gone for the green in four , instead of dropping the ball in four van de velde defended his caddy , christophe angelini who was seriously considering taking a job distributing digital video disks in his native paris earlier this year from criticism that he should have urged more caution on the 18th if he had stood in front of me with a wedge in his hand , i might have knocked him over , van de velde said it was my decision , and i take responsibility for it and if somebody had told me before the tournament that i would end up finishing second , i would have said , 'thank you , sir' finishing tied for second still hurt , however he said he slept only four hours the first two nights after the tournament , his mind racing with images and regrets , and as he flew back to france that monday night he turned to his wife , brigitte , and said how could i have been so stupid \? i came so close to a childhood dream it was not easy for van de velde to make golf his career in a nation where its roots are shallow at 14 , when he announced his intentions to his father , jean , he was displeased that he was not going to pursue higher education it was a new environment , van de velde said i could n't answer for him , but i think he was scared of what i was going to face he did n't think i could make it through to help van de velde make it through the week after the open , he and brigitte decided to return not to their home in geneva but to montdemarsan , the french town about 50 miles south of bordeaux where they both grew up one of the first things van de velde did was attend a bullfight , in which the matador jose tomas dedicated a bull to him i prayed that the beast would n't get him and send him to the hospital , van de velde said that would have been the perfect finish to my bad week tomas , if not the bull , emerged unscathed since then , van de velde has resumed sleeping through the night and begun sifting through the scores of letters and messages none of which , he insists , have started with you stupid idiot he was particularly amused by one missive from a british golf fan that reached him despite being addressed only to jean van de velde southwest france on the front of the envelope was a picture of him barefoot in the barry burn with the words that s him next to the photo if someone saw only the 18th , they might go , 'that s terrible , ' and that s fair enough , van de velde said but i think the people who are interested in golf will also remember the last 36 holes it is unclear whether the best golfer in a country where golf remains a minor sport will do his future entertaining mainly in europe or in the united states he said he was still considering his options , which , since carnoustie , have increased as much as his visibility ranked 152d in early july , he now has a spot in the pga championship and a spot in next year s masters and next year s british open but what he really wants is a place on the european ryder cup team in september no frenchman has taken part in that matchplay event , and he is currently eighth in the table in which the top 10 are guaranteed spots if he makes it , van de velde has a guarantee of his own if i play , he said , i will do everything i can to beat my opponents before the 18th hole photos jean van de velde smiled wanly as the british open title slipped away last month \( associated press \) \( pg d1 \) jean van de velde slept only four hours the two nights after his disastrous triplebogey 7 on no 18 \( associated press \) \( pg d2 \)
rover moved in five weeks ago , and still we have n't bonded i had expected by now that rover would be gratefully eating out of my hand , gazing at me adoringly while i shaved , listening raptly to my rants and innuendoes in fantasy , rover perched on my lap as i wrote and stared unblinking at the computer screen if he punctuated a paragraph with a purr , i 'd save it a hiss meant delete none of this has happened , has even come close rover has spent most of our time together in hiding is it because i am an imperfect pet pop , or because rover is a cat \? i have been thinking a lot lately about rover and me , which is another way of thinking a lot about me with pets , you can examine the relationship without having to allow the other party a say you can decide , for example , that you are unworthy of love without the other party s going ballistic because that makes him or her look like a real jerk for loving you in the first place how many pets , faced with human shame or guilt , have ripped open an owner s throat \? most of them just lick face you ca n't lose that is why there are , according to a sign in washington s wonderful zoo , 60 million house cats in the united states one of them now lives with me it has been many years since there were pets in my house , and then they were really the children s pets , not mine if the pets messed up , i kicked the kids i had n't even thought about any of this until the evening of may 4 , when we brought rover over from the west village whining piteously in a cardboard carrier another trauma for a 5yearold cat who had been rescued as an abandoned kitten in a vermont barn by a young couple , susannah and stephen they named him rover because he fetched like a puppy he grew fat and jolly , his black coat thick and lustrous their first child , veronica , became his playmate but after charles was born this year , rover began displaying sibling rivalry he never actually tried to eat charles , or even spray him , but he was not happy susannah and stephen knew that my wife , kathy , and i had gone to the international cat show in february and were thinking about a cat of our own i had even spoken with the animal expert roger caras , who had dismissed cats as basically useless as workers he told me cats are important if you are lonely , they are for loving , and that s real but their only function is companionship at the cat show , i repeated that to our guide , elinor silverman she snorted and said dog owners are desperate for unconditional love cat owners are willing to put up with some difficulty for a real relationship it s the difference between men who want a subservient wife or an independent one that may have been the moment for me mr caras had been too cocksure ms silverman offered an edgy challenge when susannah and stephen suggested a foster situation , rover as a loaner cat , just see how it works out , i said , let s go for it it started badly rover spent the first week wedged between a couch and a wall we know he came out for food and water and to use his litter box , but he must have done it at night , on little cat feet otherwise , he was catatonic i made jokes like that right to his face , hanging over the back of the couch he stared at me without expression he let me pet his head and stroke his back , as if he felt nothing but do n't think i was getting nothing out of this i had joined a club i began dropping little hints , a sort of verbal shedding , that other cat owners picked up quickly besides my famously obsessed cat friends , carol chesler , chris macmurray , fran prince , there were surprise confessions from others my longtime spiritual adviser , neil , growled in his honeycoated rasp , my woody is a pet , not a cat i do n't like cats , although biologically woody could be called a cat there was judy , who asked me not to ask how many cats she had in her apartment and when i told my father , he laughed and said he had had a cat he liked to spray with seltzer what was its name \? i asked that was 90 years ago , he said after a week , rover came out from behind the couch and took up a new daytime residence under the bed he was much closer to my office now that was when i began seriously thinking of him as my muse a few nights later , he woke me up by walking across my face that was not the first time i mistook a casual action as a declaration of love this is where we are now drawing \( mark matcho \)

johannesburg , jan 10 a former police officer who said he helped tackle the antiapartheid activist steve biko and smash his head into a wall when he was in custody in 1977 has been denied amnesty by the south african truth and reconciliation commission the commission has not yet released its findings , but george bizos , a lawyer for the biko family , said it had ruled that no amnesty could be granted because the police officer had not admitted to a crime the officer , gideon niewhoudt , and the four other officers involved in mr biko s interrogation told the commission that mr biko had attacked them after he had beeen forced to stand they said they had been defending themselves when they jumped on him days after the incident , mr biko , naked , disoriented and suffering from severe head injuries , was driven 750 miles across south africa for medical treatment he died before he got any , on sept 12 , 1977 his case outraged the world and helped galvanize the antiapartheid movement although an investigation at the time cleared the police officers of any wrongdoing , it became clear that an obviously injured mr biko had spent days manacled to window bars before dying alone on the floor of a prison cell what exactly happened to him has been an enduring secret when the five officers involved in his interrogation applied for amnesty in 1996 , many south africans hoped that they would finally hear a full explanation of how mr biko , the founder of the black consciouness movement , had died but few were satisfied with the version of events the five police officers put forward during weeks of testimony to the truth commission in 1997 sidestepping the question of whether mr niewhoudt , who is already in jail for other crimes , is believable , the commission s decision focuses on an issue that was particularly galling to the biko family none of the police officers accepted blame for mr biko s death or confessed to any criminal behavior in theory the verdict leaves mr niewhoudt vulnerable to criminal prosecution but such a prosecution seems unlikely legal experts say proving intent to kill for a murder charge would be extremely difficult and a lesser charge of manslaughter would not be possible because of a 20year statute of limitations a spokesman , mdu lembede , confirmed that the commission had made the ruling in the niewhoudt case it was apparently made on dec 15 but was not released to the public because it came as the christmas holidays began mr lembede said the text of the ruling would be available on monday applications for amnesty made by the four other officers are being considered by a different panel and are probably not ready for decision yet , he said the commission has received more than 7 , 000 applications for amnesty and still has many highprofile cases to deal with , like those of the two men convicted of killing the popular leader chris hani on the eve of the 1994 elections , or some of the more notorious police officers of the apartheid era they include col eugene de kock and craig williamson , who masterminded gruesome assassinations of liberation activists in general the commission has signaled its intention to forgive rather than punish the most heinous crimes of apartheid among those to have gotten amnesty is a police officer who organized a nighttime raid on political activists that killed 11 people , most of them women and children attending a wake the panel has also granted amnesty to the young men who stoned an american student , amy biehl , to death in 1993 when she drove some friends home to a black township created as a way to put south africa s brutal past to rest , the commission has the power to grant amnesty in return for confessions during the police officers' amnesty hearings , a few new details about mr biko s death emerged the officers admitted , for instance , that they had lied about which day mr biko had received a head injury because they had not followed regulations about seeking medical help but they continued to maintain that the death had been largely the result of an interrogation gone awry because of mr biko s own beligerence mr biko s relatives have fiercely opposed amnesty for the officers , saying after the hearings that they still did not think the truth had come out mr bizos said today that the commission s ruling was not wholly satisfying but , he added , perhaps that did not matter the world s jury has already decided , he said
anaheim , calif , dec 13 the mets' valiant quest for ken griffey jr ended tonight when griffey informed the seattle mariners he would not accept a trade to the mets steve phillips , the mets' general manager , refused to say if he had completed a trade for griffey , the superstar centerfielder , but he said , i will confirm he has said he would not want to come to the mets in a trade seattle let us know that griffey , who can be a free agent after next season , had asked the mariners to trade him because he has been in the major leagues 10 years , the last five with the same team , he cannot be traded to a team without his approval his agent said then other day he would approve a deal only to the cincinnati reds , but the mets continued to talk to the mariners tonight those talks ended while the mets' general manager worked feverishly from hotel room to hotel room to make a trade at the winter meetings , the yankees' general manager made one by long distance today brian cashman , sitting in his office in the bronx , sent chad curtis to the texas rangers for two minor league pitchers , sam marsonek and brandon knight cashman s geographical location was not his choice george steinbrenner did not allow his frontoffice executives to attend the meetings , so cashman relied on two scouts , damon oppenheimer and john cox , to do his legwork steve phillips of the mets was sitting in a lot of meetings with other general managers none of the meetings had produced a trade one possibility , in fact , had disappeared , phillips admitted but he said at midday that four major possibilities for trades remained as the day progressed , though , it was difficult to find support for the chances of a mets trade here phillips did not provide details of his possibilities , but executives of other clubs said the mets were also trying to wrest b j surhoff from baltimore \( perhaps scott erickson , too \) and jason schmidt from pittsburgh or brad radke from minnesota while cashman went home after his enforced day at the office , phillips decided not to go home tonight as planned he decided to stay until tuesday , the last day of the winter meetings , and try to make at least one trade the mets have reason to pursue surhoff he is a strong lefthanded hitter , which the mets need to replace john olerud the orioles have asked the mets whom they would trade for surhoff , but as of late this afternoon , the mets had not told them the mets apparently are willing to include armando benitez , their closer , in the right trade other teams have asked for benitez , roger cedeno and octavio dotel for players the mets want the mets have a possibility of trading their closer , tony attanasio , a player agent , said after meeting with phillips attanasio represents kazuhiro sasaki , a japanese closer , for whom the mets have made an offer he would have considerably more interest if he made a trade , attanasio said the mets joined the legion of teams expressing interest in the starting pitchers radke and schmidt a minnesota official said the twins were not looking to trade radke as for schmidt , cam bonifay , the pirates' general manager , said , we 've been unable to find anything to help steve and me make a deal the mets had talked to cleveland about manny ramirez and the toronto blue jays about david wells , but the talks with the indians have not gone beyond a session saturday , and wells was dormant at least for now the yankees continued to try to trade hideki irabu but had not been sufficiently impressed with any offer they had received the reds are one of the teams pursuing the enigmatic righthander , offering minor league prospects the yankees traded curtis , cashman said , because they wanted to create more playing time for shane spencer and believed that ricky ledee could back up bernie williams in center field they also save 19 million for each of the next two years reached at his home , curtis said when i'm all done with baseball i ca n't imagine looking at anything more favorably than my time with the yankees the yankees and the rangers basically completed the deal , but cashman had to speak with doug melvin , the texas general manager , after the minor league draft today melvin was eager to acquire curtis because with two young outfielders , ruben mateo and gabe kapler , he wanted a veteran fourth outfielder melvin also wanted someone who could lead off , which he said curtis will do often , either as an outfielder or as a designated hitter a former player , hearing about the trade , said that curtis would have been gone months ago if this were an earlier era he was alluding to the confrontation curtis had with derek jeter , one of the yankees' stars , after an onfield brawl in seattle last august jeter remained away from the fray and appeared to be joking with his good friend , alex rodriguez , the mariners' shortstop curtis , an oldfashioned , hardnosed competitor , viewed jeter s stance as inappropriate and said something to jeter in front of the dugout , then resumed his unsolicited educational lesson in the clubhouse after the game in front of a group of reporters jeter wanted no part of the conversation and walked away they subsequently talked about it , and curtis apologized for the manner i went about it two and a half months later curtis was in a different position he socked two home runs in game 3 of the world series , the second one a 10thinning shot that beat atlanta , 65 photo trading chad curtis , above , might mean more games for shane spencer \( barton silverman the new york times \)
mamaroneck , ny , march 10 in the beginning , the complaints were all too familiar three minority officers in a smalltown police department filed civil rights lawsuits , saying they had been passed over for promotions , harassed and subjected to a hostile workplace then things got really bad when two black officers filed the first lawsuit , in february 1998 , the police chief sent out a memo inviting everyone in the 40member department to read the complaints their colleagues had filed in april , an officer whose forbears were from india filed the second suit later , the chief sent the three officers who had complained to cultural awareness training but the men accused of the harassment were not sent to sensitivity training sessions a racist broadcast was mysteriously played over the policeband radio , and insulting cartoons were slipped into an officer s locker later , the town s labor negotiator interviewed the staff when he finished , he sent his report , full of all the officers' private woes , career disappointments and departmental criticism , to the police chief by the time the suits , which had been combined , came to trial in federal court in white plains in february , one officer involved , peter c persaud , who had filed the second suit , had been accused of sleeping on the job and given a fiveday suspension another , cedric winn , had been accused of leaving a tape recorder running in his locker to record his colleagues unaware and was dismissed after a disciplinary hearing the third , jason t lassiter , who had been on the force for 12 years , felt that he was being treated as a pariah and the mood in the police department , where officers used to picnic together , attend one another s weddings and laugh at the end of a day , was one of anger and recrimination all this stemmed from complaints of discrimination that one of the plaintiffs' lawyers described as subtle , the kind of woes that many workers gripe about , like being passed over for choice assignments or scrutinized more closely than others any part of this case standing alone , i would n't have gotten involved , said joseph a maria , who represented officers lassiter and winn , but when you put it all together , there was a thread , a pretty thick thread once we put the lawsuit together , it got worse , he said they were so retaliatory the town settled the lawsuits for an undisclosed amount of money six days after the trial began , just before the police chief , richard rivera , was to take the stand and after evidence was submitted that the town had offered to drop its fiveday suspension of officer persaud if he would agree to drop his lawsuit whether any of the three complainants still has a job is a question everyone involved has refused to answer none have returned to work despite the settlement , town administrators maintain that the police department did nothing wrong they point to the fact that the one other minority member of the force , nelson flores , was promoted to detective in august as evidence that the department does not discriminate the only change they plan to make is to add a clause to the police contract that will forbid officers to sue without first going through mediation or arbitration in many respects , the department made some mistakes in personnel decisions , said milton thurm , the lawyer who represented the town i honestly believe that none of the decisions were based on race there were remarks made that were derogatory but not racial they were guys kidding around i think you will find that in a lot of small departments officer persaud , who has worked for mamaroneck for three years , said he filed his suit because he was fed up with being greeted with ethnic slurs during the morning roll call he said he did not consider the epithets amusing some of the complaints were simple misinterpretations , mr thurm said for instance , a park and be seen directive that officers winn and lassiter contended was issued to intimidate one of the town s few black families was intended to appease a resident s protest that he never saw patrols in his neighborhood , mr thurm said other complaints , he said , were based on supposition , like the mysterious 6 am broadcast in november of a racist howard stern routine over the department radio three municipal departments share that radio band and anyone could have broadcast on that channel if he or she had the right equipment , mr thurm said still , he acknowledged , the department did not do much to investigate the offensive broadcast still other complaints were petty , he said , like the plaintiffs' objection to the playing of the howard stern television program just feet from the police station s front desk again , i do n't think it was racial , mr thurm said it was just a bunch of guys watching television the plaintiffs disagreed in 1996 , officer winn said , he was handed an incident report , which he saved , that included a racial epithet he produced the document during the trial the official report , compiled in a book of police reports that is open to the public , was edited to eliminate the epithet and change the phrase to blacks congregating
washington , june 16 congress seldom meets a hearing that it does n't like , but the one that representative john l mica , a florida republican , convened today raised quite a few hackles its topic the pros and cons of drug legalization , decriminalization and harm reduction the hearing , the first on the subject since 1988 , was motivated by suspicions on capitol hill that legalization of drugs is the ultimate goal of people who actively promote marijuana as a medicinal palliative or advocate giving sterile syringes to heroin addicts to prevent them from contracting aids the hearing illustrated congress s reluctance to rethink the war against drugs , on which the federal government spends nearly 18 billion a year and it presaged the sort of discourse about drugs bound to surface in next year s election campaign it s a politically riskfree area , said eric e sterling , a former counsel to the house judiciary committee who helped draft the antidrug abuse acts passed in 1986 and 1988 mr sterling , who is president of the criminal justice policy foundation , attended the hearing no member of congress is going to lose a vote because they 're tough on drugs , he said and it attracts media attention i suspect pollsters would tell members of congress that this is a very good area to be outspoken in the hearing itself drew protests from opposing camps we do not have hearings called 'the pros and cons of rape , ' said representative mark souder , republican of indiana , a member of the subcommittee on criminal justice , drug policy and human resources , which held the hearing and ethan a nadelmann , the director of the lindesmith center , a group based in new york that works to change drug policy , dismissed the hearing as an effort to smear the many moderate proposals for drugpolicy reform with the broad and false brush of radical legalization the hearing was largely prompted by voter initiatives to approve medicinal marijuana in at least five states and the district of columbia the initiatives were financed in part by the billionaire investor george soros , who has also reportedly contributed about 10 million to the lindesmith center and the drug policy foundation , two groups spearheading the effort to change the way that americans view illegal drugs there was a feeling that one side was doing all the talking and there really needed to be a congressional response to this , said bobby charles , the chief counsel for the government reform subcommittee gen barry r mccaffrey , the retired general who is the white house s national director of drug control policy , put it more bluntly we 're getting rolled in the public arena by very clever people , he told the subcommittee in his testimony , general mccaffrey described a campaign of deception and halftruths to erode society s disapproval of marijuana and harder drugs , to which 41 million americans are now addicted while 82 percent of the public oppose making illicit drugs legal , he said , there is a carefully camouflaged , wellfunded , tightly knit core of people whose goal is to legalize drugs in the united states mr nadelmann did not attend the hearing , contending that the subcommittee had disinvited him they might have held hearings on whether current federal drug policies are doing more harm than good , he said instead , they decided to hold a hearing on the 'drug legalization movement , ' which is essentially a figment of their imagination mr charles said none of the subcommittee members wanted to legalize drugs themselves but representative mica , he said , believed that an open and honest debate only serves the cause of truth other subcommittee members expressed unhappiness that the hearing was even taking place legalization is a surrender to despair , said representative benjamin a gilman , republican of upstate new york it cannot and ought not be any topic of serious discussion in our nation s debate of the challenges of illicit drugs suggesting the depth of hostility toward the notion of legal drugs , representative bob barr , republican of georgia , asked whether anti racketeering laws could be used to prosecute people conspiring to legalize drugs general mccaffrey shot back that doing so would have a chilling effect on the right of free speech general mccaffrey assured the subcommittee that i am not openminded about drug abuse in america but afterward , he said he wished that there had been a fuller exposition of the legalization argument i want people to come out and say what they believe , and be subject to crossexamination , he said ira glasser , who testified before the subcommittee as executive director of the american civil liberties union , said , i think they are engaged in an effort to discredit and attack and intimidate people who disagree with them mr glasser , who is also president of the drug policy foundation , said in his testimony , the government has demonized all drug use without differentiation , has systematically and hysterically resisted science and has turned millions of stable and productive citizens into criminals the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws , which wants marijuana made legally available , said it was excluded mr charles said there was not enough room for everyone i think there will be future hearings , he said mr nadelmann was one of several people whom general mccaffrey accused of advocating drug legalization general mccaffrey quoted mr nadelmann as having said in 1990 , personally , when i talk about legalization , i mean three things the first is to make drugs such as marijuana , cocaine and heroin legal the rest of mr nadelmann s sentence , which was omitted at the hearing , said under fairly restricted conditions , but not as restricted as today mr nadelmann said he was quoted out of context my secret agenda is not the legalization of drugs , he said it s the creation of a drug policy based upon common sense ,

washington for outoftown visitors , summer in washington can mean many things monuments and documents , a babel of regional accents , first family photo ops \( though these are rare \) , and the sight of local office workers jogging at lunchtime on the national mall up and down , up and down no matter how hot the weather but summer also means art , and plenty of it washington is a serious museum city there s the national gallery of art , of course and the smithsonian institution covers a wealth of cultural bases the nation s collections of african , africanamerican and asian art are under its auspices , as is the hirshhorn museum , a showcase for contemporary work that s just a partial list throw in privately financed outfits like the corcoran gallery and the table is set for a feast all these venues have worthytooutstanding fare on view at present , including retrospectives of roy lichtenstein , brice marden and alma thomas a survey of recent work from south africa , and a truly celestial gathering of south indian goddesses none of the shows will travel to new york , which may make a washington trip \( with a stop in baltimore on the way \) something more than a shouldweorshould n'twe proposition one attraction that certainly wo n't be going anywhere is the national gallery s new sculpture garden , which opened in may covering a 61acre square plot next to the museum , it has curvy paths , shady plantings and a circular fountain about the size of lake lucerne this sends out mighty firehosestyle jets of water in summer in the winter it will be a skating rink installed throughout the grounds are 17 examples of postwar sculpture from the museum s collection some , like ellsworth kelly s ovalshaped steel stele ii and isamu noguchi s great rock of inner seeking , are poised and circumspect , the way we wish politicians were others , like louise bourgeois s bronze spider and joan miro s gothic personage , birdflash , browse , wary and shy , among the trees to be frank , innercity sculpture gardens are an iffy idea they corral together largescale occupants who have basically nothing to say to each other , then force them to show off competitively , a situation in which nobody wins still , this one is good of its kind most of the work gets to claim some personal space , and some pieces are outgoing and userfriendly visitors can lounge around , for example , on scott burton s granite seats and feel relieved that they do n't have to negotiate lucas samaras s vertiginous stack of turquoise chairs and they can fantasize a home away from home in roy lichtenstein s aluminum house i , with its cartoon lines , pop colors and eyetickling play with perspective corcoran gallery of art lichtenstein , who died two years ago and is best known as a painter , has a fullscale survey of sculpture at the corcoran gallery it encompasses some 40 years of work , and although the artist was involved in the planning stages , the final selection was made by jack cowart , deputy director and chief curator at the corcoran the show has much to offer , though it gets off to a shaky start the polychrome sculptures installed on the museum s grand interior staircase are swamped by the heavy 19thcentury architecture they look flimsy , almost like clutter lichtenstein s painstakingly breezy art was made for cleanedout modernist spaces it often depends on them , in fact , which is both a weakness and a strength once inside the whitecube environment of the galleries , everything perks up the show begins at the beginning from the 1940 s comes a carved stone head influenced by precolumbian sculpture , from the 50 s a slender assemblage of painted wood in which the artist s eye for whittleddown forms and his deadpan wit are already in evidence although lichtenstein had a brief decoish phase in the late 1960 s , his renowned pop art style was firmly in place by 1964 , as seen here in sculptures of women s heads , soulful and ben daydotted steaming coffee cups and explosions these images were transferred straight from paintings , with in some cases the ben day dots replicated in perforated steel the sculpture became more abstract as time went on and folded in a range of art historical references , picasso , matisse and abstract expressionism among them lichtenstein s famous images of frozen brush strokes , which gently mock the psychic imperatives of action painting , proved especially amenable to the sculpture medium , and several variations splash and drip in midair here if the show feels more and more absorbing as it goes on , it s not because the work gets better exactly , but because one gets attuned , even faintly addicted to , its character selfamused , goodnatured , always preferring the eloquent turn of phrase to the big statement it all looks effortless , though the preliminary studies and working collages in the show scuffed up , rethought , drawn over tell a different story lichtenstein s art is cool , in the sense of wow , that s cool he had oodles of style , enough to sustain a whole career it was a career very much of a piece his sculptures , paintings and prints are , visually speaking , all cut from the same bright , sheer , washandwear modern cloth as a body of work , they give lightweight a good name hirshhorn museum
when united states customs officials arrested ahmed ressam near seattle last week after he came off a ferry from canada in a car they say was loaded with jars of nitroglycerin , timing devices and other bombmaking materials , american intelligence officials knew little about him but the arrest set off alarms in france , where antiterrorist officials had been focusing on the 32yearold mr ressam because of his connections to a loosely organized group of islamic radicals that french investigators suspect had carried out a series of attacks on supermarkets , armored security vehicles and banks in northern france in 1996 french officials declined to provide specifics and did not suggest that mr ressam , an algerian , was involved in the attacks but one senior french lawenforcement official said that mr ressam had links to fateh kamel , an algerian veteran of the afghan war the french have tied mr kamel to the group that carried out the attacks in 1996 , which left one bystander and several islamic radicals dead earlier this year , the french identified said atmani , an algerian with a bosnian passport who once roomed with mr ressam in a montreal apartment , as another figure with links to mr kamel french officials said they sent a delegation to canada in october to interview mr atmani and mr ressam , but neither man could be located a french antiterrorist official said that they briefed canadian and american officials about their interest in mr ressam , including his possible links to the financing of islamic terror activities in europe and elsewhere much about mr ressam remains unknown as officials in three countries trace his movements in an effort to learn what he planned to do with the explosives he was accused of bringing into the united states but from interviews and a review of public records in canada , a picture is emerging of a man who moved easily from country to country with falsified passports at the modest , 85pernight hotel where he lived for two weeks in vancouver , british columbia , workers recalled that he was traveling with another man who spoke english with no discernible accent american officials now say they have unconfirmed intelligence reports that mr ressam had been seen in training camps used in the 1980 s by islamic militants fighting the soviets in afghanistan mr ressam told canadian authorities that he had been falsely accused in algeria of being an islamic radical , and tortured , according to immigration records canadian officials acknowledged yesterday that mr ressam had taken advantage of lax procedures and loose cooperation between the police and immigration authorities to obtain his false papers reviewing the case , one montreal police investigator , claude paquette , this week said that the loose rules had turned canada into a club med for terrorists canada s investigation into the affair has established , among other things , that mr ressam arrived in the country in 1994 with a french passport in an assumed name later , after being ordered arrested and deported , he went underground and obtained a canadian passport in a false name using only a roman catholic baptism certificate , a procedure said to be common in quebec when arrested in seattle , mr ressam was carrying a canadian passport in the assumed name of benni antoine noris the group to which french investigators have linked mr ressam is part of a new trend in islamic radicalism in which small , loosely linked bands of militants collaborate in attacks on western targets , often financing themselves by what the french call gangsterterrorism one highranking french official who outlined what he called the globalization of islamist terror said there were at least 20 islamic groups that have planned or carried out terrorist attacks in countries like canada , france , belgium , turkey , malaysia and australia , as well a dozen or more other nations few of these groups , he said , belonged to a coherent terrorist network , although many maintained loose links with each other what most of these groups have in common , french and american officials say , is a heritage from the islamic holy war against soviet troops in afghanistan in the 1980 s , when thousands of young muslims from across europe , the middle east and asia were indoctrinated with a militant brand of islam , and trained in weapons techniques and bombmaking even if the islamic terror groups are not centrally directed , antiterrorist officials in the united states and other western countries say they are linked by many things , including their fiercely antiwestern system of beliefs on the fringe of islam and common experiences and operating procedures most of the leaders fought , or at least were trained , in afghanistan most see the united states , with its secular political tradition , its military and economic power , and its backing for israel , as the prime target for terrorist attacks many radicals use false passports and work from similar terrortraining manuals
in 1976 , josephine e jones set eyes on stainedglass windows , carved cherry bannisters and minton tiles in a queen annestyle row house at 137 west 122d street in harlem , and she knew it was the home she had dreamed of owning the detailing was a signature of francis h kimball , one of new york s leading turnofthecentury architects , and the street was once known locally as doctors' row mrs jones had made her way north from greenville , sc , where her father , a cotton sharecropper , worked for a white landowner with an expansive victorian estate though mrs jones s family had lived in a tiny shack without running water , she remembered playing in the victorian house and fantasizing about owning one as grand on 122d street , mrs jones discovered that treasure , but hardly anyone else recognized it the neighborhood had been neglected for 30 years , and there were more abandoned buildings on the street than inhabited ones thieves had filched many gargoyles , gables and other ornamental details from the row houses , and one historic brownstone had been painted bright orange none of that fazed mrs jones , who bought the house for 15 , 000 in 1992 , she asked the city s landmarks preservation commission to designate her home , and the row houses adjoining hers , as official landmarks she was not the only one middleclass and professional africanamericans were increasingly drawn to harlem , attracted by relatively inexpensive real estate prices , dropping crime rates and signs of economic renewal they , too , wanted their historic homes and harlem s other jewels to gain landmark status , which they hoped would help their preservation efforts too many markers of their heritage , they say , have already been destroyed the famed cotton club is gone , as is the audubon ballroom , where malcolm x was killed so are the lafayette theater , where orson welles staged the first allblack production of macbeth , and the harlem opera house , which oscar hammerstein opened in 1889 other important cultural moorings have deteriorated or been partly dismantled , like the renaissance ballroom and theater , minton s playhouse and small s paradise , where many jazz legends took the stage preservationists argue that many cultural touchstones remain , and can be saved if the landmarks preservation commission acts quickly they point out that the city s landmarks law lets owners of historic properties qualify for special grants and lowinterest loans for restoration work and the law carries penalties for alterations that compromise a building s historic integrity but the landmarking process is never easy , and it is complicated by harlem s own economic and social dynamics some community developers , for example , argue that landmarking brings bureaucratic restraints and higher expenses that make it more difficult to renovate old buildings others say that poverty and other social problems make it harder for neighborhood activists to focus on preservation efforts nevertheless , in the last several years , people like mrs jones have formed local advocacy groups to pressure the city and the commission to recognize historic sites in harlem in 1991 the city landmarks agency issued a list of 25 sites it promised to place at the top of its agenda but some residents say the process has stagnated , and neighborhood leaders are expressing frustration harlem has been ignored up until now , said carolyn kent , cochairwoman of the parks and landmarks committee of community board 9 , which covers west harlem it has been ignored by its own residents , by downtown advocacy , by the commission , by elected officials it s a tragedy because we 've lost all these places that are of great international importance the president of the hamilton heightswest harlem community preservation organization , ron melichar , said that many architecturally significant buildings have been ignored the concern we feel is that as you look generally at the housing stock in harlem , you see a deterioration and an increasing disregard for the historic value of what is there , he said it has had a big impact on our community , because it does n't allow for us to move ahead with the revitalization that should happen michael henry adams , a preservationist who is writing a book about historic harlem , has become one of the area s most vocal advocates of landmarking he argues that the landmarks preservation commission has neglected buildings above 96th street , thus erasing the heritage and history and culture of so many people it is not the kind of racism where someone calls you a name , mr adams said it s the worst kind , where they just ignore you he added it is an utter scandal that the incredible architectural and cultural heritage here can be destroyed when we have a law in place to protect it but it is being used in an inequitable way the chairwoman of the landmarks preservation commission , jennifer j raab , said that protecting harlem was one of her top priorities , along with lower manhattan and douglaston , queens when ms raab was appointed by the mayor in 1994 , she said , no action had been taken on 12 of the 25 sites that had been nominated since then , she said , seven of those sites have been landmarked , including the 1933 harlem ymca on 135th street , near adam clayton powell jr boulevard , where many important black figures from richard wright to the rev dr martin luther king jr have lived , visited or spoken
vietnam the necessary war by michael lind 314 pages the free press 25 michael lind begins this intrepid reexamination of the vietnam war with a scene from what used to be called the international communist conspiracy mao zedong , stalin and ho chi minh standing side by side at a banquet in moscow in 1950 to mr lind that moment reveals an underappreciated truth many writers over the years have portrayed ho as a vietnamese nationalist first and a communist second and thus a leader who was turned needlessly into an enemy by ignorant and clumsy american actions in mr lind s different view , he was a committed stalinist tyrant who from the very beginning belonged to the forces arrayed against the united states mr lind returns to ho several times in vietnam the necessary war , which rejects the vision of the war that might be described as conventionally liberal , that it was a tragic mistake from the start mr lind s main point about ho is that he was a willing and enthusiastic proxy for the soviet union in the cold war , and it is the cold war that furnishes mr lind with his main analytical concept the vietnam war was necessary , mr lind argues , because it was a part of the global and epochal conflict between the united states and the soviet union , a conflict that was an extension of the great hot wars of the century to have yielded without a fight to a sovietsponsored takeover of south vietnam would have resulted in a realignment of global forces in moscow s favor , mr lind contends he then gives this not very unusual argument a new twist it was necessary for the united states to escalate the war in the mid1960 s in order to defend the credibility of the united states as a superpower , but it was necessary for the united states to forfeit the war after 1968 in order to preserve the american domestic political consensus in favor of the cold war on other fronts , he writes mr lind s view , in other words , is that lyndon b johnson did well by escalating the war in 1964 and 1965 but that richard m nixon did badly by failing to withdraw from the conflict more quickly , before mounting american casualties sapped the country s willingness to fight the cold war on its many other fronts vietnam remains an issue around which opinions have the unyielding character of religious conviction , so it is unlikely that mr lind will change many minds with this book nonetheless , it is a forceful and fresh look at the conflict , a book whose conclusions correspond to none of the already wellestablished positions mr lind is devastatingly hard on the antiwar left , whose arguments he slices up with a keen analytical razor but he also effectively refutes what might be the main charge made from the other side of the spectrum that a timid civilian apparatus tied the military s hands , denying it permission to get the enemy where he was , in north vietnam , and thereby bringing about a shameful and needless defeat it is far from clear that he is correct in everything he says but mr lind , whose earlier books , like the next american nation and up from conservatism , showed him to be a bold and unconventional thinker , continues impressively to be one here his argument hinges on several propositions one is that the vietnam war was not an isolated episode that the united states slipped into almost by accident and fought as a matter of pride it was part of the battle for global supremacy itself second , mr lind contends , the vietnam war was justified , not because democracy in south vietnam was threatened \( he agrees that it never existed \) but because of that country s strategic importance third , the strategic stakes had to do not with controlling the territory of vietnam but with prestige and credibility mr lind is not a balanceofpower theorist he advocates a bandwagon school of thought , the idea that nations align themselves with the side that they perceive to be riding the crest of historical power , which , if the vietnam war had not been fought , would have been the soviet union as mr lind puts it the primary danger facing the united states was the likelihood that if the soviet union and or china helped a proxy state annihilate an american protectorate , the soviet union and china would be dangerously emboldened , while weak american allies and neutrals around the world would be frightened into appeasing one or the other of the two communist great powers mr lind mounts a strong argument for that point of view it is what might be called the forfeit scenario that seems less solid to fight a war on behalf of an ally and then to abandon that war \( and the ally \) when the going gets tough seems a dubious principle of behavior for a superpower mr lind argues that the war and the ally were abandoned later anyway , at great cost to american prestige and with the loss of 25 , 000 more american lives those costs , and especially the cost in lives , cannot be dismissed but it does not seem at all sure , had the war been forfeited in 1968 , that the united states would not have suffered the very sort of blow to its credibility that the war was fought to avoid indeed , it seems likely that a quick withdrawal after 1968 might have enhanced soviet prestige even more than the final indochinese debacle of 1975 did china , for example , which in 1972 joined forces with the united states in an antisoviet alliance , might have felt compelled to join the bandwagon with the soviet union if the united states had jettisoned vietnam in 1968 moreover , the withdrawal engineered by nixon and his national security adviser , henry a kissinger , left south vietnam intact mr kissinger has argued that what led to the eventual debacle was , first , the watergate affair , which crippled nixon politically , and , second , the consequent refusal of congress to provide aid to the south vietnamese even after hanoi began its final offensive mr lind states that only a permanent american troop presence , as in korea , could have safeguarded a noncommunist vietnam , but he makes no real argument to support this position , which readers are under no obligation to take on faith one wants , in other words , to debate mr lind , whose main shortcoming is not that his position is poorly argued but that on certain points it is not argued enough still , his forceful polemic is one of those rare books that really deserve the overused modifier provocative mr lind makes you think about matters in ways you had n't thought before photo michael lind \( sigrid estrada the free press \)
hauppauge , ny in the basement conference room of the phoenix house drug rehabilitation center here , there is a deflated sense that the party is over this group of four ages 17 to 21 could have been found not long ago hanging around the parking lot of a suburban high school , full of youthful alienation , boredom and desire for a more grownup , flashier life i could n't stand the town i lived in , said debbie walcott , now 21 , who grew up in dix hills said eric uresk , 18 , a friend of mine works in nightclubs , and he s been taking me with him since i was a kid they also had hubris i had a very cocky attitude , said tom gungor , 20 , of massapequa it kept him believing , he said , that i ca n't be a drug addict like the others , he was wrong already , each has a lifetime s worth of stories about drug use and crime their stories spill out now that they have submitted to longterm drug treatment most after being charged with crimes committed to buy drugs they are casualties of their generation s recreational drugs called club drugs because they are often used at long , loud music parties at nightclubs or impromptu gatherings known as raves , they have been far overshadowed by powder cocaine , crack and the return of heroin drug experts say they are particularly popular among white middle and uppermiddleclass youth , in part because they are easily ingested and carry none of the stigma of heroin or crack no one calls this an epidemic but guarding against one , the national institute on drug abuse announced last week that it was increasing funding for research and education on club drugs including ecstasy , ghb , rohypnol and ketamine this puts the government in the familiar position of broadcasting the dangers of drugs teenagers see as lowrisk fun these socalled party drugs , ai n't , said alan i leshner , the institute s director ecstasy , the best known , produces a spedup euphoria that allows people to dance for 12 or 14 hours without fatigue it can cause a dangerously rapid heart rate , a spike in body temperature and , in the long term , anxiety and memory damage rohypnol , known as roofies , is a tasteless , odorless liquid sedative that can erase memory of anything that happens under its effect there have been numerous reports of the drug being used in sexual assaults most kids who use drugs are looking for a social context , a social connection , said dr mitchell s rosenthal , the president of phoenix house , the nationwide drug treatment organization tom gungor said he entered the rave scene at 15 after he was handed a flier at the sunrise mall advertising a rave near the brooklyn bridge he said the music and drugs were linked because on the drugs you can feel every beat in your body the club scene can be a balm to a disaffected youth offering harmony with a group , the blunting of life s sharp edges , the promise of affection and a way to fill time when they go to the clubs , they 're accepted by the crowds , mr gungor said they 're taken in it s a nice feeling , especially if they 're having trouble at school or at home club music is no more directly linked to drug abuse than was lucy in the sky with diamonds but the residents of this phoenix house center , in the growing suburbs of suffolk county , took deep plunges eric uresk , a strong , stout boy whose wrestling exploits once got his name in the newspapers , wound up stealing from other drug users to support his cravings i 'd wake up in the mcdonald s ball pit or on people s front lawns and not remember how i got there , he said debbie walcott , 21 , said that attending woodstock 1994 introduced her to an array of drugs she stole drugs and money from a pharmacy where she worked , danced topless to support herself and ended up adrift until she violated probation and got to phoenix house richard o 'donnell , a thin , shorthaired 17yearold from east islip , said he started going to teen nightclubs when he was 14 or 15 he met a group of older kids and fell deep into clubbing and drugging and pulling crimes like stealing car stereos after a while i stopped going to school , he said then he was charged with truancy even now , he remembers the sense of adventure and breaking free it was a fun life , because it was dangerous he said you 're always on the run nobody knew what you were doing
atlanta , oct 20 the atlanta braves are deflecting team of the decade questions like so many foul tips off a baseball bat , professing indifference to the opportunity to be designated baseball s best of the 1990 s who cares \? we 're in the world series and the bottom line is we want to win , braves outfielder brian jordan said today , in between battingpractice cuts at turner field but it is actually the braves' fault that such inquiries are being made if their play in just a few of the previous seven postseasons had matched their brilliance during those regular seasons , they would already be wearing the unofficial crown , regardless of what happens in this world series matchup with the yankees , which begins saturday in atlanta atlanta manager bobby cox today named the lefthander tom glavine as the game 1 starter , followed by greg maddux in game 2 on sunday , and kevin millwood and john smoltz in the first two games at yankee stadium next week cox also said smoltz , a starter his whole career , would be used as a reliever on saturday , if necessary smoltz pitched twice in relief during the national league championship series against the mets while names like glavine , maddux and smoltz are familiar , this edition of the braves is different from most of its predecessors , certainly the 1996 group that fumbled a twogamestonone lead in losing the world series to the yankees in six games overcoming seasonending injuries to andres galarraga , javy lopez and kerry ligtenberg to win a major leaguebest 103 games , and playing fantastically when the division title was on the line in august and september , has provided the braves with more chemistry and resilience than they had three years ago thirtyone times this season they gained a victory in their last atbat , and they showed grit in outlasting the diehard mets we 're a lot closer as a team , a lot tighter , chipper jones said we did n't have a lot of injuries in '96we did n't have a lot of adversity to come through this year , all of the adversity has brought us a lot closer as a ball club i think if we had n't had all those injuries , to be honest with you , we might be sitting at home right now asked if this team is stronger mentally than the club that collapsed in 1996 , losing three straight games in atlanta , including game 4 in which a home run by the yankees' jim leyritz helped erase a 60 lead , jones was frank without a doubt we played a lot of close games this year we did n't clinch the first week of september we clinched really late in september , so we were pretty accustomed to a playofftype atmosphere before we got into the playoffs in years past , we 've clinched the first week of september and taken a couple of weeks off , trying to get everybody healthy and it s hard to flip that switch again once you get to the postseason while these braves are not as offensively imposing as the 1996 team , they are more potent in other areas their bullpen , led by the ornery closer , john rocker , is wicked , particularly with cox at times employing his starters in relief the earnedrun average of atlanta s bullpen \( 352 \) was better than that of its staff full of aces \( 383 \) besides the relief corps , the braves boast better defense and bench play than they did in 1996 lopez s backup , eddie perez , played solidly in the second half of the season and was the most valuable player of the nlcs the braves have also received terrific clutch contributions from the 40yearold otis nixon and the 35yearold ozzie guillen , as well as solid innings from brian hunter , keith lockhart and howard battle everybody has picked it up , said andruw jones , who drew the gamewinning walk against the mets' kenny rogers in game 6 of the league championship series a lot of guys have become heroes that said , the braves , who have consistently reminded reporters of the yankees' excellence , insist on being called the underdogs of this series but when the clubs met in a threegame series at yankee stadium just after the allstar game break , the braves won the first two games and they did some remarkable things en route to the victories , the most impressive being their shelling of the yankees' extraordinary closer , mariano rivera with two outs in the ninth inning , jones , who homered in his first two atbats in the 1996 world series , drove a rivera fastball over the fence for a threerun homer that led to a 107 braves' victory it was one of only two home runs hit off rivera this season and the last of his four blown saves one thing we can grasp from that series back in new york is that we did hit him a little bit , not that it was easy and not that it s going to be now , jones said we can draw a little bit of confidence from that but that was june this is october october 1999 , not 1996 photo pitchers john rocker , left , and terry mulholland waiting for fly balls during the braves' workout yesterday in atlanta \( associated press \)
moscow , april 27 senior american and russian officials met today to discuss competing notions of how kosovo could be resettled and administered once hostilities end , as moscow moved increasingly into a role as mediator in the lengthening balkan conflict before leaving moscow for germany , deputy secretary of state strobe talbott gave a positive assessment of his meetings with viktor s chernomyrdin , a former prime minister who has been appointed russia s special envoy for kosovo there is no question that russia and the united states are working together on this problem , mr talbott said the problem is extremely complicated it is important that urgent work continues , and it will continue in the days to come nevertheless , important disagreements were evident the major differences centered on how kosovo would be administered , what kind of force would keep the peace and how many serbian troops might be allowed to remain nato officials have been talking about setting up an internationally protected area in kosovo that would be nominally within yugoslavia , but effectively controlled by allied forces kosovo is a province in serbia , a republic in yugoslavia moscow favors a different arrangement , one that harks back to american proposals made at the peace talks outside paris before they collapsed and the bombing began in russia s approach , kosovo would be under international supervision for only a limited period , until security could be established , the refugees returned and a new provincial government elected this plan appears to reflect russia s anxiety about having nato establish protectorates in sovereign nations , and yugoslavia s preoccupation with retaining control over kosovo mr chernomyrdin reaffirmed that argument in an interview on russian television in which he said , kosovo is part of yugoslavia some of today s discussions reflected differences over the sort of force that might enter kosovo once the hostilities ended nato favors an international force , with allied troops at its core a major component would be the british troops who are now assembling in the thousands in neighboring macedonia the united states has pledged to contribute 4 , 000 troops in washington , a senior administration official said the russians did speak to mr talbott about an international military force , rather than just an international presence , that would enter kosovo and bring the refugees back but the official said there was a lot of ambiguity about what moscow means by military force , for example , whether it means heavily armed soldiers or lightly armed police the official said mr chernomyrdin repeated his earlier assessment to the americans that president slobodan milosevic of yugoslavia could accept an international force from nations like russia , south africa , ukraine , nigeria , algeria , greece and other countries not involved in the air strikes nato and belgrade also differ about the number of serbian troops who might remain in kosovo after a settlement virtually none , as far as the alliance is concerned about 22 , 500 troops and interior ministry police , according to mr milosevic during the discussions in moscow today , russian officials also proposed a bombing pause to encourage diplomacy , but mr talbott rejected the idea despite such complications , russian mediation has emerged as the most promising avenue for a diplomatic solution , and the businesslike tone of today s meeting suggested that a serious process is under way but it remains unclear how much influence russia really has over belgrade , and how much leverage it is prepared to use mr chernomyrdin sidestepped the question in his public comments today we are intermediaries , not participants , and everybody should realize it , he said the thing is , only russia can make contact with yugoslavia today for all the differences , a state department official said the talks were not strident a nato official said the administration was mildly encouraged because mr chernomyrdin was in a listening mode and took a positive approach nor is russia the only channel united nations secretary general kofi annan is due in moscow on wednesday there have been suggestions that he may appoint a special envoy for kosovo , but it is not clear if he is prepared to do so now certainly russia , as well as nato , has much to gain by negotiating a solution the allies' air strikes have been a painful thorn in the side of president boris n yeltsin , who is trying to fend off nationalist critics while maintaining a good working relationship with the west mr yeltsin has been consumed with the yugoslav issue , according to mr chernomyrdin , who has also been busy before his twohour meeting today with mr talbott , he talked on monday by telephone with vice president al gore the problem , however , is the enormous gulf between nato s demands and the vague proposals that president milosevic is floating through his

riverhead captain moriarty screamed ready ! aim ! fire ! and instantly a dozen guns erupted in the direction of the furtive figures taking shelter behind a tall hedge none fell down to do so would have risked contact with a fine young crop of poison ivy sprouting crimson from the ground but the enemy did fall back the previous 20 minutes had been real fogofwar stuff a chaotic jumble of gunfire , bugle calls , drum rolls , shouted orders and the curses of my fellow soldiers loading , running , firing , loading gun smoke , dust , heat , sweat i felt confusion , excitement , borderline fear but we were winning , by golly ! we had them rebels on the run ! hurrah ! or so i thought the captain evidently thought differently , because he began ordering a measured retreat fire and fall back six paces as you reload , boys ! he yelled fire and fall back ! we ca n't attack their works ! soon we were disengaged from the enemy , and the skirmish was over it had all gone pretty much according to a script devised beforehand by the opposing commanders but my heart was still pounding , and from more than physical exertion i had seen the elephant , a 19thcentury phrase that may be an allusion to the most feared weapon in hannibal s carthaginian legion , but that surely gets its texture from the awe any boy must have felt on his first visit to a circus or his first experience of combat mine came not in any real fight , but in the elaborate form of theater that is the civil war reenacting movement and it did n't come at gettysburg or any of the other megaevents on the reenacting calendar the battlefield was just outside riverhead , at the hallockville museum farm and folklife center , where on a sundrenched midmay weekend i played war with reenactor units from the metro area and elsewhere in the northeast i had been offered a spot in the ranks of a sayvillebased unit reenacting company k of the 67th new york volunteer infantry regiment my enlistment was only for 72 hours , long enough , i hoped , to get a taste of a civil war soldier s life i would eat period food , wear period clothing , sleep in a period tent , fire a period gun in the real thing , the 67th , also known as the first long island , saw action in all of the army of the potomac s major campaigns from 1862 through mid1864 of an original roster of 880 men , most of them recruited in brooklyn when brooklyn was considered long island , 428 died of wounds or disease my chance of dying would be substantially less i had the opportunity to fulfill the daydream of every boy who has read the red badge of courage without any real risk of getting the red badge camp opened on friday , a day devoted not to fighting but to livinghistory demonstrations for hundreds of children bused in from schools in the area reenactors from the 1st long island , company h of the 14th brooklyn , the 5th new york engineers , berdan s sharpshooters , the 54th massachusetts \( the black regiment featured in the film glory \) , the 30th virginia and lee s light horse \( confederate \) artillery , with two cannon , were on hand to describe the routines of a civil war soldier s life , fire some rifles \( reenactors load real black powder but , of course , no musket ball \) and answer the students' questions these school events are a big part of our mission , said ty magliola , a 49yearold wading river resident a k a color sgt patrick collins we 're chartered under the new york state board of regents , so education is important to us the children , mostly fifth graders , seemed interested the firing demonstration was a chorus of questions can we shoot \? can we hold the gun \? can we have a bullet \? seeing stuff in books and computers ca n't replace the touchyfeely thing , said kevin o 'donnell , 50 , whose fifthgrade class was visiting from boyle road elementary in port jefferson station asked if he worried that the reenactment sent the wrong message at a time of concern over children s attitudes toward violence , mr o 'donnell said there s always that hesitation , but you ca n't ignore the history if they have a perspective on the impact of war , that it s not just a guy firing a gun but something that has an impact on his family , then it s not glorifying war friday was my education day too first , i was shown how to look right mr magliola , who had taken down my shoe , waist and jacket measurements , handed me a bundle and pointed to a tent to change in , and minutes later i emerged in attire that in 1863 would have been regarded as impeccable white cotton shirt cut in blousy period style , sky blue woolen trousers held up with suspenders , a navy blue sack coat with brass buttons and a traditional forage cap with a jaunty forward lean on my feet were thick woolen socks and dusty black brogans thinsoled , unsupportive , a little uncomfortable and thus very period completing the look were black leather belts holding cartridge box , percussion cap pouch and a bayonet in its scabbard , a haversack holding a tin plate and cup , eating utensils and a few other odds and ends , a canteen shaped like an oversized throat lozenge and the piece de resistance , a fully functioning reproduction of an 1861 springfield rifle
