morelia , mexico , jan 23 as fighting between peasant guerrillas and government troops dies down in the southern state of chiapas , the army is facing a growing chorus of accusations of torture , beatings and illegal arrests of suspected rebels from peasants , human rights investigators and others many reported cases have come to light only in recent days as investigators succeeded in entering the state prison and some villages that were isolated after the fighting broke out on jan 1 in this quiet village surrounded by cow pastures and pine woods , people tell a story that is similar in many details to dozens of reports echoing through the region on the morning of jan 7 , residents say , hundreds of soldiers swept through the modest shacks of the 183 families that live here , rounded up the men and forced them to lie face down on the local basketball court with their hands behind their heads while one soldier shouted that the town belonged to the rebel zapatista national liberation army , the villagers said , other troops took three men to the office adjoining the adobe church and tortured them , twisting their arms and dunking their heads into a pail of liquid the three men were taken away with 36 others who were arrested here that day , the residents say , and have not been seen since mexican and international rights groups say the villagers' account resembles many others they have investigated in recent days soldiers have been accused of detaining suspected guerrillas without due process , beating or torturing them and threatening their lives at least a handful of people captured by the army are also said to have disappeared the great majority of those jailed appear to have suffered torture , said morris tidballbinz , an investigator for amnesty international , who interviewed some of the 70 suspected rebels still held in the state prison these people do not need an amnesty , he said of the vote by congress last week to grant amnesty to rebels who laid down their arms they need access to proper trials , and most of them would be released investigation promised a spokesman for president carlos salinas de gortari , gabriel guerra castellanos , declined to comment specifically today on various reports of abuses by the army but he said all the cases , as well as the kidnappings and reported mistreatment of some civilians by the insurgents , would be investigated by the national commission on human rights , a government ombudsman agency that has reported receiving 138 complaints of disappearances , torture , homicide and other crimes the government of mexico is firm in its commitment to respect human rights , mr guerra said by telephone from mexico city abuses will not be tolerated mr guerra also said the government had willingly opened itself to scrutiny from abroad and while some rights advocates were less generous about the extent of official cooperation , none denied that the conflict had received an unusual amount of attention from mexican and foreign human rights organizations for the most part , the groups have focused less on abuses attributed to the zapatista rebels , which they described as far fewer in number among them are the rebels' abductions of civilians , including the former governor of chiapas , absalon castellanos dominguez , and the reported shooting of a physician in the town of ocosingo meeting may come soon although a ceasefire has generally held for the past 10 days and mr salinas s peace commissioner for chiapas , manuel camacho solis , seemed to hint on saturday that he might meet with the insurgents soon , he said today that peace efforts were running into the beginnings of a stalemate speaking in san cristobal de las casas , mr camacho insisted that a basic shift had nonetheless taken place in the government s response to the insurgency after moving initially to crush the zapatistas militarily , he said , the salinas administration had laid down a clear line of seeking a political settlement some human rights advocates and political critics have challenged the view that the administration has changed its approach they have also questioned to what extent the military has gone along with the shift the army , which retains a degree of independence within the government , was seen by many analysts to have been illprepared to fight the insurgency that appeared with the new year and that criticism has continued as the army has emerged as the most visible government authority in some parts of the chiapas countryside there is still a very serious situation because the regular authorities are not the ones who are detaining people , said the rev pablo ramo , the head of the human rights office that the roman catholic church operates in san cristobal the national human rights commission has taken on an important role in receiving complaints but there is a void in terms of the conduct of the usual authorities government officials have emphasized that the amnesty law cannot take effect until the fighting is over but they have offered little explanation why the army , which under a ceasefire called by the government is supposed to have ended its patrols , has continued to detain suspected rebels election fraud charged claims of inconsistency in the government line arose most recently in the chiapas town of oxchuc , where dozens of troops arrived about two hours after the lower house of the congress approved the amnesty in mexico city townspeople said the soldiers swarmed into an area in which the local opponents of mr salinas s institutional revolutionary party are concentrated oxchuc was one of a handful of municipalities in the state in which the vote for the party was unanimous in the last elections but opponents of the governing party , gathered in a group that calls itself the three knots civil association , say they were kept from the polls by threats and thrown rocks in a series of interviews during the first days of the zapatista rebellion , the town authorities in oxchuc accused members of the association of supporting the zapatista rebels and said they intended to root them out then on thursday , men and women who support the opposition group said , the troops surrounded their neighborhood and began searching house to house alicia lopez , 28 , said that her father , feliciano , 50 , and her brother , eliseo , 27 , were hauled away as the soldiers rifled through the family s dirtfloor shack and that she had not seen or heard from them since they say that some people participated with the zapatistas , but it is not true , said a 29yearold resident of oxchuc , juan santis referring to the governing party by its spanish acronym , he added , they have come after us because the town is divided and we are not with the pri part of a pattern human rights investigators said such incidents were part of a pattern in which government partisans in some longdivided towns and villages apparently told army soldiers that their local enemies were zapatista rebels and pushed for their prosecution in morelia , some 25 families who support the governing party moved away about a year ago after sometimes violent conflicts with other villagers a separate church and village hall built by the government supporters was destroyed , some of them said several people familiar with morelia s conflicts , speaking on the condition that they not be identified , said they believed that many of those who remained in the village supported the rebels photo alicia lopez , center , covering her

hartford , july 25 connecticut s death penalty law was upheld today by the state s highest court , ruling in the first murder case to come before it under the 14yearold law but when , or if , any execution will take place was far from clear because the court also insisted on strict compliance with a provision of the law that rules out execution if a jury finds any mitigating factor for the defendant advocates of capital punishment say that that provision of the law makes it almost impossible to execute anyone the court issued its landmark state ruling in the case of a man convicted in 1987 of the stranglings of four teenage girls in three episodes the court , in a 4to1 decision written by chief justice ellen a peters , strongly rejected defense lawyers' challenges to the law s constitutionality , declaring that it embodied all safeguards against arbitrary and capricious executions required by the united states supreme court but even in upholding the death penalty , they delayed any execution in this case by ordering a new sentencing hearing for the defendant they did so , they said , because the judge did not strictly comply with the most exacting of the law s safeguards , a provision that rules out execution if a jury finds any mitigating factor for the defendant , like emotional duress or mental incapacity court cites errors by trial judge in the case decided today , 34yearold michael ross had pleaded insanity as his defense in the stranglings of the girls in 1983 and 1984 the jury rejected that defense but the supreme court ruled that the trial judge then made several errors in the penalty hearing that improperly limited mr ross s argument that his mental impairment , caused by growing up in a dysfunctional family , was a mitigating factor advocates of the death penalty in connecticut , as in other states including like new jersey , have argued heatedly that putting what they say is undue emphasis on mitigating factors favoring murderers undermines the law , making executions almost impossible to carry out new jersey , connecticut and new hampshire are the only northeastern states among the 37 nationwide that have adopted new capitalpunishment laws since the united states supreme court struck down the death penalty in 1972 as being arbitrary and capricious none of the three northeastern states have executed anyone under the new laws proponents of abolishing the death penalty have claimed we have a workable death penalty , because if you look at death row we always have four or five people there , said state representative william l wollenberg , a republican from farmington who believes connecticut s law is too restrictive i cannot think of an instance , he said , where a reviewing court would not find mitigation so mitigation precludes the death penalty connecticut s law , like those in many other states , requires juries to find an aggravating factor in the commission of a murder in order to apply the death penalty in the case decided today , mr ross had admitted raping three of the girls before making them lie on their stomachs and then strangling them with his hands he kidnapped two of them , taking them into rhode island to kill them those circumstances , the court declared , clearly amounted to crimes committed in an especially heinous , cruel or depraved manner , as the law defines one aggravating factor but connecticut s law is more restrictive than those in many other states because it rules out the death penalty if the jury finds any mitigating factor , like a defendant s youth or mental state , no matter how severe the aggravating factors mr ross s defense was insanity , which the jury rejected in convicting him of four murder charges and two kidnapping charges but in the sentencing phase of the case , he again presented evidence of mental impairment as a mitigating factor exclusion of report is cited the jury again rejected that evidence and called for the death sentence , but the court today said the trial judge had erred in not allowing the jury to hear testimony on a psychiatrist s report that the defense had not been permitted to admit as evidence during the trial the rules of evidence , the supreme court said , do not apply when a person s life is at stake all evidence should be heard the court said the judge also erred by instructing the jury that it could draw an inference unfavorable to mr ross from the fact that his parents did not testify on his behalf during the penalty hearing mr ross blamed his parents for his emotional problems , the court noted , and they were cooperating with the prosecution the court also said that the judge erred in instructing the jury that it must be unanimous in finding a mitigating factor again , in a lifeordeath situation , the court said , each juror must be persuaded that there is some mitigating factor , but they do not all have to agree on the same one standards of human decency the court s majority strongly stated that the death penalty is not cruel and unusual punishment under connecticut s constitution the question is not whether any one of us would vote to enact a death penalty if our role were that of a legislator , chief justice peters wrote it is whether the death penalty is so cruel and lacking in moral justification that it is fundamentally offensive to evolving standards of human decency while we should not blindly follow a beaten path , she wrote , we agree with the new jersey supreme court s cogent observation 'when , in the course of a decade , 37 states call for the death penalty , the probability that the legislature of each state accurately reflects its community s standards approaches certainty' the supreme court , however , also appeared to raise a high bar for legislators who want to expand the law so that the death penalty can be applied in more cases

a chance he created the position for mr nazario five months ago in the hope that a gang member would have some clout with the youths who have claimed public housing as their drug turf look , mr wardlaw said , if the gangs control the youths , then we 've got to find a way to talk them into delivering a different message like any city where gangs have run rampant , connecticut s capital has taken a beating in the last few years gang members have clogged the streets with guns and drugs , killed and wounded innocent victims and scared off longterm residents and businesses if nothing else , putting a member of los solidos on the public payroll demonstrates that there is no shortage of ways hartford is trying to cope with the gang problem the city is virtually a laboratory for methods of quelling gang violence in los angeles , the crips and the bloods have hammered out a truce in the south bronx , the authorities have used federal racketeering laws to clear a gang off the streets

he s locked up christopher morano , who is the supervisor of the statewide gang prosecution unit in the chief state s attorney s office , said police videotapes have helped his office when witnesses were lost to gang intimidation we were losing or dropping a third of our cases because gangs have either threatened or bought off witnesses , mr morano said in august , he was able to use state racketeering laws in the arrest of 14 members of the 20 love gang who were videotaped selling drugs outside the stowe village projects gang members are arrested every day , usually for breach of peace , a misdemeanor the hope , say officers , is that constant police attention will root out gangs from their streetcorner drug spots the hartford police department spent a record 45 million in overtime in the last fiscal year , compared to less than 2 million the year before much of it went to controlling gangs , said hartford s police chief , joseph f croughwell jr two police substations have recently opened in gang neighborhoods a joint federal , state and local task force was organized in february to focus on los solidos , which had gained control of most of the city s drug business it used wiretaps on gang members' phones , monitored calls made by one of the gang s leaders from a federal prison in florence , colo , and set up a surveillance headquarters disguised as a business near frog hollow , los solidos s neighborhood in october , the task force arrested 17 members of los solidos \( also known as the solids \) in a dawn raid that involved 128 officers divided into 20 squads

landover , md , may 5 one of these weeks , some team is probably going to give the rangers a good series or , perhaps , one of these nights , some team might give the rangers a close game but it was n't the washington capitals , not this game , not this night , not this series , not this week after taking an early lead on two goals from their rejuvenated power play , the rangers coasted to a 30 victory tonight at the usair arena , taking a 3gamesto0 lead in the second round of the stanley cup playoffs how embarrassing was it for washington \? consider the altercation between keith jones of the capitals and esa tikkanen of the rangers , two rough , tough , gritty players trying to inspire his team , jones played a mean game , bumping , hacking and slashing whenever possible , taking three minor penalties after one confrontation , tikkanen got close to jones he got in his face , boy , did he ever and then tikkanen , well , he , yes , he , uh , why he kissed him that s what he did he kissed him right on the nose and there is no penalty , minor or major , for that he s trying to be a tough guy , trying to stir the pot , tikkanen said of jones we 've got to turn around and skate away shoot , nowadays , if you want to see a good fight , you 've got to watch the national basketball association playoffs or maybe a major league baseball game it was the seventh consecutive postseason victory for the rangers , who swept the islanders in the first round game 4 of these eastern conference semifinals will be here on saturday night brian leetch , mark messier and steve larmer scored for the rangers before 17 , 952 , who began to file out in large numbers midway through the third period mike richter , the ranger goalie , stopped 21 shots to earn his third shutout of the postseason the capitals , who upset pittsburgh in the first round , are reeling , partly from injuries joining the list tonight was peter bondra , who went out with a bruised left shoulder suffered when he was trying to check aleksei kovalev along the boards kovalev refused to be checked and threw bondra into the boards with one arm while controlling the puck with the other bondra joined michal pivonka and calle johansson on the bench we 're wounded , said capitals coach jim schoenfeld , we 're bleeding but we 're not dead yet earlier in the day , pivonka had piqued the interest of the rangers by being quoted in the washington times as having said that the veteran rangers could be beaten he predicted the capitals would win both games he said most of the rangers are names from the past , past their times craig mactavish , 35 years old , agreed with part of this we are old , he said that s right there s no doubt about that but you do n't throw your birth certificates out there and the youngest team wins richter is now one short of the team shutout record for the playoffs with four , held by davey kerr , in the tworound tournament of 1937 late last month , richter opened the playoffs with consecutive 60 shutouts over the islanders richter preserved the shutout in the third period by stopping two closein chances from dave poulin of all seven ranger victories , none has been by a margin of fewer than three goals help from unexpected sources coming into the game , the rangers had gone only 1 for 11 with the man advantage for the series , but they increased that percentage quickly at 4 minutes 35 seconds of the first period , leetch was credited with a goal that went in off the skate of sylvain cote , the washington defenseman the goal was recorded as unassisted , although messier , brian noonan and adam graves all helped shape the play in the washington zone messier got the next one , making the score 20 at 13 57 , after goalie don beaupre misplayed the puck behind his own net first , leetch took possession , and shoved it to messier , who stuffed it inside the post from the side before cote could come to beaupre s rescue in the crease beaupre had missed game 2 with a sore groin the rangers got the last goal at 6 06 of the second period when larmer took kovalev s long , righttoleft pass and popped the puck past beaupre kovalev trails leetch , 12 points to 11 , for the team scoring lead in the postseason although less flashy than he was at times during the regular season and certainly more disciplined , kovalev has been deadly effective in the first two rounds , creating chances for both himself and his teammates and showing few defensive liabilities nothing for juneau on the washington side , joe juneau , the capitals' flashy center , again had no points and is without even an assist in three games he had no shots on goal for the second consecutive game , and was moved to the wing alongside dale hunter it did n't help the rangers bashed juneau whenever possible , and he needed about a minute to get up on shaky legs after noonan and jeff beukeboom smacked into him at the same time it s tough , juneau said , but you ca n't cry over it it s very frustrating kevin hatcher , washington s star defenseman , had one shot on goal and has only one goal and no assists in the series photo rangers' aleksei kovalev flying in front of capitals goalie don beaupre as dimitri khristich helps defend the net during the first period \( michael geissinger for the new york times \)
washington , april 4 the supreme court ruled today that states may not impose extra fees for dumping waste from another state the 7to2 decision overturned an oregon surcharge on the disposal of solid waste generated beyond oregon s borders under the 1989 law , the fee for placing outofstate waste in an oregon landfill is 310 a ton , as against 85 cents for waste generated within oregon the oregon supreme court upheld the surcharge last year the ruling today was the latest of several supreme court decisions to reject protectionist efforts by a growing number of states to restrict the flow of trash and hazardous waste the decision , written by associate justice clarence thomas , was based on the constitution s commerce clause , which prohibits the states from erecting economic barriers against interstate commerce handling costs cited discrimination simply means differential treatment of instate and outofstate economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter , justice thomas said if a restriction on commerce is discriminatory , it is virtually per se invalid the decision , oregon waste systems v department of environmental qualify , no 9370 , left open the prospect that a state could justify a surcharge if the costs of handling outofstate waste were actually higher but the possibility of a successful defense appeared remote oregon tried to provide an economic justification for the surcharge , calling it a compensatory tax intended to force shippers of outofstate waste to pay their fair share of costs that instate shippers pay through the state income tax and other taxes the court rejected this explanation justice thomas noted in his opinion that the state had neither explained how it set the surcharge at 225 per ton nor claimed that the instate shippers pay the equivalent of the surcharge through their general taxes the majority opinion was joined by associate justices john paul stevens , sandra day o'connor , antonin scalia , anthony m kennedy , david h souter and ruth bader ginsburg chief justice william h rehnquist dissented in an opinion that associate justice harry a blackmun also signed rehnquist applauds oregon chief justice rehnquist said oregon should be applauded for taking a comprehensive approach to its solidwaste disposal problem the court today leaves states with only two options , the opinion said become a dumper and ship as much waste as possible to a less populated state , or become a dumpee , and stoically accept waste from more densely populated states i see nothing in the commerce clause that compels less densely populated states to serve as the lowcost dumping grounds for their neighbors , the chief justice concluded according to a brief filed by the national solid wastes management association , an industry group , most states both import some waste and export some of the 420 million tons of solid and hazardous waste generated each year , some 20 million tons move across state lines for disposal fourteen states filed a brief telling the court that they had adopted policies similar to oregon s or were considering doing so according to this brief , 18 states none in the new york metropolitan area currently restrict the movement of solid or hazardous waste across state or county lines cases dealing with waste disposal have become staples of the supreme court s docket , reflecting the economic and political stakes that are now attached to the issue the court is expected to rule shortly in two other cases one , c a carbone v clarkstown , ny , no 921402 , reflects the fact that waste can be an economic asset as well as a burden challenge to ordinance the case is a challenge brought under the commerce clause to an ordinance that requires all trash generated in the town to be taken to a designated facility for sorting rather than shipped elsewhere the other case , chicago v environmental defense fund , no 921639 , involves federal regulation of the ash created from municipal waste in an incinerator designed to produce steam there were also these developments at the court today airline suits the high court agreed to review a ruling by the illinois supreme court that permitted members of the american airlines frequent flyer program to sue the airline for consumer fraud for imposing new conditions on accumulating mileage credits for free flights american airlines appealed the ruling with the support of other commercial airlines , several of which are facing similar lawsuits the question for the court is whether consumer suits of this sort can be brought under state law , or whether all such suits are preempted by a federal law , the airline deregulaton act of 1978 , which governs all regulations relating to rates , routes , or services of any air carrier the supreme court in the past has interpreted the federal law broadly to displace state regulation the justices ruled two years ago , in morales v twa , that states could not regulate deceptive advertising of airfares but earlier this year , the court declined to review a federal appeals court ruling that permitted an airline passenger who had been bumped from an overbooked flight to sue for damages under state law

bill risked the retribution of the gun lobby , but in fielding all the phone calls , his staff drew the conclusion that the muscle of the national rifle association often seemed far removed from the concerns of his constituents calls did pour in from other parts of the state mrs szeibl s office here in the 38th district received 781 of them in three days , most of them heatedly against the ban most of the threats are , 'go find another job , dear , ' mrs szeibl said they say 'he 'd better watch out when he comes into the district we 're all coming down and make sure that he does n't get reelected he s not going to get any money from the republican party' the congressman recounted in an interview today one person said , 'i'm 83 years old and i'm going to go into every precinct in your constituency and campaign against you' that s what a lot of my colleagues are afraid of what makes the national rifle association threats more frightening , he said , is that the group may attack a candidate not simply on gun control issues , but also on issues of more immediate concern to most voters but the callers from within this ethnically and economically diverse , mostly democratic district , where rising crime has become an obsession , were 80 percent in support of the ban , mrs szeibl said and when mr horn returned home for the weekend for informal meetings with constituents , the issue was hardly raised at the home of john simons , a hungarian immigrant who is a retired machinist , the congressman stood by the fireplace and fielded questions from about 20 people on health care , the deficit , budgetary controls , crime , the recession , military base conversion and illegal aliens mr horn , who was president of california state university at long beach for 18 years before entering politics , answered with the careful precision of a professor no one asked about vote afterward , marsha moode , a guest who has a political affairs program on a local cable television channel , said i think it s fascinating that they just took the vote on guns and no one in this room has asked about it anyone who says a word against the vote almost seems to be advocating violence in the streets we are talking california politics here californians feel such a terrible sense of crime everyone s putting a double lock on their doors when i parked my car outside here , i looked around to see that everything was all right another guest , bob collins , a retired machinist , said he owned several rifles and shotguns and enjoyed trap shooting i believe in the right to keep 'em and bear 'em and this and that , but not the assault weapons , said mr collins , who said that as a retiree he could no longer afford his membership in the national rifle association the only guest who approached the congressman on the issue was harry kemmerer , a retired engineer i thanked him for his vote , he said later mr horn s second visit was to the home of patrick g o'healy , a commercial real estate developer , in an affluent , gated community where guests could wander between the swimming pool and the table of hors d'oeuvres none of the people here , mostly republicans , seemed unduly concerned over the congressman s vote on assault weapons the host , mr o'healy , was a case in point right after the riot i bought a little teeny gun , a beretta 22caliber pistol , kind of like a selfprotection gun , he said i 've never used it i 've never even carried it it s still in its original grease i'm not sure i would have the ability to shoot somebody it s the rambo fantasy then , he led a reporter up the carpeted stairs to his comfortable bedroom , where he took from their hiding place two other loaded pistols , a 357 magnum and a glock ninemillimeter i'm not sure why i really bought them , he said , feeling their heft in his hand and laying them gently on his fourposter bed quite frankly , i think this country would do well to eliminate all handguns , he said if it were n't for the fear of someone coming in with a handgun , if it were n't for the protection , i would never have bought a pistol looking back at the week , mrs szeibl talked of her strategy for handling the passionate phone calls it is so emotional for these individuals , mrs szeibl said , that if we contradict them in any way it only inflames them we let them vent their emotion and their anger many from out of the area were upset that they would not have their guns to shoot in the desert and in the woods i asked them , 'but what do you shoot at \? ' they said , 'we shoot at trees' i said , 'why \? ' photo the offices of representative steve horn , republican of california , received hundreds of calls , pro and con , before last week s house vote to ban some assault weapons but when he returned to his district to meet with constituents , as he did in a home in downey , the subject hardly came up \( ed carreon for the new york times \)
the murderous teenager who is the title character of charles fuller s zooman and the sign is , on his own harrowingly skewed terms , a thorough egalitarian in the stunning monologue that begins the 1980 play , which has been revived at the second stage theater , this innercity philadelphia youth seems to cast an eye of combustible contempt over anyone who crosses his line of vision he knifed an ole jive west indian at a subway stop , he tells us , because the man was swinging his arms as if he owned the platform he is glad , he says , that his aged aunt s social security check was stolen by junkies old people in general , all bent over and twisted up , skin hanging off their faces , make him sick as for the girl he accidentally killed that day in a shooting that is the mainspring of the play s plot , it was entirely her fault the little bitch , as he puts it , had no business sitting on her front steps in the middle of what everyone knows is a war zone as portrayed by larry gilliard jr , in a smart , bravura performance that makes no apologies for his character , zooman is a marvel of disaffection he punctuates his frightening pronouncements with a mechanical , joyless whinny of a laugh , and his eyes rove the audience with a dead , everdefensive gaze he s a morally anesthetized punk , a spiritual cousin of the futurist hoodlums of a clockwork orange who nonetheless belongs , all too familiarly , to the america of today mr fuller s take on the phenomenon this character represents still seems remarkable in its nonjudgmental clearsightedness and intelligence zooman remains a play with problems , and seret scott s straightforward production , while admirable in its nonsensationalist restraint , does n't succeed in disguising them the drama lacks the taut narrative drive and fullbodied characterizations of a soldier s story , the 1981 work for which the author won a pulitzer prize but its searing presentation of the logic of a world in which people on both sides of the law become dehumanizingly interchangeable continues to demand attention zooman animates a moral argument in rich and uncompromisingly complex ways that avoid reductionist explanations and consoling solutions the play shifts between zooman s selfjustifying monologues and scenes that show the family of jinny tate , the 12yearold girl the youth killed , dealing with the effects of the crime there is grief , of course , but also righteous indignation when they realize that while many of their neighbors must have witnessed the killing , none will admit it the tates deal with this realization in resonantly different ways jinny s mother , rachel \( oni faida lampley \) , numbed by pain and disgust , wants only to leave the neighborhood her 14yearold son , victor \( alex bess in an affectingly understated performance \) , gets a gun from a friend jinny s father , reuben \( tony todd \) , a bus driver and former prize fighter , puts up a sign that says , the killers of our daughter jinny are free on the streets because our neighbors will not identify them this in turn sets off a chain of events , including nasty harassment of the family , that becomes a study in social pathology the play s most remarkable achievement is that zooman makes a certain warped sense his undiscriminating hostility reflects an environment that perceives him as faceless , a readymade scapegoat every time somebody black did something and the cops did n't have a name , they busted me ! he says the arbitrarily brutal life he knows is for him part of a given system with its own set of rules even more disturbing is the fact that most of the tates' neighbors seem to accept those rules as well as rachel observes no one buried in the graveyard can read their own inscription and this neighborhood is dead and throughout the drama , there is a sense of people acting blindly with misbegotten results zooman , aiming at a gangland enemy , shoots a girl he has never met the tates accuse the wrong neighbor of withholding evidence and zooman s final undoing involves his being mistaken for someone else mr fuller charts this futile pattern compellingly and persuasively the domestic drama of the tates is less convincing a subplot about tension in the marriage and its effect on the children seems perfunctory and patly sentimental and ms scott , while keeping themes in sturdy focus , is less sure in building the play emotionally , and its climax is curiously flat the actors , who include stephen m henderson and saundra mcclain in deftly shaped turns as visiting relatives , are all solid mr todd , a towering man who wears his size with appealing awkwardness , is considerably more his reuben is a giant of confused sorrow , loaded with the potential for violence , and his suppressed explosiveness is the perfect foil for mr gilliard s casually worn destructiveness the current theater season , with its revivals of such recent works as wendy wasserstein s uncommon women and others \( also at the second stage \) and michael cristofer s shadow box , has demonstrated that topical plays can date quickly zooman , however , remains a bracing and unfortunately relevant piece of theater zooman and the sig by charles fuller directed by seret scott sets by marjorie bradley kellogg costumes by karen perry lighting by michael gilliam sound by janet kalas production stage manager , eliseann konstantin stage manager , elaine bayless associate producer , carol fishman presented by the second stage theater , carole rothman , artistic director suzanne schwartz davidson , producing director at 2162 broadway , at 76th street , manhattan with larry gilliard jr \( zooman \) , oni faida lampley \( rachel tate \) , tony todd \( reuben tate \) , stephen m henderson \( emmett tate \) , alex bess \( victor tate \) , willie stiggers jr \( russell adams \) , ed wheeler \( donald jackson \) , saundra mcclain \( ash boswell \) and kim bey \( grace georges \) photo oni faida lampley , left , tony todd and saundra mcclain play members of a bereaved family \( susan cook zooman and the sign \)

new rochelle davids island , once an active army post guarding new york from attack by sea , now sits abandoned off the coastline here considered by many to be prime real estate not used since world war i , the 120acre site on long island sound periodically catches the fancy of developers , who see highrise dwellings there , and city fathers , who would like the property to generate revenue for new rochelle s declining tax base but to date no proposal for the island s future has made it past the planning stage two years ago , environmentalists' concerns and debate over construction of a 3 , 500foot bridge linking the island to this city , among other things , caused a 1 billion condominium proposal to founder the question of what to do with davids island has again come before mayor timothy c idoni and the city council this summer , with the introduction of three new proposals for its use one of the latest proposals is from the developer donald trump , who is considering building up to 2 , 500 housing units on the former fort slocum army post his initial offer to the city for the property was 10 million something to support the city' but the county executive , andrew p o'rourke , also wants the island , and he recently proposed converting it to a waterfront park , linked to onshore communities by ferry under the county plan announced in june , most of the 125 abandoned buildings on the uninhabited island would be razed to make way for bicycle paths , hiking trails , ballfields and a children s playground mayor idoni , however , drafted a letter last week to mr o'rourke , saying that those plans were on hold we 're looking for something to support the city of new rochelle , he said , explaining that the county plan would not generate revenue under the proposal by xanadu properties associates that was defeated two years ago , a 1 , 500unit highrise condominium complex , along with the bridge , an 800boat marina and a fourpad heliport would have produced about 22 million in tax revenues a year , said jean miller , project manager director with new rochelle s department of development of that , 30 percent would have gone to the city , 53 percent to the local school district and 17 percent to the county the city initially had high hopes for xanadu s plans but eventually tabled the proposal after realizing that it would not meet state and county requirements the proposed bridge , especially , was expected to meet heavy opposition from both the county board of legislators and albany , primarily because of the added traffic many ideas , no deals mr o'rourke , in announcing his plan , said over the last 12 years , this island has been the center of many commercial proposals , none of which have come to fruition our proposal today is for a park that will not disturb the fragile ecosystem of the sound and will forever preserve this island for the people of new rochelle and all of westchester the county plan includes a 300foot public beach on davids island , six picnic sites , a great lawn and parade grounds , and a 37mile paved path along the island s perimeter , with scenic overlooks along the route the purchase price was not determined , but the initial development costs were expected to be 85 million the third plan to come before new rochelle planners in recent months is for a recreational park including a golf range , earthscience park , children s park and two museums the developers for that plan , the davids island development company of brewster , have not estimated the cost of the project mr idoni said he questioned how the project would be financed and whether it would generate enough money for the city mr trump , in discussing his plans , said last week that he wanted to build a very spectacular development and avoid the mistakes the previous developer made he specifically cited xanadu s plans for a bridge connecting the island to the mainland , saying that ferry service might be a better alternative but he stopped short of saying his organization was proceeding , adding only that he would possibly become involved meanwhile , stephen p tenore , chairman of the board of legislators and the lawmaker representing new rochelle , suggested what he called a positive solution , whereby mayor idoni and the city council incorporate both the county s and mr trump s plans to develop the property it would behoove the county to acquire at least part of the island for open space , mr tenore said
washington , may 11 for decades , american officials have done everything but backflips to avoid even making eye contact with fidel castro on the rare occasions when diplomatic duty lands them in the same room but who was that bearded man next to mike espy , the agriculture secretary , in south africa this week \? it was mr castro himself , and it left aides to mr clinton none too pleased about mr espy s kodak moment hillary rodham clinton , who like mr espy was part of the official united states delegation to nelson mandela s inauguration , knew enough to stay on the other side of the room from the cuban leader so too did vice president gore , who led the contingent honoring south africa s new president but mr espy , who has spoken sympathetically in the past of mr mandela s affection for mr castro , had no such qualms and his choice of company at a reception in the presidency building has left clinton administration officials agog at the apparent cozying up to the cuban leader so far , the photograph has not turned up in the press , but the picturetaking was witnessed by reporters at the reception
greenwich , conn at a time when most smaller hospitals are seeking to hitch up with larger medical centers to steer them through the turbulent waters of health care overhaul , administrators at greenwich hospital remain determined to pilot their own ship thumbing its nose at health economists who predict the demise of small , independent hospitals , greenwich is in the middle of a 60 million fundraising campaign to build new clinic space and a 180bed building spurning the common belief that small hospitals cannot dispense good , costeffective specialty care , it opened a comprehensive cancer center last year in this wealthy suburb , just a 40minute train ride from one of the world s cancer giants , memorial sloankettering cancer center in manhattan spurning the suitors though it has received offers of affiliation from topranked hospitals from new haven to new york , greenwich has rejected them , a decision that in time may prove either genius or folly although the move is a gamble , some healthpolicy experts say that the future could hold a place for highquality local hospitals willing and financially able to change their ways to deliver costeffective care to be successful , they said , these hospitals will have to carve out a niche for themselves , as greenwich is trying to do by focusing on developing pleasant , efficient outpatient clinics having affluent patients will certainly help in the transformation to the extent that people are willing to pay and maintain loyalty , there may be some that can sustain their independence , said sylvia boeder , director of communitybased services at the american hospital association she noted that president clinton s health care proposal gives patients the right to choose any doctor , although they may have to pay extra to exercise that right to date , she said , many small hospitals that had tried to make it on their own have already been forced to affiliate with larger medical centers or networks , but none has made the investment that greenwich has been able to make no ordinary little town greenwich is no ordinary little town , of course , and greenwich hospital no ordinary little hospital its patients have included glenn close , diana ross and fay vincent its coffee shop has tablecloths , and candy stripers still roam the halls and when greenwich hospital asks for donations , they arrive not in tens of dollars but in millions outside nearly every room in the institution is a brass plaque bearing the name of the person whose money built it that , in part , is the key to the institution s boldness the residents of greenwich want the best in their own backyard , and are able to buy it when the hospital opened its cancer center in 1992 , donations enabled it to get the best radiation equipment and to hire away a radiologist from sloankettering but in an age of fundamental changes in health care , the hospital s administrators know that philanthropy alone will not sustain it donations can build new clinics , but the hospital s patients still pay for medical care with insurance changing health insurance even in this privileged corner of southeastern connecticut , the structure of health insurance is changing a small but rapidly increasing number of patients at greenwich hospital belong to managedcare plans , and the traditional insurers that cover the bulk of the town s citizens are demanding that hospitals deliver more costeffective care what is more , the breadandbutter procedures that have long sustained community hospitals , like appendectomies and childbirth , are increasingly being done on an outpatient basis or with overnight stays , leaving beds at small hospitals like greenwich largely empty so greenwich hospital is relying on its 60 million plan to reinvent itself as a community hospital for the 21st century we 've been very aggressive because we realize this facility wo n't survive unless it rebuilds , said frank a corvino , president and chief executive of the hospital a community hospital will never be able to compete in the year 2000 with a facility like our current hospital , which was designed for medical care as it was delivered in '51 in those days there was no such thing as sameday surgery and when patients came into the hospital they stayed for 7 to 10 days , mr corvino continued so if you could n't get their xray done at 4 , it would get done at 8 , and if the physical therapy could n't get done today , you could do it tomorrow sometimes , smaller is better indeed , small suburban hospitals may have some advantages in trying to keep costs down and maintain a balanced budget they do not have the overhead costs associated withhighly specialized procedures , and virtually all of their patients have insurance outwardly , greenwich hospital displays many signs of a hospital that has outlived its time the outdated building leaks , and although it is licensed for nearly 300 beds , usually less than half are full on a recent afternoon , most of the plush rooms on the sixthfloor orthopedics wing were empty , the spectacular views of long island sound going to waste
pink and yellow and each of the fullest intensity of their hue as i sat on the sofa with enez whipple , the bright pink of her sweater was echoed by the pale pink of the tulips on the coffee table before us against the white walls , and the chairs and the sofas that i would remember as white , came yellow pillows and little yellow details it was the time of the yellow outside through the large windows of this east hampton house built around an old water tower , came the vista of yellows of daffodils , daisies , birds singing outside on a table in the dining room , a distance away but connected in the wide open space , there were white china fruits , and somehow , in my memory although whether or not they were really there , i do n't know i add white china flowers there were none of the paintings of the abstract expressionists on the expansive white walls , nor the photographs of the many trail blazers first showings of the photographs , for example , of the interior of the last office of freud , nor echoes of hans namuth or dorothy norman or arnold genthe , the people whom enez whipple had repeatedly granted a safe space to show in their earlier , more volatile days , during her 40year stint as director of east hampton s guild hall even the new glossy print book , just out , that enez whipple had put together to tell the story , guild hall of east hampton , an adventure in the arts , was absent from that friendly white and pink and yellow living room in the last 10 years , since enez whipple s retirement , guild hall has had four different directors , a fact not surprising considering the tensions and the complex meshings of conflicting agendas that has always marked this community , where repeatedly artists in all areas have come for the particular quality of the light what was it about enez whipple that had allowed her to hold the position as coordinator of it all , creating , well before such a thing was in fashion , a home for interrelating the arts \? 'temple as a museum' it was the original vision of a museum as a temple that you went to be educated in you went to the theater , and during the intermission you went into the garden and saw outdoor sculpture in the 30 s , when guild hall was founded , only 29 percent of museums engaged in performing arts programs , so that by luck we were pioneers in the total art experience , she said with the modesty and simplicity that would be characteristic of her talking about her career , even as i asked her what about her had allowed her to take on that role enez whipple landed in guild hall more or less by accident she came from a little upstate town about 15 miles from syracuse , where she would eventually attend the university , a student in theater arts there on the front porch she did the usual things every child does , putting on little plays with the other children who felt the way i did , mostly farmer s children and children of the paper mill , undertakers' chairs and all the rest her mother , who had gone to syracuse university before her , had trained to be an opera singer , but she had to give it up because of a disease of the vocal chords her father , a rather stormy soul , was an inventor like her mother before her , her first interest was in music she was a piano student from an early age , although she did n't have what it took to be a concert pianist , she said without any particular sadness still , i had a great love for it ironically , in the beginning she did n't have any particular interest in the visual arts i just did n't think of it but in college , her friends all were in the school of fine arts , she said there she was to develop the particular gift of coming to an understanding of new areas of art purely through friendships , that was to deeply mark her subsequent career there she continued to study the piano since theater was my second love , and i did n't particularly want to teach , i started to do master s work in directing and theater arts tie to cultural center guild hall opened in 1931 enez whipple came to east hampton 10 years later the era of the grand old summer colony was in its last radiance , already a bit tattered and becoming forlorn , when enez whipple first arrived in the hamptons with her new husband , whip , a cartoonist who was on guild hall s summer board of directors when i saw the rollins dance studio rehearsing a scene out of 'a midsummer night s dream' in the garden , drifting around the courtyard in their long dresses , i felt i had never seen anything like it , that it was all a kind of enchantment , she recalled it was the end of the era of the great estate , and i was very glad to have been able to experience it she worked informally at first , assisting her husband who was really too busy to do very much for guild hall , until gradually the job became hers , until gradually , after three years , she became first , summer director , and then , at first unofficially , and later officially , the yearround director as well as enez recapitulates the first wonderment of that long ago rehearsal on the grass , the surprise of those long floating dresses and the fairy tale quality of it all , even now , more than 50 years later , and with her four decadeslong history of involvement behind her , one feels more the quality of that first childlike fascination , rather than the sense that it is she who has actually made a mark which came first \?
a private gathering of irishmen last week at an upstairs room of a second avenue pub in manhattan had all the melodramatic stealth that long has hobbled the image of ireland s struggle for peace and unity all that were missing were the trench coats , said representative peter t king , a nassau county republican and a fervid irishamerican who has taken heat from editorial writers , voters and the state department for a decade of visits to belfast in open support of the guerrilla fight of the irish republican army but as mr king trudged up the stairs of the american pub he was clearly entering a new phase of the longrunning agony over ireland s civil strife an openended ira ceasefire was under way , sure as the rising of the moon wednesday night , and joe cahill , the 74yearold patriarch and hardliner in the ira guerilla war , stood before the gathering of 20 important irishamerican leaders the very next day newly permitted back on american soil , with all standing complaints of terrorism seemingly expunged , mr cahill was on a pub mission that was as critical in itself as all the previous 20 years of hitandrun provo operations in behalf of northern ireland s embattled minority of catholics and nationalists we 're standing on the same platform , mr cahill kept emphasizing to the irishamericans listening in the pub he had come specifically to assure the leaders of the irish diaspora that the rare irish quality of strategic harmony was at hand , that the ira command was unified back in belfast in the commitment to put aside the gun and trust a peace talk initiative with london and dublin the mission of joe cahill , hardly known as a man of words , was to convince the crucial american element in the tricorner dynamics of the irish troubles that this time there was none of the internal bickering in the republican movement s leadership that had produced a sorry history of renunciation , assassination and fractured civil warrings over ireland s independence this time , as before , the influential , affluent irish supporters on this shore would be riven or not , enthusiastic or not , to the extent that they grasped the hierarchical politics within the struggle back in belfast and derry we 're standing on the same platform , joe cahill kept insisting to the irishamerican leaders , saying that this time was different , that the old pattern of intramural treacheries was at an end cahill has a bad heart and is worn out from this fight , said mr king but he knew he was sent to convince the hardest of the hardliners over here and he spoke loud and clear for 10 minutes to these guys lawyers , businessmen in their 30 s and 40 s and he was able to address them in a language they understood the irish voice , published in new york by niall o 'dowd , an irish immigrant who was a principal in arranging the tricky , still frail ceasefire , has underlined that what is different in this inititiative , one of many across centuries , is the placing of nationalist ireland and irish america on the one page and singing from the same song book mr king , a prominent militant , spoke separately for 90 minutes with mr cahill and now vouches heartily from the same page of that song book cahill was not brought along reluctantly , said the congressman , who needed to hear the old warrior bless talk with the british he s a strong supporter of the peace process equally amazing as this message might be to militant followers of ireland s bloodsoaked politics , representative king , who is a domestic hardliner , too , from the republican party s reaganbush wing , is praising president clinton at least as much as joe cahill for the slender opportunity that has arisen against all odds clinton s decision to grant a visa to gerry adams was the most significant act any modern president has ever taken in regard to ireland , said mr king , speaking of the controversial policy reversal that saw mr adams , the ira s political leader , finally admitted to new york in february to speak here of his cause do n't try to tell mr king that bill clinton , who made 1992 campaign commitments to northern ireland peace , is a foreign policy waffler as president he sent shock waves through the british , said the congressman he treated adams as a legitimate player give clinton a hell of a lot of credit for what has happened neither mr king nor any one else knows how far the proclaimed ceasefire might advance against the formidable history of violence in the sectarian , whipsaw muddle of the irish troubles but decades of irrational killing have suddenly been given pause for articulation , and as tough an irishman as joe cahill has come over to endorse the talking
the justice department has found that new york city and the city s board of education discriminated against members of minority groups in recruiting and promoting the custodians who maintain the city s schools in letters sent to city officials and the lawyer for the custodians' union this week , deval l patrick , assistant attorney general in the civil rights division , called on the city , the board and the custodians' union to reach an outofcourt agreement to remedy the discrimination or face court action the justice department said that the city had been using written examinations for custodians that had not been demonstrated to be jobrelated but that had an adverse impact on black and hispanic test takers it also found a substantial disparity between the numbers of black , hispanic and asian job seekers hired as custodians compared with their availability in the metropolitan labor force mr patrick said in his letter that any settlement should compensate the victims of discrimination and bar future bias in addition , the city and the board of education would be asked to design a recruitment program to attract black , hispanic and asian candidates for custodian jobs accord was hailed the justice department made no public announcement of its findings , but copies of the department s letter were made available to reporters yesterday by the giuliani administration , the board of education , the custodians' union and the black and hispanic caucus of the city council a justice department official familiar with the case said she could not comment on it , and other department officials could not be reached last night to provide further details on the federal inquiry or explain how it originated the black and hispanic caucus called the discrimination outrageous yesterday and urged the board of education to move to immediately remedy this disgraceful state of affairs paul a crotty , the city s corporation counsel , declined comment on the finding , saying he had not finished discussions with the city personnel department and the board of education on how to proceed but the findings , resulting from a roughly twoyear investigation , came amid a growing dispute among the giuliani administration , the school custodians' union and the board of education over a tentative contract agreement between the board and the union , which the mayor has rejected although the timing of the justice department s findings was not related to the dispute , all sides immediately tried to use the findings to bolster their cases schools chancellor ramon c cortines had called the proposed contract , announced more than a week ago , revolutionary , saying it would tie the promotion of custodians to job performance instead of seniority and make the custodians answerable to school principals but mr giuliani rejected the pact , with his aides calling it too expensive and its provisions on accountability too vague the administration now seems to be hurtling toward a confrontation with the union over contracting out the custodians' work to private cleaning firms mr giuliani s labor commissioner , randy l levine , said this week that he wants to renegotiate the contract and win the right to use commercial cleaning companies in half or more of the city schools to judge the companies' performance against that of the custodians if the custodians refuse to return to the bargaining table , he said , he would recommend to the mayor that all the schools switch to commercial cleaners john h beckman , mr cortines s spokesman , said yesterday that the justice department finding highlighted the importance of affirmativeaction provisions that had been included in the tentative contract we believe they would address a number of the justice department concerns , he said and william m broderick , the lawyer for the custodians' union , local 891 of the union of operating engineers , wondered how the city could move to private companies in the face of the finding if we do away with all the jobs , there will be no jobs for the minorities , he said but mr levine said the justice department finding shows this is a system just in total disarray it s biased and has to change he said the last contract with the custodians in 1988 had also included affirmativeaction provisions that had not changed the makeup of the custodial force under the current hybrid system , the custodians are city employees who must pass civil service exams administered by the department of personnel but they also become independent contractors who hire their own handymen and firemen a title dating from the days when the fires under heating boilers had to be tended by someone city officials said part of the problem in promoting minorities has been that prospective custodians needed the experience as handymen and firemen to qualify for the civil service exam but mr broderick , the union lawyer , said people could get the experience working in buildings other than schools we have not been found guilty of anything in this thing , he said the only reason we were named is because we 're an important part of trying to correct it the justice department based its conclusions on its finding that the written examination administered by the city s department of personnel was not jobrelated , as well as on employment patterns it said that of the 865 school custodians employed by the board of education in 1993 , only 42 percent were black , 34 percent hispanic and 05 percent asian , while blacks make up 224 percent of the work force , hispanic people , 188 percent , and asians , 7 percent in addition , the department said that of the 156 custodians hired by the board of education from 1987 to 1990 , none were black and 6 were hispanic of the 108 people hired or promoted from 1990 to 1992 as custodian engineers who work in the larger schools none were black and three were hispanic
austin , tex , may 8 angry about crime \? on america s talkradio circuit , conservatives have solutions , and they do n't take up a lot of air time , either the death penalty cane them as they do in singapore one strike and you 're out liberals typically take more time to explain themselves , offering eightpoint plans , and they sound more defensive or so say many talkshow hosts and radio industry analysts , advancing just one of many theories to explain a striking fact so far , rightwing talk radio has proved far more popular than leftwing talk radio enter jim hightower , the fiery , funny texas populist , in what may well be the left s most determined counteroffensive his threehour nationally syndicated program will be broadcast on saturdays and sundays beginning this saturday on more than 100 stations across the nation \( although no firm deal has been made yet in the new york area \) it offers a tollfree number for callers 1800agitate an answer to limbaugh mr hightower has been on the air for more than a year with twominute commentaries , now reaching 72 stations , in which he regularly takes after heartless republicans and fortune 500 welfare kings and now , many of his admirers are already promoting him as the leftofcenter alternative to rush limbaugh i 've spent years trying to find the liberal or even populist yang to limbaugh s yin , said jon sinton , a radio consultant in atlanta who helped in getting the show on the air he thinks he has found it in mr hightower , whose sharp wit earned him a reputation as one of the more entertaining figures in american politics when he was agriculture commissioner of texas in the 1980 s mr hightower has said that ronald reagan s idea of a good farm program was hee haw and that george bush was born on third base and decided that he hit a triple and he even castigated moderate democrats there ai n't nothin' in the middle of the road , he scoffed in his east texas twang , but yellow stripes and dead armadillos battle for listeners but now the 51yearold mr hightower , whose program will be syndicated by the abc radio networks , faces a steep challenge so do many other leftofcenter hosts of talk shows , none of which remotely approach the success of mr limbaugh , who has an estimated five million listeners a poll conducted last year by the times mirror center for the people and the press found that conservatives were twice as likely as liberals to be regular listeners to talk radio why \? the question has produced an ocean of speculation and absolutely no consensus , though just about everybody agrees it is important talk radio has certainly been a powerful industry force , having played a big role in saving the am radio band the number of stations using a newstalk format has more than tripled over the last five years to 1 , 031 , according to the m street corporation , a research group in manhattan but talk radio has also shown the power to galvanize a segment of public opinion on hotbutton topics from zoe baird s taxes to homosexuals in the military political analysts say the growing audience , especially mr limbaugh s , could be a big force in this fall s congressional elections and beyond the demographics of talk some in the industry say the politics of talk radio is simply based on demographics older listeners , who tend to be more conservative , stayed with am while younger listeners grew up with fm and stayed there others say it reflects the country s true mindset , which they say is otherwise distorted by liberalminded news media some leftofcenter groups say the answer lies in the attitudes of the titans of the radio industry there are a lot of phony excuses for why the right wing dominates , but the most obvious , true explanation is that the management at these stations is conservative , said jeff cohen , executive director of fairness and accuracy in reporting , a nonprofit group that says it is working to get more diverse programming on talk radio a variation on this theme is that someone like mr limbaugh would never offend a corporate sponsor , while someone like jerry brown , the unpredictable erstwhile presidential candidate who is now the host of an callin program on 38 stations , might just do that that s entertainment still others suggest that it s all entertainment , anyway kit carson , who carries the title of mr limbaugh s chief of staff , answered with a brisk absolutely ! when he was asked in a telephone interview whether his boss would be as successful on radio if he were struck by lightning and turned into a flaming liberal \( a few minutes later , mr carson called back and said his comment should not be interpreted as minimizing the importance of the nation s conservative streak that mr limbaugh had tapped so well \) in any event , many liberals admit to listening to mr limbaugh because they enjoy being irritated by him conversely , gloria allred , a feminist lawyer and dedicated liberal who has a talk program in southern california , says her phones routinely light up with conservatives who want to argue with her it happened the other day when she said she was sick of the adulation of president richard m nixon since his death
to the editor the editorial a sneak attack on health reform \( april 11 \) calling a section of the clinton health care plan a multibilliondollar giveaway to major manufacturers unfairly characterizes a provision designed to guarantee affordable health insurance to nonworking , middleincome americans age 55 to 64 the proposal in question would provide health insurance at a reduced cost to a highly vulnerable group of people at risk of being left out of health care reform much of the debate has focused on those who are lowincome , on medicaid or employed but there must also be recognition of the plight of those who fall into none of those categories people no longer working , too young for medicare , not impoverished but needing assistance in paying health care costs the premedicare population while it is true that some employers in the auto , steel , communications , airline and other industries do offer health insurance benefits to retirees , 96 percent of american companies do not it is also true that president clinton s plan would relieve those employers of a portion of their financial burden for such benefits but to call this provision a giveaway is akin to calling the creation of medicare a giveaway because it reduced employer costs by providing benefits to retirees over age 65 for consumers , the real test of reform is whether all americans are guaranteed health care at a price they can afford any proposal that ignores the legitimate needs of the premedicare population cannot meet that test cathy l hurwit legislative director citizen action washington , april 12 , 1994

for older couples contemplating marriage , something in writing has come to mean more than a valentine s day card the prenuptial agreement , entwining love with money , has become almost as essential a document as the marriage license , say lawyers who draw up such agreements increased longevity means that more couples who are in their 60 s , 70 s and even their 80 s are marrying for the second or third time , and they want to make sure that their assets go to their own children and grandchildren and nowhere else , said james c kahn , a partner in the white plains law firm of kahn kahn , which specializes in matrimonial law it may not be romantic , but it s a fact of contemporary life to put something in writing , and most older couples deal with the issue realistically putting something in writing is not confined solely to older couples , though younger couples are also signing prenuptial agreements , especially when one of the partners has considerable assets and the other has none , said joseph a scutieri , who is also a partner in kahn kahn it s usually the parents of the one who has the assets to protect who insist on the prenuptial agreement even though it puts a tremendous strain on the young couple , mr scutieri said when you start out a marriage with the assumption that there will be a divorce , it can be the kiss of death 'the timing was awful' nevertheless , mr kahn added , many parents still think it is worth the risk a typical example is with one of our clients who is a successful businessman with a string of retail outlets , mr kahn said he put his son , the one who is getting married and who is in his 20 s , into his business and signed over one of the company s retail units to him the father , who wants to protect the company , insisted that the son s fiancee relinquish any claims to the business by signing a prenuptial agreement just in case the marriage does n't work out mr kahn continued the girl came to us for advice on the eve of the marriage the timing was awful she was very upset what should she do \? we advised her against signing the prenup because we felt that it was not in her best interest but she was so upset and fearful of the consequences and the thought of postponing the wedding and all the other complications that she signed anyway what was especially troubling to me was the time frame by signing the prenup , she literally waived her rights away throughout the entire life of the marriage i felt that marriage was off to a bad start but when older couples are involved , a prenuptial agreement can actually increase the chances that the marriage will be successful , said susan pollet , a lawyer who has her own practice in chappaqua and specializes in family , labor and employment law by discussing finances openly and outlining their positions , especially regarding their adult children , older couples work out the particulars upfront amiably before they get a formal written agreement , ms pollet said , adding that in order to draw up a sound financial agreement , it is absolutely essential that each of them have their own attorney even when there are no children to take into consideration , older professionals who have accumulated substantial assets want to make sure that their assets are protected before they enter into marriage , said denise s d'ambrosio , a lawyer in the white plains office of hall , dickler , lawler , kent friedman with one out of two marriages ending in divorce today , people with means who are thinking about marriage are very cautious about shifting their assets to joint ownership , ms d'ambrosio said i have clients in their late 40 s , for example , who are getting married for the first time who are using a prenuptial agreement just as they would an insurance policy or as a good financial planning device they have a lot to lose and they have seen people who have had their entire marital wealth reduced to almost nothing through the legal costs of divorce so naturally they are cautious mr scutieri added that divorce has increased during the last five years , especially among middleage people the recession is taking its toll , especially in westchester , where corporate cutbacks have hit middleage couples who have had to alter their life styles drastically , he said money problems lead to fighting and eventually divorce , even though financially , couples would be better off not divorcing an added benefit of a prenuptial agreement , said jean carlson , a financial planner in mamaroneck , is that it gives a couple an opportunity to work out their financial future before marriage prenuptial agreements are not only for the rich , ms carlson said , adding that averageincome people also need them for those with average incomes , for instance , their largest asset is probably their pension or their home , and that leads to questions how will pension money be divided \? does each partner own his or her own home \? how will the property each spouse brings to the marriage be held \? what about property acquired or money earned after the marriage \? will that be considered separate or marital property \? couples about to marry for the second time would be well advised to plan for the marriage just as they would plan for retirement , ms carlson said they should sit down and review such things as insurance policies , individual retirement accounts and pension options and they certainly should make out new wills some couples avoid the whole procedure by choosing to live together without being married mr scutieri said there are numerous elderly couples who decide not to get married for various reasons one of them is that they want to keep both of their social security benefits their total benefits would be reduced should they marry there are also those who do n't marry for fear of the future they know they would be financially responsible for paying the bills if their new spouse , for instance , had to go into a nursing home for example , in westchester good nursing homes cost about 4 , 000 a month and a halfmilliondollars' worth of assets can vanish quickly when the state is dunning a spouse for payment and then there are those romantics who prefer not to sully relationships with talk of money take the couple aged 68 and 70 that recently sold their individual houses in scarsdale and decided to live together we are both very well fixed , said dan p , a retired executive who insisted on anonymity i am a widower my companion has been divorced and widowed she has four children and six grandchildren i have two children and three grandchildren we have had a very close relationship for a number of years , ever since our respective spouses died we have been on a number of trips together , but we only recently decided to live together although the couple had seriously contemplated marriage several times , he said , they eventually decided against it it got much too complicated , he said when we started discussing assets , it began to sound like a cold business deal we stopped before any real harm was done society is much more permissive today , and at our age who cares if we get married or not \? a few people have criticized us , but our children have n't i think they are relieved the couple , who share expenses , rent a condominium in rye brook but we have looked at a vacation house we like in maine where we spent last summer , he said we are seriously thinking of buying the place as equal partners it has enough bedrooms for all our visiting children and grandchildren , who seem to get along surprisingly well drawings drawings by felipe galindo

east meadow , li , march 29 over the objections of some democrats , a nassau county commission today adopted a plan to create a new government for the county , with a 19member legislature as its centerpiece the proposal , drafted by the commission on government revision and adopted today by the commission 152 , will now go to judge arthur d spatt of federal district court for approval last year judge spatt ruled the current government unconstitutional , saying that the sixmember board of supervisors violates the oneperson , onevote principle even if judge spatt approves the plan , it will still be subject to further review by the commission and final action by the board of supervisors before it goes to a referendum , probably in november democrats , who are outnumbered by republicans in the county by a ratio of 3 to 2 , charged that the proposed legislative districts disproportionately favored republicans they also said the district lines cut some villages in half , diluting the voting power of some community interest groups 'blatantly political' the map , as drawn , is blatantly political , said lewis j yevoli , a democrat and supervisor of the town of oyster bay it divides too many small villages to ever win approval mr yevoli estimated that under the current plan , democrats could expect to win no more than seven seats , and possibly as few as three or four of equal importance , the democrats said , was how many votes it will take for the new legislature to adopt a budget and decide other crucial matters it s not just the shape of the districts , but the process of government , said bruce nyman , a democrat and supervisor of the city of long beach , who said he hopes to be a member of the new legislature if the new charter is stacked in favor of the majority , it really wo n't matter how many seats the democratic minority has the republicans say they recognize that there are still problems with the district map , but are generally pleased with it no matter which party you 're in , you 've got to recognize the reality that in creating the districts , there is no way you can please everyone , said gregory p peterson , a hempstead republican and majority leader on the board of supervisors i think the commission has done the unexpected , said mr peterson it s done its job very well in a nonpolitical way in guaranteeing at least two minority districts , it had to put other considerations aside but in the end , the commission has met the court requirements of oneperson , onevote , as well as minority representation the commission has done what democrats have been calling for for years , mr peterson said the funny part is , now that they 've got what they wanted , they 're crying 'foul' joseph mondello , chairman of the nassau republican committee , said as party leader , i 'd like all 19 districts to be republican and obviously the democrats would like all 19 districts for themselves but that s not reality the reality is that neither party is going to be fully happy with the results of the commission but if we do n't resolve this , judge spatt will john b kiernan , the republican chairman of the commission , said the panel was trying to do its job without becoming involved in a partisan dispute nothing set in stone' he said that none of the lines proposed by the commission were set in stone and that changes would no doubt have to be made after the next census reapportionment of the districts will continue just as the age and makeup of the population change , he said mr kiernan , who is also the county parks commissioner , said demographers had been able to refine the lines on the map so that they severed only 12 of the county s 64 villages unfortunately , there is no way to draw the map unless some villages are divided the demographers first created two minoritydominated districts in the center of the county in the town of hempstead , where most of nassau s minority population lives public hearings planned the other 17 districts , each with an average population of 67 , 755 , were formed around the two central districts along with the map , the commission will recommend to judge spatt that the 19 legislators work part time , be paid 39 , 500 a year , and serve twoyear terms if the plan is approved by judge spatt , the commission will hold three public hearings on the matter , on april 18 , april 27 and may 4 final recommendations must be submitted to judge spatt by june 1 , after which the debate will begin on the board of supervisors since neither party has a majority on the board , a stalemate is possible if the charter is approved in a referendum in november , election of a new county legislature would take place in november 1995 and the new government would take office in january 1996

tokyo , feb 20 bowing to international pressure , japan has decided to postpone , for as long as 20 years , a series of multibilliondollar nuclear power projects that would add tremendously to the world oversupply of plutonium , japanese and american officials say the decision , to be announced in the next few months , came after a yearlong reassessment of japan s ambitious but politically troublesome nuclear energy program and stemmed largely from the international outcry last year over japan s sea shipment from europe of more than a ton of plutonium , a highly toxic and radioactive material that is a fuel for nuclear weapons several of japan s asian neighbors banned the shipment from passing through their waters , fearing an accident or terrorist incident the government s decision affects the schedule for building several breeder reactors which are nuclear power plants that both consume and produce plutonium and a second reprocessing plant , which turns ordinary nuclear waste into plutonium it also seems bound to cut sharply the shipments of plutonium from europe because japan will have far less capacity to use the plutonium fuel the government s decision is also motivated partly by fears among japan s huge utility companies that the country s policy to create a nuclear fuel cycle turning nuclear waste into plutonium fuel was quickly becoming a financial fiasco , one that could cost them billions of dollars policy is retained japanese officials say they have no intention of abandoning their fuelrecycling policy but the delays are clearly an effort to back away , and many of them concede that they were shocked by the scope of international protests generated by the first plutonium shipment officially , about two sea shipments of one to two tons are planned annually for the next 18 years , although that plan also seems bound to be drastically changed what to do with that plutonium is becoming a major problem tokyo clearly fears that the political liabilities will mount in coming years if japan is unable to burn all the plutonium it plans to produce or import plutonium stockpiles would only add to suspicions abroad , denied by japan , that tokyo has ulterior motives and is keeping its options open in case it ever needs to develop nuclear weapons looming large against this background is north korea , which is widely suspected of operating a nuclear weapons program even without a weapons project in japan , many asian nations say , the mere presence of large amounts of plutonium in the country constitutes a latent nuclear capability our basic policy is still in place , but now we are looking out at the year 2020 , or maybe 2050 , a senior government official involved in the debate said last week politically , it is clear that this is not the time to be producing plutonium , shipping it around the world or storing it the clinton administration , fearful of adding to its tensions with washington s biggest ally in the pacific , has never publicly opposed japan s plans to build breeder reactors or the reprocessing centers needed to convert nuclear waste in fact , the nonproliferation policies issued by the white house last year gave a specific exemption to japan s project , and to reprocessing centers in england and france that depend heavily on japan s business us halted program but the united states halted its own breeder reactor program 15 years ago , largely to stop the spread of bombgrade materials american officials have made little secret of their concern that japan s program would add tremendously to the glut of plutonium created by the dismantling of nuclear weapons in the former soviet republics while japan s plutonium is reactor grade , meaning it is made for energy production instead of weapons , the national academy of sciences recently concluded that such material could be used to make a bomb , heightening the concerns that the supplies could fall into the hands of terrorists or aspiring nuclear nations , including iran , iraq and north korea the overall program is now seen as more trouble than it is worth , in terms of the money and the politics , said paul leventhal , the president of the nuclear control institute , a group in washington that has led the lobbying effort against japan s plutonium plans it has suggested instead that tokyo buy and stockpile large amounts of uranium , which is far more difficult to turn into nuclear weapons the increasing international pressure because of the program has created a perception abroad that japan is interested in preserving the nuclear weapons option , mr leventhal said tokyo , he added , is finding it more difficult to blunt that perception trying to avoid debate while the wisdom of japan s energy strategy

washington , sept 13 the white house said today that president clinton would address the nation on thursday about a possible invasion of haiti , and the pentagon sent a troopladen aircraft carrier to the caribbean military officials said the plan called for sending army and marine forces from vessels just offshore into portauprince , cap haitien and other places as quickly as possible to seize critical installations and crush any resistance their mission would also be to protect american citizens and help maintain order during the early hours and days of the invasion , which would be aimed at ousting haiti s military leaders and restoring the elected president , the rev jeanbertrand aristide , to power the idea is simultaneous entry in multiple places and to avoid disruption by a massive presence , a senior administration official said the aircraft carrier america , which would serve as a launching pad for special operations forces , left today for the caribbean it will be joined by the eisenhower , which is to leave on wednesday carrying troops and about 50 helicopters from the army s 10th mountain division military officials said their plan was to use an overwhelmingly american force of about 20 , 000 troops at first , then deploy a small multinational contingent , and finally turn the operation over to a 6 , 000member united nations peacekeeping force the peacekeeping force , which would be half american and under united states command , would be withdrawn by february 1996 , they said as the military plans were disclosed , congress sparred with the white house over the wisdom of military action , with democrats seeking a way to schedule a vote on the use of force that would not embarrass president clinton page a8 the timing of any invasion remained uncertain , clouded by washington s intensifying efforts to intimidate the haitian junta the tempo of preparations seemed nonetheless to accelerate today in washington the white house announced that mr clinton , who had delayed the important step of making the case for military action to the public , would make a televised address on haiti on thursday at 9 pm officials said mr clinton did not plan to issue an ultimatum setting a specific date for the haitian military leaders to leave administration officials face strong opposition to an invasion from republicans in congress , so they gained some maneuvering time when the democratic leaders put off any congressional action until next week because of the jewish holy days but officials said the administration did not intend to wait for congressional authorization if it ordered an invasion polls show opposition the american public is strongly opposed to an invasion , according to the latest new york times cbs news poll , which showed 66 percent saying they opposed such a move such sentiment often turns quickly after a president orders american forces into combat , a notion that administration officials are counting heavily on as they proceed with their planning administration officials said mr clinton planned to use his speech on thursday to lay out a broad rationale for military action and , in a bid for bipartisan support , to trace the roots of united states involvement in haiti s current problems back to the administration of president bush president clinton , who met for an hour today with his top national security advisers to discuss haiti , also dispatched top aides to woo members of congress in hopes of tamping down pressure to put the question of an invasion to a vote defense secretary william j perry and gen john m d shalikashvili , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , met with senator bob dole of kansas , the leader of the republican minority and a strong critic of an invasion no one involved in the meeting would discuss it later worried that haitian military leaders may order attacks on their opponents during the opening hours of the invasion and concerned about possible revenge killings by supporters of father aristide , administration officials have been trying to identify key areas that have to be occupied first some are concerned that the forces may not reach volatile areas throughout haiti in time to establish order timing still uncertain administration officials are confident that an americanled invasion force can quickly subdue any resistance from the haitian military some small complications have surfaced , however for example , officials said , the united states dropped three million leaflets over haiti last weekend warning that father aristide would soon be returned to power , but none have been seen by american officials in haiti one theory is that they were caught up in a thunderstorm and blown out to sea american forces have been ordered to be ready to carry out the invasion as early as tuesday , though senate republicans voiced concern that the administration might speed up the invasion to avoid a divisive congressional debate on monday the moon will be full , and american forces , which have nightvision goggles for operating at night , may want to wait until it wanes but senior administration officials say the full moon may not be a decisive factor in their decision on when to move anthony lake , president clinton s national security adviser , said monday night that by stipulating that the subsequent united nations peacekeeping force is to be withdrawn by february 1996 , the administration had sought to give haiti a breathing space to restore democracy , while avoiding an openended military operation mr lake said he believed there was still a chance that the haitian military would heed washington s call to relinquish power and leave the country , but american officials said they had no intelligence indicating that the haitian military was prepared to leave some american officials have said the haitian military may try to cut a deal at the last moment others speculated that the leaders of the junta might seek political asylum in the dominican republic , avoiding capture , maintaining a comfortable living and keeping a close eye on the haitian political scene
portauprince , haiti , sept 25 like a neighborhood bully , the haitian army has intimidated , beaten and killed haitians in the last three years but , nearly a week after american soldiers and marines landed here , the pecking order has been reversed thousands of haitians now defy their army with demonstrations to support the ousted president , the rev jeanbertrand aristide , under the watchful eyes of the americans the haitian soldiers have also been humbled by the realization that they have no real army their superiors kept them in the dark about the arrival of the united states forces , and the haitians were simply told to cooperate with the americans interviews with more than a dozen soldiers revealed hostility toward the american military presence , a sense of vulnerability , and low morale but none of the fearful soldiers would let their names be used we are hurt by what we are seeing , said a 23year veteran of the haitian army the foreigners have landed and deployed their weapons in the country i am not sure what their mission here is the americans' mission , ultimately , is to pull the teeth of the haitian military they want to reduce its ranks to 1 , 500 , from 7 , 500 , and to retrain the force to end the practices that have caused so much pain for the people the retraining and , where necessary , the disarming of the closely linked army and police will focus on the plainclothes auxiliary force known as attaches they have been responsible for most of the 3 , 000 killings of civilians since the coup that overthrew father aristide i challenge anyone to point to one soldier who has killed anybody , said a soldier attached to the dessalines battalion , reflecting a view that is much disputed outside military circles we felt bad for all of these things but there was nothing we could do throughout the past week , haitian soldiers could only watch as americans seized their rusted and decrepit heavy weapons they also mostly just watched as the people demonstrated against the militarydominated de facto government , an act unthinkable only a week earlier while members of the haitian high command are likely to live out a comfortable existence , either in haiti or elsewhere , the future of ti solda a little soldier , or an enlistee is tenuous many of the soldiers live among the very people they were once ordered to keep in line by any means necessary , and now they feel vulnerable the soldiers , even those who have not taken part in atrocities , are seen as the backbones of the oppressive military government if it was not for the americans , we would have been dead , said one soldier standing by the port , sounding a sentiment shared by many colleagues the people would go after us but a soldier from the workingclass neighborhood of martissant who has been in the military for six years said i am not worried about anything the people know that i have not done anything to them everybody in my neighborhood knows me the rift between the little soldiers and the people is a recent phenomenon like the people , the soldiers were victimized under various dictators , including francois duvalier , papa doc , who shut the doors of the military academy a few years after he was elected president in 1957 and created his own militia , tontons macoute when duvalier s son , jeanclaude , who succeeded him , was forced into exile in 1986 , jubilant crowds hoisted soldiers in the air and proclaimed them heroes many soldiers even today are thought to support father aristide and have led minor revolts against their military superiors complicating the soldiers' existence is the fact that they have not been paid for three months all the soldiers interviewed said they had joined the military partly because it was a way to gain steady employment still , for all the confusion over their future role , some soldiers remind the interviewer that as children , they admired the crisp uniforms and austere cadence i am very proud that i joined the military , said a second lieutenant who lives in carrefour , a rundown district of portauprince i have no regrets photo haitian soldiers who intimidated , beat and killed haitians over the last three years have been humbled with the arrival of united states troops a truckload of haitian soldiers patrolled portauprince \( angel franco the new york times \)

for the last four decades , murray klein has helped guide one of new york s most famous institutions so yesterday , when mr klein announced his retirement from zabar s food emporium , it was something of an upheaval to the salmonandcuisinart set , not to mention to food retailers in the dogeatdog deli world of new york , mr klein is a marketing legend , a feisty bull terrier who delights in outhustling and undercutting competitors what new yorker could forget the macy szabar s beluga price war of 1983 , which mr klein orchestrated \? zabar s , at broadway and 80th street , announced yesterday that mr klein had sold his onethird interest to his partners , the brothers saul and stanley zabar , for an undisclosed amount mr klein , 72 , said he would remain a parttime consultant the announcement , and mr klein s continuing role at the store , appears to confirm the three partners' contention that their highly public feud , which began in the mid1980 s , had subsided in disputes that popped up in newspapers and magazines , the zabar brothers and mr klein seemed to fight with some regularity over how the store should be run things became so intense that the three began courting potential buyers for the store rather than work together none of that ever materialized , said saul zabar yesterday , adding that the problems were resolved mr klein remembered , it was really a personality clash with me and saul but we sat down and said what we had to say it was a long time ago and we 've been successful working together since then mr klein , widely considered a marketing wizard , once encapsulized his theory of retail if i walk onto zabar s floor and i can see my shoes , it s not busy enough there is no question that mr klein and his partners have kept the everexpanding zabar s busy more than two million customers pass through the foodcluttered aisles annually , the partners say , grossing 40 million a year mr klein has always been particularly proud of the store s glittering mezzanine , which is loaded with every conceivable type of kitchen equipment we cut out the middle man and bought direct in volume , mr klein said in explaining his strategy we also buy closeouts and pay suppliers right away , which gets us better prices mr klein has always reveled in tweaking the nose of his competitors , particularly macy s at times he would undercut macy s food and cookware prices , then publicly rub it in with newspaper ads comparing the two stores on several occasions this led to price wars , like the battle of beluga a decade back before christmas , macy s offered 14 ounces of beluga caviar , the highest grade , for 149 mr klein countered with 139 macy s then lowered the price to 129 mr klein , not to be outdone , sold it at a loss , for 11995 , rather than lose a fight it was crazy , he admitted yesterday mr klein said he started with zabar s thanks to his older cousin , aaron klein murray klein , who was born in the ukraine , found himself in a displacedpersons camp in rome from 1945 to 1950 , when his cousin arranged for him to come to the united states and got him his job the young murray cleaned floors and sorted soda bottles at one of the stores owned by louis zabar s , who founded zabar s in the 1930 s mr klein left briefly to open his own hardware store and then was asked back in 1953 and made a partner several years later mr klein , who lives in manhattan , said he was retiring to spend more time with his wife of 40 years , edith today he is headed off on a mediterranean cruise i'm a millionaire , he said , so i have to spend the money fast photo remember the great beluga caviar war \? that was one of the marketing moves of murray klein , left , who said yesterday that he was selling his onethird interest in zabar s food emporium to his partners , saul and stanley zabar he was with saul zabar at the deli counter of the store \( andrea mohin the new york times \)
philadelphia this spring , many leading cancer researchers said that one of their greatest fears seemed likely to come true in the wake of scandal surrounding the highly regarded clinical trial network run by dr bernard fisher at the university of pittsburgh , researchers worried that the public would lose faith in these scientific studies , which are essential to determining whether treatments work they were concerned that fewer doctors would refer patients to the studies and that fewer of those patients would enroll , preferring instead to put their faith in unproved treatments but , so far , that has not happened researchers at leading cancer centers say there has not been any noticeable slowdown in patients' entering clinical trials enrolling a patient in a clinical trial is time consuming , involving recruiting the patients and explaining the study to them yet , as in the past , the reluctance of some patients to enter studies continues to have more to do with their own fears and hopes than with abstract concerns about data integrity patients interviewed recently at the university of pennsylvania s cancer center here said they were well aware of the problems with the national surgical adjuvant breast and bowel program , as the network had been called it had been front page news in the local newspaper when one doctor participating in the study was accused of fraud and the study s results were thrown into question but the false data submitted by an investigator were , at most , only of academic interest to these patients , who faced a far more immediate problem how to stay alive many patients at the cancer center were past the point where their doctors talked in terms of a cure instead , their aim was to control their disease by agreeing to participate in a clinical trial , they would go beyond the limits of medical knowledge , entering the vast territory of uncertainty , where there is no best treatment or best doctor or obvious choice of what to do few who worked at the medical center were untouched by the patients' plight dr john glick , who directs the cancer center , said he and other doctors at the center had a personal reason for encouraging patients to participate in clinical trials seeing patient after patient who will inevitably die of cancer demoralizes doctors , while clinical trials , whose ultimate purpose is to save lives , helps keep up their spirits 'they keep me alive' dr glick and his colleagues hope that even if they do not always help a current group of cancer patients , later ones will benefit clinical trials are what keep me going , dr glick said , adding , they keep me alive i think that physicians frequently have a bias that new is better , he said that bias is based on a sincere desire to want to do something for patients a new therapy looks promising , and although it has n't been proven , they want to try it on patients but , dr glick said , offering new treatments outside formal studies designed to assess their effectiveness can do more harm than good , because it may be impossible to know whether the patients were helped or harmed patients have a different perspective lisa hodges walked briskly recently into a conference room at the cancer center with her husband and parents mrs hodges , a resolutely cheerful 37yearold project manager at att and the mother of a 5yearold girl , was looking for the best chance to save her life three years before , she had been treated for breast cancer with a mastectomy and chemotherapy this past winter , after her back began to hurt , her doctor decided to do a chest xray it revealed many tiny nodules in her lungs , all less than half an inch in diameter but all cancerous only treatment options mrs hodges , who lives in voorhees , nj , said she thought she had already lived through the worst thing that could happen to her when she found a lump in her breast three years ago , she planned her funeral her husband , bill , said that both of his parents had died of cancer and that the word cancer , to us , meant death now , facing a recurrence of the cancer she had hoped was gone , mrs hodges had been told that there was no cure and no best treatment instead , she faced an array of options our major goal is to put the cancer into remission , dr glick told her he offered her the standard therapy six months of chemotherapy to control the cancer , followed by two years of maintenance chemotherapy , at a lower dose a second option was a clinical trial comparing the relatively new drug taxol in different combinations with an older drug , adriamycin then he offered a third choice , the clinical trial he hoped she would join under it , mrs hodges would start out with conventional chemotherapy if her tumors shrank , she would be randomly assigned to receive either maintenance chemotherapy or a jolt of very high dose chemotherapy so high that it would kill her bone marrow this would be followed by a bone marrow transplant using her own marrow cells stored in advance
afula , israel , april 7 as this scarred and bitter town buried its dead from a suicide car bombing , israel reeled today from a new attack by militant islamic forces that killed a man , wounded four people and strained the faith of countless israelis in the chances for peace with the palestinians perhaps nowhere was israeli rage more palpable than in afula , a workingclass town in the north on wednesday , a young palestinian from the nearby west bank drove to a bus stop here and blew up his car , turning a commuter bus into an inferno that killed 7 israelis and himself and wounded 44 others some were severely burned and still in serious condition today it was the most serious terrorist attack in israel in five years today , thousands in afula turned out for a funeral service for four victims , including two teenagers , that became a catharsis for the entire country through a live nationwide broadcast only hours earlier , israelis had learned of a fresh assault on a bus stop this one was near the mediterranean port of ashdod , where a palestinian from a gaza strip refugee camp opened fire with an automatic rifle , killing an israeli and wounding four others before he was gunned down by armed israelis nearby in afula , there were tears and uncontrolled wailing but there was also fierce anger at the hamas and islamic holy war groups that took responsibility for the latest attacks , at yasir arafat for ducking an opportunity to condemn the killings openly , at their government for insisting that it will keep on negotiating with the palestine liberation organization of mr arafat and for not sending at least a cabinet minister to share the town s grief the most senior government representative here today was the deputy education minister , micha goldman , who was booed and cursed when he tried to speak , and finally was hustled away by the police to keep him from possible physical harm he s a traitor ! he s a traitor ! young men shouted at the retreating official , leaving little doubt that their real target was not mr goldman but prime minister yitzhak rabin , who like mr arafat has also said nothing in public about the afula incident mr arafat s silence was especially troubling to many israelis , including government officials , and it may have longlasting reverberations plo expresses regrets in tunis , the plo issued a statement today saying that it expresses its regrets for the incident which took place in afula and which cost the life of a number of citizens but it was too little , too late for many israelis , who questioned more strongly than ever whether someone who could not bring himself to comment on the shedding of their blood can be considered a reliable negotiating partner in stark contrast , they had the example of mr rabin in the days after the hebron massacre of feb 25 , in which a jewish settler killed 29 palestinian worshipers at a mosque the israeli leader condemned the mass killer in lacerating language , outlawed antiarab groups that had spawned him and arrested some of their leaders economics minister shimon shetreet urged a suspension of peace talks with the plo until mr arafat spoke out , and said he would raise the matter at a special cabinet meeting called for friday opposition leaders demanded an end to the negotiations us faults arafat even the united states declared itself dissatisfied with the plo response a state department spokesman , michael mccurry , said today that washington wanted to hear a stronger statement from mr arafat foreign minister shimon peres , while affirming that israel would not stop even for a moment its negotiations with the plo , nonetheless also expressed regret over mr arafat s silence in the israeli government , mr peres has been the plo chairman s main champion , praising him as a courageous but beleaguered leader in afula , the opposition had widespread support and the prime minister almost none at all after the bloody events of the last two days rabin is responsible because he is weak , said roni shapira , a middleaged man who came from tel aviv and who , like others , put flowers on the blackened sidewalk by the shattered bus stop the government thinks too much about the arabs and not enough of us , its citizens , and the arabs take advantage of it hebron contrition fades gone , certainly in this hardedged town , were any lingering traces of contrition for the hebron killings israelis were again the victims , many residents said as usual , some added and even though israelis had expected some sort of revenge attack after hebron , they were still outraged when it finally came , especially as they devoted today to annual commemorations of the six million jews who perished in the holocaust moreover , they heard warnings of perhaps worse to come the armed wing of hamas , the acronym in arabic for the islamic resistance movement , said in a statement that the afula bombing was but the first of five attacks to avenge the hebron massacre the other four are on the way , it said , threatening to act by next thursday , when israel celebrates its founding in 1948 we 've vowed to turn your independence day into hell , hamas said map of israel shows the location of afula and ashdod
the coach of the 1996 united states olympic swimming team disputed an assertion yesterday by the chinese foreign ministry that a dozen recently failed drug tests by chinese athletes represented individual action rather than systematic cheating the chinese olympic committee has confirmed that 11 athletes failed tests for performanceenhancing drugs at last month s asian games held in hiroshima , japan as many as eight are reported to be swimmers , including one worldrecord holder this news follows the twoyear ban imposed last week on the swimmer yang aihu , a gold medalist in the 400meter freestyle event at the world championships in rome in september , where chinese women won 12 of 16 gold medals yang was banned for testing positive for steroids at an outofcompetition test shortly before the asian games speaking yesterday at a news briefing in beijing , a spokesman for the chinese foreign ministry said that yang s drug test and the 11 failed test results at the asian games represented an act by individuals chen jian , the spokesman , added that chinese sports authorities promote hard work and scientific training while adhering to strict prohibition , strict testing and strict punishment of drug use cornel marculescu , director of fina , swimming s worldwide governing body , appeared to back the chinese foreign ministry in an interview , saying that we believe it is a matter of some swimmers and coaches we do n't believe it is a matter of the chinese federation but richard quick , who will coach the united states women s swimming team at the 1996 summer games in atlanta , strongly disagreed in a telephone conference call with reporters yesterday afternoon speaking of the chinese swimming program , quick said , my personal opinion is , it is a systematic problem the centralized training and coaching methods in china do n't allow it to be anything but a systemwide problem , said quick , who coaches at stanford none of the 11 athletes who tested positive at the asian games have been formally identified or suspended yet swimming and olympic officials said yesterday that they were awaiting a report from the asian olympic council before issuing sanctions the council is meeting this weekend in kuwait , officials said international olympic officials said it was highly unlikely that the chinese swimming team would be barred from competing in the 1996 summer games despite pledges by germany that it would not participate in meets where the chinese also competed , american swimming officials said they would not boycott events in which the chinese compete , adding that the chinese have been invited to the pan pacific meet in atlanta next august the meet , however , has been a low priority for the chinese , who skipped the last pan pacific competition in 1993 in addition to increased random , outofcompetition testing , the thrust of swimming s fight against banned substances is expected to be a steppedup effort to suspend coaches whose athletes fail drug tests marculescu said that an indonesian swimmer was recently suspended by fina along with her coach , who happened to be her father anita defrantz , one of two united states representatives to the international olympic committee , said in an interview that coaches , trainers , administrators and doctors should be held as accountable as athletes when drug use is uncovered if anybody should be targeted , it should be the administrators , defrantz said the shocked and embarrassed response by chinese officials to the failed drug tests suggests a quick response will be made , perhaps in terms of a bureaucratic shakeup , said john krimsky , the interim executive director of the united states olympic committee quick , the olympic coach , said he would consider supporting a lifetime ban for athletes who test positive for drugs any country that does not allow testing by fina on less than 24hour notice should not be allowed into international competition , he said
boston , may 3 never let them see you sweat , says william f weld , reflecting the patrician style that has taken him from harvard to the top job in the criminal division of the reagan justice department to the republican governorship of one of the nation s most democratic state he prides himself on his vacations at his family camp in the adirondacks , where he goes fishing on a private lake , reads yeats and dines on trout and venison cooked by his guide back in boston , the millionaire governor plays squash three afternoons a week i love sort of lying around on the weekend , mr weld , who lives in cambridge with his wife and five children , said in a recent interview i enjoy not working as much as i enjoy work itself whether , as some critics suggest , it is part of a calculated image bill weld , the natural , born to win or whether it is the real bill weld , he is expected to glide to victory this fall in his bid for a second term none of his three democratic opponents are well known the prominent democrats who might have given him a race , including representative joseph p kennedy 2d , have decided not to take him on after tantalizing voters for weeks , former mayor raymond l flynn of boston , now the ambassador to the vatican , said last week that he would not run support from top democrat the most powerful democrat in a legislature controlled by democrats , william m bulger , president of the senate , has practically endorsed the governor he s up for reelection , and most of us would just as soon keep him around , mr bulger said recently it is not politics as usual in this bastion of liberalism and kennedys this was a oneparty state under dukakis , said james braude , the head of the tax equity alliance of massachusetts , a citizens group , and a longtime weld critic now it s a oneparty state under weld , only it s the other party his political skills are stunning michael s dukakis , defeated in the 1988 presidential election by george bush , was governor of massachusetts from 1974 to 1978 and 1982 to 1990 for mr weld , a 48yearold moderate republican , the governor s job is his first in elected politics with his libertarian streak , he says , it is a natural fit for him to be fiscally conservative but liberal on gay rights and abortion he won by a margin of three percentage points in 1990 , elected by democrats who could not bring themselves to vote for his opponent , john r silber , the president of boston university voters blamed dukakis the state was going through a fiscal crisis , and the voters blamed mr dukakis and his liberal spending policies just as you could n't have had a ronald reagan without jimmy carter , you could n't have had a weld without a dukakis , said kevin phillips , a washington political analyst mr weld , who has professed admiration for mr reagan s management style , believes in minimalist government that goes on social issues as well as fiscal issues , he said out of your pocketbook , out of your bedroom he signed legislation last year making it illegal to discriminate against homosexuals in public schools and he has supported abortionrights legislation that lowers the age of parental consent to 16 , though his position on abortion has shifted in early 1989 he described himself as modified prochoice , saying he opposed public financing for abortions he won the election with a platform supporting the right to abortion his views , which he affirmed at the 1992 republican convention in houston , have infuriated the religious right lately , with his name being mentioned as a potential national candidate in 1996 , the governor has been playing down his stand on abortion we should focus on economics , he said in a recent interview my whole point is that we should not lead with the abortion issue in 1996 reminded that he had emphasized it in houston , he answered that was then , now is now i want to be in the same party as pat robertson they 're very nice people mr weld calls himself to the right of attila the hun on crime and he recently proposed one of the toughest welfare programs in the country the affable , selfassured mr weld has disarmed some democrats i would say that his most infuriating trait is perhaps his most endearing one , said tom birmingham , the chairman of the state senate ways and means committee he has a sort of cavalier sense of the whole process as a type of game i'm not sure there are too many issues he cares deeply about but the arm slength approach is refreshing , for me at least here s life outside politics answering those who say he lacks conviction , mr weld said i like to have fun with politics , but i also take my politics very seriously i care very passionately about not wasting taxpayers' money attracting attention while his aides confide that mr weld has national ambitions , he is not talking about them now while he seeks reelection still , he gets noticed without trying he is 6 feet 4 inches tall , redhaired , goodlooking and extremely smart he graduated first in his prepatory school class , at middlesex academy , and summa cum laude in classics from harvard , where he wrote his senior thesis in two weeks while starring as a rabbit in the hasty pudding theatrical club s production of right up your alley
a yearold battle for control of curticeburns foods inc , a maker of private and brandlabel canned foods , came to a turning point yesterday when its directors accepted an offer from the dean foods company with an effective value of 453 million but the deal , consisting of an offer of 172 million for shareholders and the assumption of 280 million in debt , is contingent on the settlement of a longrunning financial dispute with profac cooperative inc curticeburns , which is based in rochester , was founded in 1961 by 700 members of the cooperative to process produce harvested from local fields and farms , mostly in midwestern states they have to work out their differences , said howard m dean , chairman of dean foods , which is based in franklin park , ill if they ca n't , that will probably kill the deal he said curticeburns plants would help increase the production efficiency of dean s recently acquired birds eye operations in new york several bidders are cited dean and profac were among several bidders for curticeburns , whose sale was begun a year ago at the urging of its largest shareholder , agway inc of syracuse agway , a farm supply cooperative , owns a 34 percent stake in curticeburns and has been trying to sell its food holdings the dispute between profac and curticeburns is over the contentions by profac that its members are entitled to 50 percent of the proceeds from the sale of curticeburns , which has 21 product lines including comstock pie fillings we 've shared equally in good and bad times , said roy a myers , profac s general manager he contends the cooperative has a joint venture agreement with curticeburns over the years , its members have invested 100 million in the venture , provided debt financing and own its 13 plants and lease them back to curticeburns j william petty , curticeburns president and chief executive , described the relationship as a contractual one it s not a joint venture , he said , but one where profac is reimbursed for its services according to a complex formula for this deal to work , profac and curticeburns have to get a divorce , said john m mcmillin , a foodindustry analyst for prudential securities he predicts the case will be resolved in court if profac feels they 've gotton a raw deal , join the party , mr mcmillin said curticeburns has been an unmitigated disaster i think it s been far too diversified they did too many things and none seemed to work consumer preference for fresh and frozen goods , along with a move to fewer brandname items , has contributed to a poor earnings performance for curticeburns in recent years the company earned 68 million in the nine months ending march 31 , a 56 percent improvement over the corresponding period a year ago , buoyed by proceeds from one of three recent divestitures sales were 643 million in the period , a decline from the corresponding period a year ago another complication for the deal is the simultaneous sale of nally s fine foods , a curticeburns division , to the hormel foods corporation terms for nally s were not disclosed the unit , which makes nally s chili and bernstein salad dressing , had sales of 180 million
mayor rudolph giuliani proposes to cut 1 billion from new york city programs next year without cutting the services that make life bearable for the city s most vulnerable it takes an optimistic nature to believe his administration can raise the city bureaucracy s productivity enough to sustain services while reducing the number of employees but , as the mayor points out , he has already accomplished some things his critics claimed could not be done most notably , he has persuaded unions to accept a severance plan for city employees and to give him extraordinary authority to transfer employees between agencies the budget mr giuliani submitted to the city council yesterday was his formal plan for fiscal 1995 , starting july 1 he faced an awesome 23 billion deficit the largest since the city s fiscal crisis in the mid1970 s and closing the gap is made more difficult by the public s rebellion against further tax increases in contrast to predecessors who raised taxes , the mayor opts to cut them only 35 million next year , but 260 million the year after , and more after that he includes longoverdue relief for apartment owners , who pay higher taxes than owners of houses mr giuliani hopes to cover most of the 23 billion deficit with program cuts , more help from albany and washington , and city employees' contributions for their health insurance in addition , he plans an intricate refinancing of city debt and sales of city assets an fm radio license , a hotel , gas stations and , later on , sewage plants such deals can bring in quick cash , but they are oneshots that offer no longterm relief none of those are sure things costfree health insurance for most city workers is too generous , but they resist paying any share of it the 45 million he hopes to get for the wnycfm license seems high and , not least , council members from poor neighborhoods are understandably unhappy with staffing cuts at social service agencies while the mayor refuses to cut police and fire personnel key supporters of his mayoral candidacy over all , the new budget seems more realistic than the mayor s preliminary plan in february for example , he now pledges not to cut the number of social workers and preserves the department of aids services and , sensibly , he has adopted a slower plan for merging the city s police , housing police and transit police , an idea that has encountered resistance as before , mr giuliani projects a slight reduction in total spending , to 316 billion from 317 billion , and stresses that this would be the first reduction in 16 years if it happens , without further injury to services already maimed by earlier cuts , that would be a real accomplishment in yesterday s presentation , mr giuliani demonstrated an impressive personal knowledge of the budget , although he provided few details on the specific impact of cutbacks it now becomes the council s responsibility to test his blueprint , to assure that the city fulfills its obligations to the needy and disadvantaged

with the mainstream approach used for philadelphia , a film that appeared to be a courtroom drama \? or with the twopronged approach used for making love \? some marketing experts believe that it is increasingly difficult to market a film directly to homosexual audiences one of the problems with the gay market is to treat it homogeneously , says chris pula , president of marketing at new line cinema , which two years ago released three of hearts , a film about a lesbian relationship one gay film is n't going to satisfy everybody barry krost , who with doug chapin is producing back home , a disney movie about a small town s response to a man with aids , says there used to be just one common denominator , and that was pornography if you went to a gay bar , everybody looked the same now you go to bars or marches , and there are people dressed up , dressed down , in black tie a whole range it does n't make it easy to sell to richard jennings , the executive director of hollywood supports , an advocacy group for gay people and for aids awareness at the studios , says it used to be that we would flock to anything that had gay characters , even if they were icepick murderers or people deranged because they were gay now , people want to see much more realistic films about their lives gay men and lesbians show little interest in each other s films men do n't go to lesbian films , says jon gerrans , a partner in strand releasing he cites claire of the moon , which his company released last year the film , a lesbian love story set at a women writers' conference , was not well received by critics but made back several times its cost with an almost exclusively lesbian audience christine vachon , who produced go fish , a lesbian love story released last month by the samuel goldwyn company , says lesbians go to the gay men s films because there are n't enough lesbian films for them but how many gay men do you know who want to see two women kissing on each other \?

the jets screaming by at treetop level might have spoiled another demonstration , but they were not a distraction yesterday the students protesting outside the lexington school for the deaf were chanting in american sign language , and they had no trouble communicating with one another we want a deaf ceo now ! signed a group of six students , standing on top of a low wall and drawing cheers from the 100 other students and faculty members outside the school , on 75th street in jackson heights , queens , a few blocks from la guardia airport who is max \? i do n't know ! the students continued who is max \? i do n't know ! after a long search the students were referring to r max gould , a banking executive who earlier this month was named the executive vice president and chief executive officer of the lexington center , the parent body of the largest school for deaf children in new york state mr gould s appointment , after a long search , angered many students and faculty members , who think that the center s deaf clientele should have played a larger role in selecting its leader most of the 154 students at lexington s high school are refusing to attend classes until mr gould resigns , although the 250 students in lower grades were in class yesterday the protests are straining the tightly knit center , which also includes a research division , mental health clinic and hearing and speech center founded in 1864 , it serves 14 , 000 people a year through government grants , private donations and fees administrators are n't sure what to make of the student s five demands , including mr gould s resignation and a pledge that there will be no reprisals against demonstrators reprisals \? asked esther lustig , the center s director of external affairs and development , looking at the students milling outside her window we 're a lot more concerned about making sure they get some lunch than taking reprisals protest at gallaudet the students , now in their second day of demonstrations , are serious in their demands , inspired by the success of a similar protest at gallaudet university in 1988 gallaudet , the liberal arts college for the deaf , based in washington , agreed to replace its hearing president with a deaf educator after a week of unrest that closed the school and instigated a national movement for deaf rights it s like a black college was looking for a ceo , and they interviewed six whites and two blacks , and hired a white , said nicholas lalanne , one of the leaders of the demonstration and a former student body president it s the same parallel , people wanting to make their own decisions mr lalanne , like most of those interviewed outside , spoke through a sign language interpreter we do n't have to depend on hearing people , said jeff bravin , who teaches social studies at the school we can do it ourselves mr gould , a senior vice president at citicorp and the chief operating officer of quotron , the stock quote company , said he has no intention of withdrawing as the father of twin sons who are deaf , he says his long record of involvement on the board of the lexington center and with other organizations for the deaf , combined with his managerial experience , qualifies him for the job all along , the board said it wanted the most qualified person for the job , he said if they could find one who was deaf , fine but my qualifications for the job exceeded those for any available deaf person last summer , after advertising to fill the position , the board had offered the job to a deaf person , but he turned it down for personal reasons , ms lustig said the board then hired a search firm that recommended four candidates , one of whom was deaf in march , mr gould , an associate chairman of the board , asked that his name be added to the list the sixmember search committee , two of whom are deaf , voted for mr gould earlier this month , and the decision was accepted by a slim majority of the board last week ms lustig said 7 or 8 of the board s 45 members are deaf the protesters are demanding that 51 percent of the board be made up of deaf people though not necessarily agreeing with any demands , the center s administrators , including mr gould , said they hoped to meet with the students soon to establish grounds for discussions the protesters said many hearing administrators at the school took a paternalistic attitude , assuming that the students needed to be helped with their disorder several said it was time that deaf children had a role model at the highest levels of the center none of the major agencies for the deaf in new york have a deaf person at the helm , said jackie roth , an alumnus who was helping organize the protest lexington is one of our oldest institutions , and it should set an example so that deaf people could have someone to look up to photo students demonstrating outside the lexington school for the deaf yesterday as they protested the naming of r max gould as chief executive officer of the lexington center , parent body of the school \( ruby washington the new york times \)
there is an irony here shea gould was known as much for its opulent corporate life style and internal politicking as for its legal expertise anderson , kill , olick oshinsky is the ben jerry s of the law world , the place where each of 240 lawyers is a partner and frills are considered superfluous , even embarrassing so which of new york s hundreds of law firms just signed a 15year lease for three of the five lavishly appointed floors , and all of the basement filing space , that the nowdefunct shea gould had occupied at 1251 avenue of the americas , the old exxon building , between 49th and 50th streets \? yup sure , we 'll knock down parts of it , but for a law firm it s efficient space , said jeffrey a moross , the anderson , kill partner who is honchoing the logistics of his firm s move from its cramped offices at 666 third avenue , at 43d street , to floors 42 through 44 of shea gould s old offices for the most part , those offices are a law firm s dream they have lots of window space , which means 180 offices with a view there are kitchens , a huge law library , mahogany work stations all kinds of accouterments to relish another deal near interest in the space has run high one law firm , which requested anonymity , is in final negotiations for the 46th floor , even though it will probably sublet out at least 10 , 000 of the floor s 41 , 000 square feet it s great space in a great area , so we 're willing to take more space than we need , said michael a gerla , a director of the real estate concern colliers abr , this law firm s broker the building s leasing agent , barry gosin , the head of newmark real estate , says he is entertaining five bids from law firms for the 45th floor still , most everyone stands to lose money on shea gould s demise surely mitsui fudosan , the building s owner , is unlikely to come out whole the dissolving firm was paying an annual rent of well over 50 a square foot anderson , kill s rent , according to one person familiar with the lease , will start at only 38 a square foot , and will bump to 43 and then 48 over the 15 years of the lease moreover , landlords usually provide large periods of free rent to new tenants , and anderson , kill was not about to forgo it not surprisingly , mitsui fudosan is feeling a bit gunshy about law firms , and that is costing anderson , kill new tenants usually put up a substantial security deposit , which is reduced each year over five to seven years anderson , kill had to agree to a much more gradual burn down rate in a sense , we are paying a shea gould tax , mr moross said demolition costs for owner maybe so , but mitsui s tax is still higher none of the new tenants will take the space as is the 45th floor , for example , was shea gould s conference center , nicknamed the egg early on because of its peculiar oval cluster of conference rooms mitsui fudosan will have to gut the space to accommodate conventional offices it is awkward , inefficient space that we know we will have to completely rebuild , said mr gosin , the leasing agent anderson , kill and the 46thfloor tenant will at the very least require their own conference rooms and they are likely to want a more egalitarian office space layout than now exists shea gould has these incredibly extravagant secretarial work stations , yet their paralegals are all crammed together , said mr gerla , the real estate executive who represents the law firm that is negotiating for the 46th floor they and my client do not have the same taste in space allocation anderson , kill , which plans to move some 165 lawyers into its new quarters in september , is already drawing up space reallocation plans shea gould s airconditioned copying area will house computers some of the larger partner offices will be reduced in size , so that more lawyers can have window views and the huge shea gould library , which can seat more than 60 researching lawyers , will have 18 more offices carved out of it furniture at issue no one yet knows how different the offices will look , though the reason is that no one seems to know what will happen to shea gould s furniture this is a skittish subject with everyone when david fuchs , the shea gould administrator who is liquidating the firm , was telephoned by a reporter asking about the furniture , he said , i do n't care what you print , and hung up mitsui fudosan , furniture dealers and mr moross of anderson , kill were less blunt but also declined to talk about the furniture but several knowledgeable people independently told the same story when promised anonymity they said that the law firm had offered to give mitsui fudosan the furniture , valued by an appraiser at about 260 , 000 , as at least partial redress for defaulting on its lease but other creditors complained shea gould apparently had second thoughts , too the firm contemplated holding a furniture auction on its property , but those plans never materialized some partners started taking furniture home finally , shea gould signed a contract with one usedfurniture dealer for what was left a few days before that dealer was scheduled to pick up the furniture , shea gould called and said the deal was off much of the remaining furniture still sits in the space , and no one seems sure who owns it if they just leave it there , mr gosin said , we 'll consider it abandoned photo with shea gould now defunct , barely anything was stirring at its old offices in midtown manhattan yesterday that is about to change \( william e sauro the new york times \)
washington , dec 29 in his first public criticism of his fellow republican leader , senator bob dole today questioned the propriety of the 45 million book advance for representative newt gingrich , the next speaker of the house , and suggested that the deal could mar efforts by republicans to get off to a strong start when they take over congress on wednesday while mr dole , the kansas republican who will become the senate majority leader , said he was not ready to pass judgment on the deal , the largest ever for a sitting member of congress , he added that it raised questions and would have to be addressed it s not too popular , mr dole told a halfdozen washington reporters today during a conference call while he was on vacation in florida i can already see , when you start cutting programs that might affect lowincome americans , it might become an issue since the nov 8 election , any qualms that either of the two new republican leaders may have about each other have been held at bay as the party prepares to take charge of capitol hill for the first time in 40 years today s comments by the older , more cautious mr dole , who has been majority leader before , were his first indication that the untested mr gingrich might have overreached democrats have pounced on the book deal , calling mr gingrich a hypocrite for posing as a white knight who is cleaning up washington and yet signing a deal that exploits his public position for his own personal profit other political figures have received huge advances for books , but not while in office others in office have received advances , but none nearly so big mr gingrich has dismissed the criticism as silly and a case of book envy of the amount of his advance , he has said , conservative books sell efforts to reach mr gingrich or his spokesman today were unsuccessful the 45 million advance was offered to mr gingrich this month by harpercollins publishers for producing two books in the first , to be called to renew america , mr gingrich is to discuss his social and political philosophy the second book would be an anthology of writings about democracy , with commentary by mr gingrich republicans have been concerned that the deal provides an opening for their critics , but until senator dole s comments today , their concerns have been muted and offstage mr dole said that the matter kept popping up on callin programs on talk radio and on cspan , forums that have provided early warning signals for impending political fiascos , including several of president clinton s failed appointments every time we 're on a talk show , i assume we 'll be asked about the book deal , mr dole said it is of some concern to a lot of people he added , i 've listened to a lot of these cspan things and talk shows , and the public senses 45 million is a lot of money we just need to lay it to rest because we do n't need it to come up , he added , although it was unclear what action , if any , he might take he said he had not discussed the matter with mr gingrich asked if the deal had hurt the party , mr dole replied , i do n't know , but when bob novak expresses reservations , it means he s been picking it up out there , because he s not known to differ with newt mr dole was referring to the conservative columnist who wrote earlier this week that the deal was a blunder that played into the hands of mr gingrich s enemies mr dole has other reasons for wanting the public to think well of the republican congress he said he would decide by next week whether to form an exploratory committee for a possible presidential race
first , as vocational education enrollments wane for another year , set aside the tradition of practicing for adult work with jigsaws and adding machines it s going and most educators say , fine , leave it behind next , consider the relentlessly climbing youth unemployment rates , the dwindling earnings of nonprofessional workers in their 20 s and the complaints from employers that high school graduates are not prepared for the workplace so how to serve the half who do not go on to fouryear colleges , or who do and then drop out and drift \? how to respond to the news that high school voced gives its customers no advantage in career choice or earnings \? what s going to replace wood shop and bookkeeping class \? a few answers have emerged from the scramble to replace the old model of vocational education , which dates to world war iera legislation they rely on two perhaps incongruous approaches getting kids into the workplace to learn by experience , and giving vocational students academic basics of the same caliber that collegeprep students have either way , most of the new models bear the popular rubric schooltowork which is partly a dressier term for voc ed and partly a reflection of genuine innovation in philadelphia , public high school students can choose the academy for fitness , health promotion and sports education , or the hotel restaurant and tourism academy in rothsay , minn , students run a lumberyard , hardware store and grocery , which together took in 450 , 000 last year in broome county , ny , sophomores can apply for fouryear apprenticeships that extend through a twoyear community college program vocational education is a large enterprise slowly turning in the right direction , punctuated by very impressive examples of how to do it well , said marc bendick , a labor economist in washington who was staff director of the city school board s commission to restructure vocational education in parts of the system , if you woke up rip van winkle style from 1917 you 'd feel right at home , and in other parts of the system they 've made some marvelous changes if the marvelous changes are disparate , they reflect disparate views of what school , and particularly high school , is for the failures of the marketplace have reinforced the critics who say it s mostly futile to train a high school student for a specific job while conservatives like diane ravitch and chester finn prescribe a more rigorous and traditional academic curriculum for all , the view from left of center is that everyone learns more when academic and practical skills are cultivated together , in a curriculum that abandons the old tracks at the same time , outofschool training has brought a rush of interest , apparent in the brandnew schooltowork opportunities act , which will pass out federal grants to make apprenticeships and other workbased programs bloom all over the nation the slow crippling of vocational education began about 10 years ago a flurry of national reports a nation at risk in 1983 was probably the most prominent spoke sternly of academic deficiencies and set off something like the sputnik panic a generation earlier academic graduation requirements notched up , which vocational educators say discouraged concentration in vocational subjects budget cuts compounded the effect according to the national assessment of vocational education , a huge federal research project that made its final report to congress last month nb july , the proportion of students concentrating in vocational subjects dropped to 28 percent in 1990 from 34 percent in 1982 another department of education survey , which asked high school sophomores to identify themselves by track , found a starker result the percentage calling themselves vocational students , as distinct from generaltrack or college prep , dropped from 21 percent in 1980 to 79 percent in 1990 and the consensus is that the decline continues now in 1990 , congress amended several longstanding federal policies on vocational education the legislation sent more money to poorer districts and twoyear colleges it also called for the integration of occupational and academic studies in the high school classroom hard to define and harder to practice , integration is a popular idea now , it s a given , said larry \( cq \) rosenstock , who worked on the 1990 legislation and is now executive director of the rindge school of technical arts in cambridge , mass in that respect , educators have turned 180 degrees since the 1984 congressional hearings in which , mr rosenstock recalled , it was considered blasphemy to suggest dismantling the separate vocational track if it s a second track , the problem is that from the front end you 're sorting by income and by the education level of one s parents , mr rosenstock said that has nothing to do with intellectual capacity vocational education is the starkest form of class sorting , so the first question is to insure that it s not a separate track , because that s doomed to failure the only people who advocate a second track are those who are talking about someone else s kids as mr rosenstock defines integration , it s taking the best of each vocational methods and academic content
not more than a month or two ago , the museum of modern art acquired one of the rarest and most soughtafter of all 20thcentury prints a trial proof , inscribed and dated by the artist , of picasso s frugal repast of 1904 behind it is a curious and instructive story picasso was about as quick a study as anyone in the annals of art once hooked , he pushed back the frontiers and overran the accepted limits of whatever medium he adopted as riva castleman , chief curator of prints and illustrated books at the museum , pointed out the other day , picasso completed more than 2 , 000 images in various print mediums , often changing his compositions many times before authorizing their publication of this activity , the museum of modern art has the most comprehensive collection in the united states initially picasso the etcher and printmaker was not quick off the mark \( he was so awkward , in fact , that he did not remember that when an etching is printed the image is seen in reverse \) it was in september 1904 , just short of his 23d birthday , that he was gently pushed toward etching by a catalonian painter called joaquim sunyer sunyer was not an important painter , but he was friendly with eugene delatre , who knew all there was to know at that time about engraving picasso was in no hurry to make etchings , but sunyer urged him to have a try after all , there was really nothing to it you just had to take a needle in your hand and go to work picasso could not afford an expensive copper plate , but he did get hold of a zinc plate that had already been used by another spaniard in paris , joan gonzalez once the landscape already on the plate had been scraped out and the plate repolished , picasso went to work with a newfound and prodigious assurance combining a number of telling images that he had noted down a year or two before , he produced the frugal repast , an image that hammered home the downside of human pairing even in picasso s blue periods , where high spirits are in very short supply , there is a rockbottom quality about the frugal repast , with its blind man , its apparently derelict woman and the remains of a particularly dismal meal still , nothing could have looked less like a beginner s work than the gaunt and cheerless print that was to become a mandatory illustration in virtually every history of modern art it helped that delatre printed the early proofs his was the sure hand that brought out the warmth of feeling and the sensitive treatment of hands , hair , skin and still life that are the mark of the trial proof now at the modern we have no trouble believing that this trial proof was , in effect , the beginning of one of the greatest careers in the long history of printmaking the trial proofs were never exhibited , though picasso was delighted with them and had a number printed off for his friends \( among them the poet guillaume apollinaire and the actor and theater director charles dullin \) visitors who feel , on looking at the museum s new acquisition , as if they have never seen the frugal repast before are likely to be absolutely right there is a comparable proof in the chicago art institute and another \( printed on prussian blue paper \) in the boston museum of fine arts apart from that , the frugal repast , when seen in public , is known from the edition of 250 printed for the dealer and publisher ambroise vollard in 1913 given the size of that edition and the tremendous pressure under which etchings are printed , the surface of the zinc had to be hardened by steelfacing the edition that resulted had a look of almost industrial efficiency , but it has lost the residual humanity of the early proofs nuances are pressed flat , and the richness gives way to uniformity yet it is to the vollard edition that the huge popular success of the frugal repast has been owed shorn of its subtleties and ambiguities , the image holds the eye it reproduces well the compositional power comes over intact but steelfacing has violated the original the frugal repast in 1913 became a case history of destitution , with none of the richness and amplitude of feeling that picasso had coaxed from the zinc plate in 1940 the vollard version was given to the museum , along with more than 1 , 600 other prints , by abby aldrich rockefeller \( the new trial proof came as the partial gift of thomas p solley and mary ellen meehan , with additional funds from the vincent d'acquila and harry soviak bequest \) it is from it that generations of visitors through the museum s print room have formed their opinion of the frugal repast they will have a pleasant surprise this summer when the two versions are hung side by side in the museum s print gallery photo the modern s newly acquired version of the frugal repast , printed in 1904 the start of a great career in printmaking \( beth phillips art transparencies museum of modern art \)

light , red to brown , tan to pink there are ragged edges and missing segments in a broader sense , my family s story reflects white and black america s historical attitude toward skin color our experience suggests that america is not what it presents itself to be some geneticists have said that 95 percent of 'white' americans have widely varying degrees of black heritage seventyfive percent of all africanamericans have at least one white ancestor and 15 percent have predominantly white blood lines the sweeter the juice is about the privileges real and perceived bestowed by the appearance of whiteness , and the lengths some in ms haizlip s family went to gain them but it is also about the consequences those decisions wrought on those left behind on ms haizlip s mother , whose long life was haunted by her childhood abandonment , and on ms haizlip , her siblings and their children , who were deprived of the maternal side of their family and history my search for the missing part of my family has been with me consciously and unconsciously all my life i inherited it , i absorbed it by osmosis , ms haizlip writes this need , this pain of my mother s became mine it touched me in ways i am yet unable to fathom still , ms haizlip lived a charmed life , growing up in the rich state with her two sisters and a brother , the children of a prominent and welltodo minister , a darkskinned man whose personal and racial pride both consoled his wife and defined his children , all of them lightskinned i did not think a great deal about white people growing up , ms haizlip writes some were friends none that i knew personally were enemies in general , white people were the backdrop and audience for the drama of our lives , aside from the special group that made up my mother s family for me , they were in a class by themselves like many black people , ms haizlip was more concerned with the myriad colors and textures of hair among black people than she was with white folks in spite of the trauma and cost of being born with colored skin , we black people have always had a delicious way of describing ourselves , ms haizlip writes to a white person , a black person is simply black black people see an infinite range of hues we call ourselves honey , caramel , ivory , peachesandcream , mahogany , coal blue , red , bronze , amber , tar , rhiney , snow , chocolate , coffee , ebony color for blacks is intensely subjective but color , ms haizlip notes , is not race as she sets out on her journey to uncover her family s history , a history that had been revised , hushed up and sometimes smothered so that some members of her family could move fluidly into a new world where they would try to live happily ever after , she wonders how many of my cousins who had been free , white and 21 would claim their colored relatives and heritage traveling around the country , searching census documents and county and town records , doing research in the national archives and university collections , ms haizlip traces her family s roots back to ireland , virginia and massachusetts , to slave owners and slaves alike , to people we would define as white , black , mulatto , native american she uncovers information suggesting that martha washington , wife of our founding father , might be a distant relative the same for sir walter scott at times , ms haizlip dwells on the genealogy of longgone relatives and the achievements of more recent ones when a passing mention would do as a result , the reader loses sight of the narrative thread the search for her mother s surviving relatives that provides a sense of mystery and that flavors the sweeter the juice at its most intriguing in addition , ms haizlip s tone is sometimes selfimportant and humorless , with too much description of the trappings of bourgeois life one occasionally gets the feeling she s forgotten what she already knows that in terms of race as we know it , few of us are what we appear to be the sweeter the juice works best when ms haizlip writes with the knowledge that her family s experience is not unique it is her telling of race and family secrets that makes it so we do n't want to give away the ironic and bitterly funny conclusion of ms haizlip s search , but suffice it to say that with the help of a private detective she does find some of her white relatives , and they are not living in anything approaching the big house
washington , sept 7 representative jim mcdermott , the washington democrat who rallied 85 colleagues behind his proposal for a governmentpaid health care system far more sweeping than president clinton s plan , urged congress today to abandon all efforts at health care changes this year mr mcdermott , who had reluctantly gone along with efforts to develop other versions of legislation to insure all americans , said none of the incremental plans now being considered would even bring us close to a system that offered universal coverage , fairness and cost controls in a speech in his congressional district in seattle , he said it would be better to wait until next year and then renew the effort to enact his single payer system , under which insurance payments would be replaced by taxes and the government would pay the bills mr mcdermott s opposition underlined the problems facing any effort to take modest steps toward increasing health coverage in the last weeks of the congressional session anything but a diehard , mr mcdermott has always been regarded by house leaders as a player who would fight hard but reasonably , a good prospect for support of compromise his argument came a day after a leading republican strategist , william kristol , himself proposed doing nothing this year he urged congressional republicans to fight against any incremental steps that congress might consider this fall , contending that under the current circumstances any change would lend retrospective legitimacy to mr clinton s own efforts next year , mr kristol said , republicans can press for a more modest plan based almost entirely on changes in insurance laws , taking them in the opposite direction from the one mr mcdermott urges negotiations go on with the concept of modest legislation this fall under attack from both right and left , senate aides continued to talk in hopes of finding a route to a bill that would command support after congress returns from vacation next monday their bosses were still out of town , but aides to senator george j mitchell of maine , the majority leader , met with aides to senator john h chafee , the rhode island republican who leads a bipartisan group of about 20 senators that calls itself the mainstream coalition that group s plan would seek to raise insurance coverage to 92 percent of americans by 2004 from the current 85 percent , chiefly through subsidies for the working poor , and to reduce the federal deficit by 100 billion over 10 years if mr mitchell and the coalition cannot reach agreement on a version of that plan that they think can command a solid majority in the senate , an even smaller scheme , concentrating on coverage of all currently uninsured children , may be proposed by some liberal democrats they have argued that one small step forward would be a down payment on eventual universal coverage , just as the weak 1957 voting law foreshadowed greater federal guarantees of civil rights 'like the leak in the dike' but mr mcdermott argued today that any plan that did not reach universal coverage was doomed to make the present situation worse in his seattle speech , he said that unless all americans were insured , we will never be able to control cost shifting , the means by which the insured patient pays for the debt of the uninsured patient and unless we stop cost shifting , he added , cost containment throughout the entire system is a pipe dream the uninsured patient is like the leak in the dike , he said either you fix the dike or you face the flood and without universal coverage , the flood is uncontrollable health care costs in a telephone interview , mr mcdermott also argued that incremental approaches like insuring children would bring a rhetorical attractiveness but a practical nightmare he said they all required too much bureaucracy to make them work the flaw that he said sank mr clinton s plan in his speech , he contended that the effort to maintain a system of employerbased private insurance led to endless complexity and confusion and delay that ultimately sank health care reform there simply is no way to achieve universal coverage through private insurance companies without staggering complexity , he said , and complexity is a poor tool with which to mobilize support hopes rest with business and he argued in the interview that a phasein , like the senate coalition s proposal for gradual increases in coverage until 2004 , would serve as a roadblock to any serious action until then asked why he thought a singlepayer system could gain enough support to pass in congress , mr mcdermott replied the problem is going to get worse something has got to happen ultimately , he said in his speech , businesses will come to understand that a singlepayer system is simpler and cheaper for them than are existing arrangements and patients will have the same kind of choice that the elderly now have under medicare , he contended medicare , he said , is a singlepayer system republicans urged to fight mr kristol s arguments against incrementalism were very different he predicted that any compromise that mr mitchell struck with mr chafee would be flawed because it would require a standard benefits package that would politicize health care by having congress decide what was medically necessary , would provide subsidies for a huge sector of the population , would standardize and drive up insurance rates and would authorize a commission to propose further legislative measures stalling , in hopes that congress will simply run out of time , may not be enough , he wrote the defeat of clintonite health care legislation this year must be accompanied by the unconditional and unqualified intellectual defeat of the administration s entire health care theory a system shaped by government fiat and dominated by government regulation photo representative jim mcdermott enjoying a laugh yesterday at a rotary luncheon in seattle where he called for a delay in all efforts to change the health care system \( associated press for the new york times \) \( pg a23 \)
berlin , june 10 in the old east germany , no tradition was more widely observed than the jugendweihe , the atheists' answer to religious confirmation more than 95 percent of east german youths went through the ceremony when they reached the age of 14 it symbolized not only the passage from childhood into maturity , but also a commitment to marxism the book that each participant received , a history of the workers' and antifascist movements in germany mixed with adoring biographies of communist leaders , was on almost every east german bookshelf when east germany ceased to exist in 1990 , the jugendweihe , or youth inauguration , was one of many traditions that were expected to fade quickly into oblivion , and seemed to be fading in 1990 and 1991 the communist government had used it to enforce ideological conformity , making it difficult for nonparticipants to enter good schools or obtain good jobs , and westerners expected easterners to leave it behind as they embraced their new freedom just the opposite has turned out to be the case this spring , nearly 80 , 000 14yearolds in eastern german states are voluntarily taking part in a redesigned version of the jugendweihe in eastern berlin alone , 10 , 000 young people have signed up , nearly 50 percent of its 14yearolds these days , instead of pledging to work and struggle for the great and noble cause of socialism , the young people promise to live wholesome lives and respect the rights of others the book they receive at the solemn ceremony does not glorify any ideology , but rather describes germany s natural beauty psychologists and anthropologists maintain that many young people reaching puberty need some kind of ceremony to impress upon them that they are no longer children , and that they must now assume responsibility for their own lives this need is especially acute in eastern germany , where unification has abruptly cut people loose from the moorings that bound them to one another and to society for more than 40 years organizers of the reformed jugendweihe say they hope that their work will help forge a generation of solid citizens who will reject the temptation to join farright groups or other antisocial movements based on the evidence of a ceremony at a school auditorium in eastern berlin on a recent saturday morning , they may be succeeding seventyseven nervous boys and girls arrived early for their big day proud parents adjusted their children s clothing and wiped real or imagined spots off their faces inside , the program began with an air of solemn dignity today is an important event in your life , said werner riedel , who heads the private association that now sponsors jugendweihe celebrations in eastern germany today you finish that long and peaceful part of your life that we call childhood you are becoming young men and women yes , you 're big now your knowledge and your choices deserve to be taken seriously at 14 , you ca n't write letters to santa claus and expect your parents to grant your every wish , he continued you have to do your own thinking about how to fulfill yourselves if you want to be strong tomorrow , you have to begin taking responsibility for yourself today you have to reject violence , racism and antiforeigner feelings you have to respect the environment , and not treat our mother earth as if we have a second or third one in our pocket you have to read good books , go to the theater and the cinema , to galleries and museums for the girls , i wish you nice boys , and for the boys , i wish you nice girls but please , there s no hurry after finishing , mr riedel called the name of each participant they came to the stage in groups of about 20 each was given a book , a red rose , a firm handshake and a few words of congratulation in the audience , flashbulbs popped and cameras whirred after an hour of poetry , music and dance , the ceremony was over another group of young people was arriving for the day s second jugendweihe outside , robin senftleben , 14 , smartlooking in a white shirt , multicolored bow tie and matching vest , seemed impressed with himself and what he had just experienced i feel like i 've been honored , he said it s something you have to live up to you 're not a kid anymore you have to stop fooling around and start taking things more seriously the jugendweihe is not just a oneday ceremony but a process that takes several months in that time , participants and nonparticipants alike are invited to join seminars and discussion groups with titles ranging from drugs betray everyone to facial care and makeup to how tolerant am i really \? the jugendweihe is a 150yearold tradition in germany it was begun by communist and social democratic families who saw the need for such a ceremony but were not affiliated with any church in eastern germany today , less than 20 percent of families are tied to a church , compared with more than 80 percent in the west although some western children join the ceremonies , none are held in the west religious leaders long opposed the jugendweihe as antichristian , but protestant clerics have recently toned down their criticism roman catholic bishops still denounce it organizers of the modernized jugendweihe , many of whom are resolute anticommunists , say the ceremony does not reflect nostalgia for the vanished east germany we 're trying to give kids a sense of selfworth in a society that often does n't take them into account , mr riedel said in an interview i like to think that we 're making a contribution to building a better germany photo werner riedel , center , congratulating german teenagers at a nonreligious comingofage ceremony in eastern berlin last month the jugendweihe ceremony was used by the communist government in east germany to enforce ideological conformity and is being revived to promote good citizenship \( david hornback paparazzi for the new york times \)
as the dollar has plunged almost daily to new lows against the japanese yen , it is easy to conjure up images of hyperactive traders in speculative frenzies , selling wave after wave of dollars after all , that s what was seen on the trading floors of europe in the dog days of 1992 , when a global run on the british pound drove britain out of the european monetary system that was then , and almost everybody was making money this is now everyone or almost everyone has been losing it , and trepidation has triumphed over adventurism the dollar set a record closing low against the japanese yen in tokyo yesterday before recovering to end slightly higher in london page d4 most speculators who borrowed enormously to place large bets on the pound s fall in 1992 are now sitting on the sidelines the only players still in the game are motivated as much by caution as by conviction american and european investors backing out of bets that the yen would fall and japanese exporters dumping dollars rather than holding them even the strength of the german mark is rooted in a conservative impulse a desire for the investment that is least likely to lose value there is no one left to buy the dollar , said the head of the government bond trading desk at a leading new york investment house all of the speculative pockets of money went long on the dollar at the beginning of the year , lost money and bought it again now they say if that has n't worked , why not try the other way \? that is exactly what the many investors who think the dollar is undervalued and should rise have been doing through the long cold winter and into the early spring , , both speculative hedge funds and other investment vehicles with a longer perspective sold yen and bought dollars when the yen did not fall , they sold the dollars and bought back the yen faced with political turmoil in tokyo and uncertainty in washington , most players are simply moving to a neutral portfolio , although some are cautiously trying to earn back some of the losses they suffered after the yen rose there are a lot of disappointed bulls , said robert allen , who manages international bond mutual funds for g t capital management in san francisco heading into the year , we were pretty much fully hedged into dollars but recently we 've been playing to the dollar weakness , but we are not aggressively negative on the dollar that is not the case with the japanese , by far the most significant buyers of yen and sellers of dollars because the united states imports more than it exports , japan receives a trade balance of some 5 billion a month in the 1980 s , the japanese used these dollars to buy bonds , businesses and real estate in the united states but since 1985 , when washington and its allies agreed to reduce the dollar s value , hoping to increase american exports , the yen has risen and most of those investments have lost money virtually all japanese investments in the united states have been losing money from a yen point of view , robert z aliber , a finance professor at the university of chicago , said he estimated those losses at 50 billion to 100 billion so now japanese exporters are largely selling the dollars they earn as soon as they receive them , though this is getting more painful every day large japanese investors , like life insurance companies , have been selling overseas investments and moving their money home no japanese want to hold anything but yenrelated securities , said a top executive of a large trading firm no matter what they buy , they hedge they have been so burned according to one japanese currency trader in new york , some japanese corporations had been holding their dollars , hoping to wait until the dollar rose to 105 yen the level at which most corporations did their 1994 profit plans before converting them back to yen but as the dollar has continued to fall , many are taking their losses , selling on any rise in price the exporters are n't chasing the dollar down , but when buyers come into the market they run into resistance from the exporters , jack grifin , head currency trader at fuji bank in new york , said the rise in the german mark , by contrast , stems more from deliberate moves taken by global investors who are attracted to european markets largely for their slightly higher interest rates and lower risk of inflation three or four weeks ago , we shifted some money back into european currencies from the dollar , robert sinche , a money manager at alliance capital management , said alliance moved mainly because the yield on shortterm bonds is higher in germany than in the united states , he said yen s strength perplexing over all , the movement in the mark has not been especially unusual some traders say that at its recent level of 157 to the dollar the currency is somewhat overvalued but the mark is well in the middle of its trading range over the last two years it is the unexpected strength of the yen that continues to perplex investors and traders the markets are not responding the way traders are able to predict , or even to make sense of after they moved , said virginia r parker , managing director of ferrell capital management , which runs a fund that places money from large investors with a variety of currency and bond traders at banks and trading firms at the beginning of the year , both the traders who base their moves on analyses of fundamental economic factors and those who simply follow market trends were bullish on the dollar in the last month and a half , the fundamental traders moved largely to the sidelines and the technical shortterm traders began to bet the dollar would fall funds more cautious ferrell , like other currency traders , has made some money as the dollar has fallen , but it has little conviction that this is a sustained trend the fund has pulled more than a third of the money it had placed with currency traders , diverting it to bond traders similarly , the large hedge funds essentially speculative mutual funds for rich people have become much more cautious in 1992 and 1993 , they borrowed many times their capital to augment their bets that interest rates would fall in the united states and around the world when those leveraged bets backfired this year , the funds substantially reduced their borrowing and , thus , their trading none of the large hedge funds has any significant profits this year to date , said antoine bernheim , president of the united states offshore funds directory , a guide to hedge funds they either have large losses or small profits as a result , the leverage factor tends to be much lower than it was in the last few years
richard ravitch and donald fehr stood in front of the mirror in dressing room 1 outside a channel 13 studio , removing makeup from their faces they had just finished taping the charlie rose pbs television program , the third episode in the dick and don show last monday they appeared together on nightline and on sunday they popped up as a duet on david brinkley s show i have to leave town later , said fehr , referring to a trip he was taking to washington good , ravitch replied that means we do n't have to make any more of these joint appearances ravitch , who on the set before the taping had referred jokingly to the pair as the bobbsey twins , was smiling when he said it but both he and fehr know they have enough serious business to conduct with each other without touring the talkshow circuit neither , however , would decline an invitation to appear on a national television show knowing the other had said yes public relations , of course , will not settle baseball s labor dispute nor win it the two sides have 10 days before the players' deadline to forge an agreement or face a potentially disastrous strike that could leave the major leagues without a postseason for the first time since 1904 if only the joint television appearances and the ride back to their respective offices on manhattan s east side in the same car after yesterday s show could translate into labor peace , owners , players and fans would be ecstatic as close as they were in that car they are that far apart in their negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement one of the networks could sign up the dick and don show for a 39week season in prime time , and it would n't enhance the chances of a prestrike settlement although the owners and the players have only 10 days to sday , nothing significant should be expected to come from this week s bargaining sessions the two sides plan a full bargaining session tomorrow and group discussions on specific issues today and thursday while they discuss , others should consider the remainder of the season , that is , the next 10 days this suddenly is magic number time , that period usually reserved for the latter half of september when people start figuring out how many victories and losses it will take for one team to clinch first place or another to be eliminated from a race the season could resume after a strike , but figuring it wo n't , the yankees have h a clinching number of three any combination of yankees victories and baltimore defeats totaling three would clinch first place in the american league east the orioles face another clinching number the cleveland indians could still overtake the chicago white sox and be in first place in the al central aug 12 , but a combination of indians victories and orioles defeats totaling eight would knock the orioles out of of the al wildcard spot if the strike were settled in time to hold the playoffs the texas rangers' number is seven the al west leaders have to win seven of their remaining nine games to finish with a 500 record montreal s clinching number with atlanta in the national league east is seven after last night s games the los angeles dodgers need a combination of their victories and colorado losses totaling seven to end the rockies' wild dream of finishing first in their second season and then there are the mets if they win the nine games they have scheduled before aug 12 , they would finish third in the nl east , even if the philadelphia phillies were to win 9 of their last 10 games none of those numbers , though , was on the minds of the stars of the dick and don show yesterday as they staged their liveliest appearance yet unlike the first two episodes , in which they primarily answered moderators' questions , this time , after a few questions from charlie rose , they talked directly to each other and responded , sometimes with passion , to what the other said the shows ravitch and fehr have done have broken no new ground or elicited no pivotal revelations but one bit of information surfaced yesterday ravitch and the owners say that 19 teams are losing money , but they refuse to identify them fehr knows their identity , but is bound by a confidentiality agreement not to divulge any information but during yesterday s joint appearance , rose , referring to the 19 clubs , asked fehr what s going to surprise us , that the yankees are losing money \? that the white sox are losing money \? fehr did n't reply when the yankees were mentioned , but at the mention of the white sox , he said , yes , i think you might be surprised , yes was fehr saying the white sox are on the list of losers \? just 24 hours earlier jerry reinsdorf , the man who runs the white sox , said the club makes money are they on the list of 19 \? if so , why , if their chairman says they make money \? perhaps the only way for the owners to clarify this and other puzzles \( is it true , as reported , that the montreal expos are one of the nine clubs the owners' profitandloss report shows as making a profit \? \) is to disclose the names on the list ratings would go through the roof if on the next dick and don show the costars would identify the teams and discuss the validity of each case
an 11yearold brooklyn girl has died from neck injuries she received when she fell down a flight of stairs at her junior high school last week , the police said yesterday the girl , ayodell smith of 175 hawthorne street in crown heights , was declared braindead last friday at kings county hospital , ellen borakove , a spokeswoman for the medical examiner s officer , said she was placed on lifesupport systems so she could donate a kidney , and was removed from the systems wednesday night , ms borakove said on dec 6 , the girl was eating an orange when she tumbled down a flight of stairs about 3 pm near the main entrance of intermediate school 2 , at 655 parkside avenue in flatbush , according to school officials and the police she hit her head , lost consciousness and never regained it school officials have criticized emergency medical service workers for responding too slowly to the call for help at the school the child lay crumpled on the floor for about 30 minutes as school administrators tried to revive her and awaited the arrival of an ambulance but medical service officials said yesterday that dispatchers were never told that the child was unconscious , which would have led them to give the call priority ms borakove said that because of the nature of the injuries it would not have mattered when the ambulance arrived the cause of death was a broken neck , she said the fracture was high up on the cervical spine , making the injury fatal , she said it is our opinion that any time lag would have had no impact on the outcome , ms borakove said a board of education memorandum filed by georgianna land , who was acting principal of the school , described a harrowing scene of sobbing teachers and students as they waited for an ambulance the gym teacher knelt down to see if she was breathing and check her pulse , the memorandum said she had none while the child was on her back , the teacher did an airway check he called out 'obstructed airway' and he proceeded to try to clear the obstruction on the second try , a piece of orange was in her mouth he cleared her mouth with a finger sweep he then checked for a pulse there was no pulse david bookstaver , director of public information for the emergency medical service , said this is a unique situation with unique variables that resulted in a tragic outcome furthermore , after careful examination , we do n't find any malfeasance on the part of the new york city ems obviously , we express our condolences to the family
at first glance , there appeared to be nothing unusual about the twostory , tan brick , semiattached house at 25417 60th avenue in little neck despite being a multifamily dwelling , it otherwise blended in with the onefamily houses along the street that , with its neatly trimmed hedges , mowed lawns and numerous trees , looked as if it belonged in the suburbs rather than queens among the tenants were a young couple and two small children in the secondfloor apartment , described by neighbors as a regular family on a quiet street in a welltodo neighborhood yet men came and went late at night in expensive cars , neighbors said and residents wondered why if the cars were so grand there were no curtains on the windows in that secondfloor apartment instead , they were covered with paper and cardboard on saturday afternoon , to their shock , they found out acting on a search warrant , the police raided the apartment and arrested four men on charges that included criminal possession of drugs in the first degree and conspiracy to distribute them the police said that in the apartment they found 86 kilos of cocaine with a street value of 18 , 000 to 25 , 000 a kilo , and 777 , 180 in cash this was a stash house , capt michael gabriel of the manhattan north narcotics division said yesterday , where they counted the money and they stored the drugs there were still many questions left unanswered yesterday , like why a narcotics unit out of manhattan handled the case one possibility was that the arrests could be tied to investigations in that borough police officials declined to discuss such specifics , saying that the investigation was continuing but for the residents of an uppermiddleclass neighborhood , the revelation that a drug operation was apparently operating in their neighborhood came as a big surprise we 're extremely shocked , said joe manluco , 33 this has never happened in this community it s a very quiet community but it happened right where we live thinking about it for a moment , he said of those arrested maybe they think it s a quiet community and nobody would notice they tried to hide their heinous business by fitting in captain gabriel said at a press conference announcing the arrests that dealers often like to store their drugs away from their selling operations most stash houses are in quiet areas , he said none of those arrested lived in the apartment , which captain gabriel described as housing a wholesale operation they were identified as cesar gonzalez , 23 jose contrera , 30 eddie mendoza , 31 , and william duran , 30 the police did not release their addresses , although captain gabriel said they lived in queens neither the renter nor the landlord , who did not live on the premises , was implicated in the case the police gave no clue as to what happened to the family that lived in the apartment jennie kim , who lived next door , said the family moved in at the end of september i saw his wife when i took my daughter to school , ms kim said we said 'hi' she spoke english she had two boys , one a year and a half , the other maybe in kindergarten she was a nice lady in her mid20 s she looked so young , and she was always smiling ms kim added , they looked like a regular family but the cars coming and going acuras , bmw s , cadillacs raised suspicions we thought at first he was in auto sales or repairs , mr manluco said but , he added , we wondered how come they could n't afford curtains when they could have very expensive cars \? the cocaine was found in plastic envelopes in the open in the bathroom , the police said they said two handguns were recovered for fred rizzi , an architectural draftsman who lives across the street , the events of saturday bothered his sense of security drugs , and the evil they represent , had come to his beautiful , quiet and , until now , safe block it goes to show you it could happen anyplace in a decent residential neighborhood they feel safer , mr rizzi said even the drug dealers feel safe out here photo officers of the manhattan north narcotics division piling up 86 kilos of cocaine alongside about 777 , 000 in cash that they found in a drug stash house in the little neck section of queens neighbors expressed shock that such an operation could have existed on their quiet block \( rebecca cooney for the new york times \)
the 1970 s appropriated and reformed into fashion supper club acid jazz , an english movement that in theory mixes dance music and jazz , has been slowly bubbling in the pop underground for the last several years it has created a product that was neither jazz nor acid , and its synthetic pleasures have regularly been scuttled by an inordinate amount of musical incompetence galliano , one of the movement s most popular groups , played on thursday night , and the band had clearly been working on its pop craft and showmanship galliano is also the name of the band s leader , and he took the group even further from its label the band mixed rapping galliano himself can rap , if inarticulately with riffs and grooves lifted from all over the place , from rufus and isaac hayes to hiphop the show was firmly stuck in the 1970 s , but with a modern overlay it s fashion music the songs , mostly chants , were sung in part by val etienne , the band s singer , and galliano occasionaly chimed in the rhythm section , helped out by a percussionist , kept its textures familiar to anybody who had been awake during the 70 s , with the sounds of a clavinet clanking away next to the wahwah of a guitar and the chilled sound of a fender rhodes electric piano best of all , the band has actually started both to act like a band and to present an idiomatic sound , a rare thing in acid jazz the band also put itself forward as a collective , with a dancer prancing around with a jestertype figure during the chants , the whole band stayed in motion , and during solos the band members cheered on the soloists galliano rapped about the highway systems in britain , and the need to be happy , and none of it made any difference the band was after the supreme pleasure of dance music , the groove , and at points it got there that it s beginning to sound like a pop group only made the music better peter watrous
various antidotes by joanna scott 240 pages henry holt 20 various antidotes , the title of joanna scott s first collection of stories , refers , the reader quickly discovers , to her characters' strategies for coping with life the illness they are all combating is the chaos , randomness and uncertainty of existence their antidotes are , variously , faith , science , madness , psychotherapy and obsession as her novels have so hauntingly demonstrated , ms scott possesses a magnetic attraction to the strange , the unsettling and the uncanny in fading , my parmacheene belle \( 1987 \) , she recounts the adventures of an ancient fisherman and a 15yearold prostitute who hit the road together after the fisherman s wife of 53 years develops cancer and dies in the closest possible union \( 1988 \) , she chronicles a 19thcentury slave ship s voyage , which culminates in a grisly act of mutiny and in arrogance \( 1990 \) , she improvises upon the life and times of egon schiele , the viennese artist who was accused of selling pornography and seducing a minor art , for ms scott s schiele , is a tool for reinventing , and thereby possessing , the world like memory , it s a way of transforming the past and making it conform to the expectations and demands of his own voracious imagination the characters in various antidotes some taken from history , some invented by ms scott similarly latch onto vocations that spur them to great accomplishment and seemingly give them a means of remaking their worlds in more cases than not , their vision soon turns into an obsession that threatens to warp their lives , and the lives of those who love them this , ms scott suggests , as she did in arrogance , is the price of genius this is the price of achievement as yeats once wrote the intellect of man is forced to choose perfection of the life , or of the work the hero of concerning mold upon the skin , etc , for instance , is an amateur scientist , whose experiments with a microscope will forever change the nature of belief nothing visible to the naked eye could be trusted anymore , ms scott writes , for everything had a secret microscopic life he , the master of magnification , had made visible the unimaginable the cost of this achievement , however , is high like the protagonist of hawthorne s famous story rappaccini s daughter , ms scott s hero will choose to let his head completely subordinate his heart , and in doing so will lose both his family and his good name many of the other characters in this volume are also people who trade the ordinary pleasures and responsibilities of life , to family and community , for the solitary rewards of scientific or pseudoscientific research in chloroform jags , a midwife who wants to master the mysteries of chloroform to help ease the pain of her patients becomes addicted to the drug herself in tumbling , a laboratory supplier becomes obsessed with the mice he has been breeding for experiments , and allows his business to run amok and in bees , bees , bees , a wealthy blind man finds his study of honeybees turning into an entire system in his head , even as his affection for his wife and son begins to wither and die the deterioration of his love was as gradual and irresistible as the deterioration of his body , writes ms scott he much prefers his bees to his family this has been true from the beginning , but now the orchard is more than his laboratory it is his refuge not all the people in various antidotes are scientists , of course , but all of them , both the fictional ones and the ones based on historical figures , are people motivated by a single overarching passion or a sense of mission none of these individuals are remotely endearing or sympathetic their fascination derives from their fanaticism , their willful embrace of the extreme there s charlotte corday , the french patriot who stabbed jeanpaul marat to death in his bath there s dorothea dix , the samaritan who dedicated her life to the founding of institutions for the insane and there s william burke , who was supposedly hanged in 1829 for murdering people and selling their cadavers to a professor of medicine the heroine of you must relax spends all of her time reliving the moment her husband and friends discovered her adulterous affair and the narrator of convicta et combusta spends the waning days of her life obsessing about a horrible event she saw at a coney island fair the electrocution of a killer elephant weird , disturbing scenes like this float to the surface of these stories , lodging uncomfortably but implacably in the reader s mind although some of the stories in this book rely too heavily on their simple oddness to capture one s attention , ms scott s skills as a writer help to redeem even the weakest tales her eye for the curious detail , her virtuosic control of her prose , her refusal to sentimentalize her characters and her sheer talent for making the incongruous seem plausible and real these gifts turn what might have been just an eclectic collection into a fascinating little museum of human behavior photo joanna scott \( obadiah eves henry holt company \)
in october 1992 an obituary with this headline ran in the new york times harold brown sr , 61 , investment executive that description was right , as far as it went , but it did not capture the essence of mr brown s life if it had , it would have read harold brown sr , 61 , did good for a long time i 've been meaning to write this particular column , and it s somehow fitting that it turns out to be my last for more than 20 years i 've been a reporter , a job that people say is sure to make you cynical and has somehow only left me more idealistic for the last five i 've been here , in this space , considering the great issues of the day but the great issues , at base , are the same as they were when john the baptist said , he that has two coats , let him give one to him that has none the great issues are the same as they were when charles dickens created the ghost of jacob marley , misanthropic man of business mankind was my business , the specter cried , the lesson learned too late the common welfare was my business that is the most important thing i have learned in the newspaper business , that our business is one another time after time , story after story , i have learned it from everyday angels mr brown , who saw the homeless on midtown subway grates and , instead of looking away , organized a small shelter in his parish church , was one so was arlene carmen , who died earlier this year she spent her nights in a van on eighth avenue , bringing coffee and cake and a place to consider the future to street prostitutes like ebenezer scrooge , i 've walked the streets , seen goodness in the dark places , and shed the frosty rime that s said to come with my profession i 've visited the holy apostles soup kitchen in manhattan , where every day volunteers feed 1 , 000 hungry people , and the york street project in jersey city , home and school alike for women looking for a second chance i 've been to schools where teachers bring imagination and intellect to life , and hospitals where the nurses bring comfort and joy this morning i could visit tavern on the green , where the robin hood foundation is having its annual breakfast founded by three antimarleys , wall street traders who cleaned up big time in the 80 s and decided to invest in empathy , the foundation gives money to groups that shelter , feed and fight for the city s poor leaders of those groups will speak of their work , and the who swho audience will , as always , be dazzled by the simple spectacle of unabashed humanity they do dazzle , the everyday angels , just as the angel did in the christmas story , scaring the wits out of the shepherds but the angel said fear not , and that s what i 've learned from its contemporary counterparts the rape counselors , the good cops , the nuns , the librarians life will be hard , politics will be mean , money will be scarce , bluster will be plentiful yet somehow good will be done i 've been lucky to be in this business at a time that was infinitely interesting , when women were more welcome i 've been lucky to work at a newspaper that stands for the very best that newspapers can provide , lucky to have had a conversation in print with millions of familiar strangers i 've gone places i never would have gone , met people i never would have met the greatest of them are these ellen baxter , al cohall , steven mcdonald , all the others you know who you are you stand in opposition to a spiritual isolationism that makes icicles of our insides and a hard little lump of coal of our hearts karma is a boomerang , it says on the tip cup at a village coffee bar if we do not reach out , it is we who will be alone the great issues are the same as they were when 15yearold anne frank , three weeks shy of discovery in her attic hideaway , less than a year from death in bergenbelsen , wrote in her shabby plaid diary in spite of everything i still believe that people are really good at heart fear not anne was right the heavenly hosts prove it every day , in coney island , in washington heights , in flushing , with cots , with comfort , with boxes of tissues on their desks i leave you with good tidings of great joy those who shun the prevailing winds of cynicism and anomie can truly fly
east rutherford , nj , dec 10 one could talk about their impeccable defense , how they challenged nearly every shot or that 35point first quarter that set the tone most of all , though , the nets stopped bickering and started running again kenny anderson and derrick coleman worked their game of pickandroll to perfection , the defense of p j brown made dominique wilkins look very old and the nets continued their penchant for the unpredictable they followed their worst loss of the season with their largest margin of victory at byrne meadowlands arena tonight , taking the boston celtics out of their offense early and winning , 10896 , before a crowd of 14 , 949 if they have to have another team meeting , that 'll be cool , said the firstyear coach , butch beard , holding back a laugh after the game beard was referring to the playersonly meeting held after friday s practice , stemming from the team s 133106 loss to the phoenix suns and the controversy that followed thursday chris morris returned to the lineup after beard benched the small forward for showing up at the shootaround with his shoelaces untied twice in the past week morris , who requested a trade after thursday s loss to phoenix , had his moments , with five offensive rebounds , two steals and two assists in 25 minutes while morris was unrepentant for his words , he did seem more at ease beard seemed to put the fracas behind him the nets \( 813 \) triumphed for the first time in three games and for only the second time in eight games if there was any doubt about this one , beard erased it with 2 minutes 16 seconds remaining by summoning the bench brothers rick mahorn and dwayne schintzius into the game boston fell to 811 as it played without the injured xavier mcdaniel and dino radja , whose broken hand has sidelined him for most of the season the former net point guard david wesley led the celtics with 23 points , but he was clearly outplayed by anderson dee brown had a miserable night from the field for boston , hitting 1 of 12 shots and finishing with 3 points eric montross scored 19 and grabbed 11 rebounds for the celtics wilkins shot 4 of 21 from the field and finished with 9 points , thanks in large part to brown s defense he finished with 15 points , 4 rebounds and 4 blocked shots i could n't buy a shot tonight , wilkins said indeed , brown took everything but his wallet , using his elongated arms to contest every shot he put up he was getting frustrated , i could tell , brown said he started talking back to fans in the third quarter and that s not like him anderson \( 22 points , 15 assists \) and coleman \( 16 points , 15 rebounds , 5 blocked shots \) basically took over the game with their combination of dazzle and muscle in the first half the nets shot 549 percent from the field compared to boston s 376 percent they pushed their lead to as much as 22 with 10 minutes left in the game before a few defensive lapses gave the celtics some life this has gotten us off the schneid , beard said you could tell they had a meeting with the way they came out they were ready to play and focused the first quarter was one of the better quarters we played this season rex walters started his first national basketball association game ahead of the struggling sean higgins walters , who pulled his back in practice on friday , finished with 8 points on 4of8 shooting his decisionmaking in the open floor was flawless , however , as the nets spread the floor and ran the break with efficiency benoit benjamin added 15 points and 10 rebounds , and the stomach ailment plaguing him thursday night has gone away for the time being as to how much the team meeting helped , none of the nets would elaborate too early to tell seemed to be the mostcommon response
once again , the old guy did n't get it living in the city , he was aware that there were more and more people who were wearing rings in their noses , lips and ears hipper people than himself told him that many women were having their belly buttons perforated so that they could attach rings he went to see for himself , visiting a store called the gauntlet on fifth avenue near 18th street a sign on the door leading to the secondstory shop said that store was now staying open seven days a week we 're doing it because of the demand for the navel piercings , said keith alexander , one of four piercers at the wellappointed store where customers can actually choose to be punctured in any of more than 30 body parts so that metal jewelry can be anchored as he spoke , five women in their 20 s and 30 s sat on soft leather armchairs and couches , waiting to be called to cubicles in the back where the piercings are carried out it was the lunch hour and all of the women looked as if they had come from their workplaces they were dressed unremarkably in business suits and dresses none wore any jewelry more exotic than earrings one was there with her boyfriend so do you have to put any kind of antibiotic cream on \? asked one of the customers as she leafed through a catalogue showing available ear , eyebrow , lip , tongue , nipple and more intimately positioned adornments you might not want to believe no , any antibacterial soap will do fine , said mr alexander , who had nine pieces of jewelry on his face including a small but attention getting stud a half inch below his mouth he said he had 10 others elsewhere on his body you mean like dial \? the customer asked that s all you 'll need , mr alexander said the customer smiled and then , as her name was called , she went back with no evident hesitation to have her belly button punctured mr alexander , apparently amused by the old guy s mystification , continued to explain the piercing business three years ago , we might have done one navel a day , he said now we 're doing about 20 every weekday and as many as 50 each on saturdays and sundays it s the result of all those models showing their navel rings he said the procedure costs 35 and that the jewelry starts at 32 and can cost much more like all piercings at the gauntlet , the bellybutton procedure is carried out without anesthesia and takes no longer than a second or two the old guy kept wondering how significant all this was did it reflect the pull of some atavistic urge \? was it just a case of epataying the bourgeoisie \? was n't he the bourgeoisie \? how mainstream was it \? would his wife get a bellybutton ring some day \? would his daughter \? would he \? and if so , what else \? mr alexander explained that after navels , the next most popular piercings at the shop were ear lobes or nostrils but we 're doing more and more tongues , he said it s relatively painless piercing , but it gives you really great shock value the store , he said , is part of a chain we have outlets in san francisco , hollywood , london , paris and new york it started in san francisco , and manufactures the jewelry on sale originally , it catered to the gay leather community later , there were punks and customers who wanted nose rings and lip rings and eyebrow jewelry largely to shock people mr alexander , who was born in bay ridge 31 years ago , said interest in piercing broadened around 1986 that s when things started to go mainstream , he said all sorts of people started to adorn their bodies in different ways more and more men , straight as well as gay , wore earrings women were getting tattoos and showing them tattoos became more and more distinctive and individualized mr alexander s arms are heavily covered with intricate designs i 've got 50 hours worth of tattoos , he said a musician and a commercial artist , mr alexander began working for the gauntlet in 1986 he said the company had provided a year of training unlike tattooing , which has technically been against the law in the five boroughs for the last decade , piercing is not regulated , even though it can involve bleeding mr alexander says he would welcome inspections , confident that the store s procedures would easily pass any test of hygiene and safety looking for more answers , the old guy visited matty jankowski , a tattoo artist who is the founder of the new york body archive , a oneroom exhibition hall at 9 west ninth avenue that he describes as a public resource center and clearinghouse dedicated to tattooing , piercing , body modification , branding and scarification mr jankowski said that it was clear that bellybutton piercing was going mainstream obviously something is going on , said the curator , whose hall is open on weekends the old guy was left talking to himself de gustibus , he muttered chacun a son gout to each his own he did n't believe a word of it
at a suncoast motion picture store in connecticut , the scene resembles that at video outlets everywhere from floor to ceiling are hundreds of videos for sale at prices as low as 599 suncoast , a national chain , only sells videos and does n't rent them , but the situation points up a strong overall trend customers are buying tapes of all kinds in large quantities and at prices that keep dropping last year , consumers spent almost as much to buy videos as they did to rent them this fall , the biggest sales titles have been jurassic park and snow white and the seven dwarfs distributors say , however , that sales of both have slumped a bit and they may have peaked before christmas already talk has turned to the next two titles expected to sell in great numbers the lion king , due in march , and forrest gump , to be released in april in the front of the suncoast store are stacks of speed , currently no 1 on some bestseller lists , and tombstone , formerly a best renter and now , with its price cut to 1999 , a best seller also evident are christmas packages , generally in the 70 to 80 category special editions of schindler s list \( 13998 \) , dances with wolves , citizen kane , my fair lady , fantasia , breakfast at tiffany s , gone with the wind , beauty and the beast and baseball a film by ken burns \( 17998 \) but the primary products appear to be hundreds of movies of all eras and genres priced at 1299 and less sales of jurassic park can obscure the fact that consumers are buying all kinds films , especially if the price is right one distributor that can offer proof of this is united american video of charlotte , nc the company works the seams of the movie market , looking for the kinds of older titles people want to collect , duplicating the tapes in its own plant and distributing them to outlets like suncoast , where they sell at prices from 399 to 1299 much of what united american video distributes is pure b movie , but there is a higher level we 're not talking about b movies so much as older reissued movies , said jerry pettus jr , the president of the firm by that he means major feature films that were originally released on tape by studio video divisions after , say , five or seven years on the market , the studio might become disinterested and let video rights revert to the producers the producers then go looking for somebody to remarket the movies at a lower price point , mr pettus said recent examples , all licensed to united american video , include all of me , the 1984 carl reiner film starring steve martin and lily tomlin the bounty , the 1984 film with mel gibson and anthony hopkins , and best seller , a 1987 movie with james woods in cases like these , united american video repackages the films in the extendedplay mode , a duplicating method that packs more movie onto less tape extended play lowers picture quality , but it also lowers the price to about 10 or , if the title is older and in the

washington the united states is in danger of making a bad situation in haiti even worse we seem to be laying the groundwork for military intervention , which would get us into a quagmire if the administration orders an invasion to restore president jeanbertrand aristide , it will be making a grave mistake there are better ways to help the democratic process even if , given our superior forces , father aristide were back in office within a few days , in the long run an occupation would immerse us in the morass of haitian nationbuilding a futile exercise , surely haiti has struggled unsuccessfuly with this task for nearly two centuries the clinton administration inherited a bush administration policy toward haiti that was dead in the water its own approach has also been flawed it has mistakenly embraced father aristide , who has shown no flexibility it has tightened economic sanctions , which will increase the regime s blackmarket profits and the misery of the haitian people this , in turn , will increase the number of refugees , threatening to make the proposed offshore processing of them an insurmountable task when it becomes clear that the new policies will not work , the administration , if we understand its hints , will resort to invasion even if father aristide were returned to office behind the bayonets of a multinational force sponsored by the united nations or the us , what then \? the haitian military and its paramilitary allies would fade out of sight to undertake guerrilla activities against the occupying force an occupation would not be the clean operation that some interventionists imagine , even with our overwhelming power we could expect casualties and humiliations reminiscent of those in somalia we might even succeed in uniting the disparate haitian political forces against us we would be dragged into settling their differences , but predictably could not satisfy various factions in the end , we would wind up scapegoats additionally , unilateral intervention would stir up longstanding antiinterventionist sentiment in the southern hemisphere in short , returning father aristide to portauprince would be the beginning , not the end , of washington s problems he would have to be sustained in power we would have to protect his life at least through the end of his term , in december 1995 \( or longer , according to his calculations he maintains that his term was interrupted when he was deposed in december 1991 , eight months after he took office and a year after he was elected \) and given father aristide s tendencies , once in power he might negate our attempts to sow the seeds of democracy in haiti our brief invasions of grenada and panama provide no justification for overrunning haiti in both cases , our goals were limited and involved no nationbuilding even the house , on may 24 , approved a resolution opposing military intervention there is a better approach the white house ought to drop father aristide permanently hardly a democrat , he is part of the problem , not the solution although he is the product of an election , his authoritarian behavior while in office briefly does not augur well for democracy moreover , despite the administration s embrace of father aristide , he has bitten the hand that has been trying to feed him by refusing to compromise with his opponents instead , together with the organization of american states we should press for negotiations with haiti s military regime our object would be to start building a democratic process , beginning with a new presidential election as soon as suitable procedures could be put in place this would require several things the departure of today s military leaders from power barring father aristide from returning \( other democrats can be found to support \) international observers for proper elections dismantling all paramilitary organizations , and a multinational effort to professionalize the haitian military and police to put pressure on the military leaders to negotiate a transfer of power , we should continue the tough sanctions against them personally no international recognition , no traveling abroad , no access to their frozen financial and property assets overseas although the international sanctions against haiti s leaders themselves should continue , the trade sanctions against haiti should be lifted they punish innocent people and add to their misery , including forcing them into boats to flee to the us , only to be turned back in any case , all the sanctions since 1991 have been ineffective instead of coercing the military into accepting the return of father aristide , they are providing blackmarket profits to the military and its allies we should be encouraging the private sector in the us to resume economic operations in haiti , a major source of income for the impoverished haitians ending our support for father aristide should induce the military leaders to cooperate with us , because they would no longer have to fear for their lives if he returned we would be offering them a facesaving way out it would help break the deadlock while relieving the haitians' economic hardship , which has gained us nothing those contemplating direct involvement in nationbuilding ought to hark back to our occupation of haiti from 1914 to 1933 when we arrived , we encountered no vestige of democracy when we departed , we left none an invasion today would very likely lead to the same result drawing
there is something about a bomb attack like the letter bombings in the unabom case or wednesday s firebombing on the subway that provoke a particularly intense fear the explosions seem to come out of nowhere , transforming an ordinary routine like going to work or opening a package into a deadly act and , there is the randomness of it , the fact that it can seemingly happen anyplace and at any time yet despite last week s explosion on the subway , which injured more than 40 people , as well as the vastly larger blast at the world trade center nearly two years ago , officials and experts on security and terrorism were cautioning against overreacting to what were terrible but very rare incidents i do n't mean to sound callous about the tragedy of people injured in the subway attack , or killed by the unabomber , said brian jenkins , the deputy chairman of kroll associates , an investigative and corporate security firm but in the united states , with 24 , 000 homicides a year , an american has a 1in10 , 000 probability of being murdered , while the odds of being killed by a terrorist bomb are something less than 1 in 100 million , which is a ten thousandfold difference the incidents and the resulting consternation highlight a paradox on one hand , the incidents produce a kind of fear on the part of the public , in large part because they attract inordinate amounts of publicity but the fact remains that terrorism , while scary and headlinegrabbing , is , compared with other hazards , a minor threat there is no failsafe for these things , just as there are no failsafes if you 're walking on a street or in a shopping mall , said lieut robert j valentino , a spokesman for the new york transit police but these are very isolated incidents we had one last week and there was the one the week before prior to that , we ca n't even think of the last time something like that happened what has made the letterbomb killing of a new jersey advertising executive and last week s subway bomb seem particularly alarming is that they both occurred while people still have fresh memories of the explosion at the world trade center in february 1993 , in which six people were killed the trade center blast was a mammoth one , and the recent explosions minuscule in comparison they varied also in technical sophistication in the unabom case the explosive was more intricate , while the subway explosive was crude and yet the bombings share several basic characteristics one common feature is that , as in most terror bombings , the trade center attack , the unabom attack and the subway attack would have been very difficult to prevent security experts say that the measures needed to bring about perfect security would be so expensive and so intrusive that they would be impossible and undesirable in a democratic society one reason for the difficulty of preventing such attacks is the simple freedom of movement that exists in american cities , and the impracticality of systematically searching people who go into subways or shopping centers or parking garages or movie theaters the transit authority once considered placing metal detectors at certain subway stations , but did not go ahead with the idea because of logistics and constitutional concerns a second reason such attacks cannot easily be thwarted is that almost anybody can make a bomb if he or she is determined to do it some explosives are very difficult to make , of course , said edward m roy , an explosives expert at the new mexico institute of mining and technology however , a lot of them are easy they 're made of materials that you can go to the hardware store and the greenhouse to get even the unabom attacker , who is known for the high craftsmanship of his devices , would not have needed any special training in weaponry , electronics or explosives he does not have to be former military , or a chemical engineer or anything special , mr jenkins said he added that while it takes skill to make a letter bomb , a crude device , like the one used in the subway , requires only a jar of gasoline , some wires , a battery and an alarm clock one readily available book , the anarchist cookbook , for example , has recipes for pipe bombs and other explosives published by barricade books in new york , the book , which is essentially a compilation of material from police and military manuals , has sold two million copies since it was first published in 1971 it s sold in large quantity around university campuses , because it is sort of a gag to have it , said lyle stuart , the publisher of barricade books but no one really uses it , as far as we know a bomb is , in fact , a relatively simple device it requires just four main ingredients , none of them difficult to get first is a flammable material or an explosive , like gunpowder or ammonium nitrate , an ingredient in garden fertilizer second is a source of power , usually a battery somewhat more difficult to make is the third ingredient , a fuse or detonator to make a spark the fourth is some kind of timing device , so the bomber can make it go off when he wants it to but the real difficulty lies in putting these parts together in an effective bomb , experts say a poorly constructed device , like the one apparently used in the subway , can do as much damage to the plotter as to the intended victims while there is virtually no feasible method for preventing every determined bomber , there are a few signs to watch for lieutenant valentino says that people should notify the transit police if they see a suspicious package , particularly a package left unattended , on the subway letter bombs tend to have a lot of stamps , rather than a post office franking stamp , because the bomber , presumably , does not want to come face to face with a postal clerk there might well be no return address it might have a peculiar smell , or there might be grease marks on it , from leaked explosives
warriors at heart one would expect an armynavy store to sell army and navy clothing but tanks , ambulances and jeeps \? so many military vehicles are parked in front of the new armynavy store in bayport that customers have a hard time finding a place to park parking is a big problem , said george homfeld , coowner of the store , military connection inc so i took the ambulance with the red cross insignia home one day and parked it in my own driveway but the neighbors complained i live in a condo so now i only bring home the jeep not as big a problem there the camouflaged jeep blends into the shrubbery but then so does mr homfeld he dresses in camouflage as well i love everything about the military , he said maybe that s because i was never in it the dog tags he wears are blank those of his partner , michael kulak of islip , however , have had some use i was an air force photographer , mr kulak said did he see any action \? only the dc riots in '69 , he said mr homfeld traces his love of the military back to his first gi joe toy mr kulak traces his love back to the first time he bought a military vehicle i was driving it back from the docks , he said , and two people stopped me along the way and offered to buy it i thought , hmm , i may have something here he began collecting old military vehicles and restoring them mr homfeld started doing the same they met as members of the long island military vehicle club we recently reenacted dday , mr homfeld said we took over a riverhead beach we had fireworks and everything that day they spoke only german , mr homfeld s wife , diane , said they love their military thing the two men decided that others might too so they opened the store mrs homfeld helps run it i was recruited , she said but she finds the customers fascinating a man from the fire island pines came in the other day , she said he asked me to decorate his house he saw our store and decided to have a party with a military theme all his guests were dressed in uniform plus he got permission for us to barge over some of the military vehicles so he could put them on his front lawn the hand grenades he probably put in the house they 're for sale for 6 each they make good paperweights , mr homfeld said they 're hollowed out most of the products come from government auctions and private dealers like the flashing mine markers they 'd be good for lighting your swimming pool , mr kulak said it s the clothes , however , that seem the most popular i wear the boots and the bdu pants , a customer , rigel fisco of sayville , said that s for battle dress uniform but i do n't wear the shirt i'm militant , but not that much browsing through the green and red berets , steve katchusky of mastic could n't decide what to buy this is great , ' he said mr katchusky is in the army reserve the clothes here are cheaper than what i pay the army , he said price was n't the reason erin murphy of coram was shopping in an armynavy store i want to buy combat boots , she said i like the way they look with long skirts searching for treasure john hoffman lives in the middle of a quasi gold field how does he feel when people with pails hover around his house searching for elusive treasure \? i do n't really mind , mr hoffman said as treasure seekers plundered his suffolk property the other day with two children , aged 2 and 3 , mr hoffman said he does n't have time to look for treasure if others want to , he wishes them well and so the search continued for the booty of the day the elusive beach plum years ago , beach plum jelly was a long island staple but as beach plums became harder to find , so did jars of the homemade jelly with deer eating the beach plums on the south shore , and severe winters eroding the crop on both shores , beach plums have become an endangered species but then came a veteran plumpicking voice i know a great place for beach plums , said chris bodkin of west sayville last year they were so plentiful you could fill your pail in about 10 minutes and they were right by the road by the road \? that was like saying captain kidd s treasure was by the jones beach toll booths picking beach plums near a road means less contact with poison ivy , which grows in the same sandy soil as beach plums for poison ivy , it s always a bumper crop , said one plum enthusiast , karla smart of setauket and west meadow beach mr bodkin s secret spot was west meadow beach road near old field on the way there he reminisced about growing up in a house where beach plum picking and jelly making was part of his mother s autumn routine now i make the 20 to 30 jars each year , he said that is if he can find the beach plums he is not alone in searching walking along west meadow beach road with pails in hand , were gloria and walter pulley of blue point we usually pick in westhampton , mrs pulley said , but this year there are none so someone told us about this place mrs pulley was concerned about the site being disclosed one can only hope that those who choose to go plum picking on west meadow beach road will follow a certain etiquette the area is dotted with small beach cottages built on land owned by the town of brookhaven since this is town land people can pick anywhere , bob terry , a resident , said , but there is a certain politeness that everybody follows like not picking under someone s window i had no idea they were so popular , said damen reschke , 20 , as people picked plums under the deck he was standing on my grandmother use to make beach plum jelly , he said but my grandmother was always making something weird i thought that was just one of her weird things the weird irony about west meadow beach plums , mr hoffman said , is that they may soon be gone brookhaven is considering bulldozing all the homes and shrubbery in west meadow homeowners are fighting the town this was just a huge sandbar before the houses were built , said mr hamilton , who is vice president of west meadow beach cottage owners association but the cottages act as a barrier trapping the sand and the beach plum plants so if you want beach plums , mr hoffman said , you 've got to keep the houses it s an interesting defense strategy with strings attached with the us open and the waldbaum s hamlet cup only an expressway jam apart , the pros have been practicing and playing all over long island john mcenroe recently played in amagansett the guitar , that is mr mcenroe and his band interplanetary appeared at the stephen talkhouse he put on a good show , said jim lawler of the talkhouse in front of an almost sold crowd of abut 150 , mr mcenroe performed heavy rock he wore his signature head bandanna as he played the guitar and sang he picks his tunes well , mr lawler said he did jimi hendrix and the james gang mr mcenroe probably chose the hamptons' club for his long island debut because he is friends with the owner , peter honerkamp they grew up in douglaston together , mr lawler said unlike some tennis crowds , the rock and roll fans seemed to appreciate mr mcenroe s fiery antics the crowd stayed til the end , mr lawler said that s usually a good sign photo george homfeld , left , with michael kulak and his son carl in an armored vehicle in front of their armynavy store in bayport \( steve berman for the new york times \)
tokyo , jan 23 the defeat of japanese electoral reforms on friday did not just crush the ambitions of prime minister morihiro hosokawa and his awkward coalition it also blocked the complex political revolution that he had helped set loose it remains unlikely , though , that the forces pushing for change will be turned back entirely young , unafraid of the old political taboos , and a gifted salesman with a seductively understated manner , mr hosokawa charmed the public from the moment he took office last summer with the idea that he would bring major changes to japan s outmoded political and economic structures , and that the changes would be relatively painless making change seem easy within his first few weeks as prime minister , he issued the apology for japan s world war ii aggression that none of his predecessors were able to utter , vilified the corruption and collusion that characterized the previous 38 years of liberal democratic party rule and vowed to make consumers , rather than corporate japan , the beneficiaries of government policy mr hosokawa made it seem so easy to talk down the old order , and he was so encouraged by his soaring approval ratings and popularity with the clinton administration that he continued to add to the list , with few questioning whether all of the goals were attainable , or even if they were compatible in effect , mr hosokawa transformed the breakup of the liberal democrats last summer , popular disillusionment over political corruption and impatience with japan s stingy living standards into not one but a series of revolutions the punishing reversal in parliament last week was merely the latest sign that this agenda had grown too ambitious mr hosokawa vowed to put a younger generation in power , to rein in government bureaucrats and have elected officials set policy , to shift the balance of power in parliament to urban districts from the rural constituencies , to rescue the economy from a deep recession , to lower the astronomical prices consumers here must pay , to realign the political parties toward the center , to open the economy and to make ideas rather than cash the currency of political debate feeling of revolution any one of these would have represented a sea change for this conservative nation , but a popular notion spread that the transformation was inevitable because of the end of the cold war and the growing realization that the workers who were responsible for creating japan s wealth were enjoying precious little of it the wave of revolutions found particular resonance in the clinton white house , since it dovetailed neatly with the president s own agenda and seemed likely to reduce mounting trade frictions mr hosokawa only complicated his task when he determined that the electoral and campaign finance laws had to be overhauled before he reached for his other goals the vote on friday thus underscored the fact that , so far at least , the high hopes for fundamental change were a product of oratory rather than action in a sense , the popularity of the coalition when it was formed was too high , said kazuo aichi , the head of the defense agency and a senior figure in mr hosokawa s government it just created problems by encouraging the prime minister to address too many things in fact , mr hosokawa had already faced serious setbacks on several of these fronts before the vote in parliament on his reform package on friday assault on bureaucracy the most telling losses have come in his unceasing battles to seize control of the government ministries from the bureaucrats who run them last fall , mr hosokawa established a blueribbon advisory commission of business and academic leaders to prepare a report on a sweeping plan for deregulating and opening the economy it was a clear assault on the bureaucracy , since regulations are the heart of its power but the commission s final report in december was widely seen as vague , halfhearted and lacking teeth because of bureaucratic resistance still , as haruo shimada , a keio university professor and adviser to the prime minister , pointed out , some changes appeared to be taking place despite mr hosokawa s miscalculations because of the powerful undercurrents at work here with or without mr hosokawa , something seems to be happening in japan , even if it is not certain what with the prospect growing that mr hosokawa s government will fall and new elections will be held soon , the voters may get a chance to decide whether they are willing to risk what would be the biggest revolution of all holding their elected leaders accountable for pushing through the changes they say japan must endure

political primaries rarely draw crowds , especially primaries for midterm elections but new yorkers may be about to set a new record for low turnout on tuesday when both the republicans and the democrats hold their primaries it was , after all , a miserably hot summer poison for campaigning the jewish holiday of rosh hashanah cut two days out of the already compressed postlabor day campaign week , when voters traditionally start to pay attention and the leading candidates at the top of their tickets gov mario m cuomo and state senator george e pataki feel so sure of victory on tuesday that they 're already running against each other no other races have energized the public , nor is there the slightest hint that the public is interested in being energized it could be , predict the political analysts , that as few as 500 , 000 democrats will vote , about 12 percent of the 41 million registered and on the republican side , the turnout in the contest between richard m rosenbaum and mr pataki could be lower than in the last republican primary for governor , 12 years ago , when about 25 percent of the enrolled republicans voted in most races , the likelihood of a low turnout is n't affecting campaign strategy because the contests are neither close nor crowded and the incumbents have the edge not so in the contest for attorney general the public s lack of interest , along with the confusing , fourway field and large undecided electorate , has forced candidates to adopt the political equivalent of narrowcasting since fewer than 200 , 000 democrats could elect someone , the candidates and their strategists have to figure out who their likely voters are , play to them and try to pull them to the polls running for police chief separating from the pack is no easy task , especially since except for eliot l spitzer s support for the death penalty the candidates are not all that different they are all moderatetoliberal new york city democrats , no matter what they say in their ads but they have to distinguish themselves from one other , so two mr spitzer and the brooklyn district attorney , charles j hynes are acting as if they are running for police chief by focusing on crimefighting in television ads replete with guns and bullets in fact , as mr hynes and mr spitzer a former assistant district attorney in manhattan must know , the attorney general defends the state and brings lawsuits on consumer fraud , environmental issues , civil rights and the like prosecutors prosecute and legislators write laws to combat crime that is the way new york s government happens to be structured but crimefighting sells these days , even to the generally liberal new york primary voter the incumbent , g oliver koppell , is emphasizing his experience and aggressively using the job he has held for nine months to get more publicity than he got in a lifetime as a state assemblyman karen s burstein is focusing on her experience as a former family court judge and legislator , as well as on her sex , by speaking to issues important to women and saying that people should n't vote for her because she is a woman but because of her experience which reminds people she is the only woman in the race mailing , phoning , paying religion , ethnicity , geography and sexual orientation count in a primary like this , too , because they distinguish one candidate from another , and because this is new york three candidates are jewish , one is irish catholic , one is a gay woman mr hynes is counting on brooklyn votes mr koppell , who represented a bronx district in the legislature for years , has a base in the bronx ms burstein once represented a long island district in the state senate , so is hoping for support there all three , depending on how much money they have , are sending out mailings and telephoning their likely voters mr spitzer has no elective background but he is wealthy , thanks to a family realestate business , so he is spending over 2 million of his own money on television ads , vastly more than any other candidate has even raised all four have bought television ads television advertising is wasteful and inefficient in a primary like this , because it reaches everybody watching , even republicans but it is essential , say the consultants paid to make the ads without television , they say , voters do n't take candidates seriously even campaign workers begin to wonder what s up if they do n't see their candidates on the air it s also a way to influence to some extent free press coverage , said ms burstein s campaign consultant , hank morris if i want to get an article in the new york times , i put a new commercial on tv and you do a box on it of course , if someone does not want to vote , nothing will work , not direct mail or telephone calls or television ads or free media none of the candidates this year has figured out how to address the public s low regard for their profession , but come tuesday when the polls close , that wo n't be an issue anymore at least not until the next campaign photo state attorney general g oliver koppell marching yesterday in a parade in the bronx he is one

cheiry , switzerland , oct 5 fortyeight people were found dead early today in what appears to have been a collective suicide and killing carried out almost simultaneously in two swiss villages by members of a secretive religious sect known as the order of the solar temple two other people linked to the sect were found dead in a small canadian town 50 miles northwest of montreal twentythree bodies were found in a firedamaged farmhouse in this tiny village 48 miles north of geneva 25 were found in three burnedout chalets at grangessursalvan , 47 miles east of geneva swiss , french and canadian citizens , including some children , were among the dead in cheiry , the police said that 20 of the victims had bullet wounds , and that 9 of those also had plastic bags over their heads most victims were found on a lower level of the farmhouse that was undamaged by fire they were wearing ceremonial robes and were lying in a circle with their heads pointing outward , near what seemed to be a small chapel investigators left open the possibility that more bodies might be found and that some victims were murdered the third chalet that was damaged by fire at grangessursalvan was not immediately searched fully for fear it might be boobytrapped the police speculated that sect members may also have died at other sites that have not been discovered all the fires appeared to have been set with a sophisticated starter system linking telephones , timers , heating rods and gasoline and benzene swiss experts in cults said the order of the solar temple was founded at least a decade ago by luc jouret , a 46yearold belgianborn physician who often preached of a coming apocalypse it is not known if mr jouret died today he owned two of the three chalets at grangessursalvan and was reported to have owned one of the two houses that burned at morin heights , 50 miles northwest of montreal , where two other bodies were found villagers in both cheiry and grangessursalvan said they were unaware of the sect s activities and had had little contact with those who died the only odd thing is that the lights were often on all night , said albert torche , a farmer in cheiry although sects have long been active in switzerland , it was the first mass suicide by sect members in europe in memory it was promptly compared to the deaths of 80 branch davidian members outside waco , tex , last year and the suicide of more than 900 followers of the rev jim jones in jonestown , guyana , in 1978 the swiss police said they had so far found no explanation for the deaths investigators said that an audio cassette was taped to the front door of the farmhouse in cheiry , and that while it had not been fully studied , it seemed to contain astrological information a former member of the sect said he did not recall discussions about possible collective suicides but swiss experts said mr jouret often referred to an impending global disaster he spoke with the magic of fire , of catastrophe , of ruin , said albert longchamp , who has researched religious sects in western switzerland it was an attractive message , just as fire always attracts a crowd michel brunet , a quebec police spokesman , said that the two bodies found in morin heights those of a man and a woman had not yet been identified , but that both were wearing medallions around their necks engraved with what appeared to be the initials t s , which could mean temple solaire , or solar temple in english two chalets connected by a walkway burned in the fire mr brunet said the house in which the two bodies were found belonged to joseph di mambro , 70 , who was known to be a member of the sect the other belonged to mr jouret the swiss police said they were searching for both men in cheiry , a picturepostcard swiss farming village of just 275 inhabitants , local people saw flames rising from the hillside farmhouse , known as la rochette , shortly before midnight on tuesday as they emerged from celebrating the refurbishment of a local restaurant volunteer firemen immediately went to the scene and , while they could not save the long modern barn , they prevented the fire from destroying most of the stone farmhouse soon afterward , firemen with masks found the body of alberto giacobino , 73 , who bought the 20acre farm five years ago only around 5 am did the firemen search rooms below the main floor of the barn that were not damaged by fire it was there that they found the other 22 bodies the police spokesman for the canton of fribourg , beat karlen , said most were wearing white , red or black capes and two or three women wore long golden robes he said the room where most were found was empty of furniture or ornament except for a photograph of mr jouret this room led to a small circular room with mirrored walls that had what appeared to be an altar at its center on the altar there was a chalice , a rose and a cross , he said the bodies were taken in white plastic bags to lausanne for autopsies this afternoon an investigating judge , andre piller , said he considered the deaths to be a collective suicide of the 23 victims at cheiry , 12 were women and 10 were men one was a boy of about 10 of the 16 bodies so far identified , he said 7 were swiss citizens , 5 french and 4 canadian , ranging from 18 to 72 years of age
to the editor re panic on broadway by frank rich \( column , dec 4 \) claiming that the single heftiest factor causing broadway ticket prices to soar is contracts that require backstage workers who do little work and musicians who do none is patently absurd and factually incorrect there are now at most four or five walkers , or musicians paid to do no work , on all of broadway the vast majority of musicians on broadway , like their colleagues on the stage , are dedicated artists who work hard for long hours to bring the magic of live performance to the great white way in an average broadway budget , 8 percent or less of operating costs goes to the orchestra the more that is spent on the production , the smaller that percentage gets composers and arrangers have to fight with producers to get anywhere near the number of musicians they would like for their compositions many musicians now perform two or more parts as a result , we work doubly and triply hard and , as audiences attest live music makes a difference ticket prices are astronomical , and that must change but claiming that the musicians' 8 percent of the budget is the heftiest factor in those costs is ludicrous big money is going into someone s pockets , but those pockets are not found in the orchestra pit jennifer hoult new york , dec 5 , 1994 the writer is a harpist and keyboardist for a christmas carol
the german invention of movable type was as revolutionary for the 15th century as the computer was for the 20th the metal letters devised by johann gutenberg could be assembled and printed so rapidly that books and documents were mass produced after 1450 literacy , once reserved for the elite , spread swiftly to the masses the gutenberg bible , one of the most beautiful books ever printed , became the first substantial venture of gutenberg , a goldsmith from mainz of the 180 copies made , 49 survive , 3 of which are exhibited in gutenberg and the genesis of printing , at the pierpont morgan library through april 17 the 150 or so books and documents on view , all of which were printed before 1500 , are from the morgan s collection , the nation s richest from this period but the reconstruction of the first printing press on view was lent by the gutenbergmuseum in mainz almost none of us can easily read the myriad languages and the exotic typefaces , says h george fletcher , the museum s curator of printed books and the organizer of the show so we 're free to appreciate them as art objects seeing the impress of type on paper is enjoyable , but when the bite shows through , it adds a chill of pleasure to view books as art , it s best probably to start with the library s three gutenberg bibles all were acquired at the turn of the century by j pierpont morgan , but in this exhibition they are being shown together for the first time the differences between the vellum or calfskin copy , elaborately decorated by hand , and the two paper versions , with their gleaming black typography , are immediately apparent on all copies , the print tends to remain lustrous and undimmed researchers have recently discovered why gutenberg s oilbased inks produced print of such enduring blackness scientific tests at the university of california at davis credit the large amount of lead and copper in the ink the imposing gothic type chosen by gutenberg , which duplicated the calligraphy of the day , could be read from a distance and in relatively poor light scribes who had been swamped with orders for books soon put down their pens if they became printers , as did peter schoeffer , gutenberg s principal workman , they could produce in a day what would have taken months or a year to complete by hand yet gutenberg s insistence on the finest materials soon proved too costly by the time his first bibles appeared , he was bankrupt by 1500 , printing was flourishing in 260 european cities , towns and monasteries among the show s rarities are copies of the earliest surviving books printed in england , france , italy , spain and constantinople as well as the first complete hebrew bible william caxton , a writerturnedprinter , is represented by his earliest efforts in cologne and bruges and by later volumes published in london after he brought printing to his native england these include his second edition of chaucer s canterbury tales from 1483 , which corrected the mistakes of the first edition and added illustrations , and his morte d'arthur by malory from 1485 , the only complete copy known to have survived as printing spread throughout europe , books written in latin were followed by others in the vernacular the italians were among the most daring in their illustrations , and works in greek are among the most elegant , especially homer s iliad and his odyssey , both printed in florence in 1489 after gutenberg s invention of movable type , blackandwhite woodcut images , as seen in the show s aesop s fables and brant s ship of fools illustrated by durer , were soon augmented by multicolor printing a threecolor process was introduced in 1457 with the mainz psalter , the book of psalms studded with vividly detailed initials one of mr fletcher s favorite footnotes in the early history of publishing appears in the form of a printer s complaint , published in the preface to nicolaus de lyra s commentaries on the bible it reads we printed all these books and ca n't sell them we 're drowning in them as mr fletcher points out , and it was only 1470 while the museum s historic books are all well protected in terms of humidity and light levels , the vellum works are a particular subject of concern the vellum books take longer to settle down after they are opened for viewing , mr fletcher explains i check the vellum gutenberg every day because the pages flex back and forth at you and will rise right up to absorb moisture vellum is still a living element trying to climb back on the animal it was taken from photos among the works in a new exhibition at the pierpont morgan library are , at left , the book fool , an illustration by durer from sebastian brant s ship of fools , published in 1494 , and a page from a gutenberg bible , circa 1455 \( photographs by david a loggie pierpont morgan library \)
albany , april 26 a state judge reinstated rape charges today against five men who admitted having sex with a woman who had passed out after drinking too much in an upstate restaurant the decision in the highly publicized case nullifies the guilty pleas all five men had entered last june in a town court in st lawrence county , pleas that focused attention on the criminal justice system s treatment of sexual assault the men , indicted in county court on felony rape charges , had been permitted to plead guilty to sexual misconduct , a misdemeanor each paid a fine of 840 state attorney general g oliver koppell , who argued the case personally two weeks ago , hailed the decision as a first step toward justice in the case mr koppell , who was appointed by gov mario m cuomo as a special prosecutor in the case , said his office was prepared for trial immediately it was not clear whether lawyers for the defendants would appeal today s ruling sending a message this decision is not only important for the proper prosecution of this particular case , mr koppell said in a news conference in his offices in new york city but it sends the message to all the people of new york that the crime of rape is one of the most serious crimes and must be treated that way by the judicial system the victim of the assault , krista absalon , a 26yearold hospital technician from gouverneur , ny , said she felt vindicated by the decision , even though any trial would be months away i can finally see the light of day now that i 'll finally get my day in court , said ms absalon , a divorced mother of two children who voluntarily has spoken publicly about the case this will be fair now instead of some backroom deal i also see this as a victory for all victims of rape to show that victims will finally be listened to , she said we have no reason not to report it we have no reason to hide in a closet but richard v manning , the st lawrence district attorney who had prosecuted the case and ultimately allowed the plea bargains , suggested in an interview today that the effort to revive the case was politically motivated , and that there was not enough evidence to convict the five men he had said he was concerned over a lack of physical evidence and that ms absalon would be unable to testify against her assailants because she has said she could not remember the assault the attorney general has got himself a hot potato , mr manning said let s see what he can do with it the decision was yet another turn in the unusual case , which began in 1991 in a lounge at the casablanca restaurant in the small talc mining town of gouverneur , 20 miles south of the canadian border on oct 26 of that year , prosecutors say , ms absalon passed out in the restroom after having several drinks , and the defendants , described as acquaintances , carried her to a lounge , removed her clothes and took turns sexually assaulting her she said she became aware of the assault two weeks after it took place , when a friend told her the men were bragging about it last june , all five men , after being indicted for first degree rape , admitted to having sex with her without her consent as they pleaded guilty in gouverneur town court mr koppell said today that those admissions could not be used as evidence , though four of the men had made selfincriminating statements before the pleas today , acting supreme court justice eugene l nicandri , a st lawrence county judge who was appointed a state judge to hear this case , decided that the case represents an exception to double jeopardy , the legal concept that bars multiple prosecutions for the same offense he agreed with mr koppell that the town court had no jurisdiction in the case , because an indictment was pending in the higher county court he also agreed that the pleas appeared to violate restrictions on plea bargaining the decision carried an unusual tone , in part because judge nicandri also presided over a hearing in which mr manning , the district attorney , moved to dismiss the charges against the five men in county court so judge nicandri was in essence chastising himself when he wrote that the county court should have held a hearing to determine whether mr manning had acted properly when he dismissed the charges in the interests of justice the plea bargains took place before a town magistrate , wallace a sibley , a fertilizer salesman who is not a lawyer two weeks ago , mr koppell argued that those pleas should be nullified before judge nicandri in the county courthouse in canton none of the lawyers for the five defendants could be reached this evening for comment , though one of them told the associated press that he would consider appealing judge nicandri s decision or seeking dismissal of the rape charges the defendants are mariano g pistolesi , the son of the restaurant owner mark a hartle david e cummings michael a curcio , and gregory l streeter saying prosecution of the case would be vigorous , mr koppell said he disagreed that there was not enough evidence , and repeated earlier claims that he has evidence not available to mr manning , though he declined to discuss it we believe there is sufficient evidence , he said otherwise we of course would not have brought this case
washington , may 6 a federal district judge in denver , upholding a clinton administration order , has barred the state of colorado from enforcing any state restrictions on the use of public money for abortions the ruling , issued on thursday by the judge , edward w nottingham jr , is the first court decision on the administration policy requiring states to pay for abortions for lowincome women in cases of rape or incest previously , state medicaid programs had to pay for abortions only when the procedure was needed to save the life of a pregnant woman judge nottingham ruled that colorado law and parts of the state constitution conflicted with a new federal law that authorized medicaid coverage of abortions for poor women in cases of rape or incest the judge said the federal law superseded state restrictions on the use of public money for abortions the upshot of his decision is that the state cannot enforce any of its restrictions the decision applies only to colorado but administration officials and advocates of abortion rights say it may foreshadow the outcome of similar cases in other parts of the country the judge said he had relied on precedents from the supreme court and four federal appeals courts similar lawsuits are pending in arkansas , louisiana , michigan , montana , north dakota and pennsylvania advocates of abortion rights hailed the colorado ruling as a vindication of their position colorado officials said they would appeal the judge said his decision would take effect immediately he rejected the state s plea that it be held up while the case was on appeal in december , the clinton administration ordered state medicaid officials to pay for abortions in cases of rape or incest , on the ground that payment was required by the new federal law but colorado , arkansas , michigan , utah and at least seven other states have refused to comply , saying they are forbidden to do so by either state laws or state constitutions judge nottingham rejected the contention that the federal law merely permits the use of medicaid money for certain abortions , rather than requiring it under 14 years of federal court precedents , he said , states participating in medicaid must cover all abortions for which federal money is available a 1984 amendment to the colorado constitution and state laws passed since then prohibit the use of public money for abortions except when necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman judge nottingham issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the state from enforcing this part of its constitution wade s livingston , first assistant attorney general of colorado , was asked what state restrictions remained in force under the judge s order there would be none , none at all , he said in an interview under the court s order , we have to pay for all abortions , not just those that result from rape or incest the judge said he could not strike down the objectionable part of the state s constitutional amendment and allow the remainder to stand the amendment as a whole would have to be redrafted to comply with federal law , he said 'home run for our clients' kathryn kolbert , vice president of the center for reproductive law and policy , a lawyer for several abortion clinics in colorado , said this is a home run for our clients not only will medicaid money be made available for victims of rape and incest in colorado the court also invalidated all of the state s restrictions on the use of medicaid money for abortions in court , mr livingston said that the defendant in the case , karen beye , executive director of the colorado department of social services , has to abide by the state constitution the judge interrupted to say , no , she has to abide by federal law judge nottingham , who was appointed by president george bush in 1989 , invoked the supremacy clause of the federal constitution , which says that the constitution and laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land , notwithstanding any contrary provisions of state law or a state constitution mr livingston said colorado now found itself in a procedural mess because it could not enforce any of its restrictions on abortion spending we could adopt a new constitutional amendment or a new state law that tracks the federal law , he said but that s not something you do over the weekend the 1994 session of the colorado legislature is scheduled to end next week the federal law in question , passed last year as part of the appropriations bill for the department of health and human services , is the latest version of the hyde amendment , known for its chief sponsor , representative henry j hyde , republican of illinois prior versions of the law said that federal medicaid money could not be used for abortions except to save the life of a pregnant woman congress last year said such money could also be used for abortions in cases of rape or incest the judge refused to rewrite colorado s abortion restrictions to comply with federal law i just do n't think it s a proper function of a federal district court to engage in drafting state constitutional amendments or state statutory provisions , he said colorado officials said they would ask the united states court of appeals for the 10th circuit , in denver , to delay enforcement of the decision we have a state constitution , said david r west , the state medicaid director in colorado we have an obligation to try and uphold it the federal department of health and human services says that indiana , kentucky , louisiana , mississippi , montana , north dakota and south dakota also have state restrictions on abortion that are inconsistent with federal law
solomon eisenrod has seen a lot of changes in his long career as a real estate developer , but none so striking as the way older americans are turning the once sedentary retirement years into a period of vigorous activity mr eisenrod knows what he is talking about at age 85 , he has followed the shift of living patterns for older people for more than three decades as the developer of two of new jersey s largest communities for people 55 and over rossmoor and clearbrook , both in monroe township all told , mr eisenrod and his partners have built more than 4 , 000 adult homes at the two communities , with more to come he is also a developer of the ponds , another adult community , which will open soon next to the two other communities mr eisenrod said the changes in the way retired people are living have been significant skiing and snorkeling at 80 today , older people do n't think as they once did that when they reach 60 or 65 years old they must trade in their active lives for a rocking chair that is a myth of the past , he said mr eisenrod said he knew people who ski and snorkel at age 80 and work longer days than their contemporaries , most of whom are 30 to 40 years younger most of the residents of the adult communities work at least part time , he said mr eisenrod does more than that he puts in a full fiveday week as chairman at the manhattan office of the american revenue corporation , which has real estate holdings in several states he often visits his new jersey properties and enjoys talking to the residents i can identify with the people out there , with their problems and their goals , he said , because they are my goals , too namely to stay healthy , active and to be a vital force who can help family and friends by sharing knowledge learned over the years each adult community was a product of its time , mr eisenrod said at rossmoor , which opened in the 1960 s , he said , the people who bought houses chose more sedentary activities like arts and crafts , and many of them were fully retired they did not need as much recreational facilities , although those amenities have been added over the years as the residents have changed at rossmoor , mr eisenrod said at the time rossmoor was being built , most people did not know about the concept of retirement communities , mr eisenrod said i must admit that i hardly knew where monroe township was myself , he said it was all farmland then a significant change in just 10 years , when mr eisenrod became a backer of clearbrook , there had been a major shift in how the elderly were living the community s residents have a ninehole golf course , tennis courts , two outdoor swimming pools and a fully equipped clubhouse with exercise and fitness rooms clearbrook , like rossmoor a 2 , 000home community has more than 3 , 000 residents it recently sold its last house shirley and henry zager , formerly of fair lawn , recently bought a twobedroom house there they are clearly impressed with the activities in their new community there is a special television channel which covers the activities , mrs zager said my husband and i watch it all the time and are amazed by all the activities offered we ca n't wait to get involved mr eisenrod , who is also a lawyer , became involved in housing for older people when he met ross cortese , the founder of rossmoor it was then called rossmoor leisureworld and was being developed by mr cortese on farmland off exit 8a of the new jersey turnpike ross wanted to move to california , so he sold the property to us , mr eisenrod said , referring to himself and his partners i could see the possibilities of such a development , and the land was literally dirt cheap in those days plus , in the 60 s not many developers were involved in senior communities , and i saw a future in them a pioneer state new jersey was a pioneer state for the construction of housing for the elderly , mr eisenrod said , because of its nearness to new york and its easy access to the new jersey turnpike and major highways it only takes a little over an hour to get to monroe township from midtown manhattan , mr eisenrod said , and that s what makes the development very valuable mr eisenrod s mild demeanor is in contrast with the flamboyance of many other real estate developers perhaps that is because of his upbringing i remember growing up in a tenement on the lower east side , so i keep things in perspective , mr eisenrod said i suppose we would be considered poor we had a bathroom in the hall that all the families had to share but all i can remember is how happy and united we always seemed to be in those days while he likes to reminisce , mr eisenrod is very much a man of the present he and his partners are focused on the ponds , which is being built on a 42acre tract across the road from clearbrook the initial construction includes 237 onestory homes , which are detached or in sets of twos and threes , and a 22 , 000squarefoot clubhouse the twobedroom , twobath homes will be priced from 135 , 000 to 197 , 000 mr eisenrod said the key selling point to all the homes was the wealth of activities available to residents but he said the members of a new generation of older people are also aware of environmental and other issues , and they will not live in developments that damage wide areas of the surrounding countryside that is why we have set aside 19 acres at the ponds to remain in wetlands and woodlands forever , he said a varied career mr eisenrod , the son of immigrant parents from poland , started out his career as a lawyer he graduated at 21 from the first graduating class at st john s university law school in 1929 later , he stopped practicing law and bought a providence , ri , manufacturing plant during world war ii the company had gone bankrupt , and mr eisenrod turned it around he has become a specialist in rejuvenating bankrupt companies mr eisenrod and his wife , the former sally winston , who was a professional singer , have a daughter , nancy hartwell , who lives in phoenix , and a son , michael , who is a sales executive in his father s business in 1967 , the elder mr eisenrod began developing homes in florida he has built more than 2 , 000 units and 27 holes of golf courses in boca raton he continues to develop property in florida and virginia he is an active partner in clearbrook partners , developers of the ponds and clearbrook his partners are kenneth a simons and leonard kohl , developers in the tristate area and members of the bronfman family of the united states and canada , who have large real estate holdings mr eisenrod supervises a staff of two dozen at the american revenue office on madison avenue , only a few blocks from the place he began his career as a lawyer more than 60 years earlier defining his role , he said , i make the decisions , good or bad , and i get the blame or the credit photo solomon eisenrod , chairman of the

thousands of gallons of oil leaked from a holding tank early yesterday at a bayonne , nj , oil storage operation owned by a company that has been cited for polluting local waters , the federal environmental protection agency reported the leaking oil posed no environmental threat , and only a small amount seeped from a containing tank surrounding the main vessel , federal environmental officials said the leak occurred at the standard tank cleaning corporation , which is owned by the frank family the family was held responsible by the coast guard for a huge oil spill in puerto rico last month , and federal officials have cited the company in dozens of incidents of illegal dumping of sewage and sludge in the new york area in the last two decades mary breitenbach , a spokeswoman for the epa , said yesterday s leak was caused by a valve that cracked in one of the storage tanks because of the cold weather no oil reaches water workers were able to start pumping the leaking oil into a nearby tank as soon as it was discovered about 4 30 am yesterday none of the oil , estimated at 5 , 000 to 10 , 000 gallons , reached any body of water about 50 gallons , ms breitenbach said , escaped the containment wall at the top of the tank , but solidified in the cold weather and posed no danger this is considered a minor incident , ms brentenbach said the concern is not the oil release itself but a possible threat if there is a release from the larger tank where the leaking oil has been pumped she said that once the tank was repaired , the oil would be pumped back , with the excess oil put on a barge for temporary storage ms breitenbach said that the company , which has filed for bankruptcy protection , was operating under the control of a courtappointed trustee , and that the site was being monitored round the clock
when you do n't want to write about something as badly as i do n't want to write about the bobbitt case , it s nature s way of telling you to figure out why too easy to say that there s nothing more to say not good enough to note that the case of the woman who cut off her husband s penis has evoked more bad double entendres than anything in recent memory no , none of that is why i 've avoided the bobbitts it s because of feminism it s because , three decades after the movement for women s equality began , the bobbitt case is what naysayers truly believe it is all about cutting it off but never fear , gentlemen castration was really not the point of feminism , and we women are too busy eviscerating one another to take you on witness an article in esquire magazine about a group of young women characterized as do me feminists because of an agenda heavy on sex when and how they want it , with no guilt , no regrets one of them even shows up for an interview with a consensual spanking video called blame it on bambi while the feminist theorists catharine mackinnon and andrea dworkin normally get slammed for their views on pornography , in the esquire article one is trashed for her lack of sex appeal and the other for her heft it s a little like turnabout on the bad old can a feminist wear mascara \? days when gloria steinem s politics were overshadowed by her streaked hair it s certainly just as stupid a lot of us just want to go spraypaint and make out with our boyfriends and not worry about oppression , lois maffeo , 29 , a singer , says in esquire cool that 'll make it a lot easier when you get a straight job and get paid a whole lot less than the guy you work next to men who have grown tired of complaints about equal pay and violence against women will find the ideas here more cheering , especially the idea that good feminism great sex and anyone who has been suspicious of the movement heretofore can have his fears confirmed we 're angry because we 're ugly there are a lot of homely women in women s studies , christina hoff sommers , a professor at clark university in massachusetts , is quoted as saying preaching these antimale , antisex sermons is a way for them to compensate for various heartaches they 're just mad at the beautiful girls nonsense professor sommers might not be doing what she s doing today if many women , some attractive , some not , had not fomented social change over the last three decades because of much more than heartaches that change is far from over there s still plenty to do , and much of it will be working with our male friends but seeing sexual aggression as the solution is as reductive as seeing pornography as the problem and it has precious little to do with much of real life , with raising children , making a living , or learning about yourself it s babe feminism we 're young , we 're fun , we do what we want in bed and it has a shorter shelf life than the feminism of sisterhood i 've been a babe , and i 've been a sister sister lasts longer in her new book , fire with fire , the feminist naomi wolf writes , the male body is home to me i like guys , but my body is home to me that was the point of feminism i got custody of myself esquire also published a survey of 1 , 000 young women in this issue asked if they 'd rather be brilliant but plain or sexy but dumb , 74 percent went for brains \( maybe they 'll all teach women s studies \) while a do me feminist editor was describing proactive sex pretend you 're a burglar and you 've broken in here the women in the poll were asked to choose between hugging without sex and sex without hugging hugging won by a landslide and 65 percent of the respondents said they 'd rather win the pulitzer prize than be miss america that s far more representative of what the women s movement has done than lorena bobbitt s doityourself surgery or somebody s inyourface burglary bustier fantasies because it s important to remember that feminism is no longer a group of organizations or leaders it s the expectations that parents have for their daughters , and their sons , too it s the way we talk about and treat one another it s who makes the money and who makes the compromises and who makes the dinner it s a state of mind it s the way we live now our bambi , ourselves \? oh , please
one of photography s most basic and powerful traits is its ability to give substance to memory , to present precise visual details of a time gone by that capability is vividly apparent in the absorbing show of images by james vanderzee now at the howard greenberg gallery in soho on display is nothing less than the living fabric of black society in new york in the first decades of this century vanderzee , who died in 1983 at the age of 96 , was the leading photographer in harlem during its heyday , from world war i until the 1940 s through the doors of vanderzee s studio , situated first on west 135th street and later on upper seventh avenue , passed a crosssection of harlem society his sitters included such celebrities as the rev adam clayton powell sr and the dancer bill \( bojangles \) robinson as well as a host of ordinary working men and women like other portrait photographers , vanderzee was called on to commemorate important moments in his subjects' lives , from weddings to funerals a 1927 photograph of a party celebrating a baptism is crowded with people wearing funny hats , with the proud parents and their baby at the center of the image often vanderzee provided distinctive images of social groups of all sorts a 1936 photograph shows the men and women of les modernes bridge club , the men in tuxedos and the women in long gowns , lined up beneath their fancy blackandwhite banner , while in a 1927 picture , the members of an elks club pose in a graceful arc before the camera vanderzee also took his camera out of the studio to depict public events in harlem in 1924 , he photographed marcus garvey dressed in full military regalia during a parade , a year before the black nationalist leader was convicted of mail fraud vanderzee photographed events of this sort in a straightforward , descriptive style but he showed no interest in modernist notions about the purity of the medium , and frequently used studio props , costumes , retouching and multiple printing to heighten the narrative richness of his images in a few cases , he made restrained use of these devices , as in a graduation photograph from 1939 of two girls holding bouquets of handcolored flowers in other images , though , he piled on such manipulations , encrusting the photographs with openly artificial effects a wedding portrait from around 1925 , for example , includes the image of a baby printed next to the happily posing couple , while in a photograph entitled her cigarette , made around 1935 , a man s face sits atop a paintedin column of smoke that climbs from a cigarette whose tip has been colored a glowing red often these heavily reworked images were drenched in sentimentality a 1938 image shows a man , surrounded by his children , gazing pensively at an open photo album while the ghostly image of a woman appears on the wall above his head scratched into the negative are the words their mother s photograph vanderzee s reliance on such pictorial devices gives some of his pictures a kitschy , oldfashioned quality , and may have contributed to his declining fortunes in the 1940 s and 50 s his brand of portraiture , in which elaborate costumes and painted backdrops provided sitters with elegant but fake surroundings , fell out of fashion , and few people came to his studio by the time vanderzee s work was rediscovered in the late 60 s , he and his wife were living on the edge of poverty when his pictures were featured in harlem on my mind , the 1969 exhibition at the metropolitan museum of art , they were a source of controversy , with some black artists protesting the inclusion of photographs in a show about harlem s artistic heritage but many people hailed the record of black life offered by vanderzee s photographs , and in his final years he again found favor as a portraitist , though much of the appeal of his work at that time was no doubt tinged with nostalgia despite the obvious skill involved in making many of his images , vanderzee seems not to have considered himself an artist instead he was concerned chiefly with appealing to his sitters' tastes his style was in fact a restatement of 19thcentury studio conventions this excellent survey includes none of vanderzee s later , somewhat simpler portraits , but it does present a few of his earliest images , made in lenox , mass , where he grew up it also offers a wideranging selection of pictures from the 20 s and 30 s , his most prolific years in harlem vanderzee s photographs are an important part of new york city s recent history , making it all the more surprising that the retrospective exhibition of his work held this past winter at the national portrait gallery in washington failed to come here this show , though , offers a worthy , if somewhat reduced , substitute , and a chance to reconsider an exciting and often overlooked chapter in american life the photographs of james vanderzee remain at the howard greenberg gallery , 120 wooster street in soho , through april 30 photo detail of portrait of woman and dogs , by james vanderzee \( howard greenberg gallery \)
the knicks were this large , unsightly boulder that weighed at least a thousand pounds madison square garden was the steepest hill in the eastern conference all night long , all week long , the chicago bulls seemed to be pushing the boulder , huffing and puffing , trying to roll it over the top the bulls gave it another mighty good roll last night , but the boulder finally turned on them , the way it did sunday night close just does n't count against the knicks' pile of ewingoakleymason muscle the bulls were left on their backs , trailing the eastern conference semifinals two games to none , feeling flattened , despite phil jackson s vow that the bulls would go home where the playing field is even , and return next week for game 5 it s going to be 22 , jackson said , after the knicks ripped game 2 away from the bulls , 9691 it was the only thing the bulls' coach could say , but it did not sound any more prescient than the decision jackson made at the start of the fourth quarter last night jackson has three players who were allstar selections last winter he kept all of them scottie pippen , horace grant and b j armstrong on the bench and that is exactly where the bulls lost their footing , lost their grip on a tenuous 7269 lead , lost the game jackson sent out a lineup that , given a slight alteration of the pro basketball universe , could be the opening day lineup for toronto or vancouver , the next expansion teams he crossed his fingers and sent steve kerr , jo jo english , scott williams , toni kukoc and luc longley to keep the bulls from falling back for the record , this unit was comprised of two journeymen guards , a backup forward , a european rookie and a 7foot center given up on by the minnesota timberwolves it was a hang on lineup , jackson did admit pippen had four fouls , but this was not the time , nor the place , to be experimenting with a paperweight against the rock against this defense , which has now held opponents to 25 percent fourthquarter shooting in six playoff games , the bulls needed to stay on top of the knicks not only did they lose their lead , but all their momentum , and even the return of pippen , armstrong and much later grant could n't get it back the bulls were outscored 110 they did n't score a fourthquarter point until 6 minutes 40 seconds were left in the game pippen never restarted and experienced another nightmare finish , two lonely free throws , before fouling out at 2 38 , the game already lost the knick boulder picked up steam , slowed momentarily , then rolled halfway home to the conference finals jackson had no one to blame this time , not even the officials , as much as he had himself when scottie s not in , we pretty much can shut them down , said john starks you looked at their lineup and you knew they were vulnerable starks was looking from the end of the bench , having been sent to his room by pat riley after a secondquarter kick \( extending a streak to consecutive games \) in the direction of armstrong cost new york a technical foul beyond that , starks , struggling with his shot since his comeback from knee surgery , was 1 for 5 at the start of the fourth quarter , riley motioned starks to the seat next to him they engaged in a discussion on selfcontrol he told me to calm down , said starks nothing new here , except starks s response it s easy to do when the coach tells you to the first of two starks 3pointers gave the knicks a 7472 lead the second made it 7772 his breakaway dunk and foul hiked the lead to 8 the bulls were on their way to a 19point quarter they scored 27 in the first quarter , 24 in the second , 21 in the third you get the picture the longer they pushed , the heavier it got it was like that in game 1 , too now the bulls go back to chicago , hoping to regroup , and probably thinking what might have been they had chances this week to turn new york upside down they came into the garden and gave the knicks all they wanted they just could n't score when they had to , just could n't reach the top of the hill this , of course , is a sevenmonthold second guess , and one pippen addressed back in february , but the bulls sure could have used one more offensive player in these two games pete myers is a nice story , professional vagabond stepping into michael jordan s starting position , but when myers squared up from the key in the first quarter last night and shot a jumper that banged off the glass the way ali s stiff jab once disfigured frazier s cheek , that was all you needed to know about that with all the wishmikewerehere lamentations coming from the chicago side , one has to wonder what the outcome of these games would have been if the bulls had heeded pippen s pleas , gone out and gotten a shooting guard , the way utah added jeff hornacek , or indiana reeled in byron scott maybe the knicks would 've won , anyway maybe the hill , without jordan , was too steep and the knicks were on too much of a roll photo knicks' john starks was instrumental in holding scottie pippen to just 2 points in the fourth quarter \( g paul burnett the new york times \)
albany , may 7 pressing a broad investigation into ticketscalping , the state attorney general hopes to peel back the mystery from a system in which private brokers offer great tickets to plays , sporting events and concerts for vastly inflated prices while the average customer at the box office often cannot get a seat at all over the last month , attorney general g oliver koppell has issued subpoenas to 34 licensed ticket brokers in manhattan , requesting detailed information about their ticket sources , their customers and their costs of doing business the investigation , conducted jointly with the new york city department of consumer affairs , appears to be the most sweeping probe in three decades into an industry that has long frustrated lawmakers and ticketbuyers alike criminal charges state law allows resellers to charge only 5 or 10 percent , whichever is higher , over a ticket s face value but brokers in new york and surrounding states routinely charge much more , a practice mr koppell and others say limits the public s access mr koppell s target is not street scalpers , but rather brokers in offices who essentially speculate in the ticket market buying blocks of seats and often offering tickets for soldout shows at high prices investigators say they are also trying to determine to what extent brokers pay bribes , known as ice , to employees of theater box offices or other outlets to obtain tickets , and to what extent brokers' activities restrict public access to entertainment events in a tactical departure for such cases , mr koppell said he had instructed investigators to file criminal charges , if appropriate , for a violation that typically brings only civil action ticketscalping can be prosecuted as a misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of one year in jail and a fine of 500 when these guys learn they are going to end up in the hoosegow , that is when they are going to take it seriously , he said business and politics but robert j malito , a lobbyist who represents 35 brokers , said that the industry was being treated unfairly and that the law governing ticket resales was too restrictive every day we get hundreds of distinguished , major businessmen who come to this city , he said they make decisions they want to see a show that night they should have a service that allows that mr malito said the vast majority of brokers obtained their tickets legally , by standing in line or hiring people to do so he did concede that many brokers were ignoring the price restrictions , but he said the law put unreasonable restrictions on the brokers' right to do business tough talk from the attorney general aside , the investigation will almost certainly be propelled in part by political considerations both mr koppell , who has been campaigning hard to stay in the office to which he was named when robert abrams retired in december , and alfred c cerullo 3d , the city s consumer affairs commissioner , are new to office and eager to establish a record on an issue with apparently broad public appeal moreover , the law regulating ticket resales expires in december the investigation is certain to affect whether there will be stricter penalties or , conversely , new rules to allow brokers to continue charging high prices under certain circumstances a small beginning in issuing the subpoenas to businesses in manhattan , mr koppell and investigators said they purposely targeted only a small segment of the ticketsales industry there are 67 brokers licensed by new york city some of these , and many others without licenses , are based in connecticut and new jersey in an attempt to sidestep new york laws , although the attorney general s office says the law covers any brokers who do business of any sort in new york , like advertising in new york papers or selling to new yorkers many more brokers are unregistered neither new jersey nor connecticut has a law on ticket scalping investigators said they hoped records from the narrow sample would reveal much more about the business , in which 125 tickets to see barbara streisand in june have sold for as much as 350 , and 30 tickets for a barney show in march sold for as much as 200 we frequently hear about the public being disappointed that they are unable to get tickets to see oneshot events or three or four concert events even though they stand on line all night , said alice mcinerney , the chief of the attorney general s investor protection and securities bureau two bureaus within the office , including the consumer fraud and protection bureau , are involved in the investigation , and mr koppell has already filed suit against three brokers over what he called illegal prices for tickets to ms streisand s show ms mcinerney said that the subpoenaed records from brokers had only begun to trickle into the office and that it was too early to speculate on where the information might lead help from exemployees ms mcinerney said the investigation was being aided by several former employees in the ticket brokerage industry , including people who worked in theater box offices and for ticket agencies the ticket agencies , which include telecharge and ticketmaster , are not considered brokers and operate under different rules although ms mcinerney declined to characterize the information these former employees supplied , it seems likely they might shed light on how widespread is the practice of brokers' bribing boxoffice employees or ticket agency workers for blocs of tickets there are often limits on how many tickets each person can purchase thus , tickets that would normally go on sale at retail price would be in the hands of brokers who could charge much higher rates , in effect squeezing out of the events people who could afford only the lower price we are charged to protect the integrity of the box office , ms mc inerney said and if there really is this dual distribution system going on out there , we should know about it mr malito also said that none of the brokers he represented were operating in new york , for fear of prosecution , but would return to the city if the law were eased when it is up for review at the end of this year senator dean g skelos , republican of rockville center , who will oversee any revision to the ticketscalping law in the senate , said his reading of the legislation was that it was intended to regulate street hawkers as a public nuisance , not brokers so he said his main concern in mr koppell s investigation was not the high prices , but whether the average consumer was being locked out of events by brokers' practices what we have to do is look at the overall picture for what s going on and not try to politicize and publicize this kind of thing right now , he said the question is , what is the problem with access , and is there a way to legitimately remedy it \? photos the state attorney general s office has joined the new york city department of

washington it has been a quarter of a century since hal , the orbiting computer whose soothing humanoid voice belies a malevolent egomania , appeared in stanley kubrick s 2001 a space odyssey the idea of a talking computer has since insinuated itself into the popular imagination , but so far the imagination is the only place where computers have real conversational skill the problem , experts in artificial intelligence say , is that efforts have focused on the building blocks and rules of language rather than on its expression thus , computergenerated voices sound flat and can manage only the most primitive sort of inflection , such as a rise in pitch at the end of a sentence when posing a question manfred clynes , who holds a doc torate in neuroscience from the university of melbourne , has long proposed that human emotions , as expressed through words , gestures , painting , music or any other medium , have distinct , dynamic shapes that are common to all cultures dr clynes , 68 , has translated emotions into shapes by hooking up people to a machine called a sentograph and plotting the horizontal and vertical components of the type of pressure the subjects applied with their forefingers to express specific emotions dr clynes has applied such shapes , which he calls sentograms , to computergenerated speech , and he has been notified that today he will be granted a patent for a system that can supply emotional contours to a computer s voice musicianship by algorithm a pianist as well as a neuroscientist , dr clynes first applied his shapes theory to music , and has developed algorithms that let a computer model the musicality of a human artist certain computers can play a score that has been entered into their memory they can perform , for example , a chopin piano sonata with noteperfect precision but it would sound awful dead , irritating , dr clynes said , because there would be no subtlety , no change in touch , tone or rhythm , none of the nuances that a sensitive pianist would bring to the performance dr clynes , whose algorithms are being developed commercially in cooperation with hewlettpackard , said his technology would allow a musician to instruct a computer to play a given score with certain phrasings as well as changes in volume , tempo , timbre and rhythm he has now applied some of these principles to computergenerated speech he proposes that digitally stored sentograms can be used to sculpt specific phrases by giving the computer s voice a more naturalsounding inflection made up of volume , pitch , timing and tremor that is the shape of a given emotion he said that computergenerated speech could be changed in much the way a written text could be changed by putting a phrase in italics or changing the size or style of type dr clynes said he hoped his invention would have a wide variety of applications , from virtual reality to the teaching of rhetoric and the understanding of the nature of emotion one application , he said , might be electronic mail that , when converted to voice from text by a computer , would convey emotion as if the author was reading it dr clynes , the head of microsound international ltd of sonoma , calif , said he was currently perfecting his computer voice technology , which is scheduled to receive patent 5 , 305 , 423 a way to certify telephone calls joann zucker , a social worker from tomkins cove , in rockland county , ny , last week received a patent for an idea that came to her , she said , when she and her husband were required by local zoning officials to notify all their neighbors by certified mail that they were planning a major addition to their home i 've always hated those green forms at the post office because it takes forever to fill them out , she said i said to my husband , 'would n't it be great if you could just send a certified phone call \? ' ms zucker s offhand suggestion has bloomed into a big project she and her husband , alan , a retired publisher , said they were now in licensing talks with regional phone companies the us post office sends about 200 million pieces of certified mail a year that contain nothing more than a message , mr zucker said that s the proven minimum market for certified phone calls to make a certified phone call , the zuckers said , one would dial an 800 number and be taken through an automated menu that would provide such options as whether to deliver the message to whomever answers or to a specific person upon answering , the recipient would be informed that the call was a certified message and that the ensuing conversation would be recorded , the zuckers said if no one answered , the caller could choose to record a message and have the phone company call periodically to try to deliver it ms zucker received patent 5 , 303 , 296 rotating restraint for monkey tests clarence m oloff was a medical technologist in the early 1980 s , working on a study for the air force of the effects of weightlessness on the bones of rhesus monkeys the monkeys were placed in fullbody casts because the casts took pressure off their bones much as the absence of gravity reduces pressure on the bones of astronauts in outer space nothing much but their toes and hands were sticking out it was not a very nice picture , said mr oloff , who is now retired and lives in lawrenceville , ga when the experiment was over six weeks later they had atrophied , they had decubitis ulcers they were in bad shape mr oloff developed a timed primate rotopositioning method for preventing trauma and for simulating weightlessness the air force was recently issued a patent for the invention that mr oloff developed by rotating the animal slowly in two different axes first , head over heels , then top over bottom the device minimizes the effects of gravitational pull it thus lets researchers track the effect of virtual weightlessness on bones , mr oloff said the patent , applied for in 1985 , was initially rejected by the patent office the air force appealed , said frederic l sinder , an air force patent attorney at wrightpatterson air force base in ohio , because the method might have medical applications for humans patent 5 , 275 , 132 was assigned to the united states air force , which says it has not conducted simulated weightlessness studies on nonhuman primates since 1988
senator bob dole , who once threatened to bury the global trade agreement signed by 124 nations , has now put america s interests first he has signed onto the accord after extracting innocent side agreements from the white house mr dole , whose threats were harshly criticized on this page , deserves full credit for rising above politics to rescue an agreement fashioned over seven years of tortured negotiations his leadership has made it likely , barring lastminute defections by democrats , that the senate will approve the agreement on thursday after the house does so today countries around the world will quickly follow suit though mr dole s approval removed much of the drama , the importance of the votes should not be overlooked the trade accord will deliver a shot of economic adrenaline that few other government policies can match by some estimates , it will raise living standards in the us by 1 , 000 or more per family rejection of gatt would not only squander these gains , but would also prove diplomatically calamitous for 50 years the world has looked to the us to lead it through a series of tradeopening agreements that have knocked down tariffs and other trade barriers the measures have contributed mightily to worldwide growth had gatt s opponents won over congress , the us would have abandoned its leadership role and inflamed protectionist pressures abroad , eventually threatening living standards everywhere like previous agreements , the latest gatt accord will also remove tariffs and other trade barriers unlike past agreements , it will cover agriculture and many services and insure that countries honor copyrights , patents and trademarks it will also create the world trade organization , which , as congress demanded in the 1980 s , will impose tougher procedures to resolve disputes all this amounts to a big victory for american exporters of everything from corn and pharmaceuticals to computer software and legal services most developing countries also win their exports will gain access to industrialized countries , and the world trade organization will protect them from any bullying tactics of wealthier trade partners an odd coalition of conservative republicans and democrats allied with consumer advocates like ralph nader oppose gatt they make three arguments , none frivolous but none sufficiently important to turn down the accord first , critics say the wto threatens us sovereignty because it can rule that us environmental and safety laws are forms of backdoor protectionism in one sense , the criticism has to be true any agreement with other nations necessarily restricts us action but the danger is grossly exaggerated gatt panels can rule against us laws even under existing rules these rules would survive even if the new accord were defeated there is one difference under existing rules the us can veto an adverse ruling under the new accord it cannot but in practice this is a minor distinction even though countries can now retaliate against the us for such a veto , most do not do so out of fear that the us would retaliate in turn that is likely to be the case under the new gatt in that sense , the accord poses no new threat indeed , it includes language that protects us environmental and safety laws that are based on scientific principles and are not deliberately aimed at blocking imports second , critics object to gatt s secret deliberations and skimpy legal protections they have a point , but again , current dispute panels proceed under even worse rules so nothing important is lost finally , critics like ernest hollings of south carolina are understandably upset that textile manufacturers in their states would be subjected to lowcost foreign imports but that is a reasonable price for the country to pay to rack up huge gains nearly everywhere else proponents and critics alike tend to misstate gatt s impact on jobs trade neither creates nor destroys jobs employment in the us is primarily determined by the federal reserve board' s efforts to push the economy as close to full employment as possible what open trade does is steer workers into export industries , which on average pay high wages that is what the votes this week are all about barring catastrophe , the us will once again launch the world on another wave of growth
tokyo , may 6 as japanese diplomats raced to quell outrage around asia , the country s justice minister today recanted his comments made this week that the massacre of hundreds of thousands of chinese by japanese forces at nanjing in 1937 was a fabrication i recognize it is an undeniable fact , the justice minister , shigeto nagano , a former general , said at a news conference today , just hours after chinese and south korean officials summoned japanese diplomats and told them that mr nagano had reopened wounds that emperor akihito and top japanese politicians have been struggling to heal as the 50th anniversary of the end of world war ii approaches mr nagano said today that he would resign if mr hata tells me to do so , and there were some hints he may decide to quit this weekend in a 30minute news conference , he repeatedly referred to the twomonth killing spree as the nanjing incident , a japanese formulation often used to counter references to the nanjing massacre , which is also known as the rape of nanking in a carefully worded statement , mr nagano also withdrew his statement that it was wrong to call japan s actions in world war ii a war of aggression pressed by reporters , he said , there is no way to avoid calling it that but at times he seemed to step on his apology , hinting that he had not completely abandoned his earlier view that japan s mission was to liberate the rest of asia from western colonial powers in response to questions , he said there was some element of selfdefense in japan s invasions in asia , adding but japan did not have the support and understanding of other countries for the purpose of the war , and specific actions in the war were not quite matched to the purpose of the conflict but the fact that there was an element of selfdefense does not mean the war can be justified did n't arrive until 1945 in his earlier comments to the mainichi shimbun , a major daily , mr nagano said he knew that no massacre had occurred because he was in nanjing , as a soldier in the imperial army , shortly afterward today he conceded that he did not arrive in the city until 1941 , over three years later , but based his observation on the fact that usually where there was military brutality , there are hard feelings he said he detected none in japaneseoccupied nanjing , but added that my comments were inappropriate because even 1 , 000 or 2 , 000 are big numbers that may constitute a massacre by most estimates , more than 150 , 000 civilians were killed and tens of thousands raped mr hata s minority government was clearly worried today that the comments were already being seized upon by its enemies and could be used to topple it there were several politically strange moments today in which leaders of the liberal democratic party , which regularly defended comments like mr nagano s during the party s 38year rule over japan , professed outrage over the rewriting of history mr nagano , who retired in 1980 as chief of staff of the army , was himself a liberal democrat until he defected from the party with mr hata last year other legislators , particularly socialists who split with mr hata s coalition government last week , threatened to hold up proceedings in parliament together , the liberal democrats and the socialists have the votes to pass a noconfidence bill , though that does not appear imminent hata tries to calm waters mr hata , speaking tonight in brussels at a news conference broadcast here , tried to smooth over the affair i want to avoid talking about resignation now , he said of mr nagano i want to take seriously the fact that mr nagano withdrew his comments and said he wanted to apologize i hope to get the understanding of different countries that he is a man of fair views , and gave a straightforward apology while mr hata s position is clearly the majority view in japan , it is hardly a universal one japan s most conservative daily , the sankei shimbun , had a frontpage editorial today defending mr nagano and urging japan to get out of the vicious circle of apologizing after comments raise an international outcry it criticized the governmentfinanced television network , nhk , for using the phrase 'nanjing massacre' in its news programs as if it is an official term it said scholars used the term incident because the number of victims is not clearly known there is a big difference between the number of victims , 300 , 000 to 400 , 000 , claimed by the chinese side , and several thousand or several tens of thousands by various researchers , it said of course , the number does not pardon japanese brutality , it said , but added , one cannot believe the number of chinese killed was well over the number of victims in hiroshima and nagasaki photo the japanese justice minister , shigeto nagano , yesterday recanted his comments on nanjing \( reuters \)
oakmont , pa , june 19 it was a bizarre final round of the united states open today , one that featured a questionable ruling , countless improbable bounces and one very unfortunate break by the time the final bogey was made on a steamy day at oakmont country club , the result was no result after a tumultuous struggle for survival , a brutal war of attrition on a golf course baked hard and fast , the open will be decided by an 18hole playoff on monday , beginning at 10 am the dramatis personae are ernie els , 24 , of south africa colin montgomerie , 24 , of scotland , and loren roberts , the 38yearold latebloomer from san luis obispo , calif any of the three , and for that matter a few others , could have won the tournament in regulation had it not been for some dreadful errors committed on the pressurized back nine els , montgomerie and roberts none of whom has ever won a major championship tied at 279 , five under par each committed a key foible along the way to the first threeway playoff since julius boros defeated jacky cupit and arnold palmer in 1963 at the country club in brookline , mass els shot 73 and montgomerie and roberts each closed with 70 roberts could have won the tournament by making a 4 1 2foot par putt at the final hole it was exactly the kind of putt he had been making all week , uphill with a slight right to left break but , with the open on the line , he opened the blade of his putter and pushed the putt to the right i hit a terrible putt , he said a bad putt the ball did n't roll for me because i hit it so bad i'm not going to lie to you i had trouble taking the putter back he was n't the only one who had trouble breathing , of course by the time he missed his putt , oakmont already was a graveyard , littered with the remains of open pretenders there was a headstone for curtis strange out there in the deep rough right of the 15th fairway , where curtis buried his golf ball off the tee he had been five under at that point , right on the number , but he bogeyed the hole from the rough and then bogeyed the next hole for bad measure frank nobilo , the engaging man from new zealand whose great grandfather was part of a crew of marauding italian pirates , found very rough sailing early in the day he hit his drive so far left on the third hole captain hook \? that he was forced to chop his ball out sideways from the church pews and made double bogey he went on to shoot 76 there even was a misplay by a united states golf association official , who allowed els to drop his ball from the high rough on the first hole after els had hooked his opening tee shot far to the left the ruling , made by trey holland , was that the abctv crane between els and the green was a temporary immovable object , and els was permitted to drop his ball into a good lie on grass that had been trampled down by the galleries not only was the crane moveable , it moved shortly afterward to provide coverage of the ninth hole i made a mistake , said holland , who is the chairman of the usga s rules committee nobody likes to make a mistake , especially with something like this , but that s what happened i feel bad about that never mind els made bogey anyway , threeputting the first green it was the first of three threeputts by els , but by the 15th hole , none of it seemed to matter that was where els somehow contrived to birdie the hole from the rough by hitting one of the greatest trouble shots in open history , a 7iron that traveled 195 yards from the hay to 15 feet right of the pin on the glassy green he made the putt and had the lead at seven under while all this was going on , montgomerie seemed to have imploded after taking the lead at the ninth hole with a birdie , he bogeyed three straight holes the 11th , 12th and 13th by the time he righted himself with a birdie at the 14th and one at the 17th , he thought he had blown his chances to become the first european to win the open since tony jacklin in 1970 i thought for certain my chance was gone , montgomerie said i thought when i finished i was one shot light i was n't expecting loren or ernie to make five at the last but they threw me a lifeline , and i'm excited to be able to take it and try the last lifeline came from els after a threeputt at the 16th hole dropped him into a tie with roberts , and after his failed attempt at driving the green at the 17th netted him a par , he came to the 18th hole thinking he needed a birdie to win he did n't know that roberts had missed the short putt up ahead he did n't want to know he never looked at the scoreboard i suppose i should have , he said yes , he should have because he tried to hit his driver a club he hooked badly three times down the stretch rather than try to play it safe and hit 3wood or 2iron into the fairway on the 452yard hole and he tried to hit it hard i tried to smash the living stuffing out of it , he said he smashed it so far left that it nearly went on to the 15th tee he would have to chip out , and he did right into a sandy divot he needed to make par from there , 90 yards short of the hole , but the bad lie prevented him from hitting the shot he needed to hit he left the ball 45 feet from the hole els had no hope of making the putt to win miracles do happen , but to knock in a 45footer to win the united states open is taking it too far , he said he lagged up to 4 1 2 feet , just where roberts had missed from els hit his putt right in the middle of the hole now there are three of us , montgomerie said i did n't expect to make it in , but now i 've got a chance the outcome obviously is impossible to predict but one thing is certain when 90 holes of grueling golf at oakmont are over , someone is going to have his first major championship and he will have earned it photo ernie els of south africa tosses his club after a birdie on the 10th hole at oakmont , pa , yesterday els will be in a threeway playoff today \( associated press \) \( pg c10 \)
rome , july 14 italian investigators said today that the mafia was behind a series of bomb attacks last year against cultural and church targets in italy partly to destabilize the italian government , but also because the mafia felt that the roman catholic church had abrogated an unwritten handsoff policy toward organized crime the investigators , who are investigating the bombings of targets that included the uffizi gallery in florence , said they had issued arrest warrants for eight suspects , all with mafia associations , and had made two arrests none of the suspects have been linked directly to the uffizi bombing , though the investigators said evidence suggested that all the groups that exploded the bombs worked in close contact they said further warrants and arrests were forthcoming from may to august 1993 , five car bomb attacks in rome , florence and milan left 10 people dead and dozens wounded in addition to the uffizi , the targets were two venerable roman churches , san giovanni in laterano and san giorgio in velabro , and a modernart gallery in milan a powerful bomb also exploded near the home of a television talkshow host , maurizio costanzo , a vocal mafia opponent mr costanzo escaped unharmed intelligence chief quits the bombings outraged italians they prompted the head of the civilian intelligence agency to resign and led to shakeups in the national police organization the prime minister at the time , carlo azeglio ciampi , blamed a turbid alliance of forces that he said pursued both political destabilization and criminal goals but in their presentation today , the investigators focused solely on the mafia of the eight against whom arrest warrants were issued , four were already in jail , including salvatore riina , the reputed boss of all bosses of the sicilian mob two men suspected of actually setting off explosions , aldo frabetti and antonio scarano , who were identified as known drug runners with links to organized crime , were detained in recent days the investigators accused mr frabetti and mr scarano of placing the bombs that exploded in rome last july 27 , causing widespread damage to san giorgio and the lateran basilica and wounding dozens of people explosives moved around the magistrates presented a detailed picture of the way large amounts of explosives were moved about the country together with illegal drug shipments , a mafia specialty , and concealed for months in apartments controlled by mafia figures the investigators described how the explosives were delivered by truck at regular intervals to a tenement building on the via ostiense in rome , and hidden under gravel in the building s courtyard the main breaks in the case , the investigators said , came from ordinary citizens who volunteered observations of suspect activity , from mafia turncoats and from telephone taps in apartments and jail cells but the investigators were reluctant to reveal details , for fear of jeopardizing the ongoing investigations the car bomb at the uffizi , which killed five people , exploded on may 27 , 1993 , blowing out skylights and windows and damaging paintings restoration work is continuing , though large areas have been restored and reopened to the public at a news conference , the investigators said today that the order for the car bombs had been issued by the mafia to strike at the government , at the roman catholic church and at media figures who opposed the mafia , like mr costanzo bombs followed crackdown after the killing in may 1992 of the country s top mafia prosecutor , giovanni falcone , the government began the biggest crackdown against the mafia in years , leading to the arrest of mr riina , who had spent more than 20 years on the run michele coiro , the chief investigator , said the mafia believed that this crackdown might constitute the beginning of the end among those sought for detonating the bombs in rome are leoluca bagarella and giovanni brusca mr brusca is a wellknown mafia operative who is also accused of setting off the bomb that killed judge falcone the mafia also meant to strike back at the church , mr coiro said during a visit to sicily in may 1993 , pope john paul ii urged roman catholics , who make up the vast majority of sicily s five million people , to rise up against the mafia mr coiro said the pope s appeals were evidently viewed by the mafia as breaching a kind of nonbelligerence accord between mafia and church he said that in an apparent reprisal last september , the rev giuseppe puglisi , a priest in palermo who was an outspoken opponent of organized crime , was shot and killed in what investigators believe was a mafia operation

category no one is more awed by the transformative power of a new idea than dr maslin , a new york city psychotherapist in private practice in fact , she stands the conventional wisdom about change on its head when she enthusiastically asserts that you can , and perhaps should , try to change someone you love insight transforms the person who loves you , she writes through understanding the invisible marriage of our mother and father , which dr maslin refers to as our own first primal marriage , we can often come to terms with ourselves this was not her specific approach or even on her mind when she planned and wrote the book but while being interviewed in her spacious park avenue living room , she was visibly moved tears sprang to her eyes and her face reddened happy that a reader had extrapolated valuable sensibility from the behavior of a parent but dr maslin is not surprised you 're the product of a marriage , she said maybe if you could see your parents' marriage in a new and different light , it can give you something , and then help you understand yourself dr maslin said that she also often became emotional when observing the recognition process between couples during therapy sessions at her office i see it all the time , she explained when people are able to say something from the deep recesses of their hearts , i'm moved that s the way i am in collaboration with her husband , dr yehuda nir , a psychiatrist and author of the wellreceived memoir the lost childhood , a book based on his and his family s ordeal in nazioccupied poland , dr maslin has written two other books they are loving men for all the right reasons , soon to be reissued as patterns of heartbreak , and not quite paradise making marriage work dr maslin , a native of brooklyn , and dr nir have four children and a second home overlooking gardners bay in east hampton , where she holed up last winter to write much of the angry marriage with the wind blowing off the water , i thought the house was going to take off like in 'the wizard of oz , ' she recalled an artcollecting couple the couple s large , prewar manhattan apartment is decorated with a highly diverse art collection , including german expressionist works and inexpensivelooking american china figurines , many in matching pairs her fervent belief in the great influence of words and ideas underscores her book and conversation after the wheel , i think one of the greatest inventions in the world was talking therapy , she said the power of a new idea about yourself is the single most potent force in making changes this is what s so important about anger when we can begin to think about our anger and put it into words , we are taking gigantic steps in civilizing ourselves , especially in our society the rat will run through the maze until it drops dead , but there s something about this thing called a human being that has the capacity for change perhaps unexpectedly to many who futilely wage domestic or workplace warfare , or expend enormous psychic energy on its suppression , dr maslin makes plain from the very first chapter in her book that this terrifying emotion , anger , is actually a gift that is invariably universally misdeployed anger is nature s first gift , bringing the possibility of protection and love , she writes a gift through which we define ourselves , through which we ask the world to take heed , through which we shape our world and in turn are shaped by it , through which we come to love and be loved so while fighting is healthy , because it means you care , chronic hostility is not but it is crucial to know how to fight dr maslin has devised several accessible doityourself approaches to help couples develop psychological selfawareness , none of which uses terms like sadomasochism or neurosis in fact , it is a maslin trademark to avoid professional jargon i love to take complicated ideas and make them understandable , she said i love to use my scientific information , even about biological matters , and make them easy to grasp
snelling , sc each day 20 trucks travel down the isolated blacktop road that leads to the nation s biggest dump for lowlevel radioactive waste they are enough to create a traffic jam it can take a day or more before one of the tractor trailers loaded with steel boxes and 55gallon metal drums or the flatbed trucks laden with tall carbonsteel boxes , leadlined casks built to withstand 80mileanhour crashes , gets its turn to drop off its radioactive cargo in normal times , only three trucks arrive in a day , but the states that send them are now rushing to beat a june 30 deadline , when the dump that has taken 25 million cubic feet of radioactive machine parts , ash , medical instruments , clothing and manufacturing waste will be closed to shipments from outside eight southeastern states since 1971 , 37 states east of the rockies have been shipping their dangerous refuse to be buried on the 240 acres of virtually impermeable clay soil here in barnwell county , sc , about 45 miles southeast of augusta , ga if the waste were spread five feet deep , it would cover more than 100 football fields once the deadline passes , there will be no permanent place to put the waste it will have to be kept above ground at thousands of locations , often where it was produced , at utility companies , hospitals , research centers and manufacturers the waste at barnwell county is not intensely radioactive highlevel waste , which is mainly spent fuel rods from nuclear power plants and the byproducts of nuclear weapons production and research this highlevel waste remains radioactive for thousands , even hundreds of thousands of years before it decays the lowlevel waste is radioactive as little as 90 days to as long as 200 years it tends to be a variety of irradiated , rather than intrinsically radioactive , materials and most of it is not considered lethal even after long exposure but could cause illness or have uncertain longterm effects about 1 percent of the waste now shipped to barnwell county has enough radioactivity to kill a human being the stuff is not very dangerous in the first place , said michael munger , a political science professor at the university of north carolina at chapel hill but it is the symbolism of a place being viewed as a lowlevel radioactive waste disposal site that overtakes all logic on the other hand , professor munger also said , the probability of things going wrong are small for any one disposal site , but those chances increase tremendously when you have hundreds of storage sites and the ongoing need to move and transport the stuff the problem has been obvious for years in 1980 , congress passed the low level radioactive waste act to encourage states to organize themselves into compacts to develop new dumps ten compacts were set up , but states in eight of these have simply continued to ship waste to barnwell county as have three unaffiliated states including new york eighteen months ago , south carolina , fed up with its reputation as the nation s dumping ground for radioactive wastes , decided to ban dumping to all but the southeastern states the state and the county are giving up 50 million a year by restricting access to the dump fees for material from outside the region are up to 220 a cubic foot compared with 40 a cubic foot for waste from the region the nation s one other dump of this kind is on the hanford reservation in washington , which has been open only to 11 rocky mountain and northwestern states since 1992 , when a dump in beatty , nev , was closed the compacts established under the federal law spawned studies and debates but only a dozen proposals for sites , none of which have any chance of being approved before 1996 local opposition is ubiquitous no one is anxious to have a radioactivewaste dump next door , and the process is greatly complicated by the lack of a scientific consensus on the safety of various disposal methods in three regions , state legislatures have changed the rules for selecting sites , forcing officials to start their approval processes over in california , which is to have the dump for the southwestern compact , the white house at the urging of environmental groups and other opponents has stalled progress by delaying the transfer of federally owned land some people suggest that much of the planning by officials in many states has been fainthearted at best everyone rationalized the lack of progress by noting that barnwell county would be there as a backstop its closing is sure to force the states to confront their old thinking holmes brown , the executive director of the low level radioactive waste forum , an organization of disposal planners , said the closing would accelerate planning for new dumps no one wants to predict a date certain on any site , mr brown said but everyone has been on notice that this day was coming legislatures have gotten serious about this but mr munger , who has studied the planning process over the years , said most states were still not serious about being home to a nuclearwaste dump he pointed out that more than 300 million had already been spent in the nation on planning , an amount that measures how far some states have gone to avoid having a disposal site the closing of barnwell will increase the pressure on other regions , mr munger said , but ultimately the compact system of regional disposal will fail because so many states are just going through the motions whether it wants to or not , the congress and the federal government will have to reenter the picture caught in the middle are the utilities and other businesses and organizations that use radioactive material and create the waste allan d pasternak , technical director of the california radioactive materials management forum , said the closing of the barnwell dump amounted to the loss of the only safe port in uncertain and stormy seas it s a doubleedged sword because , if barnwell stayed open , we would continue to have a disposal resource but it probably would have slowed down planning in other parts of the country , mr pasternak said but , we all keep wondering how this closing now is going to create a sense of urgency about something that has been going on since 1980 one piece of good news is an outgrowth of the escalating cost of dumping at barnwell in recent years the organizations that make the waste have been working to reduce the volume by limiting operations , incinerating wastes into ash or compacting it their success has led some to question whether all of the disposal sites now being planned are necessary or economically viable graph radioactive waste much planning , little action shows states belonging to one of the 10 compacts designed to try to develop regional dumps for lowlevel radioactive waste
a man and a woman walk into the river cafe , the elegant waterside restaurant in the brooklynside shadow of the brooklyn bridge it s about 1 30 pm , the tail end of lunch hour on a tuesday they give the maitre d'hotel their name , tell him they have a reservation and hand him a voucher , with the river cafe typed explicitly on it , for their meal they 're on a tour package , they explain , to which he responds that he is sorry , but the restaurant is not participating in the package furthermore , looking down his list of reservations , he finds the couple s name nowhere the couple , a casually but not inappropriately dressed pair who might be from des moines or boston or painted post , look at each other , disappointed if not aghast what do you think happens next \? you 'll find out shortly , but the scene , which occurred on may 31 , the second day of the muchballyhooed tour package that is part of the ny '94 public relations campaign , was typical of the mixups i encountered in four days of sampling what the program is offering through the summer \( it expires on labor day , sept 5 \) announced with a flourish in midmay , the program is a cooperative attempt on the part of the city , the state and a variety of cultural institutions and private businesses that depend on tourism to alleviate the intimidation factor that inhibits many people from visiting new york city the idea is simple enough economy and convenience with one phone call to a travel agent , you can arrange for two nights in a hotel , a ticket to a broadway or off broadway show , lunch in a snazzy restaurant , a city tour by bus or boat , admissions to several of the city s museums , and a personal shopping assistant at a store of your choice an expensive meal , a smidgen of culture , some highrent shopping and a smattering of glitz , all for one price a tourist s dream of new york city , yes \? as with most good ideas , however , the difficulty is execution , and , by my lights anyway , there are plenty of bugs to be worked out i booked two tours , at the expensive and bargainprice extremes , and spent last week experiencing the city as a visitor would granted , i was trying out the program in its first week , with a holiday weekend thrown in to boot and this is , after all , a complicated venture involving dozens , if not hundreds , of commercial establishments and public institutions , and it was put together only in the last six months even its organizers admit it got off the ground prematurely , and that the planning for next year s package , as part of ny '95 , is already under way this thing got fasttracked so quickly , said alan rose , a vice president of marketing for the loews hotel chain , who served on the project s organizing committee , that after the press conference last month , a lot of the hotels contacted us and said , 'i know we signed up for this , but what is it \? ' this confusion shows in the marketing of the packages the tours are sold by price , but the prices in the advertisements can be misleading there are four packages offered , with prices from 19940 to 45940 , depending on the choice of hotel but these are , of course , perperson doubleoccupancy rates \( information subtly disclosed in the fine print \) so the range is really 39880 to 91880 and for those who want to travel alone , the price range is 329 to 795 a gloss on the big apple still , my week as a tourist was no hardship the weather was glorious , with the kind of crystalline air that shows off the new york city skyline as a spectacular testament to mankind s industriousness and several times i found myself thinking boy , what a place ! there was the boat tour , for instance an hour s meander , via seaport liberty cruises , around the the southern tip of manhattan , departing from the south street seaport on a sunny morning , with the wind spilling your hair in your eyes and the air as balmy as bath water , you look at the vertical spires of lower manhattan , as tightly packed as porcupine quills , not to mention the statue of liberty , ellis island and the verrazanonarrows bridge in the distance , and you understand why people want to come here and maybe even remember why you moved here yourself the boat , which makes five trips daily and normally costs 16 , was nearly empty last week as the summer proceeds , the crowds become huge , the captain said after we got off the boat , my romantic partner \( for what was , after all , a pretty romantic enterprise \) and i walked through the seaport , past city hall and over the brooklyn bridge it was a terrific way to end the morning , and it was appetiteraising , a great segue into lunch that was when we encountered john mcfadden , the manager of the river cafe , who was serving that day as maitre d'hotel mr mcfadden showed us the reservation list the name we used was not on it he examined my voucher , good , it claimed , for a prix fixe lunch for two at the river cafe , whereupon he sighed he explained that he had tried to tell the ny '94 organizers that the restaurant did n't wish to be included mainly , he said , because there are always mixups when reservations and payments are taken out of the restaurant s hands
in two new studies , researchers have found evidence that they say should put to rest the widespread belief that sugar or the artificial sweetener aspartame in the diet can make normal children frenetic and hyperactive children wild one study involved 48 normal preschool and schoolage children who were given large amounts of sugar , aspartame or saccharine neither the children nor their parents knew which sweetener they were eating the investigators , led by dr mark l wolraich of vanderbilt university in nashville , reported no effect on the children s behavior from any of the sweeteners the second study , by dr bennett a shaywitz of the yale university school of medicine and his colleagues , investigated the possible effects of very high doses of aspartame on the behavior of 15 hyperactive children they found none dr wolraich s study is being published today in the new england journal of medicine dr shaywitz s appears in the current issue of pediatrics 'puts matter to rest' the two studies , dr shaywitz said , should convince people that sweeteners do not affect children s behavior we studied vulnerable children with attentiondeficit disorder , he said he studied normal children neither of us saw any effects i would hope this puts the matter to rest a number of previous studies , prompted by parents' reports that sugar set off hyperactive behavior in their children , reached inconsistent conclusions nevertheless , many doctors recommend restricting sugar for hyperactive patients , dr marcel kinsbourne of tufts university in medford , mass , said in an editorial accompanying dr wolraich s article dr wolraich said that previous studies , including some of his own , were questioned because they put children in laboratory settings and gave them a single large dose of sugar critics said that to really see an effect , one would need to watch children in their homes and give them sugar more than once so dr wolraich recruited two groups of children one consisted of 25 normal children ages 3 to 5 the second group consisted of 23 children , ages 6 to 10 , who were described by their parents as sensitive to sugar the children and their families followed three different diets , spending a week on each one diet was high in sugar , one was high in aspartame and the third was high in saccharine , an artificial sweetener that unlike the other two sweeteners is not suspected of causing behavioral changes the food did not have artificial coloring or additives dr wolraich and his colleagues , at the university of iowa college of medicine in iowa city , reported that even though all the children ate substantial amounts of the sweeteners , the findings were negative checking a theory dr shaywitz and his colleagues recruited hyperactive children to address the suspicion that aspartame adversely affected the brain and behavior dr shaywitz said some researchers had hypothesized that abnormal amounts of a group of neurotransmitters , the catecholamines , were related to hyperactivity and animal studies of aspartame showed that in very high doses it could alter catecholamine synthesis in the brain we said , in theory , that you could link the two , dr shaywitz said it could be possible , he said , that aspartame worsens the symptoms of children with attention deficit disorder but he added , we found no effect and we gave them a large dose , about 10 times what any child would consume although dr shaywitz and dr wolraich believe that the sugar question is answered , some experts disagree dr william v tamborlane , a professor of pediatrics at yale university medical school , said he suspected that sugar could still have an effect a kid might get up and have two twinkies and a glass of fruit punch , he said , and show a sort of agitation that would n't be detected with a balanced diet dr c keith conners , a professor of medical psychology at duke university , said his studies showed that sugar did affect behavior they showed , he said , that how a child reacted to sugar depended on what foods were eaten before the sugar and whether the child was hyperactive caring parents \? other experts said the sugar hypothesis had been all but demolished in his editorial , dr kinsbourne asked , why do people so readily perceive a relationship between food and hyperactive behavior that can rarely be confirmed and is at best subtle \? the answer , he said , may be a tendency to look for exterior factors when the source of a problem is not clear or in preference to a genetic explanation he added that since a negative study could only fail to prove , but could never actually disprove , a hypothesis , it remains unclear how many negative findings are needed to close a particular line of investigation dr pasquale accardo and dr robert lindsay of st louis university school of medicine , in an editorial accompanying dr shaywitz s article , said the belief in the adverse behavioral effects of sugar and food additives was long on theory and short on fact dr judith l rapoport , chief of the child psychiatry branch at the national institute of mental health , said the fervent belief in the ill effects of sugar and aspartame was a fascinating sociological phenomenon , adding , i think it taps into very deep concepts about being good people because of what you feed your child the idea , dr rapoport explained , is that a caring , attentive parent would not give a child junk food loaded with sugar or aspartame and a caring , attentive parent would not have a child with a behavior problem however , dr rapoport said , there is not much evidence that being a bad parent has anything to do with hyperactivity is it possible that some children are extraordinarily sensitive to sugar or aspartame but the studies did not find them \? dr shaywitz said that to those who ask such questions , i would just cite them the evidence , adding , when studies are done in a controlled fashion , giving placebos and not knowing when a child is taking a sweetener or not , nobody is able to discriminate between the placebos and the sweeteners
polls and pundits alike predict a midterm democratic defeat so catastrophic that the republicans could end up controlling not only the senate but also \( for the first time since 1954 \) the house of representatives the polls are preliminary and the pundits fallible , and when we all wake up on nov 9 the democrats , though shaken , may still have slim majorities but if things do turn out badly , it will be partly because bill clinton and the democrats have failed to persuade the american people that they can govern as a party this failure of governance is rarely mentioned in the litany of causes for the democrats' discontent the most common suspects are a nagging , nationwide sense of economic discomfort the elusive but present ghost known as the character issue , raised anew by whitewater doubts about the president s managerial skills and his bumbling white house staff a generally sour national mood and the growing rebellion against incumbency , more damaging to democrats simply because there are more of them than there are republicans but the fact that these assembled democrats could not manufacture a satisfying product in mr clinton s first two years may be more important than the other reasons combined mr clinton , it should be recalled , rode to the white house on the premise that a democratic president and congress could get things done there were flaws in this premise the democrats themselves have never been models of unity nor could mr clinton claim a numerical mandate nearly 60 percent of the electorate voted for somebody else nevertheless , americans were invited to expect the end of gridlock that was mr clinton s single most powerful argument against the gathering ineptitude of the bush administration and the seductive togetherness offered by ross perot the president and his party did not deliver again , there are any number of explanations , all plausible , none satisfactory first , he expended huge amounts of his political capital on a few matters of great moment successes like the budget agreement and the north american free trade agreement in 1993 , failures like health care reform in 1994 that made orphans of lots of other worthy legislative enterprises second , though an instinctive compromiser , he did a surprisingly poor job of involving the opposition in his legislative program , not least health care third , the republicans , never really invited to the clambake , threw sand everywhere make no mistake the republicans cannot possibly run as the party of creative and helpful suggestions on the basis of representative newt gingrich s jerrybuilt contract with the voters , which is little more than the voodoo economics of the reagan 80 s the republicans must shoulder the additional burden imposed upon them by mr gingrich and senator bob dole , whose ugly behavior in the waning days of congress helped kill campaign finance and lobbying reform but republicans cannot be held responsible for whatever harm the democrats suffer in november because their participation was never part of the original promise if the voters are sour , and they are , it has more to do with mr clinton s failure to consolidate the majority they handed him and the failure of the party to unify itself democrats helped defeat his health care initiative a democrat , ernest hollings of south carolina , at one point in his career an offbeat candidate for the presidency , opposed the general agreement on tariffs and trade the churlish behavior of tom foley , the house leader , did much to cancel mr clinton s pledge to end washington s culture of influencepeddling western democrats joined with regional republicans to sabotage many of interior secretary bruce babbitt s most promising environmental initiatives the final proof of the democrats' own gridlockfeeding disunity was their inability to rally all their troops for the two critical cloture votes on the lobbying bill in the end , it was difficult for a selfprofessed new democrat to deliver when so many old democrats stood in his way this must surely have been a painful surprise for a hopeful fellow like bill clinton but his dilemma is no worse than the voters' , who have before them equally unappetizing bunches of foley democrats and gingrich republicans this is a gloomy prospect , promising not just gridlock but rising public frustration at the majority party s inability to govern even when it has the keys to the capitol and the white house
regarding the article on taro on march 20 pardoned in jersey , taro incognito , your readers should know that two of the three dogfights were on taro s property , and the third was with an extremely vicious terrier , which numerous individuals came forward in court to state , including post office employees and ups delivery people it is terrible that a fight occurred between two animals , which resulted in the owner of the terrier putting his dog to sleep , not being killed by taro as you reported however , as anyone knowledgeable about dogs knows , dogs' fighting with other dogs has no relationship with dogs that attack people you reported that the girl maintains that how could you report anything concerning the child when the child never testified \? part of the problem concerning this case is that we could n't get the child to come forward to determine what actually happened with regard to the doctor s statements , your readers should realize that doctors make mistakes like the rest of us something does n't fit when you consider that taro has a bite radius the size of a grown man s fist but the injury was only the size of a dime in addition , there was the existence of four parallel scratch lines directly above the torn lip , which shows that there was a scratch , not a bite i completely agree with the argument that new jersey should not have required that taro remain out of state that defies any logic if taro were really bad , there is no way that the governor of new jersey would have stepped in to end this foolishness she did her homework and asked those who took care of him if he was a problem and got the answer right from the k9 officers every officer there told me they would miss him , bar none there is good that has come from this the taro amendments are moving through both houses of the new jersey legislature , which will insure that this atrocity never happens again an affirmative defense will no longer be necessary it will be the prosecution s responsibility to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an animal attacked without provocation canine mentality and behavior will be acknowledged the quasijudicial panel of experts , which proved themselves to be less than so , will be abolished medical testing will be done to determine a possible existing condition , which could explain an event lonnie lehrer haworth , nj
laurel , miss , oct 12 two homosexual men were slain here last weekend , and the sheriff of jones county was speculating about why one was found with his running shorts pulled down to his ankles let s think about it a minute , the sheriff , maurice hooks , said on tuesday as he surveyed the overgrown railroad embankment where the bodies were discovered the men happened to be engaging in sex at the time , the sheriff theorized someone walks up pow ! pow ! he continued , imitating gunfire it s just a theory , he said could the men , as some groups have asserted , have been killed because they were gay \? sheriff hooks did n't think so we 're going on robbery till we can prove otherwise , he said he added avowed homosexuals \? did n't have nothing to do with it the detail about the shorts is one of the few clues gathered so far in the slayings of robert walters , 34 , and joseph shoemake , 24 , both of laurel , a hardedged industrial town of 18 , 827 people but like sheriff hooks , many people here are not inclined to believe that the pulleddown shorts are evidence of a premeditated hate crime they are more of the opinion that the killings , committed at pointblank range with a 22caliber pistol , were simply a deadly consequence of a random robbery late friday night that had nothing to do with the men s homosexuality and they tend to agree with the county coroner , joyce perrett , who believes that the victim s shorts came down when someone dragged the body into the brush that view , the killings themselves and the subsequent friction between the small , subdued gay community here and organized gayrights groups that have intervened in the case have underscored the ambiguity and tensions of gay life in a small southern town do n't ask , do n't tell , is how the rev stan runnels of st john s episcopal church , who officiated at mr shoemake s funeral today , summed up the prevailing attitude they did not feel hated and despised by the community , mr runnels said of the two men , who he said were friends but not lovers as long as you do n't try to force the issue , mr runnels said , it s not going to be an issue but about 30 minutes away from where the bodies were discovered , in the same county , are people who thoroughly believe in forcing the issue the residents of camp sister spirit , the selfstyled feminist retreat run by two lesbians that has made headlines because of the hostility of the camp s rural neighbors people at the camp have not hesitated to call the slayings a hate crime they say it is of a piece with dozens of small harassments that they have been subjected to in the last year local residents , they say , have taunted them , made harassing phone calls , left dead animals at the gate and fired guns at the property brenda henson , one of sister spirit s founders , attributed the deaths to an atmosphere of coverup and hatred other gay rights groups , national and local , are contending that the men were killed because they were gay none of this appears to be swaying local officials i'm not going to say it was a hate crime until we get to the bottom of it , sheriff hooks said angrily this week i just do n't appreciate being used by any social groups a resident of camp sister spirit , kathy wilson , said , two of our brothers are dead but in interviews today , three men who described themselves as friends of the victims dismissed the camp s contention that the men had been victims of a hate crime as far as them being singled out for any particular reason , we have not seen any evidence of that , said one of the men , who would give only his first name , rex i do n't feel that anyone s private lives had anything to do with leading to this tragedy don scott , the chief investigator for the laurel police department , said robbery was a possible motive because mr walters s billfold was found near his body empty but the investigator also noted that a watch and an expensive ring worn by mr shoemake had not been taken mr scott , too , doubts that he has a hate crime on his hands i do n't see that that has anything at all to do with this crime , he said mr walters was a salesman for a local printing company , and mr shoemake worked at a plant that produces electrical transformers mr reynolds , the episcopal minister , said the men had been at a party on friday night and had gone out together to buy cigarettes their bodies were found the next morning just outside the city limits by two women picking up bottles the men had each been shot once in the head the police found mr walters s truck in laurel , and there were bloodstains in it , leading the police to believe that the men were killed in the truck photos joseph shoemake , left , 24 , and robert walters , 34 , in their high school yearbook photographs the two homosexual men were slain in laurel , miss , last week , but officials have not classified the killings a hate crime map of laurel , miss
indianapolis , may 31 the pacers left town this afternoon feeling pretty good and mighty tough , if not absolutely certain that they can beat the knicks in new york what they do know is what the numbers tell them they have climbed back into the eastern conference finals , tied at 22 a series few believe they can win , and granted themselves the opportunity to at least mouth what was unfathomable a couple of months ago we 've got to win six games and we can be the world s champs , pacer coach larry brown said after a light workout in preparation for game 5 wednesday night at madison square garden that s mindboggling to me for the knicks , it would be positively mindaltering if the pacers were to go into the garden and accomplish what chicago narrowly missed doing in the conference semis for brown , the job was to convince his young players , particularly those on the front line , that noise and familiar surroundings should not in itself be the knicks' panacea guards are n't a problem i think you can do on the road what you can do at home , said brown , who smiled as he admitted that his career coaching record at the garden might suggest otherwise two and 31 , he said brown said he did not worry about his veteran guards , reggie miller , byron scott and vern fleming they have been in the national basketball association long enough to deal with distractions winning on the road was routine for scott when he played for pat riley s los angeles lakers miller , a showman , said , i 'd rather play all my games on the road and fleming , who grew up in queens and still calls his hometown new yawk after four years of college in georgia and a decade with the pacers , suggested that there would be just as much pressure on the knicks as on the pacers it s pretty much the same as when i was a kid and used to go watch walt frazier play , fleming said you have no choice but to play well at home because the crowd will turn on you in a minute if you do n't brown and the pacers believe that their weekend sweep at home , in which they ground the knicks' offense to a 72 pointspergame halt , lifted them over a psychological hurdle despite two road victories against orlando and one against atlanta in the first two playoff series , brown said he sensed apprehension in his players as they went into new york for games 1 and 2 last week it showed in their body language every loose ball in game 1 and 2 , they got , he said every loose rebound , they got i think we 've got that confidence back that we had earlier i think we should have different feelings going back there now brown knew that the key to the series for the pacers would be for their young big men to play with the fury and abandon that got indiana to the conference finals in the first place dale davis and antonio davis , most of all , could not afford to let charles oakley and , to a lesser extent , anthony mason , treat them like their little cousins we 're battling him , said brown , of oakley , who he considers the player most crucial to the knicks' style of play we 're not letting him push and shove us around that s the key if you let him push and shove you around , he 'll dominate you if you stand up to him , put pressure on him , it s much different after foul trouble plagued him in game 3 , oakley did get 15 rebounds in game 4 , but was n't able to exert control , particularly on the offensive boards , and give the knicks what brown calls the cheap baskets that often bail out their porous offense more significant , there was one moment in the fourth quarter when oakley , frustrated by the pacers' size and activity in the lane that helped produce 26 knick turnovers , 8 of them his , pushed antonio davis away with a forearm davis faced oakley and shoved back with both hands we have to play like jerks , davis said if they want to play that way , we 'll have to , too we have to get a win in new york , said fleming somehow none of this promises to raise the esthetic level of play , or increase the number of points scored , though brown did correctly point out that out west , houston and utah combined for 158 points in their fifth game saturday afternoon for a franchise that began these playoffs with zero series victories in its nba history , the end is going to have to justify the means offense sells tickets , said miller , by far the prettiest shooter in this rugby scrum of a series defense wins championships
nancy kerrigan , you 've just taken a ferocious pounding in the media for not knowing how to deal with your olympic fame what are you going to do now \? i'm going to host saturday night live ! ' tonight at 11 30 ms kerrigan , a suddenly vulnerable icon , will step into television s most famous den of iconbashing , the weekly compilation of sketch comedy and rude satire known as saturday night live the move is risky for her , since the show is guaranteed to mock her snow white image , her list of lucrative commercial endorsements , even her close encounters with the tonya harding crowd on the other hand , 90 minutes of playing the good sport could provide ms kerrigan with some instant image repair i do think it 'll be great for me , ms kerrigan said on thursday during rehearsals at nbc of course , there s going to be someone that s going to find fault with everything i do but i ca n't live my life like that , worrying about everybody comments and chiding in the last two weeks , ms kerrigan has stumbled as she never did during her silvermedal performance on the ice at lillehammer , norway first she was caught on camera complaining about a delay in the awards ceremony and speculating that the gold medalist in figure skating , oksana baiul of ukraine , was only going to cry again then ms kerrigan was chided by some sports commentators for leaving lillehammer early to fly off to disney world to start cashing in on her status as america s ice queen greedy , she was called , as if she had become the eighth dwarf then , during her ride in a disney parade , she made remarks that were interpreted as scoffing at the event she was part of now , as ms kerrigan tries to regain her footing , along comes her appearance on a show that is famous , in part , for its questionable taste had she or her representatives considered withdrawing from the saturday night commitment , which she made in january , long before her wrong turn into the media shooting gallery \? not even for a moment , ms kerrigan said when this came along , i just thought great , that will be a lot of fun , she said i did n't know i was going to have a really tough 10day period like this but i had no second thoughts my mom told me there was somebody in the press in boston saying that if he were my agent , he would n't allow me to do this but that s silly it seems to me that some people do n't want me to be happy and do n't want me to have fun , for some odd reason that i do n't really understand i thought you go to the olympics , you do well , you feel good about what you 've done you 're supposed to be happy and have a good time now and relax but i have n't had that opportunity ms kerrigan said she had seen saturday night live frequently and knew what she was in for as the show s head writer , jim downey , put it , she s surely going to get the chance to make fun of herself the show s producers say they are trying to walk the line between enjoying ms kerrigan s recent perils and exploiting them in a way that will make viewers recoil lorne michaels , the executive producer of saturday night live and the man who brought it to television 20 years ago , said , i think people will see her as being vulnerable just by being on the show ms kerrigan wo n't just show up , do a monologue , appear in a skit or two and say good night anyone watching who is expecting to see a lot of nancy kerrigan wo n't be disappointed , mr michaels said indeed , as the show was being planned this week , ms kerrigan was rehearsing to be in all but a few of the show s 10 to 12 sketches , playing everything from herself to a hottempered senorita the show is likely to make some reference , not in an obvious way , to her rivalry with ms harding , mr downey said ms kerrigan is even being asked to sing a little that is really scary , ms kerrigan said i have n't sung anywhere except in the car , by myself mr michaels said the show s purpose never is to embarrass the guest hosts , and they are always allowed to stay out of sketches they are uncomfortable with we read as many as 40 or 50 pieces on wednesdays , he said we 're only looking for 10 or 12 ms kerrigan said some of the skethes had made her uncomfortable and she had asked that they not be used ms kerrigan says she has n't done much in front of crowds except skate not even a class play she has done several commercials , of course , but she described that work as mostly facial things some saturday night live cast members expressed concern about the nerves ms kerrigan was displaying during rehearsals , and said they were taking pains to put her at ease chris farley , a zambonisized cast member who will be featured with ms kerrigan in a takeoff on a pairs skating routine , stood behind her during the shooting of promotions for the show , massaging her back and encouraging her mr michaels , who is known for never flinching even at the most chaotic moments of the live show , said he was unworried athletes by and large are used to being in front of a large group of people and not knowing how it turns out , he said with people who are n't performers , i do n't think people judge them on how well they do in sketches as much as the fact that they are doing them at all saturday night live has enlisted other athletes as guest hosts , including michael jordan , joe montana and chris evert but none of them have been such a sensation in such a short period of time as ms kerrigan nancy is the kind of host where everyone is writing our show for us , mr downey said they assume we 're going to do a bit with nancy endorsing the club this is one of the few shows where we can disappoint people by not doing their ideas but we like to think we do n't do firstthought ideas a troublesome monologue saturday night live , has come in for its own share of critcism in recent months a monologue by the comedian martin lawrence , who was host on the most recent broadcast , so offended some nbc executives with its explicit sexual material that they have promised never to repeat the show mr michaels said that that show was unusually difficult , but he dismissed more general criticism that the program has become less sophisticated and is losing momentum as a medium for satire we 've been through these cycles many times before , he said the show is not what it was and it s not what it will be photo during rehearsal as the host of tonight s saturday night live , nancy kerrigan enjoyed the goingson with aretha franklin , the featured guest , while lorne michaels , the executive producer , worked in background \( lesly weiner nbc \)

moscow , dec 11 hundreds of russian tanks rolled across the border of a rebellious muslim region in southern russia today , setting off the worst internal political crisis in russia since president boris n yeltsin had troops fire on the moscow parliament last year the threat of a fullscale war in the region , chechnya , grew throughout the day as columns of russian forces thundered toward the region s capital from three directions but there was hope that tensions could be eased with possible talks on monday between the two sides mr yeltsin , who is in a moscow hospital recovering from minor surgery on his nose , has been able to quell past attempts at independence in siberia and other regions of the russian federation , but he has never had such good fortune in chechnya , which first tried to secede in 1991 the current conflict with moscow has been building since then in a rich oil region with more than a million residents that is russia s most infamous center of organized crime we must find a political solution to the problems of one of the members of the russian federation , mr yeltsin said tonight in an address to the nation we must protect its members from armed extremism political solutions , though , seem increasingly elusive this is the first time since the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 that russia has turned such enormous firepower against its own citizens , and the threat to political stability in the nation is tremendous some of mr yeltsin s strongest political allies bitterly attacked him today , and parliamentary leaders who oppose the action said their phone lines and power were inexplicably cut tonight monday happens to be the first anniversary of the new russian constitution , a document that mr yeltsin has used to justify the invasion of chechnya just as mikhail s gorbachev s efforts to preserve the soviet union foundered when he sent troops into lithuania , georgia and azerbaijan , mr yeltsin faces a similar situation today peace talks between chechnya and russia have been scheduled to begin on monday in vladikavkaz , about 50 miles southwest of grozny , the chechen capital negotiators from russia have already arrived , and a team from grozny is expected to arrive by monday but it is unclear whether the talks will begin , or what there is to talk about , since by tonight lead elements of the russian deployment had already advanced to 10 miles from the capital many women and children have already been evacuated from grozny , although neither the russian army nor the heavily armed rebels have begun to unleash their full power , reports from the capital indicate led by the flamboyant and virulently antirussian president , dzhokhar dudayev , the chechens , a muslim people with a long history of hostility toward russian leaders in moscow , are allied with muslim countries abroad and have received military aid from countries like afghanistan and iran our independence is forever , mr dudayev told reporters in grozny today on that my life is my wager his foreign minister , shamsedin yusef , added they cannot kill every chechen there are more than 1 million of us , and we are all ready to fight the chechens' cause finds little support in russia but their oil wealth , their physical location in the strategically important caucasus mountains and their increasing willingness to defy orders from moscow have made it almost impossible for mr yeltsin to allow the situation there to fester any longer mr dudayev s troops have engaged in battle with russianbacked forces in recent months , although moscow denied official links to the fighting before mr yeltsin authorized the use of force in chechnya on friday , moscow had acknowledged , in response to accusations from mr dudayev s government , that its military had been involved in the struggle previously in the last week , russia had sent helicopters , personnel carriers and other heavy armaments to the region as a prelude to today s action the north caucasus , where chechnya is located , is vital to the physical defense of russia , and weakness for the russians there would spell greater weakness across the entire region , which also includes georgia , armenia and azerbaijan it is an area with rapidly shifting political alliances and immensely valuable oil pipeline routes russian troops have already been ordered to seize control of all oil refining sites and pipelines in the territory , news reports in moscow said tonight chechnya was among the biggest oil refining centers of the former soviet union , capable of processing as much as 12 million tons of crude oil a year mr yeltsin has said that this battle is for democracy , not oil , and that if the russian constitution is to last for more than a year or two , it must be enforced but bringing order to chechnya would serve a far greater purpose as well it would make clear to anyone with similar intentions that moscow will not accept such independence from any republic and that survival without reliance on russia would not be easy moscow has long feared that chechen neighbors like north ossetia and dagestan could secede from russia , too , if they had the right
cape town , sept 8 nelson mandela , south africa s indispensable man , settled into the seat of his presidential jet he propped his chronically swollen feet on two pillows , accepted a bowl of cereal and a plate of fruit , and commenced a daylong demonstration of his art of the presidency it was 6 am on his 122d day as liberatorturnedchiefexecutive , and he had agreed to let two reporters watch him do his job never a man oblivious of his audience , mr mandela promptly embarked on a campaign of seductive engagement deliberate charm , disarming confidences , a command of details mustered in defense of crisp convictions admirers who regard the man as a modern saint might have had moments of doubt in the course of this day he would display an occasional meanness toward his predecessor and now deputy , f w de klerk , and a surprising solicitousness of corporate big shots who have quietly donated money to his cause but the day would leave little question of the patriarchal authority that sometimes seems to be the main force binding this country s improbable governing fusion of races and interests as he poked at the fruit , mr mandela recalled the paternal scolding he had delivered the night before to one of his closest allies , the congress of south african trade unions dressed in a union cap and tshirt , the president had told the unionists the last thing they wanted to hear ease up on the strikes you are scaring foreign investors prepare to tighten your belts and accept low wages , because that is how some asian economies became tigers he warned union workers against putting their own modest advantages above the needs of five million blacks with no jobs at all , for whom the president is convinced the only hope is to make south africa a mecca for foreign capital but mr mandela knows that many in the unions and some senior figures in his own party regard such thinking as sacrilege you still have this question of populism 'let the workers strike ! ' mr mandela said now , flying from pretoria to cape town they say , 'we want only investors who will invest at all costs' i'm trying to warn against that type of thinking that is irresponsible we must move from the position of a resistance movement to one of builders south africa is not a oneman show in his cabinet and parliament , and in the provincial governments , mr mandela has a strong cast , including two possible successors thabo mbeki , a former exile and liberation diplomat who now serves as the first of two deputy presidents , and cyril ramaphosa , a toughminded labor leader during the apartheid years who refused his pick of cabinet posts to remain as head of mr mandela s party , the african national congress but probably none of them has the weight to say what mr mandela said the night before to the unionists , and to expect the respectful hearing he got at 7 50 am today , his falcon 900 landed at an air force base outside cape town , and the official day began early morning white financiers , black neighbors there is little of nelson mandela in the cape town office that he inherited from the last presidents of apartheid the only personal touches among the african artifacts installed by the national gallery to indigenize the suite are a photograph of the little cottage where he grew up in a remote rural village , the scion of tribal royalty , and four pictures of two young boxers sparring in soweto in 1959 , one of them recognizably the young nelson mandela the vibe , however , is pure mandela the staff around him is conspicuously and comfortably multiracial the working style is courteously informal each visitor , including cabinet ministers and diplomats , is invited to shake hands with the woman who serves them tea 8 30 am this is the office where i saw p w botha in july 1989 , mr mandela said , folding his long , erect frame onto a creamcolored upholstered sofa that meeting with the president who preceded mr de klerk was a watershed in the long negotiations toward democracy mr botha was known for good reason as the great crocodile , but mr mandela recalls him as a charming man who poured tea for his guest and addressed him with respect mr mandela places a premium on personal contact in affairs of state manners count , and loyalty , even the easy loyalty of a kind word or a generous check , is remembered when he upbraided the labor leaders the day before , he did not mention another reason their militancy has worried him some employers who have been the targets of strikes have been secret benefactors of the african national congress before the election campaign , mr mandela went to 20 titans of corporate south africa and asked each for at least a million rand about 275 , 000 to build up his party and finance the campaign all but one , he said , complied a few , like raymond d ackerman , the head of the pick 'n pay grocery chain , gave double the minimum request , mr mandela said so it rankled him that mr ackerman s stores had just borne the brunt of a raucous strike by store clerks

uncompromising 1990 s version of on the road that gives us an alarming picture of a country pitched on the edge of an emotional and social abyss , a country already familiar from tabloid headlines and confessional talk shows , a country in which too many people pack guns and too many people come to violent , unexpected ends composed from a series of tenuously linked chapters , each of which reads like a short story , going native begins with a snapshotbright portrait of a suburban couple caught up in middling middleness the joneses have two young children and a house full of televisions rho has a susceptibility to bad thoughts and scary dreams , a sense of emotional claustrophobia her husband , wylie , although he spends a lot of time watching shoot chase crash movies , seems like an average sort of guy there is nothing immediately distinctive about him , rho thinks , no crags or crannies or funny clumps of hair for words to adhere to he is a guy who looked like any other guy one night , rho and wylie invite their friends tom and gerri hanna over for a barbecue after the nachos and daiquiris , after the steaks and potatoes , wylie excuses himself from the table he never returns and never looks back wylie , it seems , has stolen his neighbors' green ford galaxie , an unwashed , unwaxed , decidedly unnew car that will take him on a disorienting odyssey across america , into the dark , don delillo territory of lost souls and disintegrating values , deep into the heart of darkness like the receding american frontier , the road , for wylie , means freedom , independence , the chance to invent himself anew it also means rootlessness , dislocation , the loss of family and self as he makes his way westward to the coast , wylie follows a path that intersects the lives of a motley group of outlaws , outcasts and outsiders there s randy sawyers , a former medical student who abandoned his ambitions for the solitary pleasures of driving a truck hundreds of miles a week on the interstates there s jessie horn , a dancing slave girl at a las vegas casino , who dumps her abusive husband , finds a female lover and takes a job at a massmarket wedding chapel and there s emory chace , a smalltown motel owner , who dreams of writing a hit movie about a woman who falls in love with an alien from outer space as far as these people are concerned , lyrics from heavymetal rock songs , shootout sequences from movies and lurid scenes from pulp novels all bleed together into the violence they watch every night on the news and witness daily in their lives the random driveby shootings the highspeed , highway crashes the unforeseen acts of god and nature and man what s more , many of these people seem unable or unwilling to differentiate between dreams and reality , between the movies they have seen and the actual lives they lead freya , a former pornography star turned sex entrepreneur , makes a lot of money videotaping people s private fantasies the copelands , a wealthy hollywood couple , journey to the farthest reaches of borneo in pursuit of a vision of themselves as intrepid adventurers and mister cd and his girlfriend , latitia , find their cocainefueled paranoia turning into reallife violence , as their lives career out of control none of these people have the slightest grip on who they are or what they truly believe in fact , all of them seem caught in a perpetual state of metamorphosis , shedding old lives and shrugging on new ones with the ease of an actor changing costumes for a scene a nurse becomes a drug addict a vegas entrepreneur becomes a preacher a teenage girl becomes a worshiper of satan wylie , mr wright suggests , is perhaps the most extreme example of this protean personality during his crosscountry drive , he assumes and discards a host of aliases and identities , erasing his past and his responsibility for his actions as he goes change your name , he thinks , and you change your reality events , he decides , will begin falling into new , previously unthinkable patterns using quick , expressionist prose , mr wright narrates wylie s adventures and their violent , shattering consequences with cool aplomb , as he plunges the reader into a nightmare world of sleazy motels and lowrent casinos , mindaltering drugs and orgies and murder the writing is more controlled , more elliptical than in his earlier novels not a single detail is wasted here , not a single scene is superfluous the result is a chilling and often brilliant novel , a novel that radiates the dark , consuming energy of a black hole photo of stephen wright \( jerry bauer farrar , straus and giroux \)
she became america s black cinderella but her early dreams were not to find prince charming , or to be queen of the debutante s ball or even to be adored , as she would be , and cheered lustily and mobbed around the world , with her fans sometimes even stealing off her shoes while she wore them the only thing i ever really wanted when i was a child , wilma rudolph once told me , was to be normal to be average to be able to run , jump , play and do all the things the other kids did in my neighborhood wilma rudolph s life , however , became the the stuff of fairy tales , the crippled girl at age 11 who became an olympic sprint champion at 20 , whose charm and elegance captivated millions she was born in 1940 in a small house in clarksville , tenn , the 20th of 22 children to the combined two marriages of her father , ed rudolph , a railroad porter , and her mother , blanche , a domestic and yesterday early in the morning , in brentwood , tenn , not far from her birthplace , wilma rudolph died , having succumbed to a malignant brain tumor she was beautiful , she was nice , and she was the best , said bill mulliken , winner of an olympic gold medal in swimming and teammate of rudolph s on the 1960 american team in rome olympics i can still see in my mind s eye a photograph of her gracefully crossing the finish line first in the 200meter dash in rome , her head back , her outside leg raised to me , that picture symbolized what wilma rudolph was all about the epitome of athletic femininity when wilma was 4 , suffering simultaneously from double pneumonia and scarlet fever , her left leg became paralyzed at age 6 , she was fitted with a special shoe , which enabled her to walk haltingly she wore that shoe until she was 11 i remember the kids always saying , 'i do n't want to play with her we do n't want her on our team , ' she said so i never had a chance to participate and all my young life i would say , 'one day i'm going to be somebody very special and i'm not going to forget those kids ' whatever spurs are needed to drive a champion , one of those must be a need to continually prove oneself to others , as well as to oneself talent , while , significant , is not enough i was competitive from the very first moment i heard that girls were allowed to run track , she said and from that moment , that was my world i trained daily i was forever skipping class , and would climb over the fence and be the only girl in the stadium tall and slender she grew to 6 feet and 130 pounds she was also greatly gifted she became a track and basketball star in high school , and then at tennessee state university in nashville as a high school star , she won a bronze medal in the relays in the 1956 olympics in melbourne good , but perhaps not enough to make those kids in her old neighborhood never forget her four years later , she won three gold medals , in the 100 , the 200 and the 400meter relay , the most track and field gold medals won by a woman since babe didrikson in 1932 the '60 olympics was my greatest thrill , rudolph said and when i think back on it , i still get frightened , to remember a capacity crowd in the stadium all standing and chanting my name she returned to america and earned a teaching degree from tennessee state her life took on a frequently mundane quality she tried a few jobs , from teaching school to coaching she was human , sometimes selfinvolved , and making decisions that turned out poorly had tax problems was married twice and divorced twice but she remained wilma rudolph , olympic champion she set up the wilma rudolph foundation for minority youngsters she gave speeches , she reaped honors for longago achievements and , like other black olympic champions , she returned to an america that could be hostile when , once , she went for a bank loan , she experienced rejection because , she believed , of her color and while she might not have had the same reaction to racial slights as her fellow 1960 american olympian , cassius clay , who threw his gold medal into a river , she remained aware that , in effect , the playing field outside of the playing field was uneven but none of that diminished her beauty , or her stature when she entered a room , she commanded it immediately , walking straight and tall , invariably wearing a stylish hat and a generous smile , all warmth and majesty she retired from running in 1962 because , she said , she wanted to be remembered at her best and her legacy , her inspiring story , is a model of all the cliches turned truisms in sports for boys as well as girls for any color from any culture with any handicap when i was running , wilma rudolph said , i had the sense of freedom , of running in the wind i never forgot all the years when i was a little

stateline , nev the legal pipeline is full of complaints filed by criminal defendants who contend that they did not get a fair trial the improbable thing is that howard l haupt is among them mr haupt is the rarest of plaintiffs found not guilty of murdering a 7yearold boy , he has nonetheless sued on the ground that his trial denied him due process and if his chances of prevailing in that suit should seem slim , consider that a threejudge panel of a federal appeals court has unanimously given him the goahead to proceed with it mr haupt , a 43yearold computer programmer from san diego , seeks 3 million in compensatory damages and 1 million in punitive damages from the city of las vegas , whose police force investigated him , and from clark county , whose court system tried him the case turns largely on a disclosure by the judge who presided at the murder trial that an outburst by the prosecutor and a telephone call from a police detective so intimidated him that he abandoned his plans to advise the jury to return a verdict of acquittal that the jury ultimately cleared mr haupt anyway is irrelevant to whether the intimidation of the judge denied the defendant due process , the appeals panel decided in reversing a federal district court that had thrown out mr haupt s suit a holiday weekend slaying even in southern nevada , where the prosecution of crimes of passion competes for attention with litigation by dueling elvis impersonators , the haupt affair has continued to fascinate it dates from 1987 , when mr haupt spent thanksgiving weekend at whiskey pete s , a large roadside casino and hotel here in stateline on the sunbaked flats of the mojave desert , the site of a landsailing tournament that he wanted to attend the same weekend , alexander harris , age 7 , disappeared from the casino s video arcade one month later his body was found under a nearby trailer he had been strangled there was little physical evidence , and there were no witnesses to the abduction but several people told the las vegas metro police department , which had jurisdiction , that mr haupt resembled a man who had been seen near alexander around the arcade trial and acquittal mr haupt had no criminal record , passed two liedetector tests and produced eight witnesses who told the authorities that at the time of the abduction he was at the sailing tournament nonetheless , he was charged with firstdegree murder and kidnapping a result , his suit contends , of police investigators' altering and fabricating evidence , largely through the improper coaxing of witnesses in february 1989 , after five weeks of argument and testimony , the jury took slightly more than a day to clear mr haupt his initial reaction i'm very pleased that the justice system works but if the trial produced a notguilty verdict , it arrived there in an uncommon manner in the final days of the proceeding , as each side prepared to offer closing arguments , judge stephen l huffaker of clark county district court had concluded that he should advise the jury that there was insufficient evidence for a conviction under nevada law , a judge may offer the jurors his opinion of how they should vote , although that opinion is not binding it is also rare judge huffaker said in a recent interview that he had issued such an advisory to a jury only once before he was ready to do so in this case , he said , because he was convinced of mr haupt s innocence but when the judge called prosecution and defense lawyers into his chambers to tell them of his plans , the roof fell in an enraged melvyn t harmon , the chief deputy district attorney , went ballistic , in the words of mr haupt s defense lawyer mr harmon screamed at judge huffaker , telling him , among other things , that if he went ahead with the advisory and the jury heeded it , the blood of alexander harris would be on your hands alexander s murder , little more than a year before , had gripped this community , and the trial had drawn a great deal of attention against that backdrop , mr harmon s rage had a particularly unsettling effect on judge huffaker , who by his own account suddenly felt a heavier burden than he had ever anticipated 'threatened' and 'intimidated' two days after that exchange between judge and prosecutor , judge huffaker , convinced that he could not issue the advisory and that his independence had been compromised , again called the two sides to his chambers he wanted to read into the record all that had occurred during the previous 48 hours , in part so that a transcript of this second session in chambers would give mr haupt grounds for appeal in the event of a conviction according to the transcript , the judge told mr harmon of feeling threatened and intimidated by his outburst and by his degrading me personally the judge recalled mr harmon s saying that if i gave the instruction , i would not be in support of the justice system and would be immoral the judge said he regarded mr harmon as one of the best prosecutors in nevada but had considered having him arrested for contempt of court call from a detective
newark , jan 12 in an announcement that removed a cloud from governorelect christine todd whitman s inauguration next week , federal and state investigators said today that they had found no evidence to support allegations that republicans paid bribes to hold down the democratic vote in november mrs whitman s victory had been tainted almost immediately after the nov 2 election when edward j rollins jr , who served as mrs whitman s campaign manager over the closing weeks of the campaign , told reporters in washington that the campaign had spent about 500 , 000 in walking around money to suppress the vote in urban areas he said that some of the money had gone to black ministers with the understanding that they would not speak from the pulpit in favor of gov jim florio s reelection , and that other money had been paid to democratic party workers to stay home on election day mr rollins later said he had exaggerated what had happened in the campaign to the point that his remarks were untrue and in a courtordered deposition he called his statements bravado and a fantasy but never used the word no when asked by lawyers for the democratic party whether the activities he originally described ever took place investigators find nothing michael chertoff , the united states attorney for new jersey , said today that a twomonth inquiry by dozens of federal bureau of investigation agents and state investigators had uncovered no evidence that any of the activities described by mr rollins had ever occurred mr chertoff said the investigators asked lawyers for the democratic party as well as members of the black clergy for any leads , tips , scraps of information or hints that might support mr rollins s original claims , but were unable to find a single example later today , mrs whitman spoke to reporters at her transition office near the state house , noting that from the outset she had denounced mr rollins s original statement as untrue but it s obviously very pleasing to finally have it out and have it come to closure , she said it is a vindication for the africanamerican community as well mr rollins , through his washington office , issued a statement today in which he said i am obviously relieved that all state and federal investigations are now closed i again want to extend my sincere apologies to governor whitman and the africanamerican community and clergy finally i wish to express my thanks and gratitude to my family and friends for their support during this difficult time on nov 12 , the same day mr chertoff announced he would investigate the whitman campaign in response to a widespread outcry , frederick p devesa , the acting new jersey attorney general , began a parallel state investigation led by two former attorneys general , george f kugler and james r zazzali the state and federal prosecutors obtained court approval to share information produced by their grand juries while preserving their right to take different actions the state representatives stood with mr chertoff today and agreed with his report mr chertoff said the investigation was not rushed or ended prematurely in order to clear up the matter before mrs whitman s inauguration on jan 18 he said many people thought the investigation would be completed by the end of the year , and others thought his office spent too much time examining the case he said that even though mr rollins immediately tried to take back what he said , we were n't satisfied to close the investigation , and added that the investigation would have continued past the inauguration if that had proved necessary campaign strategy examined investigators interviewed 62 people , several of whom testified before the federal grand jury more than once , according to the report of the investigation that was released today by mr chertoff more than 5 , 500 pages of financial records and supporting documents were examined , as well as computer data from the whitman campaign , the report said mr chertoff said the computer records , internal campaign documents , financial records and correspondence helped his office examine the strategy of the whitman campaign , which he called a principal focus of the investigation he said there was no evidence that the campaign planned to pay money to black ministers , their charities or any special projects , or to induce the ministers to reduce turnout among their church members he also said agents of the fbi and the state police uncovered no evidence that street money had been improperly used street money , mr chertoff emphasized , is a term that appears in state election regulations and is properly used to pay election day expenses , including the hiring of poll watchers and challengers and transporting voters to the polls you will find , when the final campaign reports are released , that the whitman campaign paid some registered democrats to work for her , but these were people who supported her and there is nothing wrong with that , mr chertoff said in fact , if people believe that registered democrats should only be allowed to support or vote for democrats then i think we would have some first amendment problems episode changes the law the rollins episode has , in fact , resulted in a revision in the law regulating street money last friday , over the objections of his fellow democrats in the legislature , some black officials and governorelect whitman , mr florio signed into law a bill that will require that all campaignrelated get out the vote payments be made by check rather than in cash the federal investigation set off by the rollins statements looked for possible violations of the federal travel act , which includes using the mails or telephones to further a criminal activity , in this case , bribery the state focused on possible violations of state election laws , especially any misuse of street money mr kugler said it could be expected that anyone who accepted a bribe would not come forward to talk about it but we found no one who said , 'i was offered money and turned it down' , he said there was none of that , and i think that s important mr chertoff said he could not answer questions of morality or ethics raised by mr rollins s statements or speculate about the nationally known political consultant s motivation message of what not to do but he said if that aspiring consultants take from mr rollins the message that the way to win elections is to play tricks and cut corners , that s a very sad outcome , and if they take that message to heart they will eventually get in trouble mrs whitman said she had not heard from mr rollins since they spoke the day after he made his explosive comments , but she offered her insight into what motivated him washington s a funny place , she said the beltway makes for a rarefied atmosphere and you start playing games with one another down there and lose sight of what s happening in the rest of the world she said mr rollins would not attend her inauguration it s really a tragedy why he said what he did , she added , because he certainly was part of a winning campaign photo michael chertoff , second

tobacco farmers , lights a winston and talks about a friend who lit up at an auto dealership when the man was told that smoking was not allowed , he tore up his check for a pickup truck and walked out , mr shackelford says a customer in the store , bruce wells , who tended tobacco for years , waves his cambridge cigarette in the air i bought this thing , mr wells says , so i can still smoke it but for all the defiant chatter at the grocery store , america s tobacco roads are leading toward a dead end the tobacco fields here in pitt county , nc the biggestproducing county in the biggestproducing state no longer pay a family s bills the culture born of tobacco farming , which has long been the only way to bring big profits from small plots , is fast becoming an artifact pitt county s growers , who produce the fluecured variety used in cigarettes , have been hurting for some time because of the public attacks on tobacco , from smoking bans to tax increases as much as they bristle about all that , the families running the country s 125 , 000 tobacco farms are struggling with an even bigger , more immediate threat they face a worldwide glut of lowpriced tobacco , with big and growing exporters china , zimbabwe , brazil and argentina vying for a market that americans once dominated and selling for prices that are onehalf to twothirds of the american prices both the quality and volume of foreign tobacco production have increased significantly in recent years , the result of improved techniques already , foreign competition has contributed to a 10 percent decline in prices for american fluecured tobacco and a 25 percent decline in the number of tobacco farms in a decade , the department of agriculture estimates now the glut is likely to accelerate those processes to keep prices from plunging as the glut developed last year , the fluecured tobacco cooperative stabilization corporation , an industryfinanced agency in raleigh , nc , bought 23 percent of the fluecured harvest 205 million pounds , equal to all of its purchases in the three previous years farmers agreed to a 10 percent cut in this year s production to try to stabilize the markets still , the glut persists tobacco experts predict an even larger cut in production for 1995 i see a possibility that production will be off 20 to 40 percent next year , said mitchell smith , the pitt county agent for the state cooperative extension service a production cut of that magnitude would be reflected in farm income american farmers received 15 billion last year from sales of cured tobacco , down from a peak of 19 billion in 1981 verner grice , the agriculture department s top tobacco economist , predicts a decline to 135 billion this year with the harshest blows yet to come , farmville s town manager , richard w hicks , said , the effect i 've seen so far is fear the principal cigarette companies , philip morris , r j reynolds , brown williamson and lorillard , still collect handsome profits because they can sell cigarettes abroad , where consumption is still growing , and because they have found a way to exploit the tobacco glut they import foreign tobacco and blend it with american tobacco , which is still considered a premium product forced from the business but here on farmville s moyeturnage road , at the bottom of the tobacco chain , farmers and farm workers have no protection from the double whammy of imported tobacco and american smoking bans scrimping to make ends meet , the farmers have automated to reduce the cost of labor the minimum wage of 425 an hour and the seasonal nature of the jobs that are left discourage most local workers from taking them mexican migrant workers have stepped in scores of farm families on moyeturnage , a classic tobacco road ,

, joel moye jr , grows tobacco farther down the road it runs 39 miles past three generations of turnage family homes , past a septictank depot and a mobile home park with more than 70 trailers , nearly all occupied by families who do not work in tobacco it passes 44 houses , seven of them abandoned there are 25 abandoned tobaccocuring barns and a dozen newer bulk curing barns the road stops

cbs may have lost some luster since its days as the tiffany network , and stock in barry diller s qvc inc may have skidded in the wake of its failed paramount takeover bid , but all that was forgotten yesterday laurence a tisch , chairman of cbs , and mr diller , qvc s chairman , confirmed that they had reached a tentative agreement to merge the two companies the deal would mark the end of the powerful tisch family s dominance of cbs , reducing both the family s stock holdings and mr tisch s management role but in mr diller and qvc , mr tisch has found an heir apparent and created a combined cable and broadcast television operation shares of cbs up 50 the pending alliance was applauded on wall street cbs s stock jumped 50 a share , or 19 percent , to close at 313 , regaining almost all the value it had shed in the last six weeks since it lost eight television affiliates to the fox television network stock in qvc , the home shopping channel company , rose 5625 , or 188 percent , to 38 a share it is a win for cbs shareholders to take cash out of the company , yet they get to invest in a new entity that is run by arguably the best programmer in the business , said john tinker , who follows media for furman selz company you combine both network and cable assets the new company has a low level of debt , and the flexibility to experiment with new businesses cbs and qvc have agreed to a complex stock and cash merger in which each cbs shareholder will get 175 in cash and about fourtenths of a share of stock in a newly formed company qvc shareholders will get roughly onetwentieth of a share of common stock and roughly onefifth share of nonvoting preferred stock in the new company when the dust settles , cbs holders will own 536 percent of the new company and qvc holders will own the balance using yesterday s closing stock prices , jeffrey lodgson , a media analyst at the seidler company , put the value of the deal to cbs shareholders at 344 a share , and the value to qvc shareholders at about 40 a share but he noted that the final value to shareholders depended on the price of cbs stock when the deal closed , as well as on subjective valuations of qvc s preferred stock the 71yearold mr tisch said that he had been motivated to merge cbs with qvc because he liked the idea that barry could be part of this company because of mr diller s track record as a programming executive mr tisch added i had no intention of trying to stay forever the question was how could you insure that your constituencies are served well \? mr diller described cbs as being in damn good shape , terrific shape , but was careful to shy away from saying anything about specific changes he might make at the network after the completion of the deal , which is planned for the fall mr diller seemed to relish the chance to get back in the business he likes best network programming where he had his biggest successes , first at abc and then in building the fox network mr tisch s wellknown fascination with trading was evident even during yesterday s interview he took frequent phone calls and reported enthusiastically on wall street s reaction to the merger as cbs s stock climbed but even as mr tisch tracked his stock , some media experts began to wonder whether the walt disney company or other bidders might not attempt to make a competing offer for cbs a spokesman for the disney company declined to comment on rumors both mr tisch and mr diller dismissed a rival bid as unlikely they said it would be difficult because transferring ownership of a network has a number of regulatory hurdles and is a difficult and lengthy process a vindication if the deal goes through , it would represent a vindication for mr diller , whose company lost a bitter and protracted battle earlier this year with viacom inc for paramount communications inc as the deal is currently structured , there would be roughly 126 million shares of the new company outstanding the result would be that the loews corporation , the tischcontrolled conglomerate that holds the family s cbs stock , would find its stake reduced from 20 percent of cbs to 94 percent of the new company , which would keep the cbs name mr diller would take over the positions as chief executive and head of the executive committee from mr tisch , who would remain chairman mr tisch has four sons , and his brother robert tisch has two sons and a daughter though the family is extremely close knit , laurence tisch denied that he had ever encouraged his sons to go into the network business and said that none of them had ever indicated to him an interest in doing so nor was he disappointed at not being able to bring his children into the television business i only care that they are happy in what they are doing indeed , one of his sons , daniel tisch , who heads mentor partners , a risk arbitrage investment firm , apparently played a role in the merger of cbs and qvc , along with martin lipton of wachtell , lipton , rosen katz , the law firm that represents both qvc and loews 'lot of sense'
washington , dec 15 in perhaps the worst sexual harassment episode in the military since the tailhook incident , the navy plans to courtmartial four male instructors and has already punished six others for pressuring female students for sex the case , made public by the service at a news conference on wednesday , involves 16 young enlisted women who were learning to operate the navy s computer and telephone networks at the naval training center in san diego investigators found that the 10 male instructors , all enlisted men who had served in the navy 6 to 12 years , made unwanted sexual comments to the women , and in some cases grabbed them , at various times from march 1993 to this september , when an inquiry was ordered the navy will courtmartial four of the instructors on charges ranging from sexual harassment to dereliction of duty to indecent assault if convicted , they could be fined , demoted or discharged a navy spokesman , comdr joe march , said it would be at least two to three weeks before the courtsmartial began in addition , the training center s commander , capt john c ensch , has fined , demoted or restricted to quarters the six other male instructors , for harassing young female recruits or failing to report that harassment to supervisors captain ensch has also issued a warning to a female chief petty officer who observed the harassment but failed to report it to her superiors although the instructors apparently made no blatant sexforgrades demands , they were clearly asking for sexual favors , the investigators said for instance , the instructors would suggest to students who had received good grades that a sexual reward was warranted in return but the investigators said they had found no instance in which women had actually felt compelled to have sex to pass a course , or had failed a class for refusing their instructors' advances it is important to recognize that the navy will not tolerate the actions of those who choose to harass other individuals , captain ensch said in a statement on wednesday the assaults at the 1991 tailhook association convention in las vegas were first reported to navy officials by lieut paula a coughlin , an admiral s aide who was abused there navy officials learned of the harassment in san diego from a male senior chief petty officer , who had heard of it in a casual conversation with a woman who said she was a victim captain ensch said the chief petty officer had immediately reported the conversation to his superiors , who undertook the inquiry since the tailhook scandal , the navy has provided everyone , from recruits to admirals , sensitivity training and stern warnings that any verbal or physical harassment will not be tolerated under a zero tolerance policy , the service has discharged more than 90 officers and sailors but although navy officials have pointed to the chief petty officer s action as a sign that men in the navy have grown less tolerant of sexual harassment , none of the victims in san diego felt comfortable or confident enough to report the harassment directly to a supervisor the women were students at the internal communications a school of the service school command at the training center most were 18 to 21 years old and fresh out of boot camp in the military , women of that age and rank are particularly vulnerable to the sexual advances of instructors , who have power to award top grades and choice assignments to favored students
from max s kansas city in the 1960 s to cbgb in the 1970 s to the knitting factory in the 1980 s , manhattan s rock and jazz culture has always been defined by small clubs with enough vision to book vanguard acts this year , several new downtown clubs have opened with a view to becoming the musical focal points of the 1990 s the entrepreneurs behind these new spaces have three things in common vision , dedication and debt mitchell borden mortgaged his house , rented out rooms and moved his family into his parents' new jersey home so that he could open a jazz club called smalls in greenwich village michael dorf , with his parents as cosigners on a bank loan that will take him six years to repay , is relocating his avantgarde music club , the knitting factory , to a larger building in tribeca michael swier took out a homeequity loan and asked his wife to work overtime at her investmentrelations firm so he could obtain a 20year lease on the mercury lounge , an east village rock club , and tim nye plans to sink more than 1 million into an east village club called sunshine it s not easy being a club owner mr borden may get to book the shows and mingle with the musicians at smalls , which opened in may , but he also has to hand out fliers on street corners , vacuum the carpets and wash the dishes do i owe you money \? has become a common telephone greeting spoken by the goateed mr borden , who is 37 'buddy system' for the audience smalls is a plush , intimate , dimly lighted underground room where jam sessions often stretch from 2 am to 9 am mr borden advises audience members to use what he calls the buddy system they pair off and one sleeps , confident of being awakened if there s a good solo the acts at smalls can range from trios to groups of 25 improvisers , and the players include old hands like the pianist harold mabern to young musicians like the trumpeter pezen everett my course has been mandated by budget , mr borden said , so i end up with talent deserving of wider recognition but their playing is fresh , they 're striving , and they have that angst that leads to new sounds admission at smalls is always 10 and , because mr borden does n't yet have a liquor license , beer and wine are free at his selfservice bar none of the handful of employees get paid , including mr borden that s me , the naive young club owner with no liquor license , mr borden said but people tell me , 'do n't worry , you 've got the right heart' and with the right heart , it s going to have to work too many people are depending on it michael dorf , who is 32 , came to new york from milwaukee in 1985 and opened a club under similar circumstances his heart was in the right place , even if his wallet was n't within a few years his club , the knitting factory , was renowned as a gathering place for local avantgarde musicians and mr dorf could start a record label called knitting factory works and open a promotional office in europe now , because of his decision to expand and relocate the club , mr dorf has a debt at least 20 times greater than he had when he opened the knitting factory but at least this time around , he has experience to guide him i ca n't tell you how exciting it is to consider having real toilets , he said as he walked into two gutted bathrooms on one of the lower levels of the new space the new knitting factory , which is to open in november , looks almost functional unlike the old club , which was a former avon office , the new space actually used to be a knitting factory when completed , it will have four floors , three bars , three rooms for performances and facilities for making highquality recordings and videotapes of concerts its main room and balcony can hold up to 500 people when we 'd get 250 people at the knitting factory and they 'd all be jumping up and down to see the stage , mr dorf said , i would be dreaming of a space like this musicians ranging from the saxophonist and composer john zorn to lee ranaldo of the rock band sonic youth have already visited the new site mr dorf said he hoped to book a mix of rock , jazz and avantgarde acts , and that he wanted to set aside sunday nights for silent films , which he would screen while local musicians performed their own scores when mr dorf was shopping for new homes for the knitting factory , one place he considered was an abandoned yiddish vaudeville theater on east houston street now the sunshine theater , as it was known , has been leased by a different club owner tim nye , the 28yearold operator of the online computer service sonicnet and the thread waxing space , an art gallery and rock club in what was once a thread factory , plans to transform the old theater into a hightech club that can hold a thousand people i do n't want sunshine to be just another venue that puts on shows , mr nye said recently i'm trying to put stateoftheart audio and video facilities in there , so we can amass an amazing archive i also want to use the space to bring different musical genres together , so there can be collaborations between different disciplines , like music and video mr nye wants to book everything from jazz to classical musicians , from world music to alternative rock groups , for anything from onenight concerts to longerrunning multimedia projects he is currently talking with the singer marianne faithfull and the rock band orange 9 mm about performing michael swier worked as a bartender in manhattan for six years before taking over a small east village bar in 1985 in february , mr swier , who is 39 , converted a store on east houston street into the mercury lounge when he first opened the club with his partner , michael winsch , mr swier wanted to book blues and rhythmandblues bands , but the acts did not attract large audiences and demanded guaranteed minimum salaries that he could not afford so mr swier recruited other people to do the booking , and the mercury lounge soon became a local hotspot for rock and folk music the club , with a capacity of 200 , has featured acts like the rock band lush and the singer jimmie dale gilmore , who play to audiences of a thousand people elsewhere in the country like mr borden of smalls , mr swier often has to do the drudge work at his club he can occasionally be found at the door selling and collecting tickets his handson , lowbudget approach is very different from the more elaborate and aloof tactics of mr nye and mr dorf as for the clubs' patrons , what s more important is whether the help are reasonably polite , the sightlines clear and the drinks cheap for musicians , there are other concerns aside from humane treatment by the club owners , said elliott sharp , a guitarist and composer who has been performing in new york clubs since 1979 , what i look for is a nice room with a good vibe , a good sound system and competent sound engineers photos small rock and jazz clubs with a 90 s flavor are springing up downtown above , the scene at smalls in greenwich village , with the owner , mitchell borden , in the foreground at left is the owner of sunshine in the east village , tim nye , before the start of renovations \( g paul burnett the new york

washington , march 30 the supreme court s fault lines on questions of church and state were on full display today as the justices heard arguments on the constitutionality of a new york public school district that was created to serve the secular needs of a deeply religious community routinely during arguments , the justices toss hypothetical questions at the lawyers before them as a way of exploring the dimensions of a case but while the justices offered several imaginary scenarios today , none were as complex or exotic as the history and existence of the kiryas joel village school district in orange county , ny , whose fate will be determined by the court s ruling the new york legislature set up the district , which consists of one building , in 1989 to enable a village inhabited entirely by hasidic jews of the satmar sect to give its handicapped children a publicly financed education in a cloistered setting that reflects the village as a whole all the children in the village who are not disabled attend jewish parochial schools the children with disabilities were entitled to special education services in the school district of the surrounding town , but the hasidic parents did not want to expose their children to the stress and possible ridicule of the outside world accommodating a community is it fair to say that government power was transferred here to a geographic entity based on the religious beliefs of its residents \? justice anthony m kennedy asked nathan lewin , the lawyer for the hasidic school district mr lewin said that characterization was not fair because the legislature did not draw the school district s lines on an explicitly religious basis but even if it had , he added , that would have been a constitutionally permissible accommodation to the needs of a religious community it turns the constitution on its head , mr lewin said , to say that the free exercise of religion becomes the one impermissible vice that amounts to an unconstitutional establishment of religion the new york court of appeals , the state s highest court , invalidated the kiryas joel school district last july in a 4to2 decision , that court ruled that creation of the district amounted to a symbolic union of church and state , in violation of the first amendment , which prohibits the establishment of religion that decision , mr lewin said today , was the equivalent of ruling that because these people are religious , they ca n't be trusted to run a public school system he said the school district itself was wholly secular , serving only the special educational needs of the disabled children limited impact likely the supreme court granted a stay of the state court s ruling that will dissolve if the state court s ruling is upheld when the justices rule on the matter by early summer while the court could use this case , board of education v grumet , no 93517 , as a vehicle to reexamine its approach to the establishment clause , the justices appeared absorbed in the details of the case and did not seem eager to make new law mr lewin s argument did not appear to allay the concerns of justice kennedy or several other justices , including sandra day o'connor and david h souter at one point mr lewin held up a thick book containing the legal code of the village of kiryas joel to make the point that the village , established by the hasidim in 1977 , functions as a normal government with secular concerns he said that while the village provides for trash collection , it would not violate the constitution to permit residents who did not want to handle their trash on the sabbath to collect it themselves on a different day justice o'connor said she would agree if there were a general , neutral law permitting people to collect their own trash but she said she had trouble with the school district s case because the district was set up not under generally applicable legislation but under a law that dealt only with the needs of the hasidim at another point , she referred to the law as a dangerous precedent to a greater degree than usual , most justices appeared to be grappling with the case and uncertain of the final outcome justice antonin scalia , however , dismissed the constitutional concerns as misplaced religion was not really a part of the case , he said , because by setting up the school district , the state was accommodating not the residents' religious needs but their cultural differences , like their use of yiddish , their distinctive dress and their isolation from modernity their customs spring out of their religion , but the state was accommodating their customs , justice scalia told jay worona , the lawyer arguing on behalf of the new york state school boards association that the district is unconstitutional i do n't see how the state is accommodating any religious beliefs mr worona said that the satmars' culture ca n't be distinguished from their religious precepts he called the school district a political constituency defined by religious lines chief justice william h rehnquist disputed that characterization you 're saying that the satmars , because they all live together , ca n't exercise the same governmental authority that other people living together would be able to exercise , the chief justice said he asked whether a group of people who happened to be roman catholic could get together and say , we think pretty much alike and we 'd like our own school district mr worona replied that a school district encompassing individuals who happen to be of one religious persuasion would not necessarily be unconstitutional this case was different , he said , because the state created the kiryas joel district to let a religious community dictate where educational services would take place dissident group in village while the village s 12 , 000 residents are all satmar hasidim , their position in the case is not united five hundred residents filed a brief saying the district is unconstitutional because it permits the rabbis who control the village s religious life to control the affairs of the school district as well joseph waldman , the leader of the dissident group , was stripped of his membership in the synagogue and his six children were expelled from the parochial school after he challenged the rabbinical leadership in an unsuccessful race for the school board when mr worona , the lawyer for the school boards association , began to describe that history , justice ruth bader ginsburg broke in to assert that those events were not properly before the court the association challenged the creation of the school district on its face , in effect arguing that the district is unconstitutional in its very existence , regardless of how it is operating the bill to create the kiryas joel school district was overwhelmingly approved by the new york legislature , and gov mario m cuomo signed the bill into law over the objection of the state education department , which said it was unconstitutional julie s mereson , an assistant new york state attorney general , argued in support of the district today she said the legislature acted in a permissible spirit of tolerance toward religious differences to solve an unusual local problem photo arguments about the constitutionality of the kiryas joel village school district , created by new york state to serve the needs of hasidic children , were heard by the supreme court yesterday steven bernardo , left , superintendent of the district , and abe wieder , president of the school board , left the court after the hearing \( stephen crowley the new york times \)
the marine corps reserve s toys for tots foundation had all the right ingredients a worthy cause , a board packed with beribboned marines , a directmail campaign with a message that tugged at the heartstrings i wish you could be there to see the miracle happen when the sadness of these children turns instantly to joy , one letter pleaded , by way of asking for a check but these days the foundation is under scrutiny from many quarters for the way it conducted itself , from the actual fund raising to the way the money was spent of 97 million collected through direct mail between september 1992 and december 1993 , none went to purchase toys , although some toys were bought with corporate donations , said lieut gen matthew t cooper , a retired marine commander who was appointed president and chief executive of the foundation last fall it all went to pay the expenses of direct mail , he said holes in the bookkeeping in april the chairman and president , jerry l king , was dismissed after board members discovered he had been convicted of tax evasion and other crimes , all unrelated to his foundation work an audit after he left found glaring holes in bookkeeping procedures , like a 1 million purchase order sent to hong kong in 1993 that was undocumented and a report released this month by the philanthropic advisory service , a branch of the council of better business bureaus , notes the absence of any oversight by the foundation s board among other signs of mismanagement , there had been no boardapproved budget until 1993 , four years after the foundation was incorporated , with mr king at the helm it s highly unusual , said bennett m weiner , the director of the advisory service , whose report was the subject of an article yesterday in the washington post it does speak to some very serious concerns within the management and finances of the charity the united states attorney s office in buffalo is investigating mr king s role in the foundation , which has since been reorganized and moved from amherst , ny , near buffalo , to quantico , va last year the united states postal inspector in newark began looking into the foundation s directmail operation after complaints from state residents for example , the first set of directmail pleas was actually a test to assess the foundation s fundraising prospects but none of the 730 , 000 letters indicated that it was a test the money that came in from the mailing 220 , 000 was put toward the next mailing we 've embarrassed ourselves , said general cooper , who commanded a rifle company in vietnam and was named president of the foundation last september he had no previous affiliation with it , he said , although two members of the previous board remain active 'made a mistake' we kicked one into the grandstand , he said i'm hoping the american people and the corporation presidents will recognize we 've made a mistake the toys for tots program started in 1947 , when a marine corps spouse in los angeles made a rag doll and could find no child to give it to , said maj betsy sweatt , a spokeswoman for the united states marine corps reserve in new orleans toys and money are collected town by town , she said , and distributed locally as well this year 75 million toys were collected , with extras going to flood victims in the midwest but the foundation is not really part of the program , she added they 're a separate and distinct organization , she said they provide support in the form of toys and promotional material they 're more at the national level some question whether a national organization was even necessary they 've been around for 30some years , and they never raised money from the public before , said daniel langan , a spokesman for the national charities information bureau in manhattan they did n't need it but general cooper said money that traditionally had flowed from defense department budgets to promote toys for tots , with banners and fliers , among other things , had dried up by the late 1980 s we needed a way to pay for these materials so they would have successful campaigns , he said an expanded board since the revelations about the foundation s mismanagement , he said , the board has been expanded to 10 members \( the original had just 5 , and all were marines or reservists \) the mailing list will likely be cut back , and the office has been moved to a smaller , free space in quantico from its more lavish one near buffalo the foundation s lawyer , col gordon gannon jr , who was also a board member , resigned his paid position , general cooper said and while the board once did not even approve budgets , now there is an annual budget review process as well as bylaws intended to prevent conflicts of interest general cooper said he did not know what had happened to the money described in the audit as virtually unaccounted for 1 million in 1993 , plus about 520 , 000 in agents' fees , freight charges and excess payments we laid the evidence and the documents we had at the department of justice , he said they may come back and say there s nothing wrong mr king could not be reached yesterday by telephone at his home in snyder , ny attempts to obtain comment from his lawyer , patrick j brown , were also unsuccessful this should n't have happened , the general said i cannot explain why it happened , but it

the occupational safety and health administration is one of those government entities the national labor relations board is another that looms considerably larger in the ideological imaginations of its constituent interest groups than its teensy size would seem to warrant it is , depending on one s political proclivities , either failing its mandate to protect the health and safety of the nation s workers or using its regulatory power to bludgeon employers and snuff out the spirit of capitalism to say that osha was not favored in the reaganbush years is to engage in understatement on a massive scale the change in administration yielded no great benefit by way of increased budget or staff , and is n't likely to any time soon but osha no longer has to worry about incoming shells from the council on competitiveness , dan quayle s experiment in personal bureaucracy , and it gets now what it missed for 12 years support from the top labor secretary robert reich announced on wednesday that he intends to step up enforcement of workplace safety laws , focusing on businesses that hire the most exploitable workers young and old people and lowwage workers and two weeks ago the administration revealed its support for a revived comprehensive osha reform bill similar to one that died for lack of republican support in 1992 in a highly competitive global economy we cannot tolerate the high costs of workplace fatalities , injuries and illnesses , mr reich wrote in a dec 22 letter to senator edward m kennedy , democrat of massachusetts , and representative william d ford , democrat of michigan , the bill s principal sponsors the legislation , which would be the first major revision since the original measure was passed in 1970 after three years of controversy , includes the following it requires all companies to set up safety and health programs , including plans for employee training and education employers with 11 or more fulltime workers must establish safety and health committees made up jointly of employees and management it extends osha coverage to public employees now excluded and to employees working in nuclear plants under the jurisdiction of the energy department it increases the criminal penalties under osha for willful violations that cause death and authorizes them for willful violations that cause injury it updates the exposure limits on toxic substances and directs osha to revise the limits every three years it creates an office of construction safety within osha and requires contractors on multiemployer sites to coordinate safety plans , and requires contractors in general to draw up health and safety plans for particular projects the new osha director , joseph dear , is inheriting congressional efforts on behalf of his agency does he want to be reformed \? he laughed during a telephone interview before answering , in the cautious cadences of the recently confirmed there is an enormous amount of preventable injury and death in the workplace it produces pain and suffering and huge economic costs , he said reform legislation would give the authority to adopt on a national basis proven means of preventing worker injury and death to its proponents , the bill is a natural evolution of protective legislation they point out that while workplace deaths dropped in the 20 years between passage of the original legislation and introduction of the reform bill , the number of workplace injuries tripled , outpacing the increase in the number of employees injuries at work cost employers 115 billion in 1992 , mr dear said the bill also happens to dovetail nicely with some of the interests of the current labor secretary the safety and health committees , for example , are more narrowly defined variations of the labormanagement employee participation committees mr reich has favored as essential to increasing american productivity and competitiveness the business community , however , last year declared itself betrayed when the kennedyford version of the bill was reintroduced , and it was no happier to learn of the administration s support for the measure early in the clinton administration , there was a goodfaith effort to negotiate , said bradley cameron , director of government operations at the labor policy association , a businessoriented research group in washington ultimately , however , he said , none of our concerns were incorporated there is little that industry groups like about the kennedyford proposals , including what they predict will be its multibilliondollar price tag but they are especially perturbed by the definition of significant risk incorporated into the bill a labor policy association analysis complains that the bill adopts an extremely stringent numerical standard , reducing the agency s discretion to set its own standards for exposure to toxic substances in 1992 , the liberal measure did a camille and expired with a wan smile and no last requests but to the reengineered liberal coalition , labor especially , the surprising recent struggle over nafta proved that all kinds of wacky ideas the bill banning striker replacements ! osha reform ! are no longer unthinkable more muscle for the same money true , the occupational safety and health administration is a favorite political birdie , but is n't osha s basic problem that too few dollars and inspectors are chasing too many employers \? labor secretary robert reich acknowledged at a news conference last week that an agency with a 300 million budget and 2 , 300 employees cannot police the nation s six million employers and promised to focus on the worst violators of workplace laws joseph dear , osha s new chief , is , of necessity , a proponent of reinventing government our situation is not unlike a business' , he said in a phone interview last week the agency is at a fiscal wall the only solution is to change how we do business to increase our impact the osha reform bill , especially provisions mandating written health and safety plans and workermanagement safety committees , would shift the agency s focus from government to the workplace , mr dear said it s the only way the reach and range of workplace safety and health can be extended under present budget circumstances , he said photo labor secretary robert reich says he will step up enforcement of workplace safety laws \( reuters \)
two streaks were on the line when columbia opened its season against harvard yesterday at wien stadium first , the lions had lost 15 consecutive openers , all to harvard and second , no new harvard coach had won his first game since arthur valpey in 1948 not even joe restic , who retired at the end of last season after 25 years as the head coach by the time the wild and exciting game was over , the new harvard coach , tim murphy , had broken the firstgame crimson coaching losing streak but the streak did not end until quarterback vin ferrara scored from 4 yards out with 21 seconds left to play that touchdown , which climaxed an 83yard drive , lifted harvard to a 3932 victory over the lions columbia had battled back from an 18point deficit in the second half to go ahead , 3231 , with 4 55 left in the game marcellus wiley , who went both ways yesterday at tailback and defensive end , which has become his primary position scored the final columbia touchdown on a fourthand1 plunge then joe aldrich put the lions ahead , 3231 , with a 35yard conversion why a 35yard pointafter attempt \? because wiley \( 9 carries for 49 yards \) followed his touchdown , his second of the day , with an exuberant display that cost the lions 15 yards under a rule prohibiting excessive celebration no matter , though , since aldrich was on target as columbia supporters in the crowd of 6 , 425 went wild in anticipation of the lions' first openingday victory since 1978 but ferrara , the new harvard quarterback , had plenty of time and he used virtually all of it on the ensuing drive , which began at the crimson 17 and ended when he faked a handoff and followed two blockers through left tackle for the decisive score the junior from florham park , nj , replacing the departed mike giardi , connected on 22 of 32 passes for 245 yards and ran 11 times for another 30 yards ahead at the half , 2110 , harvard boosted its margin to 2810 when tailback eion hu s 3yard run capped a 67yard drive but then , down by 3118 , columbia scored on a 15yard pass from quarterback jamie schwalbe \( 14 of 26 for 174 yards and 1 touchdown \) to tight end brian bassett \( 8 catches for 101 yards \) with 10 minutes left in the game to make the score 3125 after recovering a harvard fumble at the crimson 33 , the lions went ahead for the only time on wiley s second touchdown and the extra point it looked like the last team that had the ball was going to win , said columbia coach ray tellier not exactly , since the lions still had 21 seconds left , but it was not enough time with the final drive ending with a pass interception at the harvard 33 as always , columbia is short on depth so tellier used schwalbe , a senior and last year s starter , in most passing situations and mike cavanaugh , a junior , when the situation dictated a run operating out of a wishbone when he was in the game , cavanaugh ran 4 times for 37 yards because all four of last year s front four defensive players have graduated , tellier had intended to use wiley mainly as a defensive end , even though he was columbia s leading runner last year wiley agreed to switch and , in the off season , went from 215 to 245 pounds , most of it muscle tellier s plan is to use wiley , a junior , mainly on short yardage and goalline situations , and they abounded yesterday in the 85degree heat on defense , wiley performed admirably , with two solo tackles and two blocked passes there were a host of big thirddown plays , none bigger than a 24yard scamper by harvard tailback kweli thompson on a third and 3 at the columbia 31 on the winning touchdown drive with time running out around the ivy league chad levitt rushed for 112 yards and 2 touchdowns as cornell opened its ivy league season with a 3116 victory over princeton in ithaca , ny levitt scored on a 39yard run midway through the first quarter to put cornell ahead for good the big red led by 289 at the half linebacker carl ricci had three interceptions for yale , including one he returned 29 yards for a touchdown , as the bulldogs beat brown , 2716 , in providence , ri ricci s touchdown at 8 minutes 32 seconds of the third quarter put yale ahead by 1816 the freshman mark lindell threw two touchdown passes and jamal patterson scored on a 1yard run early in the fourth quarter as colgate rallied for a 2016 victory over dartmouth in colgate , ny dartmouth built an early 160 lead on three field goals by geoffrey willison and a 1yard touchdown run by pete oberle before lindell rallied the red raiders on the pivotal drive , which covered 78 yards , lindell completed 4 of 6 passes for 66 yards in 13 plays patterson scored the gamewinning touchdown with 13 51 left terrance stokes ran for 143 yards and a touchdown as penn scored on its first four possessions in stretching its winning streak to 13 games with a 277 victory over lafayette in philadelphia penn gained 257 yards rushing and held lafayette to just 84 yards on the ground the defending ivy league champions , who have not lost since 1992 , got two field goals from andy glockner photo columbia s john harper crashing through the line in the first half against harvard the lions squandered two firstquarter scoring chances \( clifford hausner for the new york times \)
hannah wilke spent much of her life posing for the camera in ways that raised eyebrows in 1954 , when she was just 14 , she had her picture taken wearing nothing but her mother s mink stole , vamping coyly in front of a wall on which her name was spelled in big letters arlene h butter by the early 1970 s , after art school and a failed marriage , wilke began taking pictures of herself stripped to the waist , her wellshaped torso dotted with little folded shapes of chewing gum that had a none too vague clitoral aspect \( these tiny objects , miniaturized versions of wilke s sculptures made of fired clay and then latex , were part of her pursuit of a formal imagery that is specifically female \) over the next two decades one became accustomed to seeing photographs of wilke , usually partly or entirely nude , in magazine articles and books about feminist art or performance art , as well as in her gallery shows and on her exhibition announcements goodhumored , almost girlishly awkward , these images blended feminism , narcissism and exhibitionism in unsettling ways they seemed to be little more than the artist s enthusiastic exploitation of her own darkhaired good looks eyebrows may elevate once more over the photographs wilke made during the two years before her death , from lymphoma , early in 1993 and if they do rise , the heart will probably go with them , right into the throat working with her second husband , donald goddard , wilke left a searing record of her final illness it consists of nearly a dozen large , brazenasever color selfportraits that dominate her posthumous exhibition at the ronald feldman gallery in soho \( through feb 19 \) in a bit of characteristic wilke wordplay , the show s title is intravenus the goddess of love on medicinal drugs the stark power of these images is nearly physical it can keep you hesitating at the door , reluctant to step into the gallery in them , wilke s beauty lies in waste , but her spirit is strong , as is her desire to keep on working or living , whichever comes first as always , her artistic materials are her own life and body her goal , selfexposure and the concomitant unease it arouses in the viewer but now she has company the specter of her own death which adds a new dimension to her courage and her art , are these last wilkes art or documentary \? are they good or just sensational \? they tend to push such questions aside brusquely with an unusual combination of honesty and artifice in them wilke , shown nude or partly dressed , alternates between ignoring death and staring it in the face , while at the same time refusing to obscure any signs of its approach as she strikes her poses , sometimes imitating the old masters , sometimes her own work , her face and body give a full account of the ravages of disease and treatment in many instances her head is bald , her body swollen , her face puffy , her eyes sunken , her skin darkened by chemotherapy tubes extend from her chest and arms bandages , the result of painful bone marrow harvesting , pad her spreading hips in one image , she mutely sticks out her tongue , so the camera can record how its surface has been split open by chemotherapy the largerthanlife scale of the images makes the facts of her condition unavoidably palpable \( they virtually eliminate , and therefore underscore , the esthetic distance operating in similar works , like cindy sherman s madeforthecamera grotesqueries or andres serrano s morgue pictures \) the photographs are dated and frequently juxtaposed in diptychs that contrast emotional and physical states , usually from bad to worse in one work , an image of the artist as a smiling greek caryatid , standing nude with a vase of flowers crowning her thinning hair , is juxtaposed with one taken several months later here she sits immobilized , swollen almost beyond recognition , a white shower cap on her seemingly hairless head , her bare chest more trussed than bandaged heavy with sadness , she looks right at the camera as if to say look see what i'm going through in another diptych , wilke spreads her manicured hands coquettishly across her face in a pose typical of her earlier work , except that now no long dark tresses complete the effect the second image shows her head and shoulders wrapped in a blue blanket , like the madonna her eyes are lowered , her ashen features so still they seem more like sculpture than living flesh there is plenty that is unbearable about these images , plenty that makes one want to turn away yet something about wilke s presence is steadying and soothing you looked at me then , she seems to say well , look at me now her challenge makes us consider once more , the way women are objectified by society and discarded as they become old or ill but it also invites us to look at the essence of her art and her self which was not her beauty , or her liberated sensuality or her narcissism rather it was an extraordinary degree of selflove , a simple pride of being that is difficult for anyone , but especially women , to muster it fueled wilke s art throughout her life , and in the end it flared into a torch with which she illuminated her farewell performance photos july 26 , 1992 february 19 , 1992 no 4 , a wilke diptych on view at the ronald feldman gallery a simple pride of being \( dennis cowley ronald feldman fine arts \)

governorelect george pataki made a reasonable request when he asked gov mario cuomo last month not to burden the new york state budget with lastminute hiring so it is dismaying to find that the cuomo administration has gone ahead and hired hundreds of people anyway the governorelect is about to inherit a 4 billion budget gap in his first weeks as governor , he must find ways to save at least that much , just to balance revenues with the cost of current programs in the fiscal year beginning april 1 to deliver his promised tax cuts , he must find even more savings mr pataki called the hiring news very disturbing , and well he might some of the new hires are said to be essential to public health and safety , but others are clearly not mr pataki and his people have a right to examine every vacant slot even the clerical vacancies that the department of motor vehicles has just filled those clerks handle driver s license applicants they may be essential to prevent public impatience with long waiting lines but are they truly essential \? likewise , how essential was it that the office of parks , recreation and historic preservation fill 11 empty slots on dec 1 \? in defending the hires , the state budget office says 648 people were hired in the three weeks after election day , which was 116 fewer than in the same weeks last year after mr pataki s request , the office also instructed agencies to limit their hiring to essential postings moreover , not all new hires add to the deficit problem because an unknown number of them will be paid with federal funds or other earmarked revenues but none of that lessens the fact that mr pataki has one huge problem to cope with as soon as he takes office to deal with it , he says he may have to lay off some of those who have just been taken on it would be better for the state if mr cuomo imposed an ironclad freeze on nonessential hires and forced albany s bureaucrats to live up to it
a new radio format is taking shape from san francisco and seattle to austin , tex , nashville and east hampton , li about 50 commercial stations , and an equal number of noncommercial ones , have converted to what the industry calls adult album alternative , or aaa , although neither name is as euphonious as the sound the stations seek i do n't like the word 'alternative , ' said steve richards , the program director at wehmfm , in east hampton , which changed to the format in october it s sort of rock no , i do n't like the word 'rock' that connotes headbanging it s geared for adults , but no pop the format s basic tenet is that plenty of adults , even middleaged ones , want to keep up with current rockandroll but not all current rockandroll the format gathers together lesserknown but critically acclaimed performers like john hiatt and marc cohn , goes beyond the biggest hits of current stars to play other songs by them and blends in performers from the audience s teenage years , like the rolling stones , the who and van morrison left out entirely are heavy metal , syrupy ballads , piercing blues rock and rap it s not lowestcommondenominator radio , trying to appeal to everyone , said john bradley , a founder of the sbr radio company , a consulting firm in boulder , colo , that advises stations on the aaa format it s more thoughtful , not as hyped , not as repetitious every commercial radio station wants to attract enough listeners to attract enough advertisers to turn a handsome profit , and aaa is the latest attempt to lure all those collegeeducated couples who buy volvo station wagons and lexuses we 're going after the money demographic , the 25 to 54yearolds , said paul marszalek , the program director at kfogfm , san francisco , the largest aaa station in the country in audience and advertising billings with the new format , he said , kfog has climbed to sixth in the bay area ratings in that age group , from 17th two years ago the turnaround for us was worth millions of dollars in billings a year , and we do n't even feel like we 've hit stride , he said mr richards in east hampton said his principal target audience was the narrower 25to44 group , though he quickly added , yesterday i had a call from a 76yearold woman who loves our station dennis constantine , another consultant in boulder who has helped stations convert to aaa , has made up his own demographic category to explain his goal the 36 to 52yearolds we 're looking for people who grew up in the 70 s and are not being served by the album rock stations of today , he said the bait to land this catch is mostly rockandroll , but is easiest to explain by what it is not no thrashing , smashing rock no heavy metal no whitney houston or michael bolton and surprisingly , none of the 10 most popular rock songs of all time we wo n't play 'maggie may' and 'layla' and 'wo n't get fooled again , ' mr bradley said , referring to oldies by , respectively , rod stewart derek and the dominoes , a band from the 1970 s that featured the guitarist eric clapton , and the who those songs are available elsewhere instead we play 'gasoline alley' by rod stewart , or 'the song is over , ' from the same who album building a distinct format the goal of sbr radio , which has worked with kfog and 13 other stations around the country , is to differentiate aaa from formats like classic rock \( big hits of the 70 s and 80 s \) , albumoriented rock \( the bestknown songs from current and past hit albums , usually by big stars \) , oldies \( top 40 hits from the 50 s and 60 s \) and adult contemporary \( mild rock with pop ballads blended in \) all of those derive from the top 40 format of the late 50 s and 60 s todd storz , a nebraska businessman who helped revive radio in the 1950 s by developing the top 40 format , liked to recount how , in a bar , he noticed a waitress at the jukebox playing the same song three times in a row he deduced that familiarity was more important to listeners than diversity , and the idea of all the hits , all the time was born the premise of aaa is that educated listeners enjoy the challenge of unfamiliar music , as long as it is pleasant , and that they will appreciate the care that is taken in creating sets of songs about a common theme , or how one song leads into another an aaa station might draw on a list of 2 , 000 songs to fill its week , using three or four songs from a group s album , and about onethird of the music is less than a year old a classic rock station might only look at 500 songs at night , the format gets a little more adventurous , a little less familiar , mr bradley , the consultant , said and day or night , the announcers play second fiddle to the music you do n't hire people you need to tone down , he said the listeners , mr bradley said , are not just educated , but active they respond to promotions and to advertising chris mays , the program director at kmttfm , seattle , said her aaa station encourages listener participation and not only in its programming we have a listener group called the green team , currently 950 people , and once a month we plant trees , or clear streams , or clear trails together , she said and we have voice mail at the station for people to leave questions we get about 50 calls a day , people who 'll sing a line or tell us the lyrics and really want to know what the song is and we call each of them back , every day active listening , of course , is far more preferable to advertisers than passive listening , in which listeners may tap their fingers or toes but not activate their thought processes one striking element of aaa radio is how much it shares the goals of classical music stations in both formats , the listeners have relatively high education and income levels the challenge for either kind of station is to convince advertisers , through market research or qualitative ratings rather than raw numbers , that whatever the size of the audience , it is loaded with listeners who have money to spend so far , aaa has not reached los angeles and new york , the largest radio markets in the country , each of which is served by more than six dozen stations one reason is that the stakes are so much higher in those cities , where stations sell for tens of millions of dollars mr constantine suggested that each city s pie is so large that a station can lumber along with barely 2 percent of the radio audience and still turn considerable profits , giving its owners little incentive to gamble another explanation is that aaa takes a long time to establish itself the format has not had an overnight success anywhere yet , mr bradley said chart a typical hour on the mountain kmtt , an fm station in seattle that calls itself the mountain , is one of the most successful radio stations using the album adult alternative format the station s music , a mixture of new and old rockandroll songs that avoids pop , rap , heavy metal or hearditathousandtimes hits , is meant to appeal to a prosperous audience of adults over 25 here are the songs the station broadcast in a representative hour , last wednesday form 5 pm

every school day at louis d brandeis high school in manhattan , alfred cruz punches his student identification card into the machine just inside the front entrance he steps onto a metal scanner and if the red light blinks on , he has to empty his pockets he shoves his book bag through the xray machine , then he raises his arms so a security officer can wave a portable metal detector over his body like a wand alfred says he no longer minds the mechanized routine of going to school , but educators point to the metal detector as a vivid emblem of the failures of the large urban high school overcrowded and impersonal , with a threat of violence , schools like brandeis contribute to a staggering truancy rate , particularly among black and hispanic boys , academic experts and educators say the sheer size of these schools creates a factory mentality , said jonathan kozol , an expert on urban education the kids feel dehumanized the teachers do also the very impersonality of the situation encourages people to leave they are not inviting places many educators say the answer is wholesale restructuring of many of the city s worst high schools in the last decade , a number of smaller high schools have opened , with more than 30 last fall alone , admitting a mix of students from throughout the city but the opening of these schools has created an unintended side effect the concentration of the most troubled students in the most troubled high schools , like brandeis students apply to the smaller schools and are admitted selectively the neighborhood high schools must take the rest onefourth missing brandeis s grip on many of its 2 , 500 students is tenuous more than 650 are absent on a typical school day alfred himself , who is repeating 10th grade , was a chronic truant until this spring it was only when brandeis put him in a special program that permits him to attend school from 8 to 11 30 am , and still receive high school credit , that he began showing up regularly he found it easy to disappear in body and spirit most of the teachers were n't alive , the 16yearold said they 'll teach you something and they expect you to get it and if you do n't , they just move on to the next thing they never gave a chance to the students and i guess they lost me along the way if they did n't care , why do it \? a decade has passed since hundreds of millions of dollars in state aid became widely available in new york for counselors , schoolbased programs , computers to track attendance , social workers , tutoring and hotlines for parents to stem truancy and mayor rudolph w guiliani has initiated police sweeps in which hundreds of outofschool children are detained in seven school collection centers , including one at brandeis but experts say these programs are patches in a fundamentally flawed system that clusters the most troubled students in the most crowded , dangerous schools despite the spending of more than 60 million this year for prevention efforts in the city schools , truancy continues to grow in new york city high schools , a higher percentage of students were found to be longterm absentees showing up for one or fewer days in a month in the 19921993 academic year than in the previous three years , according to the latest board of education statistics about one of every four students is absent each day at brandeis , four times the national rate symptoms of anonymity' truancy and attendance problems are symptoms of anonymity , said michelle fine , a psychology professor at the cuny graduate center who has studied the characteristics of dropouts those same students shift their attendance patterns when they go to the smaller schools the fourstory brandeis high school , on west 84th street between amsterdam and columbus avenues , is at the bottom of an informal pyramid that has evolved among the 126 high schools throughout the city it has the lowest reading scores for incoming students of any manhattan high school out of 2 , 500 students , only about 60 are taking advanced placement courses at the top of the pyramid are the four elite high schools stuyvesant , brooklyn tech , bronx high school of science and fiorello h laguardia high school which require strict competitive exams to enter in the vast middle are the educational options schools , or magnet schools , that select a mix of students , with 75 percent reading at or above grade level only a relative handful are atrisk students poor academic performers with troubled personal lives alfred cruz did not want to go to brandeis he had applied to chelsea vocational high school , a smaller magnet school of about 1 , 000 students in soho , but he was placed on a long waiting list and did not enter he said he was all too familiar with many brandeis students from his west 106th street neighborhood , where he walks past drug dealers and dropouts every day the last option nobody really wants to go to a zoned school , said alfred , who wants to be a rap musician it explains itself it s like a last option you want to try for other options if you do n't get accepted anywhere else , you just automatically go there when the school year began , alfred showed up at brandeis for the first several weeks , then disappeared he could be found a couple of blocks away in a laundromat playing video games all day
washington , sept 17 this week could be the death of significant health care legislation in 1994 , and developments in haiti might mean the end before the week begins unless senator george j mitchell , the majority leader , and the bipartisan group known as the mainstream coalition , which supports some change in health care , can agree on a plan and start selling it to their colleagues in the week ahead , there will not be enough time , even optimists concede , to pass a bill before congress adjourns in midoctober some senators , even members of the mainstream group , think it is already too late , and no one says an agreement at this point guarantees senate passage or a favorable vote in the house mr mitchell , a maine democrat , and leaders of the bipartisan group of about 20 senators whose votes are essential to the dwindling hopes for any legislation , plan to meet on monday they may agree then on a bill that would add about half the nation s 39 million uninsured to the ranks of the insured but even if that meeting succeeds , the duty of defending president clinton over a decision to invade haiti could distract the majority leader from following up on an agreement , just as the crime bill diverted his attention in midaugust if the efforts of senator mitchell and the coalition fail , various senators will be likely to put forth more modest bills , focusing on coverage for children , changes in insurance rules or giving the states more flexibility to experiment with broader health care none of those are trivial but while these narrower bills would invite fewer outside opponents , their sponsorship would also be narrower moreover , they would be vulnerable to the suspicion that unlike the mainstream bill , a product of nearly a year of discussions , they were simply lastminute efforts to slap something together the mainstream measure falls well short of universal coverage , which president clinton and the democratic leaders in congress once insisted on but it would make health insurance more secure for those who now have it , greatly curtail insurance companies' ability to deny coverage because applicants are sick and use subsidies to increase insurance coverage to 92 percent of the population by 2004 from the current 85 percent some mitchell allies say crucial decisions have yet to be made on issues like integrating medicaid patients into new insurance schemes , giving states more flexibility and taxing expensive insurance policies they say that when all those issues are settled , the bill will be able to command the support of most democrats but even if it does , and if it keeps the support of some republicans now on board , the opposition will still be formidable indeed , many republicans are already sure of victory and are chiefly concerned about blame senator bob packwood of oregon told his colleagues at lunch on tuesday , according to one participant we 've killed health care reform now we 've got to make sure our fingerprints are not on it when mr packwood , the republican floor manager on health care legislation , was asked friday if he had said that and what he had meant , he paused i do n't know , he said finally i do n't remember what i say from one day to the next but other republicans like senator phil gramm of texas are eager to claim credit for killing health care legislation i am certainly proud of my part of killing the clinton plan in all of its incarnations , he said mr gramm also scoffed at the bipartisan effort it s only mainstream washington , he said , it s not mainstream america but other republicans disagree senator arlen specter of pennsylvania , for instance , who sometimes participates with the bipartisan group , says he is inclined to be cautious still , he added some republicans want to do nothing they are wrong to avoid any risk that president clinton is going to get credit is really contrary to what mainstream republicans think in the country democrats are generally reluctant to throw any cold water on the efforts by mr mitchell , who spurned a supreme court nomination to concentrate on passing health care legislation but senator edward m kennedy , the massachusetts democrat who is the senate s longestrunning advocate of national health insurance , said he feared that if haiti took up even a week of mr mitchell s time , that would kill any chance of passing a bill favored by the mainstream group doubts about having enough time now come readily from republicans , even supporters of the mainstream measure senator john c danforth of missouri , a founding member of the group , said , if we plan to adjourn in three weeks or at most four weeks , it s about as close to an impossibility as it can be and , he added , i do n't see any life in it at all senators mark o hatfield , the oregon republican who is also counted among the members of the bipartisan coalition , also lacked confidence that anything could be done to salvage a bill a this point i think when the chairman of the finance committee , pat moynihan , made his statement , we could just say that it is just not achievable in this session , he said senator daniel patrick moynihan , democrat of new york , the finance panel chairman , criticized the plan as too ambitious in thursday s congressional record
it is best to let sleeping dogs lie if you awaken them , they start baring their teeth and baying at the moon i am referring here not to the new york knickerbockers , but to their patrons in madison square garden , who respond to injustice with typical new york paranoia and venom and menace new york aggression was in full evidence yesterday when the two home teams of the garden , the knicks and the rangers , played home playoff games , although not exactly at the same time the knickerbockers , with the help of some outraged decibels from 19 , 763 selfappointed referees , defeated the new jersey nets , 9081 , before the rangers went out on the ice and beat the washington capitals , 63 , in just your normal 2 million gross night in between , carpenters like malcolm shaw of the garden staff wielded their highspeed wrenches \( human powered , shaw noted \) to remove the bolts from the basketball court then the ice crew scraped two weeks of dirt off the surface while other workers swept out the extremely expensive food debris good grief , at those prices , you 'd think the fans would eat every crumb they converted the garden in less than five hours , and an almost entirely new crowd jostled its way inside , with the same capacity for yowling and wailing at injustice there was surely some overlap in the two crowds as members of the 33d street boys and girls chorus chanted derrick ! derrick ! to the frustrated derrick coleman of the nets in exactly the same harmony as beaupre ! beaupre ! to the bombarded don beaupre of the capitals the basketball crowd was jolted from its early sunday afternoon lassitude relatively speaking , that is , factoring in normal new york verbosity and hyperactivity in the first half , when patrick ewing was ejected for three years in the pat riley regime , the knicks have been playing with the physical and mental intimidation of their highpowered clientele , but yesterday the law was a bit edgy there had been a fearsome brawl in a playoff game in atlanta on saturday night , and the three referees were surely under orders to not let this game get out of hand , not on national television so when coleman and ewing tangled under the basket , it was just your gardenvariety confrontation nothing you and i have n't done or contemplated in the last five minutes to preserve our space from the marauders , whoever they may be \( at the garden yesterday , i saw a guy in a wheelchair get outmaneuvered in an elevator line the press elevator , i might add it s a tough town \) coleman then cleverly got in another elbow on the way downcourt , and ewing made the mistake of stumbling and calling attention to the tiff the refs whistled a technical foul on both of them , and because it was ewing s second of the young game , he was gone suddenly , it was rush hour , and the three referees were cab drivers blocking all three lanes of a cross street shrieks and hoots and oaths emanated from elegantly dressed men and women at courtside it got worse when the garden thoughtfully in the spirit of public service ran a replay on the giant message board , showing ewing stumbling , three feet from coleman more imprecations from the fans but the game continued , without ewing you 've got to use some common sense you do n't kick a guy like that out , suggested your typical courtside patron , a gentleman wearing a creamy brooklyn dodgers jersey with robinson 42 on it this typical courtside patron was none other than spike lee , whose latest film , crooklyn , is about to arrive in a theater near you lee was seeking nothing more than oldfashioned schoolyard jurisprudence no harm , no foul but there was no turning back the crowd started bellowing and the knicks doubled their lead to 22 points without ewing , and held on to win later , they gave credit to the crowd i 've never quite heard it the way it was today , said derek harper , who has spent most of his career in way stations like dallas i could see it in guys' eyes , their emotions were high , it kind of helps you , said herb williams , another wanderer who arrived late in new york , and played sensationally in relief of ewing a sober adult who does n't throw words around , williams said it was no cliche to give the fans an assist but the knicks' hierarchy would n't want to try playing without ewing that often dave checketts , the president , said , i'm sure the league is concerned with what happened last night but he asserted , that was n't the situation here it was n't leading to that i ca n't remember a situation like this do n't look for the knicks to give up their combative style it s a tough arena when the rangers are home , too there is no sound in new york sports quite like the roar of the crowd when the rangers are making a sudden break up the ice the sound is steelonsteel , the express train screeching through a local station hockey fans are allowed to bang on the plexiglas partitions and make ugly gestures at a visiting player whose features are being squashed by one of the home lads the garden fans loved it when the rangers and caps gooned it up in the third period last night the paying patrons were no doubt emboldened by a long day of reading plutarch , listening to mozart , meditating and drinking iced tea they were pumped but in new york , how can you tell \? photos though patrick ewing was gone from the game , he was not forgotten by the garden faithful \( barton silverman \) the crowd at the garden did n't fail to make their feelings known after patrick ewing s ejection \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg c4 \)
flightsafety international has some fetching qualities besides a name that suggests a soaring , riskfree investment like an airline , flightsafety , which mainly provides training on simulators to pilots and operators of ships and utility plants , can generate dizzying profit margins once overhead is covered so it is hardly surprising that flightsafety s stock jumped this month when it reported a 9 percent rise in fourthquarter profits after trading around 35 a share for months , the stock has risen more than 20 percent to close yesterday at 4275 , down 785 cents on closer examination , the recent rise of flightsafety s stock seems to be a textbook example of socalled momentum investing simply put , momentum investors pile into stocks on the rise , particularly after , say , a pleasant surprise in earnings when momentum shifts direction , they head for the exits , often sending the stock s price to undeservedly low levels while there are some glimmers of news that appear to brighten the outlook for flightsafety , the recent flight path of its stock suggests that many investors are getting ahead of themselves they 've made some progress , but they 're still not operating at a satisfactory level of capacity , said howard a rubel , who follows flightsafety for goldman , sachs the business is still lumpy flightsafety s fourthquarter earnings 196 million , or 61 cents a share , on revenues of 768 million easily surpassed analysts' expectations of 48 cents a share the surprise was due in part to a jump in deliveries of business jets to customers who then require training for their pilots and a slight rise in generalaviation aircraft deliveries even so , several analysts say nothing has fundamentally changed in the outlook for the company sales of simulators make up less than 20 percent of flightsafety s revenues , with training accounting for the balance about half of the training is for corporate and generalaviation pilots 20 percent comes from government contracts 20 percent from airlines , and the remainder from training for ships and steamgenerating plants there s a lot of uncertainty as to whether that type of trend in its earnings will continue , said david pizzimenti , a nomura securities analyst there are some signs that appear promising for flightsafety , the biggest company in the flight simulator business the airline industry continues to churn , with frequent announcements from startup airlines entering the fray or expanding when one pilot moves on , that often means a number of pilots below him or her move up a notch , requiring training at each step pilot hiring at scheduled airlines and cargo carriers is holding steady at about 5 , 000 new jobs a year , but that is expected to rise only slightly this year and the federal aviation administration said last week that it wanted to increase training and standards for commuter airline pilots to the levels required at the big carriers a l ueltschi , chief executive and president of flightsafety , based at la guardia airport in queens , welcomed the news i would think that if they start tightening down on some of the training , that would be very helpful to us , he said we certainly have the capacity but analysts and airline industry officials said none of these moves was likely to mean noteworthy gains in flightsafety s business many smaller airlines still train in their own planes because they consider that method cheaper than simulator training walter coleman , head of the regional airline association , also said pilot training for many smaller airlines already met the higher standards , which will not take effect for the commuter airlines until mid1995 still , the aviation business has defied predictions time and again , and momentum investors who decide to stay with flightsafety may enjoy a little luck in the fourth quarter of last year , for example , the company was caught off guard by a jump in walkup business from pilots seeking training there s always that level of uncertainty , said mr pizzimenti of nomura securities especially with aviation

washington , march 5 when he first became white house counsel , bernard w nussbaum told an interviewer that he viewed his mission as preventing legal problems from becoming political ones by that standard there are few , if any , white house officials who would today contend that his was a successful tenure many of the clinton administration s worst political setbacks blossomed from lawrelated issues that mr nussbaum was charged with handling that is certainly true in the case of how he has dealt with questions surrounding the clintons' investment in an arkansas real estate venture known as the whitewater development company before bill clinton became president whitewater and related issues like an investigation of a failed arkansas savings and loan association have become the white house s greatest political threat at various times in responding to questions about whitewater , mr nussbaum deployed his style as a new york corporate litigator with a vigorous takenoprisoners defense of mr clinton and his wife , hillary in the end , such behavior vastly increased suspicions about what the clintons had done good litigation tactics mr nussbaum first raised the possibility , for example , that the clintons might resist turning over whitewater documents on the grounds of attorneyclient privilege other white house officials saw this as a perfectly good tactic in the corporate litigation world where mr nussbaum came from , but politically impossible for a public figure like the president one official said it was akin to telling your client to plead the fifth amendment , a permissible approach for a mobster but not for someone who needs to retain the nation s trust mr nussbaum also argued vehemently against the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the whitewater matter the president eventually agreed to the appointment in the face of overwhelming political pressure but the most intriguing question of all may be whether mr nussbaum s actions , widely dismissed as politically naive , were actually at the behest of the clintons in a scramble to limit disclosure put more simply , has mr nussbaum been made a kind of a fall guy when the public perception that the white house had something to hide became too much for president clinton to bear politically \? mrs clinton , for example , was said to have been second to none in her resistance to the appointment of a special prosecutor , and mr nussbaum could have simply been reflecting her view mr nussbaum first met hillary clinton when he was a senior lawyer on the house impeachment committee investigating president richard m nixon s involvement in watergate she is considered the person who brought him into the white house different worlds in his resignation letter today , mr nussbaum insisted he was paying a penalty for being a good lawyer and striving to defend the interests of his client mr nussbaum always seemed baffled that his style , which was so successful in the world of new york corporate litigation , often reaped scorn in washington before he became the president s chief lawyer , he helped direct the corporate takeover upheavals of the 1980 s he thrived in a world where sharp , clever legal tactics and sharper elbows are the coin of success those who have flourished in washington at the intersection of law and government have usually displayed a more finely tuned ear for political considerations questions of tampering when mr nussbaum met with government lawyers last fall to determine the progress of investigations into a failed arkansas savings and loan association , madison guaranty , he was perhaps doing what he did in new york trying to find out as much as he could about the case against his clients , the clintons but as white house counsel , the action raised profound questions of tampering professor charles wolfram of the cornell law school , an authority on legal ethics , said such behavior was honed in the process of discovery in which opposing lawyers try to get as much information as possible from the other side while restricting the other side s access to information another example of mr nussbaum s style came in december when he told some reporters that he had not previously fully explained his decision to transfer some whitewater files to mr clinton s personal lawyer because no one had asked him that precise question it was a classic litigationbred response attorney general selections to be sure , mr nussbaum was involved in a variety of foulups before whitewater became a major political problem he was , for example , at the center of the white house s inability in its first several months to find an attorney general in what would be the first major instance in which his colleagues began to suspect that mr nussbaum was politically tonedeaf , he had argued that the president should press ahead with the nomination of zoe baird , after senator joseph r biden jr of delaware , the chairman of the judiciary committee , said she could not be confirmed because she had hired an illegal alien as a nanny for her son after that , mr nussbaum failed to find out that the next choice for the job , judge kimba m wood , had a similar problem before her name was publicly floated last month , it was disclosed that the united states park police , who had investigated the apparent suicide last july of vincent w foster jr , the deputy white house counsel , had accused mr nussbaum in a confidential report of having impeded their inquiries the report said , for example , that mr nussbaum insisted that lawyers from the white house counsel s office sit in on police interviews with staff members , perhaps intimidating them from being candid photo bernard w nussbaum working in his office yesterday after announcing his resignation as white house counsel \( paul hosefros the new york times \)
mayor rudolph w giuliani reaches what could be a makeorbreak point this week in closing a 23 billion budget gap , and there are indications that some of his intricate plans may be in trouble a month before he must complete the new york city budget the budget proposal is a harbinger of the mayor s ability to carry out the sweeping changes that he envisions in the city s government he faces two crucial tests this week , as negotiations with the city s unions on a severance program to cut 7 , 600 jobs accelerate and as lawmakers in albany decide whether the city receives 275 million in new aid as those deliberations continue , with some disagreement about their progress , the commissioners of the city s agencies on friday completed lists of 10 , 000 city workers by name and social security number who could be laid off quickly should the talks with the unions falter i'm still hopeful most of the plan will work , mr giuliani said on friday , referring to the preliminary budget plan he released in february if it does n't , he went on , then of course we would have to do deeper cuts administration officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that with the lists of employees now in hand , the mayor could begin laying off city workers as soon as this week , something the administration hopes to avoid because of the political fury layoffs can cause 'a gun to our heads' stanley hill , the executive director of district council 37 of the american federation of state , county and municipal employees , reacted to the layoff lists and warnings of deeper cuts angrily , calling them a threat and his remarks suggested that such warnings could interfere with talks on the severance program and other concessions the mayor is seeking , including a requirement that workers pay part of their health benefits they 're trying to put a gun to our heads , said mr hill , who also serves as the head of the municipal labor committee , which represents all the municipal unions i'm sorry , but i'm not going to negotiate that way by law , the mayor has until april 26 to submit his formal budget for the fiscal year that begins in july mr giuliani s aides have said it will be a more detailed version of his preliminary plan to close the budget gap by cutting 1 billion in spending and eliminating 15 , 000 jobs by june 1995 , half of them by attrition and the rest through the severance program this spring while the mayor s plan has received praise as a step toward solving the city s recurring imbalance between revenues and spending , fiscal monitors have raised questions about several parts of the plan the state s financial control board concluded that 950 million of the mayor s budget plan was risky , including the aid from albany , the severance plan and 400 million in concessions that the unions have not yet agreed to support 'fish or cut bait' allen j proctor , the board s executive director , said it was not unexpected , especially for a new mayor , to have a lot of blanks to fill in his first preliminary budget plan he added , though , that mr giuliani had to provide details soon the executive budget , mr proctor said , is going to be the time to fish or cut bait two of the largest and most immediate uncertainties in the mayor s plans are the severance program and the aid from albany , which together would save the city more than 500 million under the severance program , the mayor has offered workers 5 , 000 to 10 , 000 each , as well as health insurance for up to a year , to cut at least 7 , 600 jobs from the city s payroll the program must start this spring , rather than in the new fiscal year , to increase the savings to a total of 251 million but the program has slipped behind schedule , as the mayor s office and the unions negotiate the terms of the offer the mayor first planned to offer severance packages for three weeks by the beginning of march now the mayor s office hopes to offer them by the first week of april though that goal also appears optimistic the unions counter sitting down on friday for only the second formal bargaining session , the unions countered with their own severance offer and they refused to negotiate the severance in isolation , demanding that other concessions mr giuliani wants , including the requirement for workers to pay part of their benefits , be included as a package , said people familiar with the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity the disparity with the city s offer indicates how far the two sides remain apart , with the unions calling for less money for the least experienced workers but far more for senior workers under the unions' offer , a worker with up to 10 years' seniority would receive 3 , 500 , or two weeks' pay per year of service , whichever is greater the offer would increase with seniority , reaching 25 , 000 , or a year s pay , for workers with 26 years of experience the mayor s commissioner of labor , randy levine , said , we 're having very , very fruitful discussions but union leaders had a markedly different view arthur cheliotes , the president of local 1180 of the communications workers of america , said the administration had been slow to offer even the most basic details , including where exactly the administration would aim the severance cuts within each agency would you buy a car if you did n't look under the hood \? he said we ca n't even find the lever to pop the hood that s what we 're being offered the talks broke off until tuesday the mayor still has not received permission to use a 200 million surplus to pay for the severance packages from the municipal assistance corporation last week the corporation s chairman , eugene j keilin , suggested that by exempting police officers , firefighters and teachers from his budget cuts , mr giuliani was making it more difficult to win support for his plans a suggestion that the mayor promptly called out of line layoff lists by friday if the union talks collapse or if mac refuses to free the surplus , the mayor said he would have no choice but to resort to layoffs immediately to underscore the point , the mayor ordered the agencies to compile the layoff lists by friday it s something we have to be ready to do soon , an official said an added pressure on the mayor s budget is the uncertainty of obtaining new state aid from albany the state s budget is legally required to be approved by friday , the start of the state s fiscal year , though it could go late as gov mario m cuomo and the legislature negotiate the state s 62 billion budget , the mayor still has won no commitments on a 275 million helping hand nearly half of that amount , 130 million , is supposed to come from a proposal to have the state take over a portion of the city s medicaid costs , but by last week that proposal appeared to have died because of resistance in the state senate , which is controlled by republicans on friday mr giuliani and the senate majority leader , ralph j marino , both republicans , announced a breakthrough in the deadlock over the proposed takeover by linking it to a plan to fingerprint welfare recipients only to have democrats in albany reject the linkage out of hand , leaving the prospects of increased state aid just as uncertain as before i'm very , very nervous , a senior administration official said of the prospect of aid from albany publicly , aides remain hopeful that the mayor s budget plans will hold together none of these things , deputy mayor john s dyson said , is dead yet table point by point the mayor s targets mayor rudolph w giuliani hopes to cut 7 , 600 jobs through a severance program he has ordered each of the city s agencies to set targets to reach that number , exempting police officers , firefighters and teachers , as well as uniformed sanitation and correction workers that would leave 63 , 831 eligible for the severance offer , which is under negotiation with the unions a

after gregory by austin wright 292 pp dallas baskerville publishers 20 to you reading this , whoever you are , states the narrator of austin wright s carefully wrought but rather abstract fifth novel , apologies for the confusion of second persons it s just one of those ambiguous linguistic things one falls into your second person sets all of you apart from some invisible and undecipherable me , and it s through you that i exist looking at you , thinking through you , writing to you with that single paragraph in the first chapter of after gregory mr wright establishes his principal themes the mutability of personal identity , the crucial role that relating an experience plays in defining it and the redemptive power of writing the direct address to the reader signals that this will be a selfconscious work , forgoing straightforward storytelling in favor of a complex text that mimics the stopandstart processes of memory as the narrator remembers an ambiguous past whether accurately or not is unclear the confusion of second persons comes from the fact that the narrator calls the protagonist you throughout , even though the two are the same man mr wright , who entitled one early novel first persons , and whose narrator referred to himself alternately as i and he in another novel , camden s eyes , clearly enjoys such games , and he plays them well the secondperson narrative , which in brat pack lit has generally been an irritating and distracting affectation , becomes almost inconspicuous here as the author skillfully draws readers into a tale that , like his 1993 novel tony and susan , puts murdermystery trappings to metaphysical uses as is the case with most fiction characterized as experimental \( an increasingly inadequate adjective for an approach that has an 80year history \) , specific details are dropped into the text like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that readers must fit together we only gradually learn that the man who walks into a river at the novel s opening is peter gregory , a 35yearold high school english teacher in cincinnati whose marriage has failed , who is threatened with a lawsuit by the father of a student he had sex with , who killed a woman and her children while driving drunk and who may even have intentionally committed a murder the man who emerges from the water is someone else peter gregory wrote a suicide note and drowned himself in the river , this new man tells joe and amy , the couple he meets while hitchhiking toward new york i swam out on the other side he claims not to remember what prompted the teacher s despair such knowledge went to the bottom with him as he treks west , he assumes various identities as hitchhiker as murry bree , who shingles a roof for spending money and , in one of several amusing riffs on famous literary characters , as nicholas rostov , nocount white trash before settling in manhattan with a false birth certificate that enables him to get a job the thing is you do n't have to be anybody , joe says enviously nothing to worry about but the necessities of life tycoon jack rome offers an escape from those as well when he proposes to give the narrator 30 million if he will assume the name stephen trace and promise never to go back to his life as peter gregory at heart i'm a philosopher , rome explains the human condition , that s what interests me when you swam the river , you stepped outside the human condition rome , a selfmade man himself , wants to see if his beneficiary can invent a completely new personality , free from the constraints of the past but stephen trace proves to be a passive man who builds an identity by buying a lot of expensive things , including a long island mansion , and spends most of his time worrying about what he can become that would please jack rome an elaborate intrigue involving a television evangelist s daughter , mysterious machinations at rome enterprises and the maneuvers of rome s wife and the woman who marries stephen trace forms the backdrop for the narrator s continuing struggle to put peter gregory behind him , hindered by several chance encounters \( all but one are red herrings \) with people who knew the english teacher unfortunately , none of this is terribly interesting cleverly constructed and thematically provocative though it is , after gregory lacks any real passion , either for the characters or for the existential questions their plights embody the conclusion , in which the narrator reconciles himself to his past and moves forward by becoming a writer \( you lived in the word you written into page after page \) , has neither emotional nor intellectual punch , because the issues raised have never acquired any weight the insubstantiality of identity in the modern world and the unreliability of memory are common topics in 20thcentury fiction , and mr wright seems content merely to invoke them , rather than say anything new about them
sarajevo , bosnia and herzegovina , aug 19 a united nations report said today that bosnian serbs had fired artillery within the area around sarajevo from which heavy weapons are banned and had aimed antiaircraft guns at relief planes from a weapons depot that was supposed to be guarded by ukrainian peacekeepers they have been shelled by heavy weapons mainly from the direction within the 20kilometer zone around sarajevo , the united nations report said , referring to artillery attacks on thursday by bosnian serbs on bosnian army forces east of the town of breza the report said the shells had come from the southwest , indicating territory held by bosnian serbs that is within the 124mile radius of the united nations exclusion zone around sarajevo a french soldier with the united nations peacekeeping force was shot and killed early today as he manned a frontline observation post at sarajevo s jewish cemetery , but united nations officials said they did not know who fired the smallarms rounds a flurry of contradictory reports from united nations officials today said the rebel bosnian muslim leader , fikret abdic , had surrendered and handed over his weapons , or that he was about to surrender but reuters reported later that mr abdic denied them in a telephone conversation from his headquarters in velika kladusa , and described them as incorrect and malicious a military spokesman in sarajevo first announced that mr abdic had surrendered but an official in zagreb , croatia , said the muslim rebel , who broke with the bosnian government over his willingness to deal with the serbs , had not yet surrendered although he might do so soon mr abdic himself told reuters only that he had agreed to hold talks with united nations officials on saturday concerning the reports on exclusionzone violations , united nations officials here have said that both the bosnian serbs and the predominantly muslim bosnian army had violated the zone dozens of times in recent weeks a united nations report written wednesday said the bosnian serbs had access to weapons and ammunition in at least some of the united nationsguarded weaponscollection centers around the bosnian capital it said one 40millimeter antiaircraft gun was being trained on planes arriving and departing from sarajevo airport near ilidza , a suburb the report said the serbs had prepared three other 40millimeter antiaircraft weapons for action at the site one of the weapons had seven magazines containing ammunition on the ground beside it , the report said , adding that none of the ukrainian troops supposed to be guarding the weapons depot were seen in the area the situation is not very satisfactory , said maj rob annink , spokesman for the united nations military force in sarajevo he said the commander of the ukrainian platoon that was supposed to be guarding the weapons at that site had reported that the guns had not been loaded and therefore posed no serious threat united nations officials here have never explained how the same ukrainian troops guarding the same weapons collection site at ilidza allowed the serbs to make off with a tank , two armored personnel carriers and vehiclemounted antiaircraft guns two weeks ago no artillery rounds were fired at any planes , but a single shell fired from a 120millimeter mortar prompted officials to close the airport on thursday afternoon the only flight into the airport today carried yasushi akashi , the top united nations diplomat in the former yugoslavia , who held talks with bosnian serb and bosnian government officials the united nations also reported today that bosnian serbs had forced 110 muslims , mostly women and children from the serbianheld town of bijeljina , to cross the front line near tuzla in a new wave of forced expulsions in the serbs' ethnic cleansing campaign that began on july 16
washington , jan 22 the house and the senate come back to work on tuesday expecting to be judged on how they deal with health care , the biggest domestic issue congress has confronted in three decades it may even prove to be the most complicated task that congress has ever faced , involving far more crosscurrents than the civil rights bills of the 1960 s or the economic measures of the new deal and before the issue actually comes to the floor in either house , it must make its way past scores of conflicting interest groups like the elderly , the hospitals and the various factions of the insurance industry , and through five major congressional committees otherwise , the second session of the 103d congress faces a daunting agenda that might claim a place in history on its own but this year the other issues are likely to remain in health care s shadow a full plate congressional leaders and president clinton have promised to try to pass major reforms in the way the federal government deals with welfare , crime , banking , telecommunications , foreign aid , job training and federal aid to education with the latest new york times cbs news poll showing that only 30 percent of the public approves of how congress is doing its job , its leaders hope to dim those doubts with legislation on campaign financing , some reorganization of the way congress does its own business and perhaps still more trimming of the federal budget but after last year s budget bill froze the total that can be spent on all programs requiring annual appropriations , this summer s reruns of the annual spending battles will be even more intense than usual all eyes on november the first spending dispute of the year will come soon republicans , according to senator bob dole of kansas , the minority leader , will demand that earthquake relief for california be offset by spending reductions elsewhere thomas s foley , the speaker of the house , said democrats would argue that it should be considered an emergency , outside the regular payasyougo rules for the budget then in late february , the senate is likely to go into an extended battle over a proposed constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget if the measure receives the necessary twothirds vote , the house will consider it next as in every other evennumbered year , congress will be legislating with elections in mind , bringing more grandstanding amendments and more time off for district work periods and other opportunities to campaign and raise money all 435 house seats and 34 of the 100 spots in the senate will be up , and for most members , election day on nov 8 is the most important day of the year republicans , who now have 175 representatives and 44 senators , expect modest gains in each house an increasingly partisan tone can be expected as election day nears , but republicans are wary of letting democrats mask their own divisions with accusations of republican obstructionism we do n't have any gridlock plan , mr dole said it seems unlikely that last year s absolute partisanship on budget votes , when no republicans voted with mr clinton , will be repeated but how much collaboration there will be , especially on health care , is an open question in the more partisan house , it seems unlikely that more than a handful of republican votes can be found for any plan resembling mr clinton s , with its requirements that employers pay for most of their workers' health insurance and that each state set up insurance purchasing cooperatives to negotiate with insurance companies representative newt gingrich of georgia , the deputy republican leader , said that if mr clinton was willing to compromise and work for a health solution that is in the center and involves personal responsibility more than bureaucracy he might obtain significant republican backing but that could cost mr clinton many of the 93 house democrats who already prefer a program to the left of his , the single payer scheme that would have the government and not the insurance companies pay the bills house democrats are ready to try to get the needed 218 votes just from their own ranks if they have to their success will be tested first in march or april in the energy and commerce committee , headed by representative john d dingell of michigan , which will act first on the bill but that approach has no applicability in the senate , where at least a bit of bipartisanship is required to pass almost anything it takes 60 votes to break a filibuster that blocks action , and there are only 56 democrats searching for compromise senator george j mitchell of maine , the majority leader , has said hopefully that health will be a high risk issue to filibuster but he and other senate democrats like edward m kennedy of massachusetts and daniel patrick moynihan of new york are searching for health care compromises that can bring a dozen or more republicans along so far they have just one , senator james m jeffords of vermont mr foley said health care s prospects might depend on what lawmakers heard in their districts , whether members come back with a sense of urgency he predicted that lawmakers would spend more time than usual listening to each other when they return this week mr dole said senate republicans would be talking to each other , too , trying to arrive at some common stance they now have four differing bills they support , and mr dole said , if we ca n't come together on some common package , we may find ourselves sitting in the bleachers somewhere there is no solid timetable for health care mr moynihan plans to hold hearings in the senate finance committee through april mr kennedy s labor and human resources committee is ready to vote any time but will probably wait while he tries to line up republican support committee as microcosm in the house , mr dingell is likely to force the first votes , having given his subcommittees until march 4 to finish their work so the full committee can take up the bill the michigan democrat learned the gospel of health care from his father , an earlier representative john d dingell , who in 1943 joined in introducing the first national health care bill the veteran chairman s committee , with 27 democrats including several nervous freshmen and a few moderates along with 17 republicans , is fairly representative of the house itself thus , a victory there would be a bigger boost for mr clinton than success in the more heavily partisan democratic ranks of the ways and means or education and labor committees , which will also deal with the bill while most congressional leaders expect major health care legislation to be passed , none will offer a road map to enactment and some worry that congress will fail to agree on any bill at all , as the public expects a times cbs news poll of 1 , 146 adults , conducted by telephone from jan 15 through 17 , showed that 56 percent of the public expected failure and only 39 percent predicted success the margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points if by some unfortunate fact , we do not pass it , mr dingell said , then democrats should be ready to try to turn the 1994 election into a referendum on the health care issue

port st lucie , fla , march 27 two days after failing to obtain california s j t snow to fill their hole at first base , the mets managed to complete a trade that brings them david segui from baltimore and does not cost them a player currently in their major league camp the mets obtained segui , a switchhitting first baseman , for two class aaa players righthander tom wegmann and shortstop kevin baez in addition , the mets released glenn davis , who had come to camp as a nonroster invitee and had been competing for the firstbase job a contact hitter with a 263 career average and highly respected defensive abilities he committed only five errors last season segui is expected to be the mets' everyday first baseman and should bolster an infield that many consider defensively suspect 'a real fine addition' segui is a switchhitting first baseman and a gold glove type of fielder , said the mets' general manager , joe mcilvaine , who announced the trade after the mets' 93 loss to the yankees this afternoon he provides us with real solid defense at first base we 're happy to have him and we think he s going to be a real fine addition after waiting behind randy milligan and then davis who remains his good friend segui , 27 , finally got the opportunity to be the orioles' everyday first baseman after davis hit under 200 the first month of last season and was optioned to triplea he hit 273 in 146 games \( 127 of them starts \) with 27 doubles , 10 homers and 60 rbi but then baltimore signed rafael palmeiro as a free agent and segui was instantly relegated to the backup role this is what i 've been hoping for the last couple of months , segui said ion a conference call from st petersburg , fla , where the orioles played the cardinals this afternoon last year , i played every day and did well enough that i thought i got myself in a position where something would happen i hoped something would open up somewhere , i'm just surprised it took this long orsulak returns to outfield manager dallas green said that he was tickled by the deal and that he planned to play segui on a regular basis and bat him somewhere in the middle of the lineup joe orsulak will return to the outfield , where he will be the no 4 man , and segui s arrival will probably cost either john cangelosi or rick parker a job as a reserve outfielder i know joe and eddie and gerry worked hard to try and bolster us up , said green , referring to mcilvaine , ed lynch and gerry hunsicker , who said that talks concerning segui had been off and on with the orioles for a while it s a position we were worried about segui s name had circulated over the winter in potential trades with baltimore involving bobby bonilla , but recent interest had focused on snow , who nearly came to the mets in a trade for anthony young the angels pulled out of the deal on friday , and young is expected to be the fourth or fifth starter in the mets' rotation he s been penciled in there from the getgo , green said of young it s pretty obvious this fit very well for me and for our pitching staff it also seemed to be a good fit for segui , whose desire for an everyday job clearly outweighed any disappointment he might have felt about leaving a team that should contend for the american league east title in order to play for a team that finished with 103 losses last season son of a major leaguer everybody knows that they 're in a rebuilding stage , i guess , said segui , whose father , diego , pitched in the majors from 1962 to 1977 and whose younger brother , dan , played infield in the mets' minor league system from 1987 to 1989 they got rid of some guys i do n't know for what reasons , and i guess it s none of my business right now , they 're starting with young guys and trying to build from there for the future the mets also have tried to revive some players on the downside of their careers , which is why they invited davis to camp davis , who struggled with injuries the past three seasons , impressed the mets with his attitude and his work ethic , but not his performance and , in what was a generous and classy move , davis took the time to give mets management a scouting report on segui after he had been informed of the trade and his release i have to say that glenn davis gave his heart and soul to prove to baseball and to us that he can play again , green said i thought his bat was slowly dissipating from the rust , but his defense was something i was concerned about since davis had been signed to a minor league contract , the mets could have sent him to the class aaa team and kept him there for up to 30 days , which was their option , but they chose instead to give davis the opportunity to look elsewhere for work this spring photo david segui will bring his highly respected defensive abilities at first base to the mets \( otto gruele allsport \)
berlin , feb 17 this bustling metropolis has more than enough challenges to keep its politicians occupied giant construction projects are under way , the government plans to move here from bonn , and eastern europe s convulsions are uncomfortably close by but for hundreds of thousands of berlin residents , these challenges pale into insignificance in comparison with new threats to their beloved gardens they are threatening to bring down the city government next year , and warn that if established political parties do not listen to them , they will form a new one of their own no one is taking these warnings lightly what the farmers are to france , a local newspaper said recently , the small gardeners are to berlin taken individually , the gardeners hardly seem like revolutionaries they are quintessential good citizens like hannelore schmidt , who tends her fruit trees , herb gardens and vegetable patches every day , even in the winter greedy eyes of bureaucrats this garden is the center of my life , mrs schmidt said as she proudly pointed out two tiny daisies that had managed to sprout through the nearfrozen earth i have a close feeling for god , and i think this is it in most parts of germany , people like mrs schmidt are pillars of local life , quaint symbols of selfsufficiency and the nation s mythic roots in agriculture but mrs schmidt has suddenly found herself cast as a public villain the reason is that her garden lies in the heart of downtown berlin , just two blocks from the glittering kurfurstendamm while berlin was a divided city , lavish subsidies from bonn kept the standard of living here artificially high and allowed the indulgence of many idiosyncracies now those subsidies are being slashed as the city looks for new sources of income , some officials are casting their eyes longingly on the large plots of cityowned land in chic central boroughs like wilmersdorf that have for years been leased to gardeners we ca n't hang on to all of our old berlin traditions , wolfgang nagel , the city s minister of construction , said in a widely publicized magazine interview it does n't make sense that the best sites in the inner city , like in wilmersdorf , are being occupied by gardeners who pay only a few marks a year to use them why ca n't the city use that land to develop business and housing projects \? mr nagel s comments placed him in direct conflict with the oftensatirized but nonetheless potent kleingartnerverein in traditional germany , everyone is supposed to belong to least one verein , or club , and none is as upstanding or as dear to the national soul as the kleingartnerverein , the smallgardeners' club because of the gardeners' status as national icons , and because many berliners want to preserve the city s remaining green spaces for environmental reasons , the gardens are in no danger of quick closing more than 80 , 000 families have garden plots , and another 16 , 000 families are on waiting lists wary of the gardeners' political muscle , many of mr nagel s own colleagues at city hall , including mayor eberhard diepgen , have condemned his position a longterm city plan calls for closing some of the downtown gardens , however , and as berlin grows , pressure to close others is certain to increase leased gardens here now cover more than 8 , 800 acres , 4 percent of the city s surface area much of this is land left undeveloped after the rubble of world war ii was cleared many of the younger families who lease gardens enjoy them principally as summer retreats for sunbathing and barbecue parties but there is still a hard core of oldtimers like mrs schmidt who take their gardening very seriously mrs schmidt s garden , which is fairly typical , covers a roomy 1 , 675 square feet , and costs her just 400 a year to lease it is one of 90 gardens on a plot that occupies about a quarter of a city block near olivaer platz the setting is idyllic , a calm oasis in the heart of one of the world s most desirable real estate districts i told my husband that if they take the garden away , we have to move out to the country , mrs schmidt said the virtue of green space a member of the city council who wants to close many of berlin s gardens , wolfgang mleczkowski , has calculated that closing half of them would lead to 650 million in real estate development you have to ask yourself if you want to live in a village or in a big city , mr mleczkowski said i personally like being in a city but a lot of people who came here over the last 40 years did n't come here to be in a city they came here to escape the draft or pay lower taxes or just to flip out their heart is still back in the small town others say berlin should maintain all the green space it can , even if it means a loss in economic growth the relatively high percentage of green area in berlin is one of the city s most attractive features , said martin janicke , who heads an environmental research group at the free university here to give up these areas for development would be shortsighted we would pay a high price for it photo not 300 yards from berlin s shopping hub , the kurfurstendamm , is the garden of hannelore schmidt , one of the city s private plots that are being eyed by developmentminded officials her grandchildren looked on \( metin yilmaz for the new york times \) map of berlin shows the location of kurfurstendamm
los angeles , march 30 one rests atop vergee s palace de bella donna , beyond a sister billboard for naked gun 33 1 3 , near crenshaw and 48th a few blocks west of the vortex of the 1992 riots it shows a man , masked and menacing , aiming his gun at an unsuspecting woman as she approaches her car warning this can be you without the police dept , the billboard , placed by the los angeles police protective league , declares the advertisement led to criticism a week ago , when the league , the police union that is locked in a prolonged contractual dispute with the city , put up 22 of the messages along the city s most frequented roadways some people wondered why a city would sully its own image and essentially advertise anarchy , and mayor richard j riordan called them grotesque and stupid but whatever one thought of them before , the advertisements became either eerily prophetic or utterly inappropriate last weekend , when two 19yearold japanese students , takuma ito and go matsuura , were shot in a carjacking in a shopping center parking lot in the city s san pedro section and died now , suddenly , the advertisements are coming down within 48 hours , the billboards will be blank , then be returned to more customary tenants like cars and cigarettes no leads reported the police reported no new leads on wednesday in the killings of the two japanese , both film students at marymount college in palos verdes among the evidence they are examining is a videotape recorded by a camera at an automatic teller machine near the crime scene it s a little blurry , as you might guess , but when blown up it is quite sharp , john addleman , an official with the bank of san pedro , which owns the teller machine , told a local television station a spokesman for the police department , lieut john m dunkin , said on wednesday that the video was n't the quality we had hoped he added that the police were continuing to sift through the fingerprints found in mr ito s 1994 honda civic , which was recovered soon after the attack it is n't just a matter of dropping a chemical on something and getting an answer , lieutenant dunkin said officials of the police union have offered differing explanations for removing the advertisements on tuesday , the group explained that it was just not right for the city and union to be squabbling publicly after the shooting of the two students but geoffrey garfield , a spokesman for the police group and architect of the 19 , 000 advertising campaign , said today that police officials had decided to remove them after mayor riordan made concessions on seniority and promotion for the last 21 months , the city s 7 , 700 police officers have been without a contract , and they have not had a raise in two years the billboards were the second phase of an unusual public relations campaign by the union , which earlier this month began circulating brochures to travel agents , consulates and airlines stating that los angeles was not safe for tourists still in production is a 10minute video showing why removal is hailed the mayor said nothing about concessions to the union but hailed the decision to remove the billboard advertisements the police union has come to agree with me that goodfaith negotiations belong at the bargaining table , not in billboards , brochures or other public relations tactics , he said others were less delicate this act by the police protective league was selfdestructive , said councilman zev yaroslavsky it reminds me of that scene in 'blazing saddles' where cleavon little takes a loaded gun and points it to his own head and says , 'if you do n't stop , i 'll shoot' the campaign was a bust , and they lost the moral high ground even officials of the patrick media group , which installed the advertisements for what they had thought would be a monthlong stay , confessed some discomfort with the officers' approach yes , i frankly thought the copy was n't appropriate to their problems and expressed that feeling to them , but they were insistent , said ed dato , the company s director of government affairs it was their money , their feeling and their cause , so what i said did n't really matter michael collins , senior vice president of the los angeles convention and visitors bureau , said he was delighted that the signs would disappear did their presence drive business away \? he said i doubt it but it only served in the context of recent news to exacerbate the effect of an already ugly story mr garfield said the police group was not embarrassed by the billboards they were put up in order to engage the public , to attract attention , to get them to know about our contract dispute , he said by that measure , it s been an undisputed success he denied that the advertisements had harmed the city s image in the whole scheme of things , our billboards were minuscule compared to the natural disasters and the civil unrest , he said he also ridiculed claims that the billboards may have helped provoke the fatal carjacking , which has terrified this city s already shaky tourist industry it s irresponsible and morbid for people to connect the two , mr garfield said none of the advertisements , he noted , were near the san pedro supermarket where the japanese were shot mr garfield said the union was continuing its work on the 10minute video it s still an option that we can exercise , he said he said it featured sirens , riot footage , fires , floods , earthquake footage , a gunfight at a convenience store typical stuff you see on tv every night

there are many good and cogent reasons for the cherishableness of this volume in the cambridge illustrated history series british theater , for starters , is what american theater derives from , and is the only theater american tourists can and do flock to without fear of a language barrier , though such cockiness sometimes proves unwarranted and the fruitful twoway traffic between the british and american stages , new and old , has been continuous , despite many and varied roadblocks there is , as simon trussler points out , no comparable tome in existence short histories have tended to deal with world theater \( with commendable efforts by allardyce nicoll , phyllis hartnoll and bamber gascoigne , among others \) , but short and world constitute , if not a contradiction in terms , an invitation to dry list making or sheer superficiality a history of one major nation s theater in 400 pages , with many splendid illustrations , has a much better chance of being fair and thorough besides , in the long view , all national histories are of international interest , for both their curious parallels and no less curious divergences and mr trussler , a british theater scholar and journalist , has done a good job of work inevitably , there is a personal bias , historians at least the better ones being only human , after all first , the author defines theater as something performed , and has considerably less use for plays in print next , he states not once , but twice that he comes from the lower classes \( his father was a farmer \) , and that without government support , gratefully acknowledged , he could not have gone to college as a man of the people , then , he views theater as a popular art , and values the contributions of the many as much as those of the few he evaluates playwrights to a large extent on whether they voice the needs and concerns of the people , though he does not ignore the other kind still , john arden receives more attention than samuel beckett , and a martian reading this book might conclude that mrs aphra behn was almost as important as shakespeare the emphasis has to do with mr trussler s championing of underdogs among his most exemplary discussions are those of women in the theater , and he shows like interest in homosexual playwrights and other minorities but none of this is done in a shrill , demagogic or humorless way , even if the author makes no secret of his political sympathies occasionally , he does become a trifle overemphatic , though i am not sure that a remark about margaret thatcher s having fallen victim to the law of the jungle she espoused belongs in a climactic passage of such a book yet even an elitist critic must concede the wisdom of many of mr trussler s choices starting out with medieval times , the author posits the triune beginnings of british theatrics in remnants of the roman mimes and latin dramatists , in certain highly theatrical aspects of roman catholic religious ritual and in the stubborn survival of pagan folk feasts and fairs , popular songs and performed tales this is not news , but mr trussler s contribution is the persuasive pride of place given to folkways over church practices and the legacy from roman britain of plautine and terentian comedy and giving the lie to alleged british insularity , the author brings in relevant classical and foreign references , such as a useful discussion of hrotsvitha , the 10thcentury german nun and playwright from the very beginning , he pays close attention to where and how plays were performed , reproducing countless pictures of theaters including those that were no more than wagons , porticoes or empty spaces along with his incisive speculations on just what went on there he notes even the telltale deployment of a performing dog in the 14thcentury dame sirith we get an eloquent defense of such an early tudor dramatist as the gifted john skelton and his play magnificence , whose variegated verse forms , though often awkward in the reading , prove brisk and forceful when spoken it is only that presentday critics , bogged down in the later ubiquity of blank verse , cannot cope with other verse forms in a subsequent chapter , mr trussler observes that it took shakespeare to transmute the uncertainty of direction of elizabethan tragedy into its very essence , the eternally ambiguous tragic hero a nice insight into the heart of elizabethan and jacobean theater there is a firstrate section entitled the nature of 'character , ' in which mr trussler examines the elizabethan types and the use of tag lines , or sententiae , and shows that this lingering medieval antiindividualist approach had its virtues it accounts even for some of prince hamlet , though most of the dramatic 'characters' of the period were created by adding the slightest pinch of psychology to a veritable punch bowl of typology
with a new year ahead , it seems a good day to look backward and forward in short , to open the mail dear sir , have you ever heard of the sawdust tire \? in the 1950 s and 60 s , in iowa and nebraska , they used to mix sawdust with tirerubber compound to make a retread similar in result to what you describe and decades sooner as the tire wore and released bits of sawdust , thousands of tiny suction cups resulted after an ice storm , with a moderate driving technique , they really worked ray bailey denver funny you should mention it i had heard of something like that and meant to put it into the dec 5 column , which talked about a new bridgestone technology that fills the rubber with microscopic pores as the tire wears , the pores become tiny pits with thousands of biting edges to grip the road the bridgestone people freely admit that their blizzak tire substitutes hightech for low tech , but it was n't sawdust they were talking about in the 50 s and 60 s , the bridgestone engineers said , tire makers mixed ground walnut shells into the compound when the walnuts fell out , voila ! and speaking of tires dear sir , i would appreciate any information you can give me concerning a specific tirevalve cap some time ago , your column on the meaning of the information on a tire s sidewall mentioned the cap , which shows when the tire has lost pressure i bought two sets for my cars and found them very satisfactory unfortunately , i lost one cap and would like to buy another set , but i have also lost the information on their name and where they can be purchased can you help \?

trenton , aug 31 it started off innocently enough a lobbyist who wanted to go to an expensive political fundraiser got his client to pay the 5 , 000 contribution the client is called the coalition for the preservation of the first amendment the lobbyist , john torok , said he attended the reception for the assembly republican majority in june at the princeton marriott , even though he had just had eye surgery , could not see and had to be guided by a friend getting into the private reception where being seen is as important as seeing required the large contribution , he said none of my clients even showed , he said but the contribution has become a source of minor embarrassment for the assembly republicans , mr torok and his clients , whom he described as ma and pa owners of about 40 shops familiar in many parts of the state adult bookstores sensing a plot when the assembly republicans were told on tuesday by a reporter from the record in bergen county who the members of the coalition were , they said immediately that the 5 , 000 would be returned they also treated the episode as a plot to embarrass the assembly speaker , chuck haytaian , who is running for the united states senate against the democratic incumbent , frank r lautenberg as speaker , mr haytaian would ordinarily be in charge of the assembly republican majority fund , but because of his candidacy he relinquished that role in january to the assembly majority leader , jack collins mr collins acknowledged the contribution today , but said the republican leadership had not known who the coalition represented or what its agenda was it has now come to our attention that this group represents the views of the adult entertainment industry , he said to avoid any impression that the republicans support the views and goals of the coalition , the money has been returned , mr collins said he also said that any reports linking mr haytaian with the republican majority s fundraising efforts were inaccurate and misleading but the republican party s discomfort was matched by the glee of the democratic opposition tom byrne , the democratic state chairman , said , it appears the republicans accept money first and ask questions later about the source mr torok said he was hired by a lawyer retained by the adultoriented businesses to monitor bills that might affect them he said that his clients' political naivete is overwhelming , and that he regretted what had happened in retrospect i wish i had never gone to that reception , he said
los angeles , june 8 the 1994 california races for governor and the united states senate got officially under way today after a round of lackluster primary voting on tuesday that routinely produced the expected nominees the fall contests shape up as anything but routine in the primaries for governor , republicans renominated gov pete wilson and democrats chose treasurer kathleen brown , setting up what promises to be a hardfought contest ms brown , a 48yearold moderate liberal , is the third member of the brown political dynasty to seek the california governorship her father , edmund g \( pat \) brown , served from 1959 to 1967 , and her brother , edmund g brown jr , served from 1975 to 1983 mr wilson , a 60yearold moderate conservative , is an experienced , resourceful campaigner who , like ms brown , is sometimes mentioned as having national ticket potential the race , mr wilson vowed this morning at a republican breakfast , will fought over real issues , not what your family was he is also expected to press the crime issue , betting that ms brown may be vulnerable california voters now say that crime , not the flagging economy that the democrats have focused on , is their biggest worry , and ms brown , though she has promised strong measures to fight crime , opposes capital punishment in the senate race , the democratic nominee is the incumbent , dianne feinstein , a 60yearold moderate liberal , and the republican candidate is representative michael huffington of santa barbara , a 46yearold moderate conservative that contest also shapes up as a close one senator feinstein is expected to dwell on mr huffington s limited political record and his limited residency in california he has been active in politics for under three years and has been a resident of california only slightly longer he s a legislative cypher , she said today in the opening shot of her campaign mr huffington will probably try to paint ms feinstein as a biggovernment , bigspending , hightax liberal she s a career politician who never had a private sector job , he scoffed today and each has raised questions about whether the other has paid enough income tax over the years but ultimately , another kind of money campaign money may decide the huffingtonfeinstein contest the race could turn out to be the most expensive congressional election in history mr huffington , whose wealth from family oil investments in texas has been put at 75 million , spent 6 million to win nomination on tuesay and vows to spend an additional 10 million , if necessary , to win in november ms feinstein , who also has considerable family wealth and , further , is regarded as one of the best political fundraisers in the country , promises to come up with at least 10 million the spending record for a congressional race is 259 million , set in the 1984 senate race in north carolina from a national perspective , both the senate race and the governor s race will be watched closely presidential hints california is the most populous and politically powerful state , so what happens here in november will hint at presidential prospects in 1996 further , the outcome of the huffingtonfeinstein race will help determine whether democrats retain control of the senate and whether the small contingent of women in that body shrinks republicans would need to wrest seven seats from democrats to take over the senate political analysts and polltakers say the crucial accomplishment this fall for the nominees in both the races for governor and the senate will be to win back party members who favored some other candidate on tuesday while none of the four nominees were seriously challenged in the primaries the results seemed so preordained that only about 40 percent of registered voters turned out the balloting did produce evidence of soft support for some candidates so for the fall contest , the timeless political work of protecting and strengthening support will be crucial halfhearted unity those efforts got under way first thing this morning , though hardly smoothly for mr wilson at a republican unity breakfast here , the governor called for a very unified party but the governor s primary opponent , ron unz , a rightleaning computer millionaire , avoided a direct endorsement of the man who beat him with 62 percent of the vote , offering instead general support for republican candidates who espouse party principles and policies the unity pitch went better for ms brown during a press conference at which she was joined by other democrats who won nomination on tuesday one after another they rose to offer their support to her effort to unseat what she called the rip van wilson administration , which wakes up once ever four years , just in time for an election ms brown came out of the tuesday primary with comfortable doubledigit leads over two opponents , insurance commissioner john garamendi and state senator tom hayden still , mr wilson could take more comfort from the results of a los angeles times survey in which voters were questioned as they left the polls on tuesday almost 50 percent of the republicans who chose mr unz said they would be back with mr wilson come november less that 20 percent said they would vote for ms brown of democratic voters , roughly a third of those who voted either for mr garamendi or mr hayden said they would go with ms brown in the fall but another third said they would vote for mr wilson in the senate primaries , surveys of voters leaving the polls found support for ms feinstein and for mr huffington to be about equally solid , with both assured of getting the votes of two of every three members of their respective parties in the fall ms feinstein faced no serious opposition in the democratic primary mr huffington handily defeated his one major opponent , former representative william e dannemeyer of orange county there were several other notable political developments in the tuesday balloting in the democratic contest for the nomination to run for secretary of state , the acting secretary , tony miller , defeated assemblywoman gwen moore of los angeles and michael woo , a former los angeles councilman and mayoral candidate should mr miller win in november , when his republican opponent will be assemblyman bill jones of fresno , he would be the first openly gay candidate elected to statewide office in california in the race for the democratic nomination for treasurer , a former state democratic party chairman , phil angelides , defeated the former president pro tem of the state senate , david roberti , who had earlier fended off a recall effort led by members of the national rifle association mr roberti , author of several gun control bills , ran out of money in the treasurer s race , having used up much of his financing in the earlier fight against the recall and in palm springs , the former mayor , the entertainer sonny bono , won the republican nomination for congress his democratic opponent will be assemblyman steve clute photo the day after the primaries , candidates were back on the trail yesterday in california for what are expected to be tough races the democratic nominee for governor , kathleen brown , visited students in san jose \( jim wilson the new york times \)
washington , feb 17 toughening his appeal to older americans , president clinton said today that critics of his health care plan and supporters of a balancedbudget amendment were trying to rob medicare to pay for their goals at a white house brunch with leaders of groups that represent older americans , the president took aim at congress , where critics of his health care plan are flourishing and proponents of a balancedbudget amendment are pushing for a vote congress comes back next week and will take up the balancedbudget amendment , mr clinton said it also will take money from medicare without doing anything to strengthen the health care security of senior citizens make no mistake about it right now in congress , there are people who represent interests who want to use medicare as a sort of a bank to pay for other people s health care , to bring down the deficit , to do other things that have nothing to do with the purpose for which medicare was paid in the first place the american association of retired persons , which has not formally endorsed the president s approach , has nevertheless worked with the white house to disseminate the clinton view on both issues mr clinton , arguing against the balancedbudget measure , maintained that he had reduced the rate of increase in the budget deficit in a responsible manner that makes an acrosstheboard constitutional amendment unnecessary he said the amendment would force government to scale back needed social programs abandoning the reasonablepeoplecandisagree approach that typifies much of the white house response to proposals it opposes , white house officials have lashed out at the proposed budget measure and stepped up their criticism of competing health care proposals the white house scare approach could be effective john rother , the legislative director for the american association of retired people , said mr clinton must use strong language to cut through the confusion now surrounding his health care plan people need reassurance if people think clinton s plan will somehow threaten medicare , the president has to take that on right away , mr rother said none of the other messages are going to get through until people are reassured on that point in many cases , the white house is battling members who support it on one measure but not the other senator paul simon , democrat of illinois , who is a sponsor of the balancedbudget measure , is also a cosponsor of mr clinton s health plan he said the two issues were not necessarily incompatible the reality is , the health care plan we have has to be on a payasyougo basis , mr simon said there s no reason we ca n't have a balanced budget as well as a healthier citizenry mr clinton and his aides disagree with mr simon on that point we have demonstrated with our budgets that you can reduce the deficit and still be fair to older americans , mr clinton said first lady speaks out hillary rodham clinton also spoke out on behalf of the health care plan for a second consecutive day today , addressing scientists gathered at the national insititutes of health in bethesda mrs clinton said that the plan the administration had proposed would do more to support academic health centers and finance ambitious research that the alternatives that have been presented in congress as scientists , you are well schooled in the art of perseverance , she said you know what patience and fortitude it takes to solve the riddles of disease and to unlock the mysteries of nature and the universe you know how important it is to push ahead until you do succeed well , that is exactly the attitude we take with us into this health care debate photo president clinton talking about health care and the budget with leaders of groups for older americans yesterday at a white house brunch \( paul hosefros the new york times \)
the first clue that anything was amiss in the rare books collection of columbia university came on a hot day last july a librarian preparing a catalogue entry went to the shelves on the sixth floor , where medieval manuscripts are stored in boxes but one of the boxes was empty the head librarian , jean ashton , ordered an inventory of the medieval manuscripts by the time it was complete , it was clear that 22 were gone , including a papal bull written in 1202 and a french copy of the book of hours from the 14th century some were just single pages , carefully preserved through the centuries others were complete books , lavishly illustrated by hand and written by quill in latin or arabic columbia officials are still not sure what happened , but they have called in the federal bureau of investigation some officials speculated that the works were stolen over a period of time some said they believed the theft may have been an inside job access to the rare books is restricted , and researchers must check their coats and book bags and briefcases they may bring in paper and pencils , but not even pens the value of the missing manuscripts is difficult to determine experts said it was about 1 million , and while the manuscripts are insured , dealers said the documents were priceless to researchers the last time anyone had seen any of the works was on june 3 , a library official said after ms ashton finished the inventory , the university did not announce the losses publicly officials were hoping the culprit would return the works but it did quietly notify the people most likely to see them if someone tried to sell them the international foundation for art research and the antiquarian booksellers' association of america these organizations sent descriptions of the stolen works to their members and asked them to be on the lookout for any that turned up for sale none have in addition to the papal bull , written by pope innocent iii to a french abbot , the missing items include a copy of euclid s elementa written in latin around 1300 , a late 15thcentury transcription of the passion according to st john , a 15thcentury italian processional and a late 14century french chronique universelle among the more elaborately decorated works is a second french copy of the book of hours , circa 1490 , containing 17 miniatures and blue and gold initials eight of the 22 missing works are of 19thcentury arabic or persian origin , including a highly decorated persian book of poems , which contains 31 miniatures the medieval manuscript society , an informal group of scholars , collectors and dealers , is offering a substantial reward for the return of the manuscripts on a noquestionsasked basis , said bruce ferrini , a prominent manuscript collector and dealer based in akron , ohio , and a member of the society columbia s rare book and manuscript library , part of the university s butler library , contains more than 500 , 000 volumes and 28 million manuscript items , making it comparable to similar collections at harvard and princeton but smaller than the beinecke library at yale mr ferrini said he could not place a dollar figure on the value of the manuscripts , but said they are of inestimable scholarly and research value a spokesman for columbia university , fred knubel , said that columbia could not be part of the reward offer one manuscript expert , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said columbia had asked him to appraise the missing works , because the fbi will not enter such cases unless the missing items are collectively valued by an expert at 50 , 000 or more he said his appraisal was in six figures joseph a valiquette , a spokesman for the fbi , would only confirm that there was an investigation he did not provide additional details william voelkle , curator of medieval and renaissance manuscripts at the pierpont morgan library in new york city , said columbia officials had kept quiet about the theft in the hope of making it easier for someone to admit that it was just a prank , or that he or she was demonstrating lax security or a poor state of preservation of manuscripts mr voelkle also speculated that the theft had been an inside job if it were just one or two manuscripts , they could have been stolen by a visitor , he said , but when this number of items is missing , you figure the thief knew his way around very well another expert , who also spoke on condition of anonymity , speculated that the thief might have fancied himself a kind of robin hood who took the manuscripts to protect them from deterioration mr knubel said the university had no reason to believe any such theory mr ferrini said that the manuscripts are so well known that the only possible buyer for them would be at such a low level that the thief would receive no more than 5 percent of their value the theft , the first in recent times from butler , is far from the nation s largest purloining of rare books three years ago , a federal jury convicted a man , described as delusional , who had stolen 21 , 000 volumes , including a copy of the nuremberg chronicle , from 45 institutions around the country the man , stephen c blumberg , had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity two years ago , the library of congress lost a volume of rare early photographs , and in the 1970 s , two defrocked byzantine priests pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the smuggling of ancient atlases with handpainted maps from the yale library ms ashton , director of the rare book and manuscript library , said the loss is difficult to assess because any manuscript captures a moment of history and is unique any removal of these objects from public access is a loss to scholarship , she continued each of the missing manuscripts represents an important document to different scholars many scholars have used these items and valued them rudolph ellenbogen , curator of the rare books and manuscripts collection , said that several thousand scholars from all over the world use the rare books room every year we see them from japan , western europe and all across the united states , he said they 're interested in art , history , linguistics and every field you could name mr knubel said that columbia kept no photographic records of the missing manuscripts , and mr ferrini said the lack of such records was

stressing crimerelated issues on his first workday in office , mayor rudolph w giuliani promoted a toplevel uniformed police official yesterday to be the secondincommand in the police department and strongly reiterated his intention to intensify the arresting of streetlevel drug criminals mr giuliani named chief david w scott , the city s highestranking uniformed officer and a highly regarded administrator and commander , as the first deputy police commissioner , serving under the incoming commissioner , william j bratton chief scott , who is 58 , has nearly 33 years' experience with the new york city police department , with two years before that as a transit police officer with mr bratton at his side , the mayor said chief scott represented the finest in the new york city police department he said police officers disagree on many subjects , but one thing they agree on is that this man represents the very finest while the position of first deputy commissioner has typically been an administrative post in the police department , mr bratton stressed that he expected chief scott to play a role in devising strategy as well my first deputy will be a full partner in the running of the new york city police department , mr bratton said chief scott , who will maintain his 109 , 000ayear salary , offered few details yesterday on what impact he hoped to have within the police department , saying that he and mr bratton have a number of issues yet to discuss an imposing 6foot2 , 215pound man who was born and raised in a harlem housing project , chief scott rose through the department and was widely respected by people and groups as diverse as the police rank and file and the new york civil liberties union in 1991 lee p brown , then the commissioner , named chief scott the chief of department , the highestranking uniformed officer of the police department chief scott was the first black person to hold that position chief scott has maintained a relatively lowkey profile , although he has had responsibility for the manpower and deployment decisions for the nation s largest police department he has twice been considered for police commissioner , by both mr giuliani and his predecessor , mayor david n dinkins but chief scott took his name out of the running , saying he had no interest in 1992 chief scott announced he was leaving the department , citing several health reasons , including a possible heart ailment he withdrew that resignation after a month and said his concerns had been allayed by his doctors chief scott will replace john s pritchard 3d , who had decided to step down before the election in the city hall news conference at which he announced the appointment , mr giuliani acknowledged that there had been some problems with the effectiveness of increased streetlevel arrests as a way of reducing drug dealing and violence , but said he intended fully to employ that strategy i think there has to be proportionate enforcement of the law against people who buy and sell drugs , the mayor said nobody should feel they have immunity to buy or sell drugs in new york city the practice of massive arrests of streetlevel suspects has been abandoned by some cities and criticized in an exhaustive study by the vera institute of justice as ineffective and costly but mr giuliani said there were methods to make the practice more productive we do n't intend to replicate precisely the way it was done in the past , he said he added that if such arrests were coupled with drug treatment programs and social programs and if you did some training so that you left something behind you , it might have meant a much more effective program increased arrests , he said , can help establish a sense that our streets are not for the purpose of selling drugs strongly worded letter the focus on policerelated issues came on the day mr giuliani received a strongly worded letter from the city council speaker , peter f vallone , expressing concern that the police department had 350 fewer officers on patrol than planned under the city s safe streets safe city program while the council is fully cognizant of all the issues facing your administration , none can be more important than guaranteeing public safety , mr vallone said in his letter , which he delivered by hand to the mayor he requested that mr giuliani offer a detailed explanation for the decrease in patrol strength when asked about the letter , mr giuliani said that he had received it but that he had not yet had a chance to read it or study the issue photo chief david w scott , speaking at a news conference in city hall after being named as the first deputy police commissioner he will serve under the incoming commissioner , william j bratton , left \( andrea mohin the new york times \)
portland , me , june 15 ever since senator george j mitchell announced in march that he would not run for reelection , setting off a ripple effect from the state s highest offices to the lowest , maine has been swarming with candidates it was like he threw a rock at a bee s nest , ben coes , the executive director of maine s republican party , said of mr mitchell s announcement some of the buzzing was stilled by the results of primaries on tuesday nonetheless , there are city council members running for state representative , state representatives running for the state senate , state senators running for congress and united states representatives running for the senate mr mitchell s intentions upon leaving the senate and his position as majority leader are still something of a mystery there are no incumbents , said theodore rand , a lobsterman and former portland city council member who was defeated in his bid for the republican nomination for congress it s a level playing field how often do you see that \? maine has two united states representatives thomas h andrews , a democrat , and olympia j snowe , a republican and both gave up their house seats to run for mr mitchell s seat in the senate this set off a frenetic primary campaign involving 19 candidates on tuesday , republicans selected james longley jr , a lawyer whose father was a former governor , as their candidate to replace mr andrews the democrats chose dennis dutremble , who is creating yet another power vacuum by leaving his post as president of the state senate for the race to succeed ms snowe , the democrats chose john baldacci , a state senator , and the republicans selected richard bennett , a state representative this created even more contests to fill their seats maine s second congressional district is the largest district east of the mississippi river , and it is not easy for candidates to traverse its 25 , 000 square miles of sparsely populated land to meet the voters for all the frenzied politicking , the voter turnout was low on tuesday the governor s race attracted the most popular attention here even before mr mitchell s announcement , voters knew that they would be electing a new governor this year because the incumbent , john r mckernan jr , who is married to representative snowe , is limited by law to two consecutive terms maine s independent streak could play a large role in the race to succeed him mainers like to think of themselves as cranky , individualistic and unpredictable , said oliver woshinsky , a political science professor at the university of southern maine indeed , the most popular party in maine is apparently none at all in 1992 , the last year for which figures are available , maine had 290 , 006 registered democrats 257 , 779 registered republicans 1 , 109 libertarians , and 329 , 801 voters who were not affiliated with a party in the presidential election that year , ross perot received 303 percent of the vote here , finishing slightly ahead of george bush , who spends his summers in kennebunkport and in 1974 voters elected an independent governor , james longley , the one whose son is now the republican nominee for congress bigspending independent one independent for governor who is hoping to tap into that sentiment is angus king , a businessman who was the host of a talk show on public television mr king has outspent his rivals on advertising maine has been through an extraordinary period of partisan bickering , he said two years ago , our state government was shut down for a couple of weeks because our republican governor and our democratic legislature could n't agree on a budget the democrats chose joseph brennan , who was governor from 1979 to 1987 and narrowly lost the election to mr mckernan in 1990 he won more than 50 percent of the vote in a field of five candidates fellow democrats had sought to portray mr brennan as an insider his republican opponent will be susan collins , who has been an aide in the united states senate and a member of governor mckernan s cabinet but has never held an elective office now that the primaries are over , the voters here can turn their attention to the race for mr mitchell s seat , which is regarded as a close contest between mr andrews , a popular liberal from southern maine , and ms snowe , a moderate republican who represents the more conservative country in the rural north

san francisco while the technology world s focus has been on apple s faster macintosh line , which was displayed yesterday , and intel s recently announced quicker pentium chip , it has been easy to discount sun microsystems , the leading maker of computer work stations in fact , the common wisdom in silicon valley has been that sun would simply be gored by the twin horns of evercheaper and faster personal computers and microsoft s commercially oriented nt operating system but sun , which prides itself at being both quirky and arrogant , has been counted out before as usual , reports of our demise are premature , said eric schmidt , sun s chief technology officer now the computer maker is set to catch up in the work station business and may end up giving fits to its chief competitors hewlett packard , digital equipment , silicon graphics and ibm sun , which introduced the 10 , 000 voyager , its first transportable work station , yesterday , will soon add the sparc 5 and sparc 20 , work station models designed to refresh the performance of sun s desktop systems and put the company back in the hunt in the performancesensitive work station market a market it created several weeks ago the company , based in mountain view , calif , treated analysts to a sneak preview of its new product family scheduled to be introduced later this month since then the buzz that the new products have created has begun turning some heads on wall street the word is , there has never been a better time to buy sun s stock , which had been languishing in the 20 range since the beginning of january but the buzz has already prompted buying yesterday the stock closed at 29875 , up 50 cents while the stock is still below its 1987 high of 4575 , it has risen 8 percent in the last five trading days but trading all year has been volatile the stock closed last year at 29125 i do n't always have kind things to say about sun , but i do right now , laura conigliaro , an analyst at prudential securities , said if you 're going to buy sun , this is the window what sun did wrong in the past was essentially fumble the transition between one generation of its sparc microprocessor and the next , when its ally texas instruments took far too long to complete designing a crucial new chip that could have been fatal , but during the period that sun lagged in performance , none of its competitors could dislodge it from its 30 percent share of the work station market sun has been a company that is perceived to have lagged technically , said doug van dorsten , a stock analyst at hambrecht quist in san francisco , but they still have the largest market share , so they 're doing something right that something , he said , was to develop systems that spoke directly to the needs of its core customers , who wanted to downsize move critical applications off expensive mainframes into the unix work station market that , in turn , has protected the company s margins in the last year , because sun s highend server computers have sold better than the computer maker s internal projections any way you look at it , sun is an inexpensive stock , mr van dorsten said you could make a credible case that sun should be valued as high as hewlett packard currently hewlett packard is selling at 90 , three times sun s price in addition to getting higher marks from wall street analysts for getting its technology act together , sun also has a solid business story a number of analysts said that sun had managed its business efficiently in the last year , holding its inventories significantly below both hewlett packard and silicon graphics and the company recently restructured its distribution channels , cutting back from five or six to just two distributors , thereby halting price discounting and maintaining profit margins to their credit , they 've never been out of it , said jeffry canin , a financial analyst at salomon brothers in san francisco it s quite astonishing that they 've done as well as they have

mexico city , nov 30 barely a day before he is to resign his presidency , carlos salinas de gortari was striking his usual poses on the television news in one state , he was cutting ribbon on a new bridge in another , a new hospital in a third , a new subway line he is working as though it were his first day ! the progovernment anchor marveled for anyone who might have missed the message what could be said as easily , however , is that after six busy years in an office to which mexico allows no reelection , there is still no end to the campaign for political legitimacy that followed a vote that many mexicans thought mr salinas won by fraud the fact that he may stand as the man who most changed this country in the second half of the century has somehow seemed to get lost on the 46yearold leader s way to his last inauguration with the striped sash he will hand over on thursday to his chosen successor , ernesto zedillo ponce de leon , 42 , mr salinas will deliver a restructured and strengthened economy , a political system in the throes of democratization , a society that overcame two centuries of nationalistic mistrust to join the united states and canada in the north american free trade agreement but as mr salinas has prepared to leave office , he has been haunted by reminders of the challenges he sought to avoid while he has hurried around the provinces , the central square of the capital has filled with angry leftists camped out in protest against what they contend have been fraudulent state elections members of the federal elections board have joined the opposition in complaining that the lastminute reforms by the government to the political system that its party has dominated for six decades were too little and too late in one mexico city suburb , the young lawyer who quit last week as deputy attorney general was still railing today that corrupt oldguard leaders of mr salinas s institutional revolutionary party had blocked his investigation into the murder of his brother , the party s reformminded secretary general \( the main target of his accusations , ignacio pichardo , the party president , was named today as energy secretary in mr zedillo s new cabinet \) brokers in the gleaming downtown stock exchange worried about a possible devaluation of the peso , which has come under renewed pressure as political uncertainty and a sluggish economy have slowed the flow of foreign capital needed to cover the huge deficit in mexico s current account and across the city , politicians worried about chiapas , the southern state where rebels claiming fraud in local elections there are threatening turmoil if the governorelect tries to take office as scheduled , seven days after mr zedillo in tabasco , another southern state , earlier this month , a thoughtful laidoff oil worker named alejandro padron summed up the salinas administration s contradictions wearing the black boots he worked in until his 11year job became one of 100 , 000 sacrificed to modernize the inefficient state oil company , petroleos mexicanos , mr padron , 30 , said he understood the need for the economic overhaul and could imagine other bright futures for himself and his family in a year of searching , however , he had been able to find none in tabasco it has not been the success they say on television , he said of the upbeat advertisements that the administration often used to extol its triumphs he is leaving , but we remain the problems remain against what sometimes seemed this year like great odds , mr salinas succeeded in consolidating the power of a new political generation the cabinet that mr zedillo unveiled today was filled with faces from the united statestrained ranks of the salinistas jaime serra puche , 43 , the trade minister who led the campaign for nafta , won the post of finance secretary the president s chief of staff will be a 36yearold economist trained at the massachusetts institute of technology throughout what has become a bitter political battle over mr salinas s legacy , there has been little challenge to the notion that the new team will receive a far healthier economy than its predecessors did more than 1 , 000 state companies have been sold off or closed enterprises ranging from bus transportation to road construction have been deregulated debt payments have been slashed , the budget has run a surplus for the first time in memory , and inflation has plunged with nafta as a glimmering lure , foreign investors have poured in 50 billion in six years each year , lists of the world s billionaires show more mexicans but the latter fact has come increasingly to symbolize something gone badly wrong while the richest fifth of the population has grown richer , getting more than 54 percent of the nation s income by 1992 , the poorer half drew only 18 percent mr salinas sought to ease the social and political impact of his austerity with a 4 billionayear antipoverty effort , the national solidarity program but as late as the end of 1993 , he did not plan significant political changes to meet swelling demands for greater democracy even his sharpest critics , however , did not imagine the hundreds of peasants who marched into four provincial towns in chiapas just as nafta was taking effect with the new year nor were they less than shocked by the stillmysterious assassination of the governing party s first presidential candidate , luis donaldo colosio , on march 21 , or the slaying in downtown mexico city of another prominent reformer , jose francisco ruiz masseiu , the party s secretary general , six months later in an interview this month , mr salinas disputed the idea that the two assassinations suggested a failure to adequately confront corruption and drug trafficking within the ruling party every time we had information and evidence , we acted , he said as for chiapas , he argued that the proof of change in mexico was in its ability to withstand the shock if during five years we had not carried out social and economic reforms and made progress on the political side , an event like chiapas would have become a source of general instability in the country , he said we had the means and the space to build a negotiated solution , when in the past the means had always been extermination photo on his last full day as

washington , april 17 after spending 11 years and 8 billion searching for ways to keep the government running after a sustained nuclear attack on washington , the pentagon will shelve its project as an antique of the cold war , military officials familiar with the program say the doomsday project , as it was known , sought to create an unbreakable chain of command for military and civilian leaders that would withstand a sixmonth nuclear war , which was regarded as a plausible length for a controlled conflict that was the requirement six months , said bruce blair , a former strategic air command officer assigned to analyze nuclear war plans in the early 1980 s and at the end we had to have a cohesive chain of command , with control over our remaining nuclear forces , that would give us leverage over the soviets the nuclear tensions of that era having subsided , the project has less than six months to live on oct 1 , it s history , a pentagon official said like many other coldwar programs , its details remain top secret and from accounts given anonymously by army officers and government officials , it is clear that this secrecy itself was a major stumbling block in some ways as great a challenge as the technological hurdles a pentagon agency , the defense mobilization systems planning activity , was given the task of making plans to glue together a shattered government but the planners found it impossible , even in peacetime , to coordinate the white house , the pentagon , the central intelligence agency , the state department and other agencies the project was an amalgam of more than 20 black programs so highly classified that only a handful of military and civilian personnel knew of them that raised the bureaucratic nightmare to the nth power , mr blair said no one knew what anyone else was doing it was hard to find out even the technical characteristics of some of the plans you had all the difficulties of creating commandandcontrol networks cutting across bureaucratic lines , combined with the secrecy of black programs even the bureaucrats running it were handicapped plans for surviving a world war iii date to very early in the nuclear era among the many possible courses of such a war foreseen by planners was a continuing and controlled exchange of small numbers of weapons that would last for weeks or months , rather than an allout armageddon that would be over in hours or days presidents since harry truman have been briefed on the pentagon s plans , which relied on two huge underground shelters built in the 1950 s , one beneath mount weather in the blue ridge mountains of virginia , 50 miles northwest of washington , the other beneath raven rock mountain , six miles north of camp david at the pennsylvaniamaryland border supervised by bush in the 1980 s , new nuclear warfighting strategies that foresaw a monthslong battle demanded ways to connect the president , the secretary of defense and top military leaders who could give orders to fire nuclear weapons from anywhere in the nation a few isolated bunkers to save the lives of civilian leaders no longer sufficed far more elaborate plans began with national security decision directive 55 , an order signed by president reagan in january 1983 and still top secret the directive to create continuity of government during and after a long nuclear war was drafted by , among others , oliver l north , then an obscure marine on the national security council staff in the reagan administration , the project was supervised by vice president george bush a senior cia officer , charles allen , was deputy director in the reagan and bush administrations , the project involved hundreds of people , including white house officials , army generals , cia officers and private companies run by retired military and intelligence personnel according to army officers and government officials familiar with the project , the doomsday project created elaborate new links in the nuclear chain of command the plan to keep the government running after the white house and the pentagon were reduced to radioactive rubble included a network called the presidential survivability support system two hundred specialoperations commandos were to secure surviving leaders in scores of secret bunkers the pentagon built the new bunkers after deciding that the two huge shelters built in the 1950 s were sure to be on the soviets' target list now gathering dust then the fragmented leadership would be woven together with a communications system of space satellites and specially outfitted tractortrailer trucks equipped with sophisticated transmitters convoys of at least 16 leadlined trucks , each commanded by an army colonel , were to hurtle down the nation s highways eluding soviet warheads after the pentagon was destroyed on the trucks and throughout the nation , sophisticated radio and computer terminals shielded from the effects of nuclear explosions were to link surviving military and civilian officials after the capital was destroyed billions of dollars were spent on such equipment , much of which is now gathering dust in army depots barry horton , the principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for command , control , communications and intelligence programs , said that he could answer no questions about the project , since the details of these efforts remain classified other pentagon officials confirmed that most of the project was being mothballed as part of an overall review of nuclear war plans , although none would agree to be quoted , citing secrecy strictures but the secrecy surrounding the project began crumbling after mr north referred obliquely to his role in it in congressional hearings on the irancontra scandal in 1987 after the subject was raised , representative jack brooks , democrat of texas , asked if plans for the continuity of government included a contingency plan in the event of an emergency that would suspend the american constitution in the bush administration , members of congress and the press became aware of internal army disputes involving the project some concerned awards of multimilliondollar , nobid contracts to former army officials who had left the program others involved army analyses concluding that the project s crucial communications links would break down in a crisis highranking army officials took strong measures to quash the unwanted publicity according to a 1989 house armed services committee report and pentagon records , they ordered an officer attached to the project a soldier with a selfconfessed record of drug abuse and blackmarketeering to identify whistleblowers within the program and smear them as soviet spies last year , a military satellite communications system separate from but crucial to the doomsday project the 274 billion milstar program was deemed incapable of enduring a long nuclear war a scaleddown milstar satellite , the first of six now scheduled to be built , was launched in february , with half its classified communications gear stripped out and replaced by ballast while some continuity of government programs continue under the aegis of pentagon planners , they are pale versions of the vision laid out by president reagan in 1983 they are realizing these requirements are throwbacks to the cold war , mr blair said they are not

seattle , july 23 if anyone should like hillary rodham clinton , it is craig salins he is 46 , like her a rabid democrat , like her a frenetic advocate of national health insurance , like her and indeed he does like mrs clinton , comparing her favorably to eleanor roosevelt it is the health care plan she is selling that he is not so sure about mrs clinton came to the northwest this weekend to whip up support for democratic health care legislation , and mr salins was passing out leaflets and cheering at her sunwashed rally here but beyond her stirring calls for guaranteed coverage and health security for the middle class , mrs clinton said little about the sort of law she favors what mr salins remembers is the plan her husband , the president , proposed to congress last fall he detests that plan i'm trying to figure out family language to describe it , mr salins spat , calling it watereddown and a cavein before concluding , a second later , with a bit of barnyard english mrs clinton is billed as her party s best public advocate in the white house s final push for health care legislation , and her telegenic first week of campaigning on the issue clutching a sick tot here , assailing uninsured freeloaders there offered little to refute it but for now , at least , mrs clinton s effort to convert a densely bureaucratic proposal into a grassroots crusade is burdened by two millstones one is that there is no democratic legislation for her to push , and there will be none until house and senate leaders piece together something that they believe can win the party s support as a result , beyond a set of buzzwords , almost no one seems certain just what mrs clinton is advocating the other is that both she and the health care issue are linked to a president who is less popular in some ways , much less than either of them in random chats , some democrats and health care enthusiasts in the northwest referred to mr clinton as indecisive and more apt to compromise than his wife , and a handful expressed outright doubt that he would carry out the pledges she was making on the stump and the exceeding dislike of both clintons by some on the right has clearly made natural critics of the president s insurance proposal even more intense in seattle , mrs clinton was at times nearly drowned out by hundreds of protesters , waving signs warning of socialism they turned out in response to appeals by a local conservative radio station mrs clinton s task is to elevate the debate above partisan politics and keep reminding people what it s all about , one top aide said in an interview she has a real gift for explaining it simply , and compellingly and compassionately , and with a passion that gets to the heart feeling time pressure few seem to disagree , as long as her audience has something to focus on the issue is not her ability to be a spokeswoman , john kitzhaber , the democratic candidate for governor of oregon , said in an interview the issue is , what kind of animal are they selling \? there s a lot of confusion outside washington about what a national health plan is it s a pretty hard task to sell something you ca n't describe mr kitzhaber , who sponsored the state legislation that has since brought universal health insurance to oregon , suggested that mrs clinton would have trouble converting voters to her cause until the democrats' version of health care legislation was clarified and demystified and those are the democrats mrs clinton and the white house have about three weeks to convert not just them , but also the broader electorate before the house and senate take planned votes on health legislation and leave for vacation any later would almost certainly be too late behind the cheers at a distance , none of this was much evident at the crowded , madefortelevision rallies that mrs clinton addressed this weekend , in portland and seattle , to kick off the administration lobbying effort oregon and washington were a politically adept choice mr clinton is much more popular there than in much of the rest of the nation moreover , both states' legislatures have enacted health care plans with clintonesque elements oregon s plan will gradually require all employers to assume part of the cost of basic health benefits for their workers what the white house s critics call the employer mandate , and mrs clinton now calls shared responsibility washington has set up cooperatives , like the alliances mr clinton once proposed , to manage insurance pools across the state when mrs clinton stepped to the microphone at each stop to assert that guaranteed health insurance was a human right , a matter of social justice and a moral issue , the crowds erupted in cheers and they swelled when she added , as she did in portland , that the white house wanted to insure not just the poor , who already have medicaid , but also the majority of americans who work hard , play by the rules , pay their taxes but on closer inspection , some in the handpicked , overwhelmingly democratic throngs at both cities were not wholly certain where the white house was taking the insurance issue or , in a few cases , whether they wanted to go along in portland , david reed , a 45yearold democratic organizer , suggested that the president and mrs clinton had different notions of how many people their legislation should actually insure clinton seems to be waffling , mr reed said he puts out this 95 percent , and hillary says , 'no , universal coverage , ' and all of a sudden bill s saying , 'yeah , universal coverage' it s like she hit him over the head with a fry pan photos opponents of health care overhaul waiting for hillary rodham clinton at a seattle rally on saturday \( associated press \) \( pg a13 \) hillary rodham clinton greeting supporters in seattle on saturday at a rally where she said health care for all was a moral issue \( associated press \) \( pg a1 \)
bad economic news dribbles in from russia almost every day the inflation rate nearly doubled in january state enterprises will soon need another seven trillion rubles to cover overdue bills \( do n't bother to convert that one to dollars \) even the kremlin s ability to collect taxes on vodka is being challenged by smugglers and no wonder reformers have been routed by the militaryindustrial complex , whose managers are wishing , hoping , praying they can return to a time when success was measured in how many tons of steel pipe they produced not how much it cost to make or who wanted to buy it is there anything outsiders can do to help russians dig out of this mess \? while the current government apparently has little respect for free market economics in general and purveyors of free market advice in particular , it will just not be possible for the wannabe commissars to ignore the west for long they 'll be back , predicted stanley fischer , formerly the chief economist at the world bank and this time around , western economists may muster better ideas on how to crack the resistance to change there is no great mystery how the russian government got into the current economic fix reformers , notably yegor t gaidar , anatoly b chubais and boris g fyodorov , have held very senior positions in the yeltsin government but none represented established russian interest groups their authority turned on the sponsorship of president boris n yeltsin and money from the west since neither mr yeltsin nor the west delivered , the managers of the bloated enterprises what andrei shleifer of harvard university calls the state dinosaurs were able to hold their own with help from prime minister viktor s chernomyrdin and the central bank s printing presses the political dance that occupied much of 1992 and 1993 amounted to two steps forward and two back or as jeffrey sachs , also of harvard , puts it , we pretended to help them and they pretended to reform and when the elections merely replaced the threat of a rebellious , neocommunist parliament with the threat of thugs in brown shirts , mr chernomyrdin seized the moment of the reformers , only mr chubais , the determined head of the privatization agency survived the cabinet shuffle and apparently only because rapid privatization has proved so popular prime minister chernomyrdin is presumably where he wishes in control of fiscal and monetary patronage , and positioned to run for president as the centrist alternative to oldline communists and newline fascists but along with unchallenged authority may come accountability and while he may not yet share the view , it is hard to see howmr chernomyrdin can muddle through the next few years without a radical change in economic course to postpone the day when russian enterprises must produce something people want to buy or go out of business , the government is feeding them inflationary subsidies and loans that can never be repaid that process is already accelerating inflation exfinance minister fyodorov predicts a 50 percent monthly rate by summer mr shleifer speculates that the government will respond with price controls , a method of rationing that produced endless lines , empty shelves and thriving black markets in gorbachev s soviet union and will almost certainly do the same in yeltsin s russia soon thereafter the kremlin will be unable to duck serious economic reform to mr sachs , who resigned as an adviser to the russian government when mr fyodorov quit , the key to breaking the noreformnoaid stalemate is to broaden the international monetary fund s perspective on how to contain inflation the imf demanded balanced budgets as the price of aid a price mr yeltsin was apparently not willing to pay mr sachs would prefer to finesse the standoff by offering to finance the russian government s budget deficit with noninflationary grants or loans if the core of the problem is bankrupt government , you help pay the bills , he says mr shleifer believes talk of antiinflation strategies is premature inflation wo n't really be tamable , he argues , until the influence of the state enterprises is neutralized and the key here , he argues , is to put the enterprises out of the business of providing crucial social services today , state enterprises provide much of the food and day care , and virtually all the medical services their employees receive thus when you destroy enterprises , you destroy families , mr shleifer said no small source of political power for enterprise managers if i represented the g7 , he said , referring to the major economic powers , top priority would be creating a nonenterprisebased social safety net prescriptions for shock therapy vary but virtually everyone burned by the reality that russia is the hardest of cases agrees that whatever aidforreform deal is struck next time , it must be struck at the very top direct g7 leadership would accomplish something the imf simply cannot do , mr sachs said drawing
megan has the use of 72 words of these 72 words , at least 10 are dedicated to colors , like red , blue , green , yellow and orange though megan can say orange , she cannot really distinguish that color from the color blue and sometimes , when looking at a clear summer sky , she points and says orange as far as orange juice goes , she likes it only when mixed with apple juice and calls both of these things milk megan , who recently turned 18 months , is part of a new generation , a group born after the rodney king affair but before rwanda , after desert storm but before testilying , a generation that has known no president other than bill clinton and seems likely to call hillary clinton mother even more than generation x , that cynical group of 20somethings currently featured on the cover of newsweek , for whom divorce really is vietnam , and even more than the kids still adrift in junior high cafeterias , a group that new york magazine recently dubbed generation y , kids like megan mccartle \( not her real name \) seem lost and confused and just not very smart and though a proper tag has yet to be found , it somehow does n't seem fitting to affix them with a letter , such as z , since so few of them can spell even their own names to reflect what they suggest about this country s future and backward slide in the global standings , it seems best to call them by their distinguishing physical characteristic the small generation even more disturbing than the small generation s lack of motor skills are their recreational habits this is a group that has turned away from traditional drugs , such as marijuana and heroine , drugs we know something about , in favor of exotic household substances and we 're not just talking about glue a few weeks ago , megan was left alone in her playroom with a sixpack of playdoh twenty minutes later , when her parents returned , the blue and the red containers were empty , and megan was bugeyed and what about dreams \? each night , this young generation is haunted by cryptic messages they talk about these nocturnal sojourns in only the vaguest of terms \( flying , mommy \) still , they say just enough to piece together a rough pattern a pattern of distortion and fantasy in a recent dream , megan was a dog a dirty dog a dog so dirty she went unrecognized by her owners , and was forced to wander the earth alone of course , this says a great deal about isolation , about loneliness , about loss but most telling was that moment when the dog had something to say , something important she opened her dog mouth and out came a billion jelly beans just how important is candy to this new generation \? the small generation shows real discomfort when presented with the american way of life not only have they shunned traditional careers \( almost none of them work \) , they have a sailor s disregard for hygiene they pick their noses and soil their briefs and cry about it , expecting someone else to clean up the mess when presented with such issues , megan turns away she does n't want to talk about it she wants to talk about something else her mind wanders she sits there in her playroom , staring out a window she is surrounded by playdoh empties , by magic markers with the smell all gone right up megan s nose she s mad at mommy , she loves daddy she s mad at daddy , she loves mommy she is fickle and does n't know why she s an american woman and cannot read , and to her the basic tenets of mathematics are as veiled and mysterious as her own mind why did you do it , megan \? why did you pick up the cat by its tail \? why have you soiled yourself again , megan \? why have you let america down \? how many bombs will it take until america learns humility , megan \? why do n't you talk back \? why do n't you talk \? why did you eat all the flintstones vitamins \? why are you letting all the mommies and daddies and sports writers and sociologists and anchormen of this world down again , megan \? why are you ignorant of geopolitical reality \? megan , why are you so darn small \?
the concept was certainly noble and the cost to the school negligible a statefinanced program to train lawyers to represent battered women but in 1991 , the battered women s justice center was still a hard sell to the faculty of the pace university law school the sticking point the center s director would be michael g dowd a former dean , steven h goldberg , recalled the uproar some said we would send the absolutely wrong message if we put our stamp of approval on someone who had been suspended from the practice of law mr dowd , a prominent new york criminal defense lawyer , had recently been kicked out of the profession for five years because of his involvement in a scandal in the 1980 s that tore through new york city s parking violations bureau even though he had subsequently begun a new legal life , defending battered women charged with murdering their abusers , there were those who thought his crusade against domestic violence erased neither the shame of what he had done nor the disgrace of exile they looked at me as a lesser form of life , said mr dowd , a big , shambling man of 52 in a rumpled but still lawyerly navy pinstripe suit but last week , the appellate court that ousted him cut short his punishment because of his work for battered women and the success of the center , the judges found that redemption was possible mr dowd had earned back the right to stand up in a courtroom and call himself a lawyer with the official letter tucked in his worn canvas briefcase , mr dowd went for a first look at his new manhattan office one afternoon last week just an 8by10foot shoe box , really , with two picture windows looking onto a brick wall , but room enough to begin again it s nice , he said softly really clean mr dowd knows from dirt in 1986 , he told federal prosecutors that , under orders from donald r manes , the queens borough president , he had kicked back 30 , 000 to officials to preserve his sideline business collecting parking fines for the city soon after , mr manes committed suicide lawyers , politicians and columnists were divided about mr dowd , an able criminal defense lawyer and a hailfellow with ruddy cheeks raised on ireland street in elmhurst , queens was he a whistleblower or an informer trying to save his own neck \? a victim of extortion or a businessman not above a little bribery \? as the debate went on around him , mr dowd decided to stick to lawyering within a year of the parking scandal , her took the case of karen straw , a battered queens woman who stabbed her husband to death after he raped her at knife point some lawyers believed he was representing ms straw for free to scrub the stain from his reputation after a celebrated trial , ms straw was acquitted , and mr dowd , newly sought after , began to compile an impressive string of victories while many were ordinary criminal cases , a dozen involved women in situations similar to ms straw s he consulted in scores of other cases of battered women to grassroots fighters against domestic violence , most of them women long steeped in the issue , mr dowd seemed like an an improbable standardbearer , a former football player gone to seed , a chain smoker , a rumbling ear bender he came across as a john wayne throwback , the big guy out to protect defenseless women professor goldberg of pace law school acknowledged that mr dowd s embrace of the issue seemed odd but a man talking about what was perceived as a women s issue mattered because the solution to the problem was really about changing how men act , he said long past the point where he could have backed away from the issue , mr dowd kept taking the cases and lecturing to lawyers and women s groups he had become a zealous convert , earnest in his outrage , with the trial lawyer s flair for vivid , pointed oratory lawyer with rough edges it was as if the cause had given him a focus , the sense of purpose he had been seeking his entire adult life in the mid60 s when mr dowd was a young lawyer on queens boulevard and a wouldbe reformer , he dabbled in local politics he became president of community board 4 and a law partner of thomas j manton , the future congressman in 1977 , he was the campaign manager for a futile run at the mayoralty by his friend , mario m cuomo while he had an income as a criminal defense lawyer , his rough edges did not attract welltodo clients accused , for example , of securities fraud so as a side investment , he became a partner in computrace ltd , a small company with a city contract to collect parking fines it was over lunch at tutto bene in 1982 , mr dowd would later testify , that sheldon chevlowe , a queens political fixture , apologized profusely but said that if computrace was to keep its contract , kickbacks were in order mr dowd , who had already lost one business , decided to comply mr chevlowe died within the year at the funeral home , mr dowd said , mr manes told him to make those payments to geoffrey g lindenauer , the deputy director of the parking violations bureau lindenauer met me for lunch at the lion s rock , mr dowd said and after i paid him , he still made me pick up the tab by the end of 1984 , mr dowd refused to make more payments
chicago swiss watches , you know all about them swiss pocket knives , you know all about them swiss bank accounts , you and i would love to be rich enough to have one what we had yesterday was a swiss soccer goal , straight from the home office in zurich and amen from that knowing they were sailing off the map into uncharted waters for this world cup , the people who run the sport jiggered with the rules , just for the yanks as a result of this overt tinkering , the authorities gave the new world a scorefest yesterday germany defeated bolivia , 9483 , in the first game of the 1994 world cup \( actually , the final score was 10 , but i'm trying to put this in terms that knicks fans and rockets fans and all slamdunk aficionados can understand \) the world soccer body known by the acronym fifa got sick and tired of the defensive and negative tactics that produced only 22 goals per game at the 1990 world cup in italy they knew they had to do something before the world cup moved to a country that does not have a major soccer league this world cup was handed over to the united states because of all our wonderful soccer stadiums like soldier field and the silverdome and giants stadium no , i'm kidding i could n't even find a cappuccino machine , or any other sign of coffee , in this whole american football stadium yesterday , reminding me once again that we are not in italy after six years of blatant huckstering by the official cola company and the official telephone company , logos and advertisements everywhere , we finally had a world cup game yesterday the world s biggest sports tournament seemed bizarrely superimposed on mundane , heatbattered midjune chicago , with cars with bolivian and german flags making matters only worse on the kennedy expressway with apologies to noel coward , not merely mad dogs and english go out in the noonday sun , but also soccer players and soccer fans everybody was forced outside in brutal humidity and sunshine at midday for the benefit of television audiences in europe , where it was already evening but if you tried hard , you could visualize the fans back in berlin and la paz , bangkok and lagos , all the time zones , crowded in front of television sets , watching the ball flick back and forth in neat triangular patterns , with the players struggling for the one goal that would make all the difference in the world and we actually got one the game was full of aggressive and capable touches the german fans and the bolivian fans and all the mexican fans in the audience and even the unhyphenated americans could appreciate the way the germans moved the ball from side to side , then suddenly attacked , or the way way the bolivians could dribble the ball , trying to make something from nothing but as the hot sun beat down on everybody , soccer fans began to get this queasy feeling oh , my goodness , what if there s a scoreless tie \? what about all the scorelesstieforfather sday jokes from the yukmeisters \? however , the friendly folks from fifa had worked hard to make scoring a bit easier in this world cup no longer can defenders kick the ball back into the hands to their goalkeeper , to the derisive whistles from the fans , a change that produced more jittery moments in front of the goal yesterday more important , the offside rule was tempered to allow an offensive player to move alongside the last defender , at full tilt , when the pass goes upfield and most important , the powers in fifa went on record that the two linesmen had new marching orders a tie goes to the offense and the linesmen were told , publicly , when in doubt , keep the flag down , by none other than joseph \( sepp \) blatter , the man who runs fifa while joao havelange is off playing charles de gaulle in his later years no wonder robin williams was cooing up to blatter at the world cup draw in las vegas last december this man is on our side as a result of blatter s work , we had a goal yesterday in america ! on world television ! that we might not have had in cappuccinoland four years ago in the 61st minute , cannonballfiring lothar matthaus , shifted to defense to save his recuperating ankle , lobbed a perfect pass , just like franz beckenbauer used to do thomas hassler chested it forward to jurgen klinsmann , the speedy linguist , who slipped past the last defender simultaneously with the ball and took advantage of carlos \( loco \) trucco being 5 yards too far upfield and kicked it into the open net goal , germany ! goal , fifa ! goal , klinsmann ! assist , blatter ! robin williams should come back and give his friend mr blatter a great big hug , from all america
west nyack , ny , feb 8 lisa d'annucci had planned to get away from it all and spend the last week of march on the beaches of aruba with her mother and her grandparents not a bad vacation for a 13yearold but that was before her rockland county school lost eight days of instruction to snowandice storms this winter now lisa will be spending the week of her spring break in the classrooms of felix v festa junior high school south , her vacation canceled by school authorities so students and teachers can catch up on all the time that they have missed all our teachers say , 'you 're going to be able to tell your kids about how many snow days we got off this year , ' lisa said from home this afternoon , after school was dismissed at noon it s never happened before it s like history 'nothing to look forward to' but earlier she had lamented everyone looks forward to spring break this year we have nothing to look forward to in schools across new york , new jersey and connecticut the harsh winter weather has wreaked havoc on the educational calendar , giving most children outside new york city three to nine days of unexpected vacation just in january but now those children , their parents and their teachers are learning that their forced leisure time has come at a price by law in all three states many of those days have to be made up at festa junior high the snow has thrown the curriculum into chaos officials canceled midyear exams , because there was no time for the 500 students to prepare teachers are repeating lessons several times over , their pupils' memories hampered by weatherrelated interruptions and everyone seems to be reeling from the announcement , made just last week , that school would be in session on all but two days of spring break , good friday , april 1 , and the next monday , april 4 now students and teachers , here and elsewhere in the new york metropolitan region , face the prospect of attending school for four months in a row , from the first day back from winter break , feb 28 , to the last day of school here , june 24 , with no extended vacation , other than occasional long weekend 'real creatures of routine' it s chaotic and it s disjointed , carol conklin said of the mood at festa junior high , where she is the assistant principal schools are real creatures of routine and habit and when our routine is disrupted we have to adjust and we do n't adjust easily the hardest decision , particularly for parents , has been whether to cancel longplanned vacations , perhaps with a penalty if plane tickets are nonrefundable , or to go , anyway based on requests from parents to obtain their children s homework in advance of trips to italy , russia , london , vail and walt disney world , among other places , mrs conklin guessed that as many as 40 percent of the students in this predominantly uppermiddleclass community might stay out of school that week and then there are the teachers , many of whom have appealed to superintendent jack krause for personal days in the last week of march so that they , too , can forge ahead with plans made long ago to attend family reunions or visit friends torn between allegiances joyce riess , who teaches mathematics , had intended to devote much of her week off to singing alto in the choir at st boniface church in wesley hills , as part of its celebration of holy week now she feels torn between her allegiances to her students and to her congregation i have not made up my mind , she said , taking her lunch break at a studentsize desk in an empty classroom i'm hoping easter will be canceled this year the problem facing dr krause , is that the eight snow days last month exceeded by four the number of snow days on the school calendar new york , as well as new jersey and connecticut , require that students attend school at least 180 days a year spokesmen for the education commissioners in the three states said today that none had plans to waive the rule this year , either by executive order or consent of the legislature although new york city has not canceled school because of snow , it has had scheduling problems as a result of the asbestos removal that delayed the opening of school to meet the 180day requirement , or face a loss of state aid dr krause could have curtailed the february vacation that was scheduled to begin on feb 21 but the officials considered that too soon to give parents adequate notice and too risky , considering the possibility of additional snow then then there was the option of extending the school year , but that would mean bringing students back after the regents examinations , an impractical solution at best complaints about religious days spring break seemed to make the most sense , but there were problems there , too some jewish parents have complained that they will not permit their children to attend school on march 28 , the second day of passover some christian parents have told dr krause not to expect their children on holy thursday , march 31 the superintendent said that he was sympathetic to such concerns indeed , no exams will be permitted on those days but that he had to draw the line somewhere it s been the worst emergencyclosing situation i have ever seen , dr krause , a school administrator for 31 years , said we have never had a winter like this for the 114 members of the school concert band , the news that class would be in session for spring break was a major blow all year they had been preparing to perform that week in florida , at disney world and sea world , a goal that entailed hours of practicing and fund raising after weighing the financial , educational and emotional costs of canceling the trip on which mrs conklin , the assistant principal , is to be a chaperone school officials decided that it was in the children s best interest to go ahead , as long as the children have time each day to do their homework but what of the students and teachers who will be in school that week \? it remains to be seen how much they will be able to accomplish in those poorly attended classes or in the months that will follow without a break it s going to be too long , said kathy woods , a science teacher , and we 're going to be competing with nice weather and active hormones it s spring , so they 'll all be in love at this point the kids do n't want more snow , she added i do n't think i ever thought i 'd hear that photo everyone looks forward to spring break , said lisa d'annucci , foreground , whose break will be spent this year at felix v festa junior high school south in west nyack , ny , because so many snow days have been taken this year we have nothing to look forward to \( joyce dopkeen the new york times \)
ted davidson , publichousing resident , and george m steinbrenner 3d , publicstadium resident two peas in a pod both have been in the south bronx a long time and are wary of the neighborhood both threaten to leave i 'd move to jersey , mr davidson says , though he probably never will and maybe his neighbor , mr steinbrenner , six long blocks away , never will , either but the big difference mr davidson sees between him and mr steinbrenner , the yankees' principal owner , is this every time steinbrenner threatens to move they give him more money to stay here but we do n't have anything here the longstanding tension between the residents of south bronx and the yankees is tightening again the giuliani administration is proposing to renovate the ballpark at a cost of about 275 million , while at the same time threatening to cancel construction a few blocks away of a 250 million police academy , envisioned as an economic sparkplug for the struggling neighborhood money for the academy at 153d street and park avenue was not in the financial plan that mayor rudolph w giuliani issued in february police officials have long argued that the existing academy near gramercy park in manhattan is inadequate and needs to be replaced but a giuliani administration official , citing budget constraints , said on saturday that it was unlikely money for the new building would be in the city s proposed capital budget to be released this week the distinction between the city s treatment of the stadium and the neighborhoods around it was drawn even more sharply two weeks ago mr giuliani and other city leaders announced that the city s application for a 100 million federal grant to create an empowerment zone centered in harlem would include a narrow swath of the south bronx encompassing yankee stadium but not the adjacent povertystricken communities of melrose and mott haven how do you include the richest franchise in sports and not include , a few blocks away , the poorest of the poor \? said fernando ferrer , the bronx borough president while mr ferrer commended the mayor for including a piece of the bronx in the federal application , he said he would work to have other poor neighborhoods included also help for everybody joe lhota , the chief of staff to deputy mayor john s dyson , said the administration hoped the federal aid would both help the people in the stadium area and enhance the chances of the yankees' remaining in the bronx the history of the bronx in the 20th century and the history of the yankees are intertwined , he said , adding that the administration , along with state officials , was determined to keep the team there yankee stadium has long skewed politics and money in the south bronx well before mr giuliani , a yankee fan since childhood , the team found favor among politicians devoted to the lore of the bronx bombers and fearful of the disgrace their leaving would spread when the yankees threatened to leave new york city in the 1970 s , the cashstrapped city bought the stadium and renovated it the construction bill went from 24 million to 100 million , and to save money the neighborhoodimprovement component of the project was cut now , 20 years later , officials and residents in the bronx fear they are reliving that era we want to avoid that mistake , but the city seems to be running headlong into it , mr ferrer said you ca n't just rebuild the stadium , you have to fortify the neighborhood although many of the south bronx neighborhoods have improved in the last 20 years , maritza owens , who organizes prenatal health programs in mott haven , said gunfire is a common nighttime sound near her home on the grand concourse , within easy walking distance of borough hall , yankee stadium and the police academy site on a recent afternoon when the yankees were at home , a homeless man was sprawled out asleep in joyce kilmer park opposite borough hall on a rise from which fans in the stadium s crowded upper deck could be seen 'community is suffering' how can you spend so much time and energy on yankee stadium when outside a whole community is suffering \? said ms owens , standing near the police academy site , a sunken lot littered with rusted car parts and discarded appliances and furniture the proposed police academy , once expected to bring hundreds of new jobs and thousands of police officers and cadets to the area , was seen by bronx leaders as a way to add spirit , security and economic heft to the south bronx s attempt to erase its national reputation as a charred symbol of urban catastrophe the police department has been making the case for a new academy for eight years , and two mayors have advocated putting it in the south bronx , although budget constraints delayed its progress in the administration of mayor david n dinkins it became the spark for the bronx center plan , a strategy for complementing 20 years of new housing in the area with jobs and educational opportunity the plan called for the construction of theme high schools , one connected with the police academy to prepare students for careers in law enforcement and another , near yankee stadium , for students interested in working in the sports business it is unclear if those schools will be built although there is no direct connection between the decision on the police academy and the plan to renovate yankee stadium , bronx leaders see them as a message being sent by city hall richard kahane , president of the urban assembly planning group and chairman of the bronx center plan , said that the police academy would be a tremendous economic boon to the neighborhood , while yankee stadium s effects are limited loyalties questioned this is a major generator of confidence and faith and a major generator of economic development in terms of jobs and a major generator of economic opportunity , he said yankee stadium is an important civic symbol , but it is none of the other things mr kahane said mr giuliani had a stronger political loyalty to the yankees than to the neighborhoods around it mr giuliani never ran on revitalizing this community , he said he did run on keeping the yankees here but the mayor and his aides hold fast to their contention that the decision on the academy is all about money people arguing for this have to get real , mr giuliani said in march the city simply ca n't afford it this is not a question of what people want , but where we 're going to get the money from the mayor has softened his stance somewhat recently , saying he would consider other cuts in capital budget projects for the bronx proposed by mr ferrer to help pay for the police academy but last week , deputy mayor peter j powers said finding the money for the police academy was a tough case instead , the administration plans a 698 million renovation of the current police academy but that plan would simply overhaul the building s systems and do nothing to alleviate overcrowding , said joseph wuensch , the deputy police commissioner for management and budget he said that the academy was designed in the 1950 s to hold classes of 600 cadets , but that classes now number 2 , 200 cadets , causing a shortage of everything from lockers and classrooms to showers and auditorium space nonetheless , the giuliani administration , which has strongly supported the police department and has protected it from other budget cuts , believes the needs of the police can be met without spending the money for a new academy , mr powers said 'worth every nickel' by contrast , with mr steinbrenner questioning the city s resolve to provide a safer , more lucrative and fanfriendly stadium , money seems no object in its effort to keep the yankees we do n't know what it will cost , mr dyson , the deputy mayor for finance and economic development , said when negotiations with the yankees began in february it will be a lot of money but worth every nickel photo with the giuliani administration proposing to renovate yankee stadium while at the same time threatening to cancel plans for a new police academy , tensions have stirred again between residents of the south bronx and the yankees a homeless man napped on a park bench near yankee stadium \( susan harris for the new york times \) \( pg b7 \) map of the bronx showing location of yankee stadium \( pg b7 \)
the investigation into the subway shooting of an undercover transit policeman by an offduty new york city police officer has been plagued by tension and mistrust between the two departments and damaged by a major mistake in handling physical evidence , lawenforcement officials involved in the case say the mistake involved the handling of the transit officer s clothing by the city police department s crime lab , the officials say the clothing , handled as if it were part of a routine investigation , was tested in a special solution less than 48 hours after the august shooting to determine whether the holes in the officer s shirt and jacket were caused by bullets no one knows why this test was performed , since it was already common knowledge that the holes were caused by bullets the procedure left the clothing effectively useless when the city medical examiner s office and the forensic specialist hired by the manhattan district attorney later tried to determine how many times the officer had been shot in the back , from what angle and from how great a distance the preliminary finding of the medical examiner s office , made after a physical examination of the wounded transit officer , desmond robinson , was that he had been shot four times in the back experts say the damage done to the clothing amounts to a serious loss of physical evidence according to the lawenforcement officials involved in the investigation , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , the investigation was further hampered by the flawed working relationship between the two departments in fact , the officials said , the environment created by investigators from two different departments working in a clearly strained relationship had forced doctors at bellevue hospital center to refuse further cooperation with the police investigation shortly after the shooting the doctors who had treated the transit officer informed police that they would speak only with the district attorney s office , and then only after they had been subpoenaed reports of such problems have left the lawyer for officer robinson convinced that the investigation was tainted the lawyer , brian o 'dwyer , has charged from the outset of the investigation that police commissioner william j bratton s early pronouncement that he considered the incident to be a case of two good officers trying to do their jobs had compromised the ability of his detectives to carry out an impartial investigation there is plenty of reason to be suspicious of the investigation , mro 'dwyer said the investigation now rests with the manhattan district attorney , robert m morgenthau , whose office is preparing to present the evidence to a grand jury for possible criminal charges against officer peter deldebbio mr morgenthau has repeatedly declined to answer questions about the investigation officer deldebbio , who is white , opened fire on officer robinson , who is black , after mistaking him for a criminal during a chaotic 30 seconds on a manhattan subway platform in august officer robinson has told the district attorney that he posed a threat to no one when he was shot , and he has said that he could never forgive the officer who shot him officer deldebbio has told his lawyers and other officials with the city s police union that he fired his gun five times because he feared for his life as officer robinson , his gun drawn , advanced on him after a shotgun carried by one of two armed youths had discharged near the door of an idling e train during the evening rush hour officer robinson did not have his shield out , was not wearing the color of the day marking him as an officer and had not identified himself verbally mr bratton , who is aware of the mistake made by his department s crime lab , rejected any implication that the investigation was biased or unprofessional , and he played down the reports of tension among the investigators and officials with the two departments i can answer that quite bluntly , he said when asked about the quality of the investigation from our perspective , the investigation was handled quite well but chief michael o'connor , the top officer in the transit police , said he thought that significant tension had existed between the two departments throughout the investigation chief o'connor , who assigned his department s internal affairs unit to handle the investigation , said he thought the police department s policy of not similarly involving its internal affairs bureau inevitably resulted is a less credible result i do n't personally think the city police department s methodology is a good one , said chief o'connor , who added that he thought it unfair and unwise to ask investigators from the department s detective division to handle a sensitive case involving an officer from their own department the detectives do n't want to find the officer guilty of wrongdoing , chief o'connor said involving internal affairs makes for a much more credible process indeed , said lawenforcement officials familiar with the investigation , the city s police detectives resented the presence of the transit police department s internal affairs unit , openly suspicious that its investigators were striving to find incriminating evidence against officer deldebbio
while astronomers in many parts of the world watched , as many as five huge impact scars at a time swung into view yesterday on jupiter s pockmarked face , and more fragments of comet shoemakerlevy 9 hitting the planet hurled dazzling fireballs high above the planet s atmosphere besides drilling great holes in jupiter s upper atmosphere , comet fragments hitting the planet yesterday sparked a shimmering display of auroral light , as electrically charged particles created by the impacts interacted with the atmosphere although there are frequent auroral discharges on jupiter , the light from the current one can be seen by small telescopes some astronomers predicted that the big , black spots and dark dimples that have proliferated in jupiter s southern hemisphere since saturday would become longlasting features of the planet s appearance others surmised that most of the scars would fade relatively rapidly whatever the case , the show may not completely end tomorrow , when the last big fragment of the comet slams into jupiter more bombardment predicted three of the astrophysicists who have been calculating the fate of the comet since it was discovered last year , dr zdenek sekanina , dr paul w chodas and dr donald k yeomans , all of the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , calif , predicted that a storm of cometary impacts would continue to hit jupiter until the end of september none of the comet fragments due to hit jupiter after tomorrow are expected to be as large as those now churning up the planet s 11 , 000milethick atmosphere , they said but debris ranging in size from pebbles an inch or so in diameter to fragments up to just over a halfmile in diameter are likely to continue the bombardment , according to a mathematical model the scientists have constructed the propulsion laboratory team also had good news for skywatchers , both professional and amateur any impacts that occur between july 27 and sept 22 will be on the side of jupiter facing the earth , and can be observed directly the 21 large fragments now hitting jupiter , some estimated to be as large as two miles in diameter , are all landing on the back side of the planet , out of direct view the gigantic flashes and fireballs caused by the 21 largest fragments appear over the jovian horizon soon after their impacts , and the blackened scars they leave in the jovian atmosphere swing into view some minutes later but a direct view of the impacts themselves would be even more revealing several small fragments the propulsion laboratory group urged astronomers to go on watching , even after the main show is over several of the fragments that hit yesterday were too small to create exciting images but yielded useful scientific information one of the original fragments of the comet , which had mysteriously disappeared earlier this year , was found yesterday , but only after it had hit jupiter the impact of missing fragment m was detected by the san pedro martir station of the mexican national observatory as a dim spot near the much larger and darker one created earlier by fragment c other observatories spotted the arrival of fragment n as a small flash that subsided rapidly and left no trace a pattern of impacts the comet fragments that have hit so far have varied widely in brightness fragment g , which hit on monday evening , may have been the most massive by a small margin but the appearance of the impacts generally follows a pattern , beginning with a bright flash and the appearance of a fireball \( or impact plume \) that remains bright for about 10 minutes thereafter , a black eye appears a feature that looks small compared with the vast size of jupiter but is actually larger than the earth for example , the university of queensland in brisbane , australia , described the impact of fragment k on tuesday as leaving a gigantic indentation or dimple in the jovian surface , in the middle of which a very dark spot gradually appeared similar observations were reported by the calar alto observing team at almeria , spain , and the observatorio nacional at rio de janeiro a university of arizona team working at the big herschel telescope at la palma , canary islands , reported that it had obtained particularly detailed images of several impact sites on tuesday the spots at the centers of these sites , which form and then dissipate to some extent , look black in ordinary light but when they are viewed at a wavelength of light that is absorbed by methane , they seem to have very bright cores an indication either that the methane present in jupiter s hydrogen atmosphere was blown out of the way in the region of the spot , or that the fragment exploded high enough in jupiter s atmosphere that there was very little methane above it

tomba did n't win the gold medal today in the men s slalom , but he did steal the last olympic show just when it looked as if he had failed to become the first alpine racer to win medals in three olympics , the legend of la bomba roared to life , and down the hafjell course the man with the permanent 5 o'clock shadow came through with a burst of 1 o'clock lightning from 12th place after the morning run , from a healthy 184 seconds behind , tomba somehow overtook everyone but the leader , austria s thomas stangassinger , who won the gold over tomba by 15hundredths of a second tomba s medal was the fifth of his olympic career , a sixyear run through calgary , albertville and lillehammer concluding with three golds and two silvers he goes home monday a happy man fantastic , he did n't mind commenting it seems to be some kind of record , to go from 12th to second i'm really proud of myself echoes of albertville today s tale of tomba was strangely reminiscent of the slalom two years ago at albertville , when he made up 1 58 in the afternoon run to finish second to norway s finn christian jagge he detected a pattern of woeful morning runs , directly related to his customary lack of sleep , for one reason or another this time , he said it was not because he was out partying with four women until 2 am , or was that two women until 4 am \? he desperately wanted to go out in style , not as he did in the giant slalom thursday , when he ran 13th in the first run and failed to finish the second he just could n't sleep ninethirty , this is really early in the morning , he said it is very difficult for me he was first down the hill in the morning run , in 1 minute 284 seconds , and soon he would be discounted as a medal candidate , as racers passed him by in a blur stangassinger , a 28yearold veteran from outside salzburg , was almost a full second ahead of norway s kjetil andre aamodt jagge was fifth , 116 behind as for the threat of a tomba rally , stangassinger , with all due respect , would n't have bet his life on it he was two seconds behind , he said i thought he could take one second , not more than that time to gamble between runs , tomba decided to go for broke the day was frigid and the top of the course , through the first group of gates , was a fretful sheet of ice the bottom was heavier snow , which required sharpedged skis to cut a line and make up time i had no choice , he said i was really going for it he chose a different set of skis , with sharper edges that would create a greater risk of slipping while turning through the gates at the top sure enough , tomba nearly went down around the second gate , stunting his advancement momentarily once steadied , he began to generate momentum and speed by the middle of his run , his risk began to pay off he blasted through the bottom of the course and to the finish line in 5933 , for a tworun time of 2 0217 , but only 80hundredths in the lead , with 11 racers still to come tomba ripped off his goggles and looked back at his time he waved both hands in disgust i was not very pleased , he said i did n't believe i could get a medal still , he waited to see the outcome , and was n't sorry he did none of the next three skiers came close to tomba , as it became apparent that tomba had set a blistering pace from the middle on down a tough sloven , jure kosir , pulled up 36hundredths short of tomba , and that , ultimately , would be good enough for the bronze heading for fat city switzerland s patrick staub was more than two seconds late and jagge 102 too slow austria s thomas sykora was a victim of the ice , missing the fourth gate there were three skiers left , starting with germany s peter roth tomba was suddenly one slip or lesser time away from a medal roth s dream died between the second and third gates , when he went down the giant video screen flashed tomba , dazed , delirious his fan clubs with their banners spaced through the largely norwegian crowd were wild their man could do no worse than third aamodt , going for his fourth medal of his homecountry olympics but still without a gold , was up the norwegian fans roared , but not for long aamodt went down and out less than 15 seconds into his run stangassinger was all that stood between tomba and gold i did n't know alberto s time , stangassinger said all he could think of was getting through the ice he , too , stumbled around the second gate but once back on now , he felt confident that he had enough space between himself and tomba , which he did , barely stangassinger and kosir were also carried off the pedestals by the local folk , but most eyes were fixed on tomba , wanting one final olympic look one year more , was tomba s answer to how much longer his world cup career would run , but he had already announced at a news conference the previous week that this was the end of the olympic line an overweight american reporter had stepped to the microphone to question him , but tomba spoke first yes , he said , patting his stomach tomba at nagano in 1998 photos italy s alberto tomba clearing a gate in the men s slalom event he finished second to take the silver \( agence francepresse \) \( pg c1 \) alberto tomba of italy doing a front body flip after he won the silver in the men s slalom event \( associated press \) \( pg c4 \)
an evening in anywhere , usa john and jane doe are in their bedroom above them , and clearly audible , a man is beating a woman he is shouting , she is weeping the does look at one another mr doe then looks toward the phone should he call the police \? a noneofourbusiness shrug , and he turns off the light instead the scene is a fiction a television spot that is part of a new public education campaign from the family violence prevention fund but it is also a fact millions of americans have known for a long time what it is to hear the neighbors battling , or see a wife take a punch from her husband those that did n't know do now the story of o j and nicole simpson has become a national teachin last year the fund released a poll showing that the great majority of americans realized domestic violence was a serious problem more than a third said they had witnessed it and they had finally lost patience with the two great excuses he was drunk and she asked for it but when it came to doing something about the problem , most admitted to feeling helpless the figures are staggering four million american women admitted to being beaten by their husbands or boyfriends in 1993 alone at least 25 percent of them were pregnant even so , close to half the incidents of domestic violence against women discovered in the national crime survey were not reported to police furthermore , violence breeds violence violent youths are four times more likely than nonviolent youths to come from homes where mothers were beaten by fathers during the last decade , new services have been created for victims of battering , and new laws and police protocols developed to deter the batterers but america ca n't build enough shelters , nor can it build enough jails wisdom lies , quite simply , in prevention domestic violence is not an intractable problem but solving it requires a good hard look at america s definition even in this presumably enlightened age of what a grownup , male or female , should be yes , there are women who batter but the gender most frequently in jeopardy is female and yes , the guy who smashes his wife is the same guy who s a boon companion to his friends and yes , he can be found on the golf course and in the fancy suburb as well as in the inner city and the crack house the family violence prevention fund s public education campaign is extraordinarily timely but it is also too late for too many women
washington , april 11 the clinton administration said today that it was imposing trade sanctions on taiwan for refusing to halt the sale of tiger bones and rhinoceros horns , the first time that washington has deployed trade sanctions to protect the environment while trade sanctions have often been used by the united states as a lever to promote human rights or to lower trade barriers imposed by other countries , they have never been used to protect endangered wildlife i am delighted that the us has taken the lead in this worldwide battle to save the rhinoceros and tiger before it is too late , diana e mcmeekin , head of the african wildlife foundation , said it is as if the governor has issued a lastminute stay of execution for those magnificent creatures on the edge of extinction the sanctions on taiwan will involve a ban on all taiwan wildlifeproduct exports to the united states , which amount to about 25 million a year in coral and molluskshell jewelry and in snake , lizard and crocodile skin shoes and other leather products , the white house said this is a fraction of taiwan s trade with the united states , which last year involved 251 billion in exports to the united states and 1625 billion in american exports to taiwan underground trade tiger and rhinoceros parts are used by people in taiwan and many other asian nations for medicinal purposes , and because many people consider them sexual stimulants their use has become so widespread that an underground trade has developed and populations of both animals have been decimated this is the first time any country has acted on the international call for trade sanctions to protect endangered species , but if the illegal trade in rhinos and tigers is not eliminated , these species could be extinct in five years , president clinton said in a statement the world must know that the united states will take strong actions to protect the earth s natural heritage in a statement released tuesday in taipei , taiwan s ministry of foreign affairs expressed deep regret and dissatisfaction over the us government s obviously unfair and unjust sanction asked if taiwan planned reprisals , a government spokesman , eric chiang , said , we have n't discussed any counteractions the american move underscores the fact that as trade grows more global and as barriers between countries come down , the environmental consequences can be enormous when advances in hunting techniques are combined with lower trade barriers and rapidly growing populations that demand medicines made from exotic wildlife , a species can be wiped out in one generation tigers , commonplace in circuses and zoos around the world , will shortly be extinct in the wild if this trade is not stopped at the turn of the century , the world tiger population was estimated at about 100 , 000 today , there are fewer than 6 , 000 in 1970 , there were more than 65 , 000 african black rhinos and today there are fewer than 1 , 800 , according to the african wildlife foundation there are only about 10 , 000 rhinos of all species left in the world it is a common practice in asia to grind the bones of both animals for medicines and aphrodisiacs tiger and rhino parts are prescribed by doctors in taiwan , china and korea for fevers , arthritis and impotence the administration s interagency rhino tiger task force , which recommended sanctions to the president last week , had been considering imposing sanctions on china as well at the last minute it decided to act only against taiwan , saying china had taken some limited steps to curb the sale of exoticanimal parts at a time when chineseamerican tensions are running high over human rights issues and washington is considering revoking beijing s preferential trade status , the administration probably did not want to open a new front with the chinese on wildlife even though the chinese are considered by experts to be among the worst offenders still , the move against taiwan , argued the united states trade representative , mickey kantor , constitutes a major step forward other administrations have threatened these kinds of measures to protect the environment before , but none has ever acted , he said the united states had warned taiwan and china in november that it might impose trade sanctions if they did not demonstrate by march 30 measurable , verifiable and substantial progress in curbing illicit trade in tiger and rhino parts china took some steps , the most notable a public burning of tiger and rhino medicines , and made an effort to register stocks of those medicines and to educate people against their use but taiwan did little to satisfy american demands to safeguard rhinos and tigers , which are protected under the convention on international trade and endangered species
washington , april 12 too high premiums and not enough health care that was how a clerk in fargo , nd , answered last month when asked what was the nation s biggest health care problem her reply was a singular moment of clarity in the current debate in contrast , the arguments on capitol hill have concentrated on detail , process and politics , frequently cast in incomprehensible jargon as legislators and lobbyists compare hardtoexplain parts of president clinton s plan with elements of competing proposals that no one , except perhaps their sponsors , understands the clangor has left the public confused and , recent polls show , perhaps even less knowledgeable than it was a few months ago the problems congress is trying to solve are often drowned out in the din but the main points are as the fargo clerk identified them cost and coverage except among some very conservative republicans , there is a consensus that major gaps exist in the present system and that costs have produced a crisis and as congress returned today from its easter recess , there is widespread agreement with the message that hillary rodham clinton carries everywhere these days maintaining the status quo cannot be an acceptable alternative identifying the problem agreeing on problems is a first step toward fixing them but what comes next is a giant step , because a solution to one problem can make the next one worse the politicians' reluctance to tell constituents that there is no free lunch is reciprocated the public has not descended on capitol hill to say what it wants to sacrifice for the fargo clerk , who would give only her first name , and hundreds of others interviewed in a recent new york times poll , the connection between cost and coverage is clear cost means the higher and higher insurance premiums they have to pay but it is a different side to the cost problem that is forcing congress to grapple with this vast , complicated issue health care has become the monster that eats federal budgets , forcing up deficits and starving other initiatives coverage is largely a function of insurance about 38 million americans have no health insurance after years of steadily increasing private insurance coverage , in the late 80 s more americans started losing insurance than were signing up rising costs were the main reason millions of other americans found themselves with only barebones coverage people without insurance do get medical care , but it is worse than the insured receive , although many uninsured are young and healthy other constituencies' desires beyond these two biggest problems are a swarm of other issues , each crucial to someone there have to be more medical personnel in rural areas if the promise of health insurance is to mean more than possession of a plastic card but there also may be a need to produce fewer specialists doctors think that if change is coming this must be the moment to change the malpractice lawsuit system the elderly argue say now is the time to provide prescription drug coverage under medicare , and at least a start on benefits for long term care the difficulty is that all these issues , especially in combination , lead some lawmakers to despair and ask if it would not be enough to deal with just a few of the issues , the ones people agree on , like restraining the most grating practices of the insurance industry but the dominant view is the one offered recently by john rother , legislative director of the american association of retired persons you ca n't solve only one or two without making the others worse costs rising rates across the board about 14 percent of the united states' gross domestic product is spent on health care that is a greater share than any other country spends , and it could reach 19 percent or 20 percent by the end of the century to most people , the issue of cost is more personal soaring bills many employers never tell workers how much the company pays on their behalf , but benefits have been cut back and employees' payments have been steadily increasing the health insurance association of america says the cost of family coverage under an average group insurance plan went to 436 a month in 1992 from 235 in 1988 , an average annual increase of 17 percent for people who have to buy individual insurance , the increase has been even steeper , 20 percent or a little bit more than that a year , says cecil bykerk , chief actuary for the nation s major individual insurer , mutual of omaha their premiums are vastly higher , too , because high administrative costs and a lack of bargaining power mean that only about 55 out of every 100 in premiums goes to pay claims in large group plans , as much as 90 may go to claims , meaning the insurance company charges less for the same benefits those difficulties might not have seized the attention of congress and the administration if the government did not face sharply rising bills , too federal health spending for care for the elderly under medicare and for the very poor under medicaid went to 200 billion in 1992 from 128 billion in 1988 that is a smaller rate of increase than in group policy costs and was accomplished partly by medical providers' shifting costs onto patients for whom the government does not pay nonetheless , it is still much more than the government can manage in an era when it is beginning to take the federal deficit seriously states spending more
a chair as small as a thimble , a highboy a mere yard high or a chihuahuasize bed may look silly individually , but a crowd of these lilliputian delights makes it clear why some collectors pursue them so obsessively tiny trifles , like a hunt table four inches high or a 17inchtall windsor chair , may trigger a rocket back to childhood for unsuspecting adults and , once seduced into buying a minichest , a minichair or a minidesk , people tend to treat these adult toys like sculpture , displaying them on shelves or as end tables no one ever admits it , but most people yearn at one time or another to live in a doll house was this the secret reason that philip parker , a london dealer who died in 1983 , collected so many miniatures \? the parker collection of 30 period pieces became the largest recent popularity test of such things in april when it was auctioned at sotheby s in new york not since 1980 had so many smallscale period chairs , chests and tables been auctioned at one time and even though most performed poorly only 21 were sold , 10 at prices below sotheby s expectations seeing them en masse was a reminder of the enigmatic power of the furnished minichateau remember edward albee s tiny alice \?

when richard m nixon was elected president in 1968 , there was general pleasure on wall street according to the prevailing wisdom of the time , his election marked a return to traditional economic policies and good news for the stock market it was , as it happens , another case of wall street crystal balls showing only what the seers were wishing for mr nixon , whose funeral is today , wound up being the first president since herbert hoover , and only the third president of the 20th century , to have the dow jones industrial average decline over his term of office while many of the remembrances of mr nixon have focused on the surprise of an anticommunist warrior opening relations with china , there has been less emphasis on his most surprising economic initiative , perhaps because it proved much less successful but it is equally true that only mr nixon could have imposed wage and price controls , as he did in 1971 , when the inflation rate was above 4 percent a year then deemed unconscionably high that decision was immensely popular on wall street , and the dow leaped 38 percent the first trading day after the announcement the equivalent of a 140point move at today s dow level but it was a serious mistake on a longerterm basis , especially when combined with an accommodating federal reserve monetary policy as the 1972 election approached instead of dealing with monetary causes of inflation , or with the profligate use of energy that was making the country vulnerable to an oil price shock , the government set up a bureaucracy that ended up ruling on such vital issues as whether a new hampshire county fair violated the law when it raised admission prices by 25 cents \( the ruling was that it did \) mr nixon himself noted this in his memoirs the aug 15 , 1971 , decision to impose them , mr nixon wrote of the price controls , was politically necessary and immensely popular in the short run but in the long run i believe it was wrong the piper must be paid , and there was an unquestionably high price for tampering with the orthodox economic mechanisms but none of that was clear at first it was a week after mr nixon was reelected in 1972 that the dow first closed over 1 , 000 , and in early 1973 the dow hit a peak of 1 , 05170 , a high mark that was destined to last for a decade it was the upward spiraling of oil prices , which followed the arab oil boycott prompted by the 1973 arabisraeli war , that caused the recession and the worst bear market of the last half century it was during that bear market that mr nixon resigned the dow , at 93554 when he was inaugurated for his first term , had fallen to 78489 by the time he quit a few months later , it was to bottom at 57760 , a decline of 45 percent from the peak reached less than two years earlier presidents like to take credit for bull markets during their administrations , while distancing themselves from bear markets , but , as was noted by robert farrell , the chief market analyst for merrill lynch during and after the nixon administration , in truth they often have very little to do with what happens to the markets in their administrations mr nixon was elected near the end of a 20year bull market , which had taken stock prices from undervalued to greatly overvalued and brought on great speculative excesses , mr farrell noted the bear market that followed might have been less severe had mr nixon done a better job on inflation , or had investors been less depressed by the specter of a collapsing presidency , but it would have occurred in any case there is a tradition of closing the stock market for presidential funerals , but this one is different in one way every president who died after 1930 , save one , prompted the new york stock exchange to take a full day off but herbert hoover s death in 1964 , like that of william howard taft in 1930 , led only to the exchange closing early rather than taking a full day of mourning the taft , hoover and nixon administrations were the only ones since the dow jones industrial average was invented in 1897 that resulted in a dow drop thus mr nixon becomes the first bear market president to be honored by a full exchange holiday graph the dow s election results shows the compound annual rate of change in the dow jones industrial average , by president
albany , june 19 in brokering the deal that ended the long island rail road strike after two days , gov mario m cuomo managed to appease two constituencies that will be vital to his reelection campaign long island suburbanites and organized labor in doing so , he undercut the bargaining position to some extent of the man he appointed as chairman of the metropolitan transportation authority , peter e stangl the net result , according to mr stangl , will be heightened pressure for a fare increase on the long island rail road a year from now well after the gubernatorial election and an unwanted precedent for coming negotiations with workers at the transit authority and metronorth but for the short term mr cuomo spared himself a political calamity a prolonged strike would have stranded 110 , 000 commuters a day , leaving many of them to travel to work through a june heat wave on school buses without airconditioning a number of commuters interviewed on friday , the first day of the strike , already were holding mr cuomo accountable for their inconvenience democratic strategists believe mr cuomo must keep the november election close on long island , which has a strong plurality of republican voters he lost on long island in his first gubernatorial campaign , and he ran about 8 percentage points weaker there than in the rest of the state in both his 1986 and 1990 reelections a treasured principle the saturday night agreement also enabled mr cuomo to curtail his lobbying for a federal law that would have forced the united transportation union back to work without a settlement because it would have violated its most treasured principle , collective bargaining , the union movement viewed such action as an affront neither president clinton , who antagonized unions by supporting the north american free trade agreement , nor democratic leaders of congress wanted mr cuomo to dump the problem in their laps and the governor , who needs enthusiastic union support to help finance and staff his campaign , did not want to further alienate labor leaders who have already lost some affection for him recognizing the dangers posed by the strike , mr cuomo was positively hyperactive in confronting it he canceled public appearances , including friday s tickertape parade for the new york rangers , and placed roundtheclock telephone calls to the top negotiators , members of congress , long island leaders and the aides he sent to the bargaining table overriding goal according to officials on all sides of the negotiations , mr cuomo would flatter in one call and berate in the next they said he played the arbiter of political reality and with a quick settlement as his overriding goal , they said he seemed willing to change allegiances from management to the union as he detected shifts as the strike loomed , mr cuomo had taken a tough public stand against the union , declaring that the mta should not use taxpayer dollars to bribe the union that brought an acerbic response from edward j cleary , president of the new york state aflcio , who advised mr cuomo to read a good book on labor relations and get to understand that using the word 'bribe' in a labor dispute is a very poor phrase , especially for someone as articulate as he is five days later , mr cuomo was pressuring mr stangl to accept a settlement that would cost the mta 14 million over three years and would change none of the union work rules that mr stangl found so detrimental and after mr stangl conceded on saturday night by saying he had decided to pay the ransom before it got too bad out there , mr cuomo chastised him it s very strong language , mr cuomo said in an interview today almost immediately after the strike was declared , mr cuomo began lobbying congress and the white house for legislation to force the union back to work but by late friday he had concluded that such a bill would not pass quickly , if ever little enthusiasm the head of the house energy and commerce committee , representative john d dingell , a unionfriendly michigan democrat , told the governor in a telephone call that his committee would consider the bill only if mr clinton called him to ask for it and the president , in a statement on friday , showed little enthusiasm , saying only that his subordinates would study mr cuomo s request mr cuomo then began trying to persuade mr stangl that washington would not rescue the mta and urged him to cut the best deal possible with edward yule jr , the head of the 2 , 300member transit union did i push him \? mr cuomo said of course i did , but no harder than i did yule mr cuomo said he tried to convince mr stangl that the savings that might ultimately be realized by changing some work rules , which he put at 15 million , would be paltry compared to the cost of a long strike a compromise mr cuomo contended today that both sides compromised saturday night but that view was not shared by people in the union movement jan d pierce , vice president of the communications workers of america and a longtime cuomo supporter , said it appeared that mr cuomo sort of boxed stangl in he added , any time you have a contract with no concessions and a decent wage package in this day and age , that s a good package as for mr stangl , whose term as mta chairman expired last june , mr cuomo continued to refuse to say whether he would renominate him as he has in the past , mr cuomo said today that he was waiting to see whether the legislature would approve his request for changes in the mta s management structure asked his opinion of mr stangl , mr cuomo said , nothing that happened here has changed the opinion of stangl and yule i had before this event asked what that opinion was , he said , they were both competent

playwrights the gifts of time and performance space , professional actors so that the plays dancing in their heads can be staged , and even a place to bed down the nonprofit workshop asks nothing in return \( well , maybe a mention in the playwright s biography \) it sees its beneficence as an investment in the future of the theater over the years , the investment has paid off with works by new dramatists alumni including james baldwin , paddy chayefsky , laura cunningham , john guare , william inge , john patrick shanley , lanford wilson and august wilson and on and on the idea that you have an organization dedicated to the playwright is crucial , said august wilson , adding that he sometimes took advantage of new dramatists' offer to sleep in seventh heaven , work spaces and bedrooms provided for member playwrights on the third floor one of the projects he worked on there was joe turner s come and gone it puts sanction on your choice of profession , he said it helps you to identify yourself , to think better of yourself as a dramatist it meant a lot to me help through tough times each year , a few playwrights are chosen to join new dramatists from a field of about 300 applicants , ranging from seasoned professionals to neverproduced writers they send what they consider their two best scripts to an admissions committee , made up of current and former member playwrights and theater professionals , who select writers for sevenyear terms on the basis of talent and promise current members include michael henry brown \( ascension day \) , wendy hammond \( the ghostman \) , quincy long \( the virgin molly \) , donald margulies \( sight unseen \) and suzanlori parks \( imperceptible mutabilities in the third kingdom , the america play \) we try to gauge if new dramatists can help them , said elana greenfield , the director of artistic programs she runs the playwrights' haven with paul slee , who oversees development , and jana jevnikar , who is in charge of administration and finance there may be someone who could have had a hit three years ago who might be writing in a vacuum , she said it s so tough right now it seems that earlier members , once they established themselves , were established for at least 10 years now people are not making a living , even if they had a hit play , and they may not have space to do readings or access to actors the organization offers even more than michaela o'harra envisioned back in 1949 when she breathed life into her idea for a nurturing place in which playwrights could blossom she was assisted by howard lindsay , russel crouse , john golden , oscar hammerstein 2d , moss hart and richard rodgers , with contributions from organizations and individuals creating access i wanted something for playwrights like myself , ms o'harra said in a telephone interview from her home on cape cod she also worked as a newspaper reporter and feature writer and as a play and story editor for the producer mike todd we needed to see a lot of theater , which none of us was able to afford , she said we needed to be able to talk to established people in the theater , to whom we had no access we had no entree , no prestige , nothing but we recognized that as a group we could get these things new dramatists has helped more than 500 writers since then for the last 25 years , its members have made their way to the church at 424 west 44th street , a late 19thcentury building that a former member , june havoc , first spotted as the perfect place for the writers' refuge inside , in addition to the bedrooms , writer s studios and other rooms , are two stages where the playwrights' visions and words are given life in 1991 , the workshop received a special drama desk award for decades of nurturing new american playwrights , an honor that was added to the pulitzer prizes , tony awards and new york drama critics circle awards won by the playwrights who have walked through its doors commitment to the writer the theater has changed a lot since michaela started new dramatists , said ms greenfield , 37 , who has also worked in other capacities at the organization and as an administrator of the dramatic writing program at new york university she was seated in the theatrical library , where the public may go to read unpublished new american plays a lot of theaters have development sections of their own , she said , but they develop plays for possible production , so that the commitment is to the play here , the commitment is to the process , the whole person , the writer it s a commitment to a human being s journey a writer can say 'i need a reading i 've only written 20 pages , but if i ca n't hear it , i ca n't go on' so we do a reading the organization , which has an annual budget of about 500 , 000 , gets by mostly on grants and contributions writers have also donated some of their royalties the money is used to provide a variety of educational programs and career services , including readings of members' plays with professional actors , who in the last few years have included sigourney weaver , kevin kline , olympia dukakis and lucie arnaz
pasadena , calif , july 14 before brazil faced sweden on wednesday , coach carlos alberto parreira was introduced to what should have been a friendly crowd at the rose bowl thousands of fans wore yellow shirts and waved the yellow and green flag of brazil parreira was about to lead brazil to its first world cup final in 24 years he would be hailed as a conquering hero , right \? not a chance as his name was announced , parreira was roundly booed during the game , his face was flashed on the giant television screen at the rose bowl , and he was booed again at about the same time in italy on wednesday , after the italian team had defeated bulgaria to gain its first trip to the world cup finals since 1982 , the rai television network conducted a poll regarding coach arrigo sacchi sixty percent of the respondents said that sacchi s success was based more on luck than skill i do n't care if we win or not , at least not like this , said gennaro suppa , an elementary school teacher from the southern region of calabria this team has n't shown me anything no two world cup coaches have been more successful or less appreciated than parreira of brazil and sacchi of italy both have been vilified by the news media in their countries , ripped by fans , dismissed as ignorant in their choices of players and tactics parreira s lineup choices were questioned by his own mother somehow , despite overwhelming pressure and skepticism , the coaches have ignored the critics and followed their own muse in doing so , they have achieved a personal deliverance , accomplishing the very goal their detractors asserted that they could not reaching the world cup final on sunday i kept my way , instead of succumbing to people who do n't deserve the freedom to criticize , parreira said today the important thing is for sacchi and myself to believe in what we are doing and follow that road until the end i'm happy our way was shown to be the correct way both parreira and sacchi are curious , engaging men , and unlike many american football coaches , they have lives outside their sport parreira is a painter sacchi is an avid reader of politics and economics and of the novels of faulkner and steinbeck for each of the last three years , sacchi has spent a month in the united states , getting to know its customs and traditions in anticipation of the world cup the son of a shoemaker , sacchi was never a great player he rode a slow elevator from the basement of the lowliest italian division to the penthouse as coach of the national team i am accustomed to suffering and accusations and criticism , to people saying , 'you ca n't do this , it ca n't happen , ' sacchi said in an interview in his apartment in milan in late april i 've always been a dreamer experimentation with 73 players there were many who accused sacchi of slipping beyond dreams into delusion he called 73 players up to the national team in his three years as coach what he called experimentation , others labeled as bumbling indecision last fall , guerin sportivo , an italian soccer magazine , ran photos of all 73 and tossed in other shots of pope john paul ii , robin williams as popeye and sylvester stallone as rambo to ridicule sacchi s uncertainty , asking in a mocking headline , arrigo , have you forgotten anyone \? when the azzurri lost by 21 in a spring exhibition against pontedera , a team in italy s fourth division , american oggi , an italianlanguage newspaper published in new jersey , demanded that sacchi be fired before it s too late there was no way he could employ his attacking , pressing style in any coherent manner with only a month s preparation with the national team or so the skeptics believed clearly , they were wrong his glasses forever perched on his balding head , sacchi had proceeded during the world cup like some obsessive chemist , his lineups resembling exotic testtube concoctions by the semifinals , sacchi had already used 20 of his 22 players in different starting arrangements then he shifted the midfield again for bulgaria sometimes , he has simply relied on audacious spontaneity when goalkeeper gianluca pagliuca received a red card against norway , and italy was forced to yank a player , sacchi benched none other than roberto baggio , voted the world s best player in 1993 against mexico , he brought on forward daniele massaro at halftime , and almost immediately massaro delivered a goal against spain , sacchi did not start giuseppe signori , the leading scorer in the italian league signori came on in the second half , though , and made the pass in the 88th minute that sprung baggio for the winning goal similar pressure on parreira parreira , too , has followed his own instinct to great accomplishment , despite relentless criticism in brazil , there is an almost magnetic attractionrepulsion relationship between the national team coach and the ravenous news media in fact , one journalist , joao saldanha , was actually named head coach as brazil prepared for the 1970 world cup he was such a critic that they decided to make him coach , said francisco marcos , the brazilian team liaison saldanha s tenure came to an abrupt halt when he threatened to leave pele off the world cup team , but the point is this journalists think they know as much about soccer as the coach and they are not shy in expressing their opinions and demanding changes parreira has described his job as national coach of brazil as a a compromise , a commitment , a death sentence sometimes parreira , a native of brazil who previously coached kuwait in the 1982 world cup and the united arab emirates in the 1990 world cup , said being brazil s coach in the world cup , this is no fun there s a great deal of responsibility , but no joy at all until you win only two weeks ago , when brazil drew 11 against sweden , the tie was derided as a national tragedy by the brazilian news media pele and brazil president itamar franco suggested lineup changes parreira s mother asked him to use ronaldo , the precocious 17yearold forward parreira suggested that six brazilian teams be allowed to play in the world cup such an arrangement , he said , might please half of the people firstever qualifying loss parreira suffered the indignity of brazil s firstever loss during world cup qualifying a 20 loss to bolivia in la paz but , except for benching the enigmatic midfielder rai something the news media had been urging he has ignored the critics' howling he made the unpopular choice of including defender branco on the world cup roster , and branco scored the winning goal against the netherlands in the quarterfinals when romario became a disciplinary problem , parreira kept him off the national team for nine months until last fall he also ignored romario s calls that his friend edmundo be included on the roster at forward instead of muller since then , romario has quit complaining we brazilians have not recognized the honest work done by parreira , romario said on tuesday the brazilian media should be thankful for parreira to put up with what he has put up with , someone like me , i would n't put up with it imagine that a compliment photo italy coach arrigo sacchi sharing a laugh with reporters yesterday at team s training site in martinsville , nj italians play brazil on sunday \( reuters \)
new orleans , feb 26 even by the standards of a city where politics has long been a brawler s sport , a pair of anonymous antiblack , antisemitic fliers that have circulated in the buildup to the march 5 runoff election for mayor have been particularly nasty the election pits state senator marc morial , 36 , the son of the late ernest \( dutch \) morial , new orleans s first black mayor , against donald mintz , a 50yearold jewish lawyer with a long history of civic leadership and strong ties to the city s blacks perhaps the most bizarre aspect of the fliers incident is the morial campaign s charge that mr mintz , the frontrunner by a narrow margin in recent polls , had campaign workers create and distribute some of the more scurrilous fliers themselves to paint mr mintz as a candidate under siege in an interview , mr mintz denied that he or anyone in his campaign had created the fliers but he conceded that his campaign had mailed copies to thousands of jews throughout the nation along with a fundraising letter that characterized the fliers' racist sentiments as an attack on the stature and security of our community help in raising money the mailing generated more than 200 , 000 in contributions for mr mintz from outside the city , city investigators said as of early february , campaign records showed that his campaign had raised about 650 , 000 in all dr lawrence rubin , executive vice chairman of the national jewish relations advisory council , a group based in new york , said his group had examined the fliers and , based on their language and content , had concluded that they were probably not the work of hate groups people who received the fundraising letter called us , dr rubin said , and we shared with them our reservations and concern , but let them make their own judgment as to how to deal with it but for the morial campaign the conclusion was clear mr mintz selfinflicted a racial wound where there was none , said bob tucker , the campaign chairman for mr morial , and he did it to raise funds nationally the flier that has attracted the most condemnation is titled let s make mintz meat molasses it bears pictures of mr mintz and a man who resembles the south african leader nelson mandela and demands , stop the colored jew coalition and say never to jungle apes christ killers 'unusually nasty' even in this politically jaded city , many find insinuations that the mintz campaign produced such fliers too cynical to believe it s unusually nasty , said mary zervigon , a member of the city s human relations commission it has been going on for months , rather than just a few weeks , and there is this idea of the reverse spin of a candidate attacking himself in these fliers in order to gain some advantage already , a main mintz adviser has been charged with a misdemeanor count accusing him of violating state campaign laws by distributing some of the anonymous fliers this month and mr mintz suffered another setback on friday when an investigation by the commission issued a preliminary report saying that at least two of the fliers originated in the mintz campaign and that a campaign aide was responsible for distributing one flier and trying to distribute the other in the new orleans area still , many in this city of 497 , 000 insist that no one cares about the fliers most people have never seen or read them , said ed renwick , director of the loyola institute of politics he and others said mr mintz was unlikely to lose his nearly solid support among whites , who make up 39 percent of the voters , over charges initiated by the district attorney , who supports mr morial but the analysts said mr mintz could lose support among blacks , who are 61 percent of the voters fear of crime silas lee , a political scientist at xavier university and a pollster , said voters of both races were desperate about crime and the economy as a result , he said , older black voters and middleclass black voters , usually loyal to black candidates , were willing to vote for a white candidate perceived as strong and able to make a difference mr mintz is widely viewed as a man with ideas and the determination to put them into action mr morial , despite his relative youth and perceived inexperience , has basked somewhat in the aura of his father s reputation for assertiveness and savvy and is seen as someone familiar with the tribulations of the city s first black mayor either way , said john maginnis , editor of the louisiana political review , both candidates are seen as an antidote to years of laidback government under the outgoing mayor , sidney barthelemy , who cannot by law seek a third term and who has remained neutral samuel dubois cook , the president of dillard university here and a political scientist , said both candidates were perceived as agents of change who shared prescriptions for curbing crime and diversifying the city s economy as he sat down for lunch recently in the french quarter , mr mintz talked wistfully of his onceproud city , a place now besieged by crime , 37 , 000 abandoned private housing units and a decline in jobs and educational opportunities he envisioned bringing manufacturing jobs to the city and bolstering medical research and training institutions at 10 universities gambling on a casino mr mintz also emphasized the importance of not putting too much of the city s future economic hopes on a recently approved casino he accused past administrations of depending too heavily on the oil and gas money that once flowed into the city mr morial sounded remarkably the same as he addressed a rally on friday night at the lakewood country club in algiers on the west bank of the mississippi river but he also evoked a time when a morial was in city hall and things were better in the racially mixed audience , c w chachere , a white advertising executive , said he had been undecided until a few days ago , when disgust over the fliers had driven him into the morial camp he said he did not care whether mr mintz s campaign had actually created them , but he was angry that it had used them to raise money those fliers scare me , mr chachere said , and i have come to the conclusion that it s morial and not mintz who can use all of the people resources we have in the city photo new orleans s mayoral race has been particulary ugly , with one candidate , donald mintz , left , accused by his rival , marc morial , right , of fabricating a flier intended to portray mr mintz as under fire from hate groups mr mintz and mr morial chatted after a recent

karen horney a psychoanalyst s search for selfunderstanding by bernard j paris illustrated 270 pp new haven yale university press 30 this new biography of karen horney \( 18851952 \) is a rarity of sorts these days a study written expressly to demonstrate its subject s importance , and to subordinate her pathology to her praise in a sense , this is a strange undertaking after all , karen horney \( nee karen danielsen \) has always been considered a leading figure in the early psychoanalytic movement , and she has recently been rediscovered by feminists as a pioneering thinker about sexual differences however , her work lacks a certain intellectual cachet , and bernard j paris believes it has not received the recognition it deserves in karen horney a psychoanalyst s quest for understanding , he argues for her significance as a major theorist , with relevance for many fields today at the same time , mr paris , a professor of english at the university of florida and the founder and director of the international karen horney society , has unearthed troubling material about her personal life , with which he seems somewhat reluctant to grapple fully this gives his book a diffident tone , but mr paris honorably avoids the hagiographic impulse and gives us a valuable and lucid picture of a restless and adventurous mind the outlines of horney s story are well known , most notably from susan quinn s excellent 1987 biography , a mind of her own this leaves mr paris free to concentrate on horney s ideas and their relationship to her inner world in his view , part of horney s gift lay in her powers of selfexploration , and he cites her diaries , letters and the probably autobiographical case of clare in her book selfanalysis \( 1942 \) to show how she transformed psychic turmoil into analytic insight certainly , these documents suggest a great sensitivity to the deeper dynamics of emotion even her youthful diaries , which she kept between the ages of 13 and 26 , show a kind of natural genius for introspection karen danielsen was born near hamburg , germany , in 1885 , the daughter of middleclass parents , and in her childhood was passionately devoted to her mother , sonni , and disdainful of her religious father , wackels , a sea captain , whom she considered a hypocrite who made demands upon others that he did not live up to himself in her journal she made brilliant conjectures about her familial feelings , recorded her mood swings and delved into their causes , speculated about the not quite conscious strata of her emotions and , altogether , seemed to be discovering the psychoanalytic mode of thinking on her own the great injury of horney s youth , mr paris plausibly speculates , was the blatant favoritism shown to her older brother , berndt young karen had to fight hard to be allowed to let her abilities unfold and fight hard she did , both in her adolescence and throughout her life during her years as a medical student , she embarked on a frontal rebellion against bourgeois convention , became involved with a number of men and later conducted her marriage to oskar horney with an openness that would put more recent countercultural experiments to shame none of this , however , was done in a blithe or unrepressed spirit horney was intensely troubled by her driving need for men and her clashing desires for independence and surrender mr paris vividly conveys the acuteness of her conflicts and shows how she used her interpretations of her own history to arrive at fullfledged theoretical formulations once she helped found the berlin psychoanalytic institute in 1920 , after two years of analysis with karl abraham , who was then one of freud s followers , horney confronted freud whom she fundamentally admired on the hotly controversial question of feminine sexuality the arguments were complex , but basically horney contended that little girls' insecurities arose not from an unflattering physiological comparison with men , but from the cultural undervaluation of daughters and of women after horney moved to the united states in 1932 , to become the founding associate director of the chicago psychoanalytic institute , she continued to draw on her own experience , and she extended her investigations of how culture shapes character and gender in such books as the neurotic personality of our time \( 1937 \) later still , in what mr paris calls her mature theory , she tried to elaborate a more universal description of neurosis , which she outlined in neurosis and human growth \( 1950 \) she came up with the notion of basic anxiety to explain the roots of psychological distress , and she gave compelling and subtle descriptions of the various strategies employed by different character types to guard against fears of being unloved horney certainly understood much about the drama of the neurotic soul but by emphasizing the interplay between her life and thought , mr paris also highlights some very disturbing or , depending on the degree of one s sympathy , tragic paradoxes for no matter how much she analyzed herself , horney could not alter the unhappy pattern of her actions according to a cache of interviews , which previous biographers have mostly shied away from , the older horney was by turns timid and arrogant , dictatorial and vindictive her professional problems demotions and acrimonious quarrels at various institutes were undoubtedly caused in part by theoretical differences with what was then a very orthodox psychoanalytic establishment but as testimonies of people who knew her suggest , her behavior surely invited distrust she got involved with men compulsively and took revenge on them when they left her as she did with erich fromm , whose career she actively tried to undermine after their long liaison ended she also became sexually involved with analysands and trainees and then turned on them , with all the unfair advantage of power at her disposal now , these are the kinds of incongruities between principles and behavior with which we are becoming quite familiar , and yet they stubbornly continue to vex us mr paris applies to horney a kind of classical model of the artist , in which the wound of psychic pain is necessary for creativity , and the creation itself places the artist s self above judgment but since a psychoanalyst s identity is her instrument and medium , her character is more crucially implicated in her work were horney s rigidities the result of emotional evasions that might well have had consequences for her theory \? were they caused by the limitations of selfanalysis or analysis \? or by something like bad faith , which finally has to be understood in moral terms \? such questions may not be wholly resolvable , but one wishes that mr paris had occasionally abandoned his stance of careful dispassion and had pressed somewhat harder upon them in the end , mr paris is not entirely successful in convincing us of the contemporary immediacy of horney s ideas she was farsighted in many of her perceptions , and her writing is full of brilliant observations for example , about envy and its discontents , and about the unspoken messages conveyed to the analyst by the analysand mr paris makes particular claims for her emphasis on the adult structure of defenses and for her concept of the real self , prompted partly by her interest in zen but if many of horney s once daring ideas presaged some of the current psychoanalytic approaches , they have been outstripped by more radical developments mr paris believes horney s theoretical importance has been neglected largely because of historical unfairness and the unfashionable accessibility of her work but perhaps what also hampered horney as an influential theorist was the absence of a microscopic perspective , of a close focus on the dense details of psychic operations and on the most primitive layers of self however , horney had a great talent for conveying complicated concepts to a wider public , and she can still be read for interest and pleasure in giving us an overarching survey of her work , mr paris reminds us of its richness , range and sheer intelligence what we are left with is a congenially readable study of a very readable writer and an uneasily divided portrait of a woman who had an impressive ability to transform her subjectivity into her subject and an impressive inability to convert selfknowledge into selfhelp photo karen horney in 1938 \( freddy crevenna from karen horney \)
paris , jan 12 after a yearlong dispute over french sales of jet fighters to taiwan , france and china said today that they would restore friendly relations on the basis of a commitment from the conservative government of prime minister edouard balladur to ban any further arms sales to taiwan with the chinese economy booming and french companies effectively excluded from bidding for contracts there since the decision in november 1992 to sell 60 mirage jets to taiwan , the announcement amounted to a potentially important development for france s recessionhit economy in view of the concerns of the chinese side , the french government has undertaken not to authorize any french enterprises to participate in the arming of taiwan , a joint statement said it added that france recognizes the government of the people s republic of china as the sole legal government of china and taiwan as an integral part of the chinese territory this amounted to a restatement , apparently at chinese insistence , of france s policy when it became the first western country to recognize china in 1964 china has regarded taiwan as a renegade province ever since the nationalists fled to the island in 1949 after losing the chinese civil war taiwan still claims to be the legitimate government of all china taiwan condemned the french decision to ban future arms sales , expressing deep regret over the move and saying security in the asiapacific region would be weakened by it the chinese communists' claim of sovereignty over the taiwan area , and their claim to represent its people , does not correspond to reality , a foreign ministry statement said for its part , beijing said in today s statement that it would welcome participation by french enterprises in competition on the chinese market on an equal footing both sides said they aimed to intensify trade between the two countries after the sale of the mirage 20005 jet fighters to taiwan for about 38 billion , china ordered france to close its consulate in the southern city of guangzhou and banned french companies from participating in a 1 billion subway project there french companies elsewhere in china also complained of a disadvantage with europe still in recession and the chinese economy growing at an annual rate of about 13 percent , the chinese market is important to european companies , a fact underscored by the approximately 4 billion in new contracts secured by german chancellor helmut kohl during a visit to china in november , after the german government vetoed the sale of german warships to taiwan among the contracts secured by mr kohl was the guangzhou subway this means the end of chinese economic sanctions against us , said the french foreign minister , alain juppe relations have been completely normalized and put back on a basis of mutual confidence mr juppe said that the delivery of the mirage jets , a vital sale for the troubled dassault aerospace group , would go forward , but that there would be no further arms sales none of the planes has yet been delivered the chinese side reaffirms that arms sales of any type to taiwan will bring harm to china s sovereignty , security and reunification , and that the chinese government will be firmly opposed to that , the statement said the united states announced in 1992 that it would sell f16 fighters to taiwan although there has been no significant chinese reaction , the government has said it reserves the right to retaliate the warplanes contract with taiwan was approved by france s former socialist government mr balladur has made the restoration of good relations with china a priority since taking office last march the agreement came one day after it was disclosed in washington that a draft state department report has found little progress on human rights in china president clinton will make a decision later this year whether to renew preferential united states trade arrangements with china dependent on the curbing of rights abuses there
washington , july 4 federal reserve policy makers , who begin an eagerly awaited meeting tuesday afternoon , will probably decide after long and spirited debate that the economy is slowing enough that they need not immediately raise shortterm interest rates again this is the view not a consensus so much as a blend of opinion that masks sharp disagreement that emerged late last week from the comments of analysts on wall street and elsewhere in the private sector such an outcome would mean denying the dollar which has been battered of late , particularly against the japanese yen the support of higher rates that would make it and american investments more attractive not a fed priority but defense of the dollar is not often a high priority for the federal reserve , and the clinton administration , which sets general policy on the dollar , so far has made no serious move to shore up the currency in advance of a meeting of the group of seven industrial countries in naples at week s end still , as analysts anticipated the twoday session of the federal open market committee that will plot monetary strategy for the next six weeks and set tentative targets for 1995 , they said they would not be surprised by a rise later this month or at the next meeting of the committee on aug 16 such a rise could come if the economy continues to be thought likely to expand faster than its longterm potential , or should inflation or the expectation of inflation rise the fed could also be moved to act if the dollar plunges in an unarrested slide a weak dollar adds to inflation , probably more than import volume suggests , some analysts say data coming on friday but for now , another force tending to keep the central bank on hold until friday at least is that it is not until then that the most important monthly batch of economic statistics , the labor department s survey of jobs , unemployment , wages and hours , will be published the unemployment rate in this instance , for june is considered a backwardlooking indicator , and the federal reserve is particularly interested these days in looking forward to head off inflation before it becomes evident but analysts will be watching intently to see whether the fourtenths of a point drop in may , to 6 percent , will be sustained the committee meetings that start tuesday will also be the first in which alan s blinder , the princeton economics professor who has just been sworn in as vice chairman of the federal reserve board , will participate mr blinder has been serving on the president s council of economic advisers , and analysts expect his influence , though probably not immediately visible , to be on behalf of holding rates steady i would say no , said barry rogstad , an economist who is president of the american business conference , a group of fastgrowing companies , of the prospect of a rate rise this week i'm just not seeing where there s inflation potential there 'almost inconceivable' but robert t falconer , a longtime fed official who is now senior vice president at aubrey g lanston company , a wall street firm specializing in government securities , expressed the strongest conviction that the fed would not increase rates it s almost inconceivable that they would move at this meeting , he said , pointing to aggressive halfpoint increases in both the federal funds and discount rates , to 4 1 4 and 3 1 2 percent , respectively , on may 17 that day , the open market committee raised the rate on federal funds immediately after its meeting the five committee members who make up the fed board adjourned to the office of the chairman , alan greenspan , and raised the discount rate at that time , mr falconer noted , the fed declared that its actions substantially remove the stimulus that low rates had long provided mr falconer and other analysts pointed to definite , though not unmixed , signs that the economy is slowing well before this year s rate increases take full effect the fed had raised the funds rate by a quarter point in february , march and april , moves that mostly pushed longterm rates up as well , even though they were intended to push long rates lower angell urges a big rise the polar opposite view to mr falconer s is represented by wayne d angell , who as a federal reserve governor until early this year was one of the strongest antiinflation hawks he is now chief economist at bear , stearns company in a letter to clients last week , while making it clear his was not a forecast but a recommendation , mr angell pointed to sharp price increases for various commodities and a continued high gold price as evidence of marked increase in inflation ahead and called on the fed to boldly raise rates this week by threequarters of a point he told clients that the fed needs to take dramatic action to reassure the holders of dollars , both in the united states and abroad , that it is committed to the path of price stability most economists , however , seemed to believe the fed was likely to take either minimal action or none at all this meeting is a 5050 proposition , ventured john mueller , chief economist at lehrman bell mueller cannon inc in arlington , va he noted that futures markets now reflect hedging against a small rise , which mr mueller said could come at either the july or august meetings friday brought the latest signal of an economic slowdown ahead the government s index of leading , or predictive , indicators was unchanged for a second straight month in may and the nation s purchasing managers reported slightly reduced growth in manufacturing for june urging a steady policy at the same time , however , factories paid higher prices to suppliers , pushing the group s index to the highest point in nearly six years this could count more heavily with the federal reserve , analysts said , than the labor department s report that imports excluding petroleum rose a scant twotenths of a percent in may mr mueller agreed with the overwhelming sentiment among economists that the fed neither would nor should subordinate domestic factors to the plight of the dollar and stuart g hoffman , chairman of an american bankers association advisory panel , said , to raise it next week if they were reacting to the dollar would not be something we 're recommending another voice for a steady policy this week is marilyn schaja , money market economist at donaldson , lufkin jenrette absent foreign exchange considerations , no immediate policy shift is in the offing , she advised clients , citing three reasons the fed would not do so for the dollar alone it would roil stock and bond markets around the world with no certain benefit to the dollar , whose slide , in any event , does not appear inflationary on a tradeweighted basis what is more , ms schaja contended , any significant increase in interest rates at this juncture carries considerable risk for the united states economy the situation is an agonizing one for the fed , said david b bostian jr , chief economist at herzog , heine , geduld mr bostian predicted a contentious meeting with a 5545 percent likelihood that the fed committee would decide the economy was strong enough to justify a small rate increase
in a sweeping realignment of the television industry , fox inc announced yesterday that it would form a new alliance with a broadcast station group that would result in the defection of eight important cbs stations to fox cbs , which had already seen fox steal away the rights to broadcast national football league games that cbs had held for four decades , now faces the further humbling exercise of having to seek new and probably weaker affiliates in many of the nation s biggest cities , including dallas , detroit , cleveland and atlanta three abc stations and one nbc station will also switch to fox under the terms of the agreement with new world communications group inc , a company whose controlling shareholder is ronald o perelman , the chairman and chief executive of revlon group inc fox accomplished its move , which clearly took the other networks by surprise , by pledging to invest 500 million in new world , which owns seven television stations and has plans to acquire eight more twelve of those 15 would switch their affiliations to fox in exchange , fox would initiate a partnership with new world to produce and syndicate programming for both of the station groups , as well as for other stations fox has affiliates in all 12 cities , but they are less desirable stations with weaker signals by luring older , stronger stations in those markets , fox is , in effect , trading up the federal communications commission , had no official comment on fox s move an agency spokeswoman said the commission was surprised by the announcement the fox network had its beginnings only in 1986 it lacks the distinguished news operations and rich entertainment history of cbs , nbc and abc but fox s owner and chairman , rupert murdoch , has been moving the network toward equal status with those competitors , and yesterday s move was his boldest yet we are getting closer to parity , mr murdoch said in a telephone interview we are about threequarters of the way there anthony c malara , president of cbs s affiliate relations division , said he was stunned when he received the news in a phone call yesterday morning from william c bevins , chief executive of new world mr malara said he asked mr bevins in disbelief , what are you doing \? mr malara spent much of yesterday calling stations in the cities affected by the change it s a big blow , he acknowledged but it s not armageddon he promised that cbs would have new affiliates in each city , though he said that many might have to be weaker uhf ultrahighfrequency stations , those with channel positions above 13 the announcement by fox yesterday set up a scramble for new relationships between networks and affiliates , suddenly making precarious the partnerships that date to the beginning of the television era in detroit , for example , the current fox affiliate has been owned by paramount communications , recently acquired by viacom inc , which is in the process of starting its own network that station had been expected to stay with fox now it is likely to align itself with its parent company if that station is not available , cbs will then have to seek a different affiliate in detroit perhaps the one now linked with nbc similar turmoil could arise in many cities affected by fox s move contracts between a network and its affiliates are for a short period , usually a year or two , and can be broken by either party upon expiration because of that , fox officials said yesterday that they thought they could have all 12 new affiliates in place within 18 months , some of them by fall cbs was known to be concerned already about new world s practices , since many of its stations had begun preempting cbs programs like its morning news but the switch to fox will surely be seen in the industry as another sign of the ascendancy of that network which is still not even formally defined as a network by the federal communications commission mainly at the expense of cbs with the new world stations , fox will improve its total of veryhighfrequency stations to about 40 percent of the network , from just 25 percent these vhf stations , found from channels 2 to 13 are most desirable to broadcasters higher ratings likely those totals are likely to translate into improved ratings for fox , while cbs , depending on which stations it is able to secure in the affected cities , could sustain serious damage to its programs across the board in a typical season , cbs s overall primetime rating would be about a 12 , compared with about a 7 for fox each rating point represents 942 , 000 homes among the programs most likely to be affected is the cbs evening news , which will lose leadins from established local stations in big cities the fox stations usually have limited local newscasts and almost none produce an evening local newscast cbs could also be hurt in latenight programming its late show with david letterman will be compelled to follow newscasts or syndicated reruns that are likely to be rated far lower than those on the stations that are abandoning cbs
london , feb 3 there is a deep wellspring of anxiety in government circles here these days it comes from the fear that the united states no longer cares about britain this week s bout of jitters comes from the white house decision to grant a temporary visa to gerry adams , the irish republican leader but that is only the latest and most dramatic instance in what is seen as almost a yearlong series of slurs and slights from washington british governments are accustomed to new american administrations coming into office infatuated with the political throwweight of the germans or casting a covetous eye at commercial possibilities in asia it happened with ronald reagan and it happened even more with george bush , according to lady thatcher s memoirs but sooner or later , the thinking goes , the yanks will get in a tight spot somewhere , maybe with a dictator like col muammar elqaddafi or saddam hussein , or maybe in a dispute with other european countries , and when they need help for a little police or diplomatic action , they will find out who their real friends are a special relationship' then they will come home again that transatlantic phone link that tied churchill to roosevelt will start humming again , and the special relationship , as churchill called it , will be alive and well except this time , with the clinton administration , it is not turning out that way things have even reached the point where prime minister john major has trouble getting president clinton on the line when he called to congratulate him on the passage of nafta in november , a senior government official admitted sheepishly at the time , he could not rouse him \( though some days later mr clinton called back \) now the two men who would seem to have a lot in common they are roughly the same generation , both self made and from modest beginnings but these days they rarely talk at all perhaps once a month , ventured a british official , who pointed out that they had just seen each other , along with the other heads of state , at the nato summit meeting in january us ambassador summoned on tuesday , mr major summoned the american ambassador , raymond seitz , to 10 downing street to express his displeasure at the visa for mr adams , a diplomatic move virtually unknown in recent memory though there has been a flurry of communications through the embassies and through the foreign secretary , douglas hurd who was in washington this week and had what a senior official here called a lively meeting with the national security adviser , anthony lake , who favored giving the visa the two top leaders still have not been in contact to defuse the ill will the problem , said one person involved in the back and forth , is not that we have substantive differences or hugely competing policies on northern ireland the problem is that it is an issue which means very little in the united states , whereas on this side it has tremendous salience , he said it matters to the prime minister , who is politically exposed because of his joint declaration with the irish government , he continued it matters to the press it matters to parliament and so , he said , in acting unilaterally and against british wishes that were clearly spelled out in advance , it was as if washington was saying none of that really counts to us an opening sour note' relations with the clinton administration began over a year ago on what an official in 10 downing street conceded on wednesday was a sour note he was referring to the discovery that strategists from mr major s conservative party were working in the presidential campaign advising the republicans then there were news reports that the british home office had agreed to search through its files to see if there were any documents on mr clinton from his years as a rhodes scholar at oxford and an antivietnam war protester what was presumably being looked for was any application to change his nationality , which would have instantly dashed his campaign there was even a report of an unfortunate private cablegram sent on election day from mr hurd , a seasoned and patrician diplomat , to james a baker 3d , whom he had come to know well as secretary of state he used a hunting metaphor to wish him good luck may you bring down every duck in the last flight of the shoot does clinton bear a grudge \? now , british officials are wondering if these ducks are coming home to roost is it possible , a top diplomat wondered , that mr clinton really bears a grudge and enjoys sending little darts in mr major s direction \? they do not have to search very hard to find a disconcerting pattern , including public statements from washington that grate on britain s sensitivities by making it feel like just any other country only three months ago secretary of state warren christopher said europe was no longer the dominant area of the world at the same time mr clinton gave an interview in which he attacked britain and france over bosnia and singled out mr major with an embarrassing aside mr major had confessed privately to him , the president said , that he could not support lifting the bosnian arms embargo because his government might fall if he did
washington , may 25 officially , the house committee on ways and means is making its way through the various alternatives for health care restructuring unofficially , it is struggling to deal with one of the most painful rituals on capitol hill the slow fall of a public man each day , the masses of reporters and photographers inside the committee room grow larger , the lobbyists in the corridors less discreet as they talk about the passing of the man they feared and cultivated for 13 years each morning , dan rostenkowski bounds in to take the chairman s seat , trying another performance of businessasusual but each time he moves , or confers with a colleague , or engages in a quasimetaphorical gesture like biting his nails , he hears the whir of a dozen motor drives and looks up with a jolt to a wall of photographers in such moments , he looks haunted , trapped in his own committee room it is part of the code of this political death by inches a process that dragged on for months with jim wright , the speaker of the house who was forced to resign in 1989 that one s friends and colleagues try to avoid acknowledging the obvious i cannot discuss the possibility of the tragic loss of my chairman , said representative charles b rangel of harlem , the fourthranking democrat on the committee while there s a lot of speculation , i 've always felt it s as if i 've got a friend with a serious health problem and i'm preparing for his funeral i ca n't do it this is an emotional reality that is lost outside the clannish , closetheranks world of the committee s democrats we need the chairman now more than ever , representative john lewis , democrat of georgia , said loyally and protectively mr rangel , edging away from the cameras , said at one point this week you 're talking about a life , a family , a guy without a blemish on his legislative career but the news is not the good one does amid such emotions , any speculation about mr rostenkowski s successor if mr rostenkowski is indicted or reaches a plea agreement is done very , very carefully the rules of the house democratic caucus are clear enough , dating back to the abscam investigation in 1979 and 1980 if indicted on a felony charge that carries a sentence of more than two years , a chairman must relinquish his seat and the next most senior democrat becomes the acting chairman by this rule , representative sam m gibbons of florida would succeed mr rostenkowski since these are caucus rules , however , they can be changed by the democratic caucus and an election could be held for the position of acting chairman an election would also be held if mr rostenkowski resigns and there is an official vacancy in the chairmanship still , the principle of seniority remains strong in the house perhaps most importantly , it is given high priority by mr rangel , who is widely viewed as the most powerful potential challenger to mr gibbons mr rangel has indicated that he will not oppose mr gibbons but would protect his seniority if someone lower on the totem pole gets into the race mr gibbons prefaces his comments with a defense of mr rostenkowski he is innocent in the eyes of the law and in my eyes , he said , going on to predict that there would be no struggle over succession one of the things we do up here on capitol hill is touch base , he said and i 've been touching base a rumor is denied the rumors continue to ripple through the house , however the majority leader , richard a gephardt , shot one down today , denying that the democratic leadership was planning to install him in some capacity on the committee if mr rostenkowski leaves other lawmakers simply refuse to talk to reporters about a possible succession , among them representative robert t matsui of california , another committee democrat widely regarded as a potential challenger a spokeswoman said tonight that mr matsui was not waging a campaign for the chairmanship this anxiety is only stoked by the thought of a leadership change as congress is considering the biggest domestic legislation since social security none of us knows how to live through this , said one democrat who is not a member of the committee at the moment , members are not actually voting on a health care bill that phase was pushed back because the congressional budget office is so far behind on its financial analyses but after the memorial day recess , the clock truly begins to count down on health care reform if the main committees do not move a bill in june , the chances of getting comprehensive legislation this year are very , very dim democrats on the committee say they will rise to the challenge representative benjamin l cardin of maryland , another democrat on the committee , said this week , this committee not only has a talented leader but a strong membership we 'll meet the deadlines that need to be met mr rostenkowski s allies also insist that so far he has maintained his focus on the work it s not slowed down , said representative steny h hoyer of maryland , chairman of the house democratic caucus things are slowed down by policy reasons mr rostenkowski , who denies any wrongdoing , was in the meeting of democratic leaders with president clinton this afternoon , grousing about the delays of the congressional budget office , participants said he has presided over the questions and debates this week , as members make their way through the various health care plans , occasionally chiding them for dragging their feet but as the committee made its way through the arcana of medicare part c and the like , it is hard to avoid the real drama playing out , the climax of a twoyear investigation into accusations that mr rostenkowski misused his office expense accounts the members themselves seemed rattled this morning it was clearly depressing to see all those photographers there , mr cardin said later depressing and morbid to see the sudden interest in getting a picture at this point the motor drives whirred on photo the house ways and means committee is struggling to work on health care at the same time that it deals with the slow fall of its longtime chairman , dan rostenkowski , democrat of illinois mr rostenkowski s staff assistant , tim crippen , whispered to him during a committee hearing yesterday \( reuters \) \( pg d21 \)
charleston , sc , sept 13 it s not very often that there are second chances in life and lesser still are the odds that a race boat left adrift in the atlantic ocean , upside down and with its skipper lost at sea , would have the opportunity to sail again but the yacht coyote , the aborted dream of the late mike plant , has been resurrected in a bold move to see plant s lost vision realized , his former fiancee has retrieved the 60foot yacht , restored it to racing readiness and chartered it to david scully , a solo sailor from chicago on saturday , coyote is scheduled to be one of 20 sailboats leaving from here in the boc challenge , the singlehanded yacht race around the world named after the boc group , the british gas products company that sponsors the competition , the ninemonth race will take the fleet of lone sailors through 27 , 000 miles of open ocean and three stopover ports faster and mightier the new coyote is a mightier version of the boat that capsized in october 1992 outfitted with hightech sails that are translucent and silver rather than opaque and white , the race boat moves through the water like a sea bird after prey the restored version has a mast that is 87 feet high , 2 feet higher than before the change provides more sail area and has made the boat faster than when plant had it beyond that , the yacht s new skipper , schooled in the unparalleled traditions of french offshore racing , is lean , smart , confident and harddriving the 39yearold scully has lived in the seacoast town of la trinite , france , for the last five years he has raced maxiyachts around buoys , catamarans around islands , and trimarans across oceans but he has never raced a thoroughbred sloop around the world i think the boc is the ultimate singlehanded race , scully said in a recent interview you do n't know if you will ever have the opportunity to do it but if you do , you have to go for it although still in search of a sponsor , scully has tapped private funds to get started the quadrennial competition has tested the mettle of scores of yachtsmen before scully but none since the inaugural competition in 198283 has set off on an emotional tidal wave as forceful as the one brought on by coyote the boat was built for another world yacht race , the vendee globe challenge , in 1992 but on the way from new york to the start of the race in france , coyote lost the 8 , 200pound bulb on its keel , a ballast appendage that keeps the boat upright when underway plant , a 41yearold sailor who lived in jamestown , ri , disappeared in the mishap a three week , milliondollar search turned up only the overturned hull about 700 miles southwest of ireland it was a ghostly sight for those who had worked feverishly to help the charismatic sailor in the final days of his preparations settlement from builder plant s fiancee , helen davis , agreed to abandon coyote at sea when it was confirmed that plant was not on board but two months later , coyote was sighted floating near the irish coast , prompting davis to rethink her decision she hired a tugboat and retrieved the yacht she had helped launch davis shipped the battered hull back to rhode island , where inquiries over the missing ballast bulb turned heartbreak into blame last year , davis received an outofcourt settlement from coyote s builder , concordia custom yachts , of south dartmouth , mass she took the money , an undisclosed sum , and used it to give the boat new life i did n't want the boat to sit there , and i did n't want to put my life on hold , davis said about her decision to restore coyote the halfmilliondollar rehabilitation , part of which was subsidized with the charter fee paid by scully , took most of last spring rodger martin yacht designs of newport , ri , which created the original lines for coyote , agreed to work on the project in concert with scully the boat was fitted with a new bulb , whose attachment was engineered this time with exacting precision by stephen koopman , a naval architect from martin s office some risk remains results of a coast guard inquiry on coyote s 1992 keel accident are pending there may be several reasons for the mishap , not the least of which was plant s running out of money at a time when the final work was being done he had also run the yacht aground several times , immersing the allimportant ballast bulb in mucky sea bottoms before leaving on his voyage but even with the rebuilt boat , the element of risk remains in all these things , you 're pushing the edge , martin said for singlehanded sailors , it is exciting and frightening about doing things on the edge that s why they 're attracted to the sport it s a matter of risk and reward even the new coyote has had a scrape during a 2 , 000mile qualifying voyage last month , the boat collided at night with a fishing vessel about 175 miles east of nantucket island coyote s bowsprit , a forward appendage for attaching sails , was knocked off the fishing boat had a sixinch hole in its side the coast guard said it had not yet determined blame some see a curse this second incident has added to the superstitious nature of people who go to sea you 'd never get me on that boat , is a fairly common refrain along the waterfront of newport , where two years ago coyote set sail for the first time sailors in general tend to be easily spooked about their boats , enough to fill maritime folklore with woeful tales of craft whose luck went bad neither scully nor davis have time for such chatter and others close to coyote say the banter is nonsense so many boats have a history , martin said they get dismasted , they get hurt but people with spirit put them back together again and sail them if you do something with a boat , something happens but if you do n't do anything , nothing happens boc officials maintain that seaworthiness is a major concern in the race but in coyote s case , more than one thing went wrong to compromise plant s safety his electronics had given out midway across the atlantic and a brief signal from his onboard emergency radio beacon was misinterpreted by ground stations 'he was n't ready' in hindsight , officials said , plant had failed to register the beacon , a formality that might have increased his chances for survival but , short on cash and long on deadline pressure , he left things undone the fact of the matter , mark schrader , boc s race director , said recently , mike was n't in the race he was on his way to the race , and he was n't ready no changes were made to boc s 1994 rules for seaworthiness as a result of the plant accident schrader said that the rebuilt coyote has passed its prerace safety check with flying colors the boat looks very well prepared , he said everything was in order , and there were no deficiencies or lastminute panic in this race , the top boats look equally matched , including coyote , schrader said of course , luck is always involved , he said but

the titanic bombardment of jupiter by a dying comet rained more mountainsize fragments on the giant planet yesterday , and new pockmarks and blemishes proliferated on its cloudcovered face although astronomers were unsure whether the bombardment would continue as violently as it began on saturday , astronomers at observatories around the world hoped that each fresh cometary explosion would reveal hitherto concealed details of the planet s structure towering plumes of debris and hot gas were rising from the jovian cloud tops every few hours , and to observers familiar with the planet s normal appearance , jupiter has begun to look like a battlefield analysis of the light emitted by these plumes will permit chemical analysis of the gases within them , throwing light on the chemical composition of both jupiter and the comet observatories and even amateur astronomers in many parts of the world have been treated to a lowkey but scientifically spectacular show since fragment a of comet shoemakerlevy 9 hurtled into jupiter late saturday even though none of the 21 expected impacts of the fragmented comet are directly visible from earth , their aftereffects become visible as jupiter rotates and each impact point swings around to face earth the bombardment will last until friday and is expected to furnish scientists with a mine of information about the inner structure of jupiter , the composition of comets and the dynamics of planetary impacts fragment a , which was estimated to be about one mile in diameter , hit jupiter about 4 06 pm eastern time on saturday , and this was followed by fragment b about 11 pm , and fragment c at 3 am yesterday the disruption of the jovian atmosphere and other effects of all three were seen by many observatories three more fragments were expected to hit yesterday , and fragment g , believed to be the largest , was expected to hit at 3 28 am today jupiter is so far away that it takes light from the planet nearly 48 minutes to reach earth at this distance , no features of the planet s surface are visible to the naked eye , and even large telescopes see the damage caused by the comet impacts mostly as small , dark spots but to astronomers , the abrupt appearance of fresh wounds on jupiter s colorful face is cause for celebration , proving that despite the naysayers shoemakerlevy 9 is not a dud the tension mounted on saturday as observatories awaited the first impact astronomers had sharply disagreed in their estimates of the size of the comet , some saying it was about six miles in diameter , others arguing that it was less than one mile in diameter depending on which of these extremes was closest to the truth , the bombardment might be spectacular or virtually invisible gloomy first report the first reported observation was gloomy just after fragment a hit , astronomers at the sutherland observatory in south africa said they had seen the fragment disappear but without any apparent effect on jupiter this seemed to confirm the gloomiest forecasts many astronomers had accepted the possibility that comet shoemakerlevy 9 , which was pulled apart into 21 fragments on july 8 , 1992 , would hit jupiter with no visible effects but almost simultaneously on saturday evening , reports arrived from the big observatory at la palma in the canary islands and the european southern observatory at cerro la silla in northern chile both spoke of gigantic plumes of white hot gas and debris rising from an impact site that swept into view a few minutes after fragment a hit at the site itself , a dark spot had appeared as computers on earth began to decipher data arriving from the orbiting hubble space telescope , images appeared that brought cheers and champagne toasts by astronomers at the space telescope science institute in baltimore , the operations center for the telescope team the dark spot opened in jupiter s atmosphere by fragment a was clearly visible in these images \( although it was dwarfed by the planet s great red spot a semipermanent atmospheric feature the size of earth \) hubble scientists also reported a darkened region surrounding the impact spot that appeared to extend for more than 7 , 000 miles impact not seen directly none of the hundreds of telescopes watching jupiter can see the impacts themselves only the jupiterbound spacecraft galileo is in position to observe and photograph the back side of jupiter , and galileo is a long distance from the action because of a broken antenna , galileo will take about two months to transmit its first pictures to earth but at least one observatory , the wise observatory in israel , may have seen a flash , said dr james scotti of the university of arizona , who was observing there at 4 06 pm a distinct brightening occurred near the edge of jupiter , and at 4 18 pm , a huge plume came into view as the planet rotated even a team of amateurs in miami , jeff beisch , carl hernandez and don parker , were able to use a relatively small telescope to observe and make images of jupiter s new spot soon after it appeared as time went on , night fell over more of the world s great observatories so they could observe jupiter , which rotates every 9 hours 56 minutes , bringing each impact site into view again and again a faint bright spot among the first telescopes to see the second impact , that of fragment b , at about 10 56 pm saturday , was the keck telescope atop mauna kea mountain in hawaii , the largest telescope in the world dr imke de pater , head of one of the keck observing teams , said that soon after the moment of impact , a faint bright spot appeared on jupiter s eastern edge the keck telescope , which contains a focusing mirror 33 feet in diameter , made electronic images of the spot every four seconds , creating a kind of movie of the action but she reported that the spot had faded out by 11 13 pm dr de pater said her group had also observed clear , bright spots in jupiter s cloud system corresponding to the impacts of fragment a and fragment c , which hit at about 3 am yesterday the keck is observing impact sites using seven different colored filters , each one corresponding to the kind of light emitted by different compounds the bright spots were clearly visible in the wavelengths of light emitted at high altitudes of jupiter s atmosphere in the methane bands , bands where significant amounts of methane are components but when filters were used to explore the deeper layers of the atmosphere , no signs of impacts appeared this may mean that the fragments exploded high in the jovian atmosphere and never reached the deeper layers dr de pater added that her group tried to photograph a possible brightening of jupiter s faint ring by light reflected from the impact of fragment c until the data from the digital image are analyzed , however , it will not be known whether the ring brightened although astronomers believe they have a generally correct view of jupiter s structure , many of its details remain mysteries jupiter is immense its radius at the equator is 44 , 308 miles \( earth s radius is 3 , 961 miles \) the planet is believed to have a rocky core about the size of earth , surrounded by a thick layer of solid hydrogen that is crushed to metallic form by the great weight of the atmosphere above it the atmosphere is thought to consist mostly of hydrogen , mixed in places with methane , ammonia , some water vapor and compounds of sulfur and other substances that tint the planet s bands and swirls with red , orange , yellow and blue photo the stages of the plume of comet shoemakerlevy 9 , top , as it hit jupiter the break in the planet s cloud cover after impact , above \( photographs by nasa \)

united nations , oct 15 after a day of intense debate marked by a long standoff between russia and the united states , the security council tonight unanimously adopted a resolution condemning iraq for its recent troop deployments near the kuwaiti border and warning baghdad against future hostile actions the vote was 15 for the resolution and none opposed russia supported the measure , althout it said the council had acted hastily on a day when in the words of one diplomat a blast from the cold war was felt in the security council for the first time in recent years , the united states resisted russian manuevers to include a positive statement in the resolution s preamble about saddam hussein s promise to recognize kuwait made thursday in baghdad to the russian foreign minister american officials said that a resolution intended to castigate president hussein for threatening the persian gulf region was no place to reward president hussein for what the clinton administration and its allies see as only a vague statement of iraqi intentions apparently made in the hope of getting sanctions eased in the end , the american and russian delegates were able to agree on compromise language that noted president hussein s pledge and in a very general way welcomed all international efforts involved in defusing recent tensions the resolution not only condemns the iraqi troop deployments but also demands that all those forces be returned to their original bases and that iraq not move troops south again or deploy them in any other hostile or provocative manner to threaten neighbors or united nations operations in iraq a section of the resolution s preamble warns iraq of serious consequences for any failure to meet the demands beyond differences over the language of the resolution , the clinton administration was reported to be annoyed that the russian foreign minister , andrei v kozyrev , went to baghdad to in effect negotiate with president hussein on the recognition of kuwait and the lifting of sanctions when the need of the moment was for a speedy iraqi withdrawal from regions near the kuwaiti border americans here reject all efforts to link the two separate issues the united states also compromised on several points today to gain as much backing as possible among the security council s 15 members a demand that iraq notify the secretary general two weeks in advance of unusual or potentially alarming troop movements was dropped from the resolution that paragraph , proposed by britain , was opposed by france and several other countries questions were raised about the precedent of instituting international controls over troop movements within national borders and about the practical problems of enforcement , western diplomats said when the council convened this morning , there were at least seven modifications on the table for consideration several apparently came from the russian delegation although russia s deputy chief delegate , vasiliy s sidorov , told reporters here today that his delegation would prefer to vote on the resolution early next week , when foreign minister kozyrev arrives here after his persian gulf tour , the russians were in the middle of negotiations on a range of issues reopened for debate we are very much delighted that russia joined seriously in discussing the draft , mohammad a abulhasan , kuwait s representative here , said in an interview during a break in security council consultations but he added that kuwait had felt strongly about getting some kind of clause on early warning of iraqi troop movements into the draft mr abulhasan said he thought by the end of the morning s consultations , the possibility of a russian veto had receded considerably but by later afternoon , the situation had been reversed as only one issue the paragrpah in the preamble , was left unresolved the iraqis are sending deputy prime minister tariq aziz back to the united nations on sunday , and there is speculation here that he will bring more concilatory messages from president hussein to bolster pledges on the recognition of kuwait that he was reported to have made to mr kozyrev this week six nations cosponsored the resolution the united states , britain , france , argentina , oman and rwanda the last three hold rotating council seats , along with brazil , the czech republic , djibouti , new zealand , nigeria , pakistan and spain the council s permanent members , in addition to the united states and britain , are france , china and russia as talks went on in new york , a united nations nuclear weapons inspection team was in iraq to carry out monitoring of iraqi wepaons as called for in security council resolutions the team , headed by a briton , garry dillon , was planning to work in iraq for about ten days , united nations spokesman said in bahrain rolf ekeus , the head of the special commission established by the security council to monitor and control iraqi weapons programs , told diplomats and officials here last week about iraqi threats not to cooperate with inspections if sanctions against iraq remained in place so far there have been no incidents involving inspectors , however a tenmember team checking for possible biological weapons returned to bahrain from baghdad friday saying that they had been given full support by the government of president hussein chart an agenda iraq resolution lists points of inclusion won by the united states in a resolution on iraq adopted by the united nations security council
perhaps the best thing that can be said about the second quarter is that it s over given the tough sledding for stock funds , we all should have indexed the s p 500 and gone on vacation for three months , said john rekenthaler , editor of morningstar mutual funds and one of five experts who created hypothetical retirement portfolios for the new york times a year ago vanguard s s p index fund rose fourtenths of a percent in the last three months , compared with a 25 percent decline for the average diversified domestic equity fund , according to morningstar inc in chicago three of the five hypothetical portfolios lost money this quarter , though none more than 2 percent eric kobren of insight management , in wellesley , mass , was the best performer , gaining about 1 percent since tracking began on july 7 , 1993 , sheldon jacobs , who edits the noload fund investor , in irvington , ny , still leads the five fund experts , with a gain of 116 percent , compared with a 531 percent gain for the lipper average of all equity funds the portfolio performance , tracked quarterly by lipper analytical services inc in summit , nj , excludes transaction costs , sales charges and taxes the five experts can shift money quarterly , although the portfolios are intended to grow for 20 years mr rekenthaler plans to take advantage of market weakness he is increasing his portfolio s risk on the theory that highrisk funds have been so down in the trenches this year that they are due for a rebound echoing that approach , mr jacobs is bailing out of a couple of highrisk funds that have not been up to snuff , but plowing the money back into funds with similar risk under different management mr rekenthaler replaced fidelity balanced fund with fidelity global balanced , which has the same manager he described the action as shifting a little further along the risk curve by buying a fund that is similarly structured but which owns more overseas companies , smallercap stocks and somewhat riskier bonds he also swapped 10 percent of his holdings in scudder global for columbia special , to add some smallcap and technology stock exposure to the portfolio part of mr rekenthaler s relatively strong performance this quarter came from a stake in vanguard specialized energy , up 78 percent the fund had sharp losses late last year and early this year , severely crimping his cumulative return finally , he said , it filled its role as a hedge against rising interest rates mr jacobs is replacing pbgh growth fund , which fell 126 percent last quarter , with the montgomery growth fund if you hold on long term it will be fine , he said , but i'm worried about nearterm volatility besides pbgh growth , mr jacobs is dropping fidelity emerging markets , which recently added a 3 percent sales load , because he shuns funds with such charges for a replacement , he chose lexington worldwide emerging markets fund the allfidelity portfolio developed by mr kobren was pulled along mostly by its big stake in the fidelity value fund the fund s strong performance this quarter \( up 37 percent \) comes from health , commodity and financial services stocks , plus some japanese shares , he said but the shortterm bond fund , which excelled last year because of its emerging markets debt , stumbled this year sharp declines in that debt , plus rising interest rates , took a heavier toll than expected , mr kobren said even though most of the damage is probably done , he is shifting that money into the fidelity canada fund , a bet on rising commodity prices nearly half that fund is devoted to energy and basic industries harold evensky and jack a brill made no changes
hollywood , sept 5 movie ratings seem like taxes necessary but a source of irritation and anger within the last few days , debate over the 26yearold film rating system has taken a particularly nasty turn i 've had a maalox moment on this latest goround , said jack valenti , chairman of the motion picture association of america , the movie industry s lobbying arm , which controls the ratings classification board and is now locked in an angry dispute with the creators of a new film , jason s lyric , about black teenagers in houston mr valenti s maalox moment includes accusations of racism against the ratings board , which mr valenti furiously denies the board insisted on the deletion of some sexual scenes and a change in the movie s promotion poster before it would rate the film r instead of nc17 beyond this there are persistent charges that the ratings board is far more critical of films with sexual content than of those with gory violence that the board allows itself to be bullied by big studios but deals aggressively with less powerful independent companies , and that it seems far more horrified about foul language in films than about foul and murderous behavior the classifications and ratings board of the motion picture association of america was founded in 1968 to replace the archaic and prudish hays production code , which controlled the sexual content of movies for decades the board s classifications were created , with the endorsement of theater owners , as guidelines for parents the 5 categories over the years , those ratings evolved into five categories g , for general audiences , usually cartoons and children s films pg , meaning parental guidance is suggested and some material may be unsuitable for younger children pg13 , meaning parents are strongly cautioned and some material may be inappropriate for children under 13 r , restricted , people under 17 must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian , and nc17 , a relatively new rating , meaning no one under 17 is admitted independent film companies also have the option of releasing unrated films , but studios who are part of the association are obliged to adhere to its rulings the 13member ratings board is headed by richard m mosk , a los angeles lawyer the names of the other members , all in the los angeles area , are secret barbara dixon , a spokeswoman for the association , said they are all parents and represent a diverse mixture of ethnic and economic groups perhaps the criticism most often heard about the ratings board is that studiomade action films , which are often loaded with violence , rarely encounter problems even basic instinct , one of the most aggressively violent and sexual studiomade films in years , was given an r rating but film makers depicting sexual situations that seem believable \( unlike basic instinct \) are often told to delete certain scenes double standards apply , said doug mchenry , the director of jason s lyric the ratings system has a proclivity for violence over sex other critics add that double standards exist even in terms of sex the ratings board strongly objected to male frontal nudity in bruce willis s recent film called color of night and deletions were made in the film but female nudity , as in basic instinct and short cuts , is not so objectionable to the board contrasting cases the latest case in the violence versus sex issue involves oliver stone s natural born killers , which was given an r rating the rating , which delighted warner brothers , which produced the film and is a supporter of the association , came only after mr stone made many cuts one of them was a scene in which prison inmates decapitate a warden , played by tommy lee jones , and carry his head on a stick even without that particular bit of gore , however , natural born killers is one of the bloodiest commercial films in decades on the other hand , the ratings board unexpectedly gave an nc17 to clerks , a comedy that was a prize winner this year at the sundance and cannes film festivals because some video companies like blockbuster refuse to buy nc17 movies and some theatrical chains decline to show them , the rating is considered an economic death sentence the reason for the rating \? the film focuses on two teenage boys working at a convenience store in new jersey , and their dialogue is often crude miramax , the producer , is appealing the decision on the film , which is set to open on oct 21 mr valenti , speaking by telephone the other day from venice , where he is attending the city s film festival , defended the potentially damaging rating , saying that moviegoers in iowa or kansas probably have different standards from those in new york or los angeles there are millions of americans who become hysterical about the kind of bad language that may be de rigueur around dinner tables in the east side of manhattan , mr valenti said , his voice rising but in the cities and villages and towns across this free and loving land it s not that way at all the present case
once america learned that secondhand smoke was at the least a nuisance , and at the worst a health hazard , states and localities all over the country began developing regulations to protect nonsmokers from other people s bad habit new york might be well on its way toward intelligent new restrictions too , had the state legislature enacted the bill known as prokids last year although the assembly has passed it twice , overwhelmingly , it has yet to make it to the senate floor the bill would prohibit smoking in schools and on school grounds , and ban the sale of outofpackage or loosie cigarettes it would also require separate , enclosed smoking rooms in workplace lounges and cafeterias , and would limit hospital smoking to patients who obtained written authorization from physicians smoking in transportation terminals , buses and restrooms would be banned too , as well as in youth centers , child care facilities , group homes for children , public institutions for children and residential treatment facilities so what is there not to like about a bill that is so kind to children \? according to a recent survey , 36 state senators do like the bill , none are opposed and the rest have not yet taken a position gov mario cuomo , at whose request it was introduced , likes it too so do a wide array of medical and public health associations , the board of regents and organizations ranging from the league of women voters to the federation of protestant welfare agencies so far the senate majority leader , ralph marino , has not shown himself to be among the bill s fans last year he thought the tobacco industry , which had just been handed a 17centperpack tax increase , had taken enough of a hit this year his office says the bill is still under review , and that there is no final decision on it yet meanwhile , young new yorkers are still taking in secondhand smoke and that is a hit they cannot afford
if god is truly in the details , as the saying goes , the major league baseball owners and the striking players must worship different deities because both sides can offer up proof positive that the game is only the way they say it is the game is healthy , players say the game is on a collision course with economic disaster , owners say so divergent are the courses the two sides take to get from here to there , it often seems as if they are traversing two different planets never was that more apparent than yesterday , when 12 owners or their representatives joined in battle for the first time during this strike with the players union and they offered as their opening salvos at the bargaining table a litany on how the current system is killing many teams and , therefore , must be reworked the owners and their representatives gave their interpretations of this crisis , knowing that the 21 players and their union representatives believe the claim to be indefensible the players as much as said so less than 48 hours before , when the union delivered to the owners a financial analysis of the game the report , commissioned by the players but based on confidential figures provided by the clubs , was compiled by roger noll , an economist from stanford university who previously served on the president s council of economic advisers noll s report , in one word , is damning to any argument the owners have yet to offer as reason for their pursuit of a new economic order , that is because noll charges that baseball has underestimated its expected revenues by between 3 and 8 percent for 1994 , which , if one extrapolates from baseball s projections of 178 billion , means that another 50 million to 140 million could have come baseball s way this year if the strike had not cut the season off as it did on aug 12 noll calls forecasts of widespread doom fiction as for those muchmaligned player salaries , noll writes , total player compensation in professional compensation , contrary to widespread belief , is not increasing faster than revenue and cannot reasonably be said to be causing a decline in the financial status of the sport richard ravitch , the owners' chief negotiator , dismissed the noll report as biased and the prophecies of doom remain smallmarket teams , like milwaukee and san diego , even bigmarket clubs , like boston , atlanta and the two chicago franchises , trumpet them and when the players put the report on the table yesterday , the owners did not even deign to comment on it still , noll contends such dire predictions are far more implausible in 1994 than 1985 , when owners predicted financial disaster only to see their concessions followed by tremendous windfalls in the areas of national and local broadcast revenues now , in 1994 , owners are singing a similar tune , saying that the only way to harness financial troubles and turn them around is to harness players' salaries and , if one takes a bud selig , a jerry reinsdorf , a ravitch at their word , that tune just is n't going to change , no matter how many reports the players commission so they stand , in the same negotiating room of a midtown manhattan hotel , but so obviously in different universes it does not seem to matter that the public continues to lacerate both players and owners for shutting the game down for the eighth time in 22 years it does not seem to matter that the amount of anger will multiply a thousandfold if this fight for money and power kills the world series , something that the great depression , two world wars and an earthquake in 1989 did not do alas , the owners probably wo n't agree with the economist s conclusions , let alone claim that they 've seen the enemy and that enemy is themselves they did n't buy in when noll reached similar conclusions in 1985 it is as if the parties are doomed to play out their roles , the same as in all the previous lockouts , strikes and fights in between just as they did in 1985 , with the owners as doomsayers , noll as a naysayer and the players as the grave doubters fourteen days into the strike and no one has come close to breaking out of character and sadly , as the season slips away , one gets the idea that even if a new interpretation of where the game stands economically were carved in stone and brought down from the mountain , nothing will change which may be good for economists as each side lines up more and more expert witnesses but none of this will ever be said to be good for the game
yakutsk , russia they shot it out at noon , not long after a hard summer rain had turned the city roads to mud by the time the turf battle for one of siberia s wildest outposts had ended , two gang leaders lay dead , six others were on their way to the hospital , and this untamed city filled with enough strivers , gamblers , con men and thieves to make dodge city seem like larchmont had taken one step closer to anarchy this has always been a crazy place but it sure is getting wilder , said rima yakovleva , a 28yearold fur trader whose friend was killed in the shootout this month when people say freedom is dangerous in russia i think i know what they mean because no place is freer or more dangerous than siberia she may be right siberia has always been animated by a frontier spirit , a combustible blend of danger and possibility bigger than anyplace on earth it would take india , the united states and much of western europe to fill it up the region stretching roughly from the urals to the sea of okhotsk has for centuries produced suffering and dread on a scale practically unrivaled in the world siberia the word itself has become a synonym for isolation , exile and despair yet siberia is not a simple , or even a single , place these days it is the most reactionary part of russia , and the most open democracy , opportunity and entrepreneurial adventure are rapidly on the rise so are poverty , desolation and rage a speculator would drool over the natural treasures that lie beneath the frozen earth here more diamonds , more gold , more silver , tin , lumber and oil than anywhere in the world yet thousands of northern villages established to mine that wealth are dying millionaires with car phones carry their rubles in huge bricks yet there may never have been a time , not even when stalin turned siberia into one of history s biggest prison camps , when more people here have lived with less hope for the future nowhere are the complicated chords of the emerging russia more evident than here in central siberia , where most homes lack running water and rich young men cruise the unpaved roadways in 40 , 000 jeeps yakutia with the world s biggest coal fields , much of the oil in the former soviet union and nearly all of its diamonds and tin has as much promise for development as any place in a russia hungry for exports but local newspapers are filled with advertisements from people so desperate to get out that they are offering to trade large apartments for a single container to box and ship their possessions to moscow there are just not many reasons for being optimistic about siberia , said aleksei a tomtosov , the mayor of yakutsk , which with 200 , 000 residents is the largest city in yakutia , a 12millionsquaremile region people have been sent here with promises that have not been kept , mr tomtosov said food is three times more expensive here than in moscow every trained person who can get a job somewhere else is leaving i know a lot of people are making money here now , but i think more are losing everything they believed in i do n't think anybody had any idea the free market could be so cruel the lure diamonds glitter in the permafrost it is in the north , an often majestically unkempt , seemingly unbroken expanse of tundra and permafrost that covers the top twothirds of russia , where the new realities of the nation have perhaps been most painful until two years ago , nearly 11 million people lived here , mostly in thousands of small mining towns set up by the soviets to harness the wealth of the land east of the urals but at least a million have fled since then , and officials here and in moscow worry that another million will leave in the next year many of the region s aging residents were lured there during the glory days of communism with promises of extra pay , fancy vacations , subsidized food and a guaranteed pension after 15 years of work they followed their ideals and what was called the long ruble , the extra money and prestige that went with the extra hardships you came here and you were special , said aleksandr i gritskevich , a 45yearold police officer in verkhoyansk , a particularly bleak arctic town that is most famous for its claim of registering the lowest temperature ever recorded in a settled place \( 9004 degrees below zero , fahrenheit \) like many northern villages , the town , 400 miles north of yakutsk , is a monument to abandoned soviet dreams there is a halfbuilt day care center , a pile of bricks that was going to be a bakery and an empty space for the new school it just fell apart a couple of years back , mr gritskevich said all of a sudden it was like we were dead towns built on hope as long as the promises held , the privations had all seemed worth it frontier towns like verkhoyansk , sangar , and komsomolskonamur were cobbled together with wood beams and blind hope the deal was simple survive the coldest weather in the world , harvest the oil fields , mines and rivers , and live the communist good life back in the european part of the country forever after the deal held for at least two decades
quasars compact celestial powerhouses that can shine as brightly as 1 , 000 galaxies generally lie at enormous distances from earth s home galaxy , the milky way but to the astonishment of astronomers , it appears that something like a miniature quasar has turned up in our own galactic backyard astronomers using the very large array , or vla , of radio telescopes scattered across a desert near socorro , nm , have discovered a small but violently powerful quasarlike object only 40 , 000 lightyears away close enough , perhaps , to measure features that are too distant to detect in the much larger and more powerful quasars that lie billions of lightyears away future study of this object , and the highspeed jets of matter streaming in opposite directions from its two poles , may shed light on the functioning of its enigmatic big brothers this discovery is one of the most valuable results of more than a decade and a half of observations at the vla , said dr miller goss , director of the very large array observatory this object , relatively nearby , offers the best opportunity yet to build a good understanding of how such jets actually work tracked movement of jets the object , named grs1915 105 , was first seen in 1992 by the frenchrussian orbiting xray observatory sigmagranat the object sporadically emits intense xrays , but until the recent observations by the vla it had not been recognized as having radioemitting jets similar to those of quasars for six weeks beginning in march , two astronomers using the observatory , dr i felix mirabel of the centre d'etudes de saclay at gifsuryvette , france , and dr luis f rodriguez of the national radio astronomy observatory in socorro , tracked the movement of powerful jets streaming in opposite directions from the object s poles blazing with intense radio emissions and xray radiation , grs1915 105 began its eruption of particle jets on march 19 the particles themselves are invisible from earth , but electrons traveling in these jets are accelerated to speeds close to that of light , driving them to emit intense radio waves detectable by the vla antennas because of the orientation of the jet nearest earth an angle of 71 degrees from the line of sight of observers at the vla observatory and because of the effects of relativity on objects moving nearly as fast as light , the jet presents an illusion it appears to be moving 25 percent faster than light an impossibility a relativistic illusion the special theory of relativity prohibits anything from exceeding the speed of light , but astronomers have become accustomed in recent years to seeing this relativistic illusion in jets ejected by quasars and the seething cores of some galaxies the jets are called superluminal objects because they seem to move faster than light although astronomers have discovered a fair number of presumed neutron stars or black holes within our galaxy that emit jets , none was known to have jets exhibiting the vast power that dr mirabel and dr rodriguez measured in grs1915 105 in an announcement of their discovery scheduled for publication today in the british journal nature , the two astronomers said , this superluminal microquasar may offer the best opportunity to gain a general understanding of relativistic ejections seen elsewhere in the universe dr galen gisler , an astrophysicist at los alamos national laboratory whose research focuses on the behavior of quasars , said in an interview that while many superluminal jets had been observed , they were by no means understood in the 20 years since we 've known of their existence , we 've been puzzling over how they 're produced , he said the jets , we believe , lie along the same axis as the object s axis of rotation jets have been observed streaming from starsize objects as well as from the giant quasars , but stellar jets have much less energy than the jets of quasars double star systems many astronomers believe that stellar jets are associated with double star systems , in which one partner is a black hole or a neutron star and the other is a large , gaseous star the enormous gravitational field of the black hole draws gas away from the companion star , and this matter is trapped around the black hole in a rotating ring called an accretion disk from this disk the matter gradually spirals into the black hole , rising to such a high temperature that it emits xrays astronomers are excited by grs1915 105 because it seems to be scarcely larger than a star , but its jets pack vastly more energy than those seen in any known doublestar system an energy level that seems closer to that of real quasars the consensus , dr gisler said , is that somehow this accreting matter in the disk gets funneled into the tightly collimated jets we see streaming from the poles at nearly the speed of light how this happens , we do n't know , he added there are lots of mathematical models , but no decisive observations favoring one theory over the others whether superluminal jets can be explained any time soon , dr gisler believes that the discovery of more starsize jet ejectors in our galaxy will give astronomers a powerful tool the physics of the relativistic illusion is such that you can determine the velocity of the jets , from which you can determine the distance of the object from earth with good precision , he said these objects could give us another way of measuring distances within our galaxy by calculating the relativity effects on the two jets , it is possible to calculate their real motion , and from that their distances diagram strange object quasar s baby brother in earth s backyard quasars are dense , susperpowerful objects that may lie at the center of many galaxies a quasarlike object , designated

andrew j spano , the former county clerk , received a call last week in his new capacity as the county s democratic party chairman from three assembly people asking me to do something , he said i asked them how the county legislators felt about it and one of them said , 'oh , i never talk to them' they should be talking to each other , mr spano said , noting that one of his first tasks as party leader will be to develop communications between and among the various levels of government county legislators , state legislators and local officials mr spano , who has long dabbled in party politics , is making many changes in the job he says he has always wanted , changes in the structure as well as the operation of the party that now has a sizable advantage in registration but not , at least recently , in results having come within one seat of taking over the board of legislators in 1991 , the democrats suffered major losses last year not only on the board , where the republicans improved their position to a commanding 116 edge , but in the three countywide offices county executive , county clerk and district attorney focus on people and resources mr spano was hardly a spectator in this misadventure he was his party s choice , as far as the democratic leadership was concerned , for county executive , but assemblyman richard l brodsky , who had lost narrowly to mr o'rourke in 1989 after mr spano withdrew as the candidate , bested mr spano in a primary and then lost again to mr o'rourke i'm going to try to straighten out the party , build it up and make sure we have the kind of people and resources we need when we have to run an election campaign , mr spano said , adding , i do n't want anyone else to have to go through what i went through running for office without significant help from the party significant help means money , and mr spano said he plans to separate fund raising into two parts , for operations , which will be our headquarters , and for election campaigns under the new leadership of mr spano , who replaces dennis mehiel , now a candidate for the congressional seat held for 13 terms by hamilton fish jr , a republican , the democrats are halving the ticket price for the democratic dinner on june 9 to 75 from 150 , to encourage more people to participate , as the new leader puts it we have also done away with our journal , a booklet distributed at the dinner intended to raise money through congratulatory advertisements , and are compiling a directory listing all of westchester s democratic officeholders , party officials and people in westchester connected to the democratic party he said the party also plans to increase the size of its white plains headquarters , which is too small to hold meetings he said that if we are more than 20 people , we have to rent space in the white plains hotel the more spacious headquarters will enable us to set up phone banks and provide other candidate services during election campaigns , he said he added that the expanded headquarters will provide a psychological boost , a feeling of a new place and he intends to fill it for more than executive committee meetings one night a month we will have an open house for party people to drop by , he said a lot of our people do n't know each other some have never set a foot north of yonkers interactive cable mr spano plans to organize what he calls a crossfertilization of party leaders , where the yonkers leader will visit lewisboro and the lewisboro leader will visit mount vernon , so they see each other more than just the times they attend executive board meetings mr spano said he believes strongly in the importance of the party , saying none of these candidates could get elected on an independent line i always realized that 35 or 40 percent of my vote came from the democratic party he conceded that the major political party s influence has waned in recent years , but that it will come back , and in large measure through the modern electronics that helped diminish it it s going to come back because the media approach , he said , referring to television , is going to be more local once we get into interactive cable eventually , the advantages some candidates have will disappear , and at that point , if i have a political party behind me , i have an advantage if i have district leaders and people in the community , i have a big advantage the trouble is we do n't have as many of them as we once had of 1 , 800 possible district leaders , we have only 1 , 100 on line you used to be able to go to a district leader and say , 'i'm out of work' the leader would call party leaders who would call elected officials and things would move , mr spano said but does this fit with today s trend toward reducing government payrolls \? when i was an elected official , i not only could help people with jobs in government , i helped people with jobs outside government , mr spano said i had contacts and friends , and i would distribute resumes it s just a matter of networking who you know and what the job seeker knows how to do getting leaders on line
camden , nj , oct 11 boston s aquarium has coral reefs new york s has breeding whales baltimore s has dolphin shows camden s has brown fish from new jersey sound like a sales problem \? the 53 million aquarium opened here in february 1992 after a wave of advertising featuring caribbean music and pictures of brilliantly colored tropical fish darting around a coral reef but the aquarium has relatively few such fish , and no reef and while other aquariums nationwide are flourishing with a crowdpleasing blend of education and entertainment , the camden aquarium is struggling just to stay open there are people who say we are n't as entertaining as we should be primarily because we have brown fish , said dr judith l wellington , the aquarium president while most aquariums in the country are attracting bigger crowds than ever , attendance at the camden aquarium built with taxpayers' money specifically to stimulate development in this poor waterfront city keeps sinking , to an estimated 600 , 000 this year , down from 11 million in the first 10 months of operation in 1992 aquarium membership has also dropped , to 10 , 500 from 19 , 000 the first year last month , the aquarium laid off 10 of its 100 employees and reduced its operating schedule , to five days a week from seven , as part of a plan to close a 1 million gap in its 85 million annual budget how did new jersey manage to create one of the very few unsuccessful aquariums in america \? \( in 1993 , 34 million people visited aquariums nationally , up 28 percent from the year before , according to the american zoo and aquarium association in washington \) there are many explanations including unrealistic expectations and a recession that limited both the scale of the aquarium and surrounding waterfront development but none is quite as colorful as the brown fish dilemma when the aquarium was being discussed in the late 1980 s , state political leaders argued that if they were going to shell out taxpayer money , they wanted an aquarium with lots of new jersey fish part of the representation made to the legislature and the governor was that the aquarium would be a good vehicle for educating students and other people in the state to the fish found in new jersey waters , said lewis b thurston , who was the general manager of the aquarium s construction for the sports authority between 1989 and 1992 it would be unique in that it did not focus on fish found all over the world now , it was n't supposed to be all new jersey fish but high construction costs forced the aquarium to scale down its exhibits and indefinitely postpone plans to create what would have been the world s only living coral reef under glass and with that decision , the aquarium s other focus , new jersey fish , became dominant about 70 percent of the 4 , 000 creatures on exhibit at the aquarium were plucked from waters off new jersey , and many are in a 760 , 000gallon tank , the world s second largest , that recreates the open ocean off the shores of new jersey the tank includes specimens like brown sharks , a 100pound , prehistoriclooking ocean sunfish and a silver dolphin fish that turns blue when it feeds visitors who do come seem to enjoy these exhibits , but on a recent weekday there was audibly more interest on the second floor of the aquarium , where people clustered around small tanks of brilliantly colored nonnew jersey tropical fish peacock flounder , spotted scorpionfish , lion fish , orangespinned unicorn fish , foxface rabbitfish and clown triggerfish the aquarium , formally known as the thomas h kean new jersey state aquarium at camden , sits by itself in a wasteland on the east bank of the delaware river , directly across from downtown philadelphia after construction was completed , the state stepped aside , leasing it for 1 a year to a new nonprofit management corporation called the new jersey academy for aquatic sciences the 100acre site , which was supposed to attract additional private development , is largely a scene of weedfilled lots surrounded by factory buildings that look as if they were left over from the industrial revolution twothirds of the visitors who come do their best to avoid camden s grim streets , taking a 4 ferry ride from philadelphia across the delaware modern aquariums have done wonders in many troubled urban areas , but camden is one of the nation s poorest cities , where the unemployment rate is 22 percent and 57 percent of its 85 , 000 people live in poverty the last time the city got national attention was in 1991 , when arsonists torched 120 empty buildings in a prehalloween spate of vandalism a 1985 feasibility study for the aquarium charitably states that camden is not at this time a tourist destination but the study adds , there is no reason it could not be , given the possibility that an aquarium , going by the experience in other cities , might attract 500 million in commercial and retail development the soft economy , however , dashed those hopes apart from the aquarium , there is only a new garage , a 10acre park and a new office building for martin marietta corporation another office building , for the delaware river port authority , and a 25 , 000seat amphitheater for concerts and plays are under construction in all , that represents private investment of about 165 million but to date , the development has not provided a single shop , restaurant or extra attraction to lure visitors to the waterfront its projected attendance of 1 million visitors a year was based on a waterfront full of other activities retail stores and all kinds of shops and restaurants but none of that has happened , said mr thurston the model for using an aquarium as the linchpin for redeveloping urban waterfronts can be traced to the opening of the new england aquarium in boston in 1969 before that the nation had only 13 major aquariums since 1970 , 15 more cities have built successful aquariums , eight more aquariums are in various stages of development and as many as 100 cities are considering plans , say consultants despite the differences between camden and its competitors , louis e garibaldi , a consultant who helped plan the aquarium here , is optimistic about its longterm prospects have patience , the camden aquarium will work out eventually , said mr garibaldi , who is also the director of the aquarium for wildlife conservation in coney island robert moses put the aquarium in coney island in 1957 and only now , 37 years later , are we beginning to fulfill the promise for anchoring redevelopment the aquarium board has taken a first step toward such fulfillment at a meeting today it approved spending 100 , 000 to develop a new concept for the aquarium , possibly one that would turn each visit into an adventure , said dr wellington , who is the chief operating officer as well as the president of the aquarium one might go on a mystical adventure into the world of jellyfish , or go on a geographical adventure through new jersey or the caribbean , she said photo sonny renner and his sister , jillian , looking at one of the exhibits at

from the days when he was the hardcharging united states attorney compared with thomas e dewey and eliot ness , mayor rudolph w giuliani has always been seen as the crusading prosecutor , with nothing but disdain for the usual accommodations of politics in new york as mayor , he is a man who wo n't let his aides take even a free lunch or a free drink he scrupulously avoids accepting gifts on two occasions , he has twice publicly turned to the department of investigation in cases where there were hints that something might have been amiss or ignored during the dinkins administration yet in the last week , mr giuliani has come fiercely to the defense of 15 campaign workers and members of his administration who got from two weeks' to three months' free rent from a realestate executive who was one of the mayor s top fundraisers mr giuliani s initial response was to denounce the revelation of the arrangements with the executive , william w koeppel , as a cheap story and for most of the week steadfastly maintained that none of his aides were getting advantageous deals some aides are worried the mayor s handling of the issue has worried even some of his own staff who , when promised anonymity , say they fear his stand was in conflict with his image as the mayor who insists on higher standards chris meyer , a staff attorney for the new york public interest research group , said of the mayor s political quandary , in a way the mayor came in saying he was n't a typical politician , and now he s behaving like a typical politician that was the political backdrop for the mayor yesterday when , after several days of defending his staff , he announced that he had asked the corporation counsel paul a crotty to examine other leases in the buildings owned by mr koeppel to see how they compare with those of his own aides mr giuliani did not withdraw his support , and he made it clear that he did not plan to act on anything but his own terms or let anyone judge but himself if i find that anyone did anything wrong , i will be the first to administer probably discipline that would be considered very harsh , he said on the other hand , if they have n't , if in fact a mischaracterization is being created and kind of driven by the constant media attention to this , then i'm not going to just submit to that because people think that s the politically correct thing to do so far , he said , the rents paid by his aides were very comparable to what everyone else in the building is paying there is a long history of entanglement between real estate and politics in new york city members of the realestate industry are traditionally among the top contributors to citywide campaigns it is also , notes state senator franz s leichter , a manhattan democrat , more dependent on government than industries usually are there are rentcontrol laws , taxabatement programs , taxassessment proceedings and zoning variances , all of which can affect profits or development projects it was the large contributions by developers to members of the former board of estimate who were sitting in judgment of their projects that helped push the city toward enacting the public finance law , which sets limits on campaign contributions that candidates can accept if they want to receive city matching funds in that context , having so many giuliani staffers accept rent terms from mr koeppel that granted up to threemonth rent concessions raised at least the appearance of a problem , some publicinterest advocates said i think it s almost second nature for these landlords to offer these deals , said mr meyer what i thought would be different about this administration is that the political ethical antenna would be up and key staff people would say , 'this does n't look good , it does n't smell right' and especially some of the former prosecutors on the offensive mr giuliani could simply have said he would examine the matter when the first newspaper account of the rent concessions broke instead , he immediately went on the offensive , saying the reports were designed to create a bad impression when nothing wrong was done at all from that moment , beginning with the mayor himself , the administration offered bits and pieces of information about the deals , some of which later turned out to be inaccurate or incomplete and many of the staffers who had the apartments declined to answer questions or speak to reporters the initial accounts of how many administration officials had signed leases with mr koeppel were low it was a spokesman for mr koeppel who was the first to release the full list of 15 mayoral aides and campaign workers who had rented apartments from the developer several officials whom randy m mastro , mr giuliani s chief of staff , had said did not get rent concessions turned out to have received them after all the mayor said of his staffers , in each case , they are paying more than the prior tenant by a good deal more revelations but a former tenant of mr koeppel s came forward to say she had been paying more than 500 a month more than marva l hammons , the commissioner of the human resources administration , for the same size apartment two other aides also turned out to be paying less than previous tenants yesterday , after a week of such revelations , mr giuliani somewhat changed course but asked whether an agency like the department of investigation , which operates somewhat more independently of the mayor , should be called in to make the judgment , he firmly held his ground if anyone did anything wrong , we 'll take action , mr giuliani said but i'm not going to submit to this kind of thing and create a further impression of wrongdoing
people who suffer cardiac arrest in new york city have only a 1 in 100 chance of survival , a much lower rate than in several smaller cities and rural areas that have been studied , new research shows the researchers , who studied 2 , 329 consecutive cardiac arrests in new york city during a sixmonth period in 1991 , attributed the poor survival rates to factors that are common to large cities and that delay the care of such patients , whose hearts have stopped pumping for example , largely because of traffic problems and the logistics of finding victims in large buildings , urban victims wait longer for trained emergency personnel to deliver advanced care , which usually consists of an electrical shock to jolt the heart back into a normal rhythm in addition , new yorkers are less likely to know cardiopulmonary resuscitation than people in many smaller cities , so victims are less likely to receive cpr from bystanders quickly or at all , the researchers found the researchers found that the median time from patient collapse to the first electrical shock was more than 12 minutes in new york , compared with 8 to 10 minutes in suburban seattle , an area known for its superb emergency care , where the chances of surviving cardiac arrest are 1 in 5 tall buildings and the dense population prevent emergency crews from getting to victims fast , said dr paul gennis , one of the emergency medicine doctors from the bronx municipal hospital center who conducted the new study cardiac arrest , also known as sudden death , occurs when the heart stops pumping effectively , generally due to an abnormal rhythm which is sometimes precipitated by a heart attack through cpr , which consists of mouthtomouth resuscitation and chest compressions , bystanders can artificially propel blood to vital organs until a normal rhythm is restored this is generally accomplished through electrical shocks or drugs patients in cardiac arrest must receive cpr within four minutes and and electrical shock within eight minutes to survive , prior studies have shown only 3 percent of cardiac arrest victims in the new york study , which appears in today s issue of the journal of the american medical association , received such care there is little data about response times in other cities , although one prior study of chicago showed delays and survival rates similar to those in new york in contrast , smaller cities and rural areas of the country , like parts of iowa , minnesota and arizona , have been found to have much higher survival rates the authors of the new study cautioned that part of the difference might be because of the peculiar health problems of urban residents but they also pointed out that police officers and firefighters in many smaller cities , unlike those in new york , can administer the electrical shocks needed to save lives ems as a factor this is the first largescale study aimed at assessing the quality of emergency medical care for cardiac victims in new york city and the most comprehensive study to date of such care in any major urban area it comes at a time when mayor rudolph w giuliani has announced plans to fold new york city s emergency medical service into the fire department , in part because of what he considers the ems s poor service at a news conference held by the american heart association , which financed the study , the authors of the research praised the ems , but suggested that in a city like new york its best efforts were not good enough it is probably not possible for ambulance services themselves to get through city traffic in time to save people s lives , said dr john gallagher , director of emergency medicine at bronx municipal hospital center dr gallagher and his colleagues concluded that the only hope for improving survival was for more new yorkers to learn cpr and for both firefighters and police officers to be trained to deliver electrical shocks he estimated that hundreds of lives could be saved if there was a defibrillator , the machine which delivers the shocks , in every firehouse and squad car , since these professionals often reach cardiac patients ahead of the ems personnel this is a wonderful study that shows you that time is the critical thing and to have any impact on survival it just has to be shortened , said dr mark henry , chairman of the department of emergency medicine at university hospital in stony brook , li trimming time a challenge he endorsed equipping all police officers and firefighters to perform cardiac resuscitations , noting that in suffolk county , where the police arrive first at more than half of all cardiac arrests , police academy graduates are now taught the skill and some squad cars are carrying defibrillators as part of a pilot project but he said that in cities like new york trimming minutes was a challenge with traffic , it may take the ambulance two minutes longer to arrive on the scene , and then you have to find the patient up 40 stories in an elevator or in the middle of penn station , he said what is more , he said , some of the delays documented in the study are not controlled by ems , like the average twominute delay between the moment a person collapses and the first call to the police it may well be that in the city we have our force fields up , he said that we have to stop walking over bodies in the train station and stop to find out if someone is just sleeping or in trouble mr giuliani is considering training for firefighters to perform the initial resuscitation of victims , including administering electrical shocks the mayor is aware of this and other studies in terms of it being crucial for ems to get to the the scene early in cardiac arrests , and that is what prompted him to explore idea of another level of responder , said karen crowe , a spokeswoman for mr giuliani citing traffic congestion but dr lorraine giordano , medical director of the city s emergency medical service , said that politicians and the public have focused too much on ambulance response times and not enough on what every citizen could do to improve the city s survival rate you ca n't improve ems response time without doing something about traffic congestion and whether that s possible i do n't know , she said so i think we have to look elsewhere to improve the chain of survival the presence of good bystander cpr , of citizens who know how to activate the 911 system and who recognize the signs of cardiac arrest are as critical as the response time of ems less than 10 percent of the patients in the new study received cpr from bystanders within four minutes , and 68 percent received none at all , even though 70 percent of the incidents occurred in the home the patients waited a median of 114 minutes until emergency personnel arrived and 124 minutes until they received an electrical shock a lengthy interval between collapse and definitive care predicts a poor outcome , said dr gary lombardi , another of the study s authors unless ems is accessed and bystander cpr is initiated and defibrillation readily available any community s survival will be low less than 10 percent of people in new york city know cpr , compared with more than twothirds in seattle we have to strengthen every link in the chain of survival , said dr joseph hayes , president of the american heart association , new york affiliate why , new yorkers do not even do cpr in their own homes
advocating an end to kneejerk reaction to intermittent abuses , a special commission called yesterday for overhauling the maintenance and repair of new york city s schools in its first report , the ninemember commission , appointed in march by schools chancellor ramon c cortines , pinpointed experimentation as vital to improvement , saying no single method was applicable to a system of 1 , 150 old and new buildings serving more than a million students a school system as complex and variegated as ours requires a facilities management approach that is creative , responsive and nimble , said the report of the commission on school facilities and maintenance reform , whose chairman is harold levy , vice president and counsel of salomon brothers the current system meets none of these criteria the chief recommendation of the panel to mr cortines was a strategy of offering some new choices to selected school boards , superintendents and principals for instance , having cleaning and repairs done by private contractors chosen from realestate management companies at the same time , school custodians , private contractors whose job performance has frequently been criticized , would be transferred to buildings outside these districts another suggestion was to designate specific custodial helpers as public employees under the authority of the school system the report also recommended prompt discipline of employees who perform inadequately and a system of incentives and recognition for others other proposals included assignment of small teams of skilled workers to local school districts and employment of private companies to compete against existing custodial and maintenance workers to achieve specified goals the report also proposed giving local boards , through their superintendents , control over the maintenance money any savings could be used for educational purposes local officials would be free to experiment as to which management option is most suited to their district s needs , the report said but it cautioned against expecting quick improvements to achieve success , the report continued , any new system would require close management supervision and adequate financing from the division of school facilities , which oversees maintenance and custodial services and leases school sites the report termed current financing inadequate it also criticized the division , saying decades of management problems had caused it to lose sight of its sole purpose responding to teacher and pupil needs through its maintenance and custodial functions john fager , cochairman of the parents coalition for education in new york city , a citywide parents' advocacy organization , reacted to yesterday s report by saying , recommending a mixed system of local and central control mirrors the problems of the present decentralized centralized school system , where we have the worst of both worlds anyone who does n't realize that the division of school facilities needs to be dismantled , anyone who thinks it can be reformed , needs to have their head examined the commission s chairman , mr levy , said , some of the proposals are already being implemented , and the division has agreed to make available to other selected districts some of the options and we believe there has been marked improvement
addis ababa , ethiopia , oct 22 after two decades of war and famine , political oppression and mass killings , the recipe for restoring a shattered economy under a democratic government remains elusive here in the three years since rebel troops overthrew a marxist regime and committed themselves to democratic rule , there have been measurable gains the government of president meles zenawi has cooperated with the world bank , devalued its currency and begun to open its markets there is general stability and peace inflation is down to single digits there are 60 registered political parties more than 120 newspapers are registered here in the capital , including many that yearn editorially for the days of the dictator mengistu haile mariam , who ruled in a campaign of terror until his overthrow by rebels and government officials say they remain committed to raising living standards but ethiopia today is still the secondpoorest african country after mozambique , stalked perpetually by famine and so divided by political dissent that some critics fear it will slip back into violence , even civil war the writing is on the wall , no doubt , said nebiyu samuel , head of the ethiopian national democratic party , an opposition coalition that is included in the present transitional government all the factors , all the recipes are there for this country to go to pieces the temptation is there every day for me to quit none of us should be quitters but the road is getting narrower and narrower several thousand people died this year when rains came late and the harvest failed in the south , but by most measures this represented a kind of success the government and international relief agencies prevented a higher toll by rushing food to the stricken area yet even with good rains and successful harvests , the country will continue to require aid amounting to hundreds of thousands of tons of food a year , western relief officials say in this desperately poor land of 50 million , where more than half live below poverty level and an estimated 20 million are unemployed , economic hardships have always defined most ethiopians' existence after south africa , ethiopia is the secondlargest recipient of united states foreign aid in subsaharan africa by may , the united states had provided more than 135 million in economic assistance this year , of which about 110 million was emergency food aid the world bank disbursed 325 million this year , 200 million more than in the previous year because of the economic restructuring , addis ababa has been flooded with more than a million people since 1991 , most of them unemployed and with no future as farmers in the countryside more than 20 , 000 street children roam the city , and their numbers are expected to soar to 40 , 000 by the end of 1995 in the countryside , about 60 percent of the children under 5 are malnourished , one of the highest rates in africa in such a context , bringing prosperity and multiparty democracy in the space of a few years is an extraordinarily difficult task you ca n't apply western logic to what is happening in ethiopia , said one diplomat the western donors are expecting too much , too fast but there is dissatisfaction inside ethiopia as well critics of the government call the official tolerance of a political opposition a whitewash they say the government , controlled by the members of tigrean ethnic minority in the ruling party , the ethiopian people s revolutionary defense front , has fulfilled only a few of its promises diplomats and ethiopians also say the government has become increasingly autocratic and threatening as it tries to neutralize threats to its stability , moving its loyalists into top positions in the ethiopian orthodox church , the university , the state airline , banks and industry we have a cultural tendency towards extremism , said a senior ethiopian official you ca n't introduce democracy by undemocratic means many opposition parties have refused to take part in the country s first elections , to be held early next year the other parties that remain in the present transitional government say they have little access to radio and television , which are controlled by the government , and are not allowed to campaign freely in the provinces several parties have organized military affiliates that have fought government troops , particularly in the east officials officially dismissed this opposition as unorganized bandit activity , but relief workers and diplomats say that in some instances the fighting was fierce enough that the government used tanks diplomats and united nations officials say the government has harassed and sporadically cracked down on the opposition and the press , which sometimes publishes irresponsible reports , and more than a dozen journalists have been arrested in the last few months scores of political demonstrators were arrested here in september the government accused them of inciting a riot freedom should entail responsibility , said netsannet asfaw , the presidential spokeswoman if they incite violence , religious and ethnic , they are taken to court in the west , you accept only peaceful struggle the same should apply here how did governments deal with the black panthers or the ira \? the political dissent is also fueled by factors beyond the government s control the opposition is deeply divided and many of the parties have made outrageously unrealistic demands in an effort to feed unrest and some of the government s moves , like giving any nationality the right to secede , have heightened ethnic tensions another major source of tension is land , which was nationalized during the previous regime the current government has said it will not permit peasants to own the land they farm because of fears that they might be tempted to sell to speculators but ethiopia s biggest hurdle to survival and political success is food production the government says it is overhauling agriculture and hopes to be selfsufficient in food in a decade , but acknowledges that is optimistic barely eight months ago , for instance , millions of ethiopians were on the brink of starvation as rains and crops failed in the south with one million metric tons of food aid , the government managed to bring help to 67 million people now the rains have been plentiful and the fields are lush , but the country will still need 700 , 000 to one million metric tons of food a year if the temperamental rains fail , the situation will be disastrous even with sufficient rain , food production is low because of severe land degradation , low use of fertilizers and a lack of improved seeds ethiopia has the lowest per hectare production of grain in the world , officials say , and after years of war and drought , many farmers no longer even have oxen to till their fields we 're not making any progress at all , said a senior western relief official the same amount is being imported as in 1984 for the famine where one million died that s the kicker , that s the tragedy you have a beautiful crop and you still need a million tons photo three years after rebel troops overthrew marxist rulers , ethiopia remains the secondpoorest country in africa in addis ababa , the capital , homeless men washed their laundry in a puddle

a nuclear plant in southern new jersey , trying to reduce power after grass clogged its coolingwater intake yesterday , went through a power swing before an automatic system shut the plant down , the nuclear regulatory commission said after the shutdown , the commission said , an emergency cooling system came on twice when it should not have , spilling radioactive water into the plant s basement no radiation was released to the environment and no one was hurt , but plant operators declared an alert , sent nonessential workers home and called emergency personnel to the plant , the twinreactor salem nuclear power station , in lower alloways creek the plant s operator , the public service electric and gas company , gave a slightly different version of events , but a spokesman emphasized that the details of what happened are not yet known at only 75 percent power both of the plant s reactors have been operating at only 75 percent power for weeks because of thick sea grass in the delaware river at the site , on the new jersey side of the delaware memorial bridge diane screnci , a spokeswoman at the nuclear regulatory commission s regional headquarters in king of prussia , pa , said operators were cutting power still further , but after power had been cut to 7 percent , the reactor experienced a power surge , for reasons that could not be immediately determined a company spokesman said , however , that the reactor might have been cooled too fast cold water would have helped the nuclear reaction speed up again a safety feature in the control system of the reactor shuts down the plant if power drops below 10 percent and then rises to 25 percent or more , ms screnci said the feature can be disabled if necessary , but is designed to stop the reactor in case power levels get out of control , she said , and in this case it triggered an automatic shutdown some time after the shutdown , the emergency core cooling system came on and forced water into the reactor karl abraham , another spokesman for the commission , said , they had two safety injections , neither one of which they should have had the reactor and the piping around it are protected against overpressurization by an emergency valve that opens before the pipes burst that valve opened , and water flowed down a long pipe into a tank in the reactor building basement when the tank filled , mr abraham said , a special pressurerelief diaphragm burst and water spilled unto the floor mr stewart described the events slightly differently he said the emergency cooling system had not switched on inadvertently but he added , it was not necessarily the desired effect he added that based on humidity and radiation readings taken by remotecontrolled sensors in the reactor basement , it appeared that only a few gallons had spilled , or possibly none at all one result was a temporary loss of the ability to control pressure and temperature in the reactor operators reestablished control at 3 09 pm by closing a valve , and began the long process of lowering pressure and temperature this is done gradually , in a way that minimizes the chance of developing cracks in the thick , hot metal of the reactor vessel and pipes , some of which has been made more brittle by radiation at 1 16 pm plant managers declared an alert , which is more serious than an unusual event but not as bad as a site area emergency mr abraham said the step was taken not because of some special danger to the public or the plant , but because it was a quick way to get nonessential workers off the site and call in reinforcements calling an alert , he said , triggers beepers , pagers and i do n't know whatall the alert was canceled seven hours later the incident yesterday raises questions about the ability of reactor operators to run their plants at low power recent changes in the fuel of nuclear reactors , including salem , can make them less stable at low power levels engineers try to avoid power swings , the behavior that caused the explosion and burning of the chernobyl reactor in 1986 but ms screnci said that salem s fuel was not prone to these swings mr stewart , the company spokesman , said he had heard discussion late yesterday about the possibility that the switch in fuel could have contributed to the problem , but he had no details salem , which entered commercial operation in june 1977 , is 18 miles south of wilmington its ownership is shared among public service electric and the philadelphia electric company , each of which owns 426 percent , and delmarva power and light and atlantic electric , , each of which owns 74 percent it is operated by public service electric salem suffered a failure in its shutdown system in february 1983 that resulted in the plant s being closed for a year for management changes in the 1983 incident , an automatic safety system sent an electronic signal for a shutdown because of a shortage of cooling water , but the reactor failed to stop it had to be shut down manually map of new jersey showing location of the salem nuclear power plant
to the editor clifford odets s flowering peach was a puzzle to critics when it was first produced as a vehicle for the great yiddish comic actor menasha skulnik they remained puzzled when it was set to music as a vehicle for danny kaye they are apparently still mystified by its newest revival by the national actors theater odets waves an olive branch in a last play , march 27 they just ca n't figure out why odets latched onto the biblical story of noah and the flood none of them has ever seemed to notice that the flowering peach is a modern version of the 15thcentury noah plays that were a popular part of the miracleplay cycles in medieval england despite their religious subject matter , miracle plays were highly irreverent they introduced knockabout comedy into the emerging english theater odets clearly derived his plot and most of his characterization from specific plays in the wakefield and chester cycles noah s hassles with god when he is ordered to build an ark come straight from the wakefield noah the key characterizations come for the deluge in the chester cycle odets s major change was to split the resistance to noah s arkbuilding between mrs noah and japhet in the chester play , it is only mrs noah who has to be dragged on board as the waters rise it may be convenient to label odets a social realist and wonder how he wandered so far afield attributing it to mccarthyism is a handy allpurpose answer but social realism died in the 1940 s anyhow , odets was no mere political mouthpiece \( he wrote the country girl before mccarthy emerged \) odets was a playwright and obviously one with a scholarly knowledge of his metier maybe he wanted to see whether a 500yearold joke would still play or maybe he just wanted to write something for skulnik rosanne klass new york

washington , wednesday , aug 3 in high dudgeon , members of both parties on the senate banking committee assailed deputy treasury secretary roger c altman on tuesday and into the early hours today for having been untruthful , in their view , about the whitewater case at a hearing last february in a session that went on until 2 08 am , the most contentious day of whitewater hearings yet , senator alfonse m d'amato , republican of new york , accused mr altman of being at the very least disingenuous at issue were mr altman s responses on four different occasions at a feb 24 hearing before the banking committee mr altman was asked then whether he or anyone on his staff had made contact with anyone at the white house about issues related to the federal investigation into the collapse of madison guaranty savings and loan madison s owner , james b mcdougal , was a partner of bill and hillary clinton in the whitewater real estate venture mr altman replied each time at the february hearing that he knew of only one substantive contact , on feb 2 , when he and members of his staff went to the white house to explain that the statute of limitations was about to expire on civil proceedings against madison guaranty subsequently , mr altman wrote the committee four times amending his testimony , but he never gave a full accounting of contacts that have been mentioned by others other administration officials have testified about several other contacts the treasury department s inspector general counted 40 addressing the discrepancies , senator phil gramm , republican of texas , said , this is totally unbelievable senator connie mack , republican of florida , said the testimony of other witnesses really calls into question how we can believe you and senator richard c shelby , democrat of alabama , who later called on mr altman to resign , asked him , mr altman , do you think when someone asks you a straight question , you should give a straight answer \? 'i do not have perfect recall' mr altman insisted that he had told the truth , but no senator offered him a vigorous defense mr chairman , mr altman said at one point this afternoon , i do not have perfect recall , and i may have heard or understood questions in a way that was not intended by the senator asking the question if i did so , i sincerely apologize to all members of the committee but i do want to be clear in no way did i intend to mislead or not to provide complete and forthright answers answering senator shelby s question directly , mr altman said he had a solid reputation for integrity and forthrightness the question of whether mr altman told the truth at the hearing in february has gained special importance because of the limited scope of this phase of congress s investigation into the whitewater affair the senate has agreed that the only matters that can be examined at this point are the circumstances surrounding the death last year of vincent w foster jr , who was the deputy white house counsel , and the contacts between treasury and white house officials on the madison case the propriety of the feb 2 meeting at the white house is an open question at the time , mr altman was acting chairman of the resolution trust corporation , the agency that administers the nation s savings and loan bailout in his testimony , he denied that this meeting amounted to interference with the rtc s whitewater investigation , or to special treatment for the clintons some senators maintain that it was improper for a regulatory official to brief the white house about a case in which the clintons had an interest but the special whitewater prosecutor , robert b fiske jr , has found that no crime was committed and the independent office of government ethics reported last weekend that while poor judgment may have occurred , no ethics rule was broken other than that matter of propriety , hardly anything of controversy has arisen in the hearings that began last week and are expected to last at least through friday the civil and criminal cases against madison are , by all accounts , proceeding apace longtime friend of president mr altman , who is 48 years old , has known mr clinton since they attended georgetown university together in the 1960 s a successful investment banker , he worked as a fundraiser and economic adviser in the 1992 clinton campaign , and his nomination to the no 2 post at the treasury was one of the first announced by mr clinton after the election last year he was instrumental in organizing the administration s efforts to win congressional approval of the budget and the north american free trade agreement until this latest controversy developed , it was widely assumed that he would one day succeed lloyd bentsen as treasury secretary now his prospects for continuing in office , let alone rising there , have been called into doubt aide s testimony on diary the questioning of mr altman did not begin until nearly 5 pm tuesday in a show of solidarity , b a bentsen , the wife of the treasury secretary , sat in the first row , next to mr altman s wife , jurate kazickas
hartford , oct 5 six months ago , connecticut became the first state in the nation to embark on a voluntary program to integrate its schools across town lines the first results of the planning process are now in , and they confirm what critics have long predicted none of the state s 11 regions has submitted a proposal that would significantly integrate classrooms any time soon the regional planning groups , covering all of connecticut s 169 cities and towns , have submitted plans that propose a total of just five new magnet schools for the state , which has 508 , 000 publicschool students a direct exchange of students between school districts was proposed by only one region , hartford , where a desegregation lawsuit is seeking to combine the capital city s schools 92 percent of whose students are minority members with suburban ones but even there , the voluntary plan would take 12 years to implement and perhaps most telling of all , 25 years after the state enacted its first law requiring racial balance within school districts , and six years after education officials first proposed magnet schools as a way to overcome the growing segregation of urban minority students , twothirds of the regions still feel more study is needed before they can make specific proposals even regions that enthusiastically endorsed the concept of magnet schools stressed how tentative a first step they were taking the new haven report called its own recommendations a plan to plan as modest as the plans are , nearly every region s report emphasized that its communities were not willing to increase local property taxes to pay for integration connecticut s 1993 integration law , the first to call on an entire state to address de facto racial segregation , set a state goal and the state has to pay , the regions warned without state funding , the recommendations of this forum cannot be implemented , the hartford region bluntly stated civil rights lawyers pressing the hartford desegregation suit said the plans showed that the connecticut law s reliance on voluntary measures would not overcome the segregation of minority children in cities , a matter the state has been studying for 30 years they have gone to court , they say , because voluntary plans have led only to delay , and delay can only deprive another generation of children the equal educational opportunity guaranteed by the state constitution once again , there are no funds and no concrete plans , and there are no mandates on race or poverty percentages and , of course , at this stage there is no approval , john brittain , a lawyer for the plaintiffs , said of the hartford region s plan it s a good recognition of the problem , and that s what i think the law does it forces the state to study the problem of inequalities in educational opportunities and lack of diversity between districts but it stops with the acknowledgment of the problem state officials are still reviewing the plans , but education commissioner theodore s sergi told the state board of education on wednesday , i'm sure there will be some people who will say it s not enough and some who will say it s too much but there s been a lot of good faith in people coming together members of the planning groups said the plans set a firm course for the future , and that a host of less dramatic proposals in them could greatly increase interaction among children from different communities the plans , participants said , are proof that communities are willing to consider voluntary measures but there is little support for widespread integration for its own sake to go to everyday contact would involve such a massive restructuring of everything that exists that it s not possible , both logistically and politically , said lawrence r miller , executive director of cooperative educational services , a service agency that assisted fairfield county forums on that region s plan the sentiments of virtually every parent you talk to , whether urban or suburban , is 'you 're not going to put my children on a bus to send them far away simply to mix them with other children' the most ambitious plan was drawn by the hartford region it proposed expanding project concern , a program in which 730 hartford children now attend suburban schools , to 6 , 000 children , a fourth of the city s enrollment but the plan also shows how slowly and deliberately communities want to proceed , and how much even that depends on state financing the plan calls for the expansion of project concern to start by 1998 , adding 500 firstgraders each year , so the goal of 6 , 000 students might not be reached until the year 2010 and it calls on the state to pay all expenses , including the construction of new classrooms in suburban towns , if needed , to accommodate the city children six thousand children was project concern s original goal in 1965 , although it has never involved more than 1 , 175 , in part because of disputes among hartford , its suburbs and the state over how to share its expense while all 11 regions endorsed the concept of magnet schools , many held back from making specific proposals because the state has not appropriated money several regions joined hartford in calling for an end to connecticut s reliance on local property taxes to finance public education sonya f googins , the chairwoman of glastonbury s town council and a member of the hartford region s forum , defended its plan as more than just a piece of tokenism she said , a lot of the things that are in there , we are already doing and have done project concern is one of the best programs we 've had
bonn , jan 24 when president clinton nominated richard c holbrooke to be ambassador to germany last summer on the same day he named former vice president walter f mondale ambassador to japan , some german officials who knew that mr holbrooke was an asia expert wondered whether they had won second prize they wonder no longer mr holbrooke , 52 , has been an instant success in this crucial american diplomatic post i have never seen such an excellent relationship with an ambassador develop in such a short time as with richard holbrooke , said joachim bitterlich , foreign policy adviser to chancellor helmut kohl , who will be in washington this weekend mr holbrooke will be in washington this week to help the white house and the state department prepare for the visit what mr bitterlich and other germans say they like best is the new ambassador s informal and frank style we can talk openly with each other about the way we see things we do n't have to play diplomatic games with him , mr bitterlich said 'the unvarnished truth' tell me what s wrong with the relationship , the new ambassador would tell him and other german officials at dinner parties , not even pretending to make small talk tell me what you 'd like to see fixed dr beate lindemann , an officer of an organization called the atlantic bridge , which cultivates germanamerican cultural and political ties , said at this point in our history , we needed somebody we could talk the unvarnished truth with dick holbrooke was exactly the right man at the right time on a table in the parlor of the big official american residence on the rhine is a picture of mr holbrooke s grandfather , a jewish businessman in hamburg , wearing the prussian spiked helmet and the iron cross he won as a german soldier in world war i i show it to german visitors as a symbol of what they lost , the ambassador said his grandfather left germany with mr holbrooke s mother in 1933 today his mother , trudi moos kearl , lives in new york city mr holbrooke was a foreign service officer until 1972 in vietnam , washington , paris and morocco and he was assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs from 1977 to 1981 before he came here , he was a managing director of the lehman brothers investment bank in new york the ambassadorial residence in bonn has ample evidence of his interests in other parts of the world it is filled with thai , cambodian and vietnamese antique sculptures bonn , a small university town that will cease to be the seat of government at the end of the century , is a place with few of the distractions and none of the glamour of paris or london for a divorced man like mr holbrooke , there was not a lot else to do after he got here last september but talk politics , cultivate contacts , and help shape american policy toward such an important european ally getting close to movers and shakers is something mr holbrooke does very well , and his barely rudimentary german was no handicap he brought in an old friend and mentor , fritz stern , seth low professor of history at columbia university , as an adviser to help him through his first few months , and was soon entertaining mr kohl at home mr stern returned to columbia on jan 15 but is continuing to work as a consultant to the embassy after his frank talks with german officials , one thing mr holbrooke thought needed to be fixed was the impression some germans and other europeans had that the clinton administration did not think relations with europe were as important as they were in the cold war europe has lost none repeat none of its importance to the united states , he said in a speech in potsdam soon after presenting his credentials in october mr clinton made that clear himself during his trip to europe this month but he will not make his first official visit to germany until july mr holbrooke pointed out to old friends in washington like mr clinton s national security adviser , anthony lake , and his chief adviser on russia , deputy secretary of statedesignate strobe talbott , that an earlier idea of having the president come here in june , right after attending the 50th anniversary of the allied landings in normandy , would not be such a good idea since world war ii , the bedrock of the american relationship with germany has been security , with more than 250 , 000 american troops here at the end of the cold war now , mr holbrooke believes , his task is to make sure that the relationship remains strong on a new basis of commercial and cultural ties the overarching goal , he said in an interview one recent weekend , is to use 1994 to create the foundations for a bilateral relationship which is no longer so dependent on the american military presence to do that , in frankfurt , ambassador holbrooke persuaded the united states information agency and the commerce department to open a business information center on jan 18 partners , yes , and rivals too mr holbrooke said he would also like to reopen the closed american consulate in dusseldorf , an important german business center , as a commercial office under a commerce department officer not all his subordinates appreciated his insistence on forcing the farflung bureaucracies to cooperate more closely nor , mr holbrooke concedes , are germanamerican relations without frictions the united states remains irritated by the extensive trade and political ties between germany and iran despite what washington sees as iranian support for international terrorism in asia , we have common humanrights and political views , but we are destined to be political and economic rivals , he said we accept this it also seems clear that this old asia hand has no regrets about having taken on a new challenge in europe germany is the key player in moving the coldwar alliance into a new postcoldwar phase , he said , and clinton and kohl are at the heart of it photo richard c holbrooke in his office in bonn , where he is washington s newest ambassador until now , his strong specialty has been asia \( oliver ruther for the new york times \)
charleston , wva , jan 20 flopping on the family couch , his glasses sliding down his nose , aaron moreland looked like any 9yearold , perhaps a future doctor , pilot or accountant yet he cannot read or write or follow basic thirdgrade drills and as his parents spoke of his learning disabilities , his attention deficit disorder and episodic tantrums , he nodded glumly and agreed , the bad things in aaron s case , the bad things mean wild behavior in his thirdgrade class when he is angry or frustrated , said his teacher , margaret r bays , he wails and spits or crawls beneath his desk , barking like a dog the whole class stops , she said i feel like i'm in a pingpong game the kids watch aaron then they watch me then , while i'm busy with him , they act up twenty years ago , when mrs bays embarked upon a career as a gradeschool teacher , children with physical handicaps or learning problems were rarely taught in public schools some school districts shipped handicapped children across state borders to residential institutions in louisiana , for example , one whole generation of students with disabilities came to be known as the texas children , in a nod to the state where they went to school a change to 'inclusion' but court challenges and changing social philosophies led to the creation of a separate system of special education that guaranteed every child a place in public school usually off to one side with individual attention now the base line is shifting again in public schools across the country , students like aaron and others with more acute medical , physical and mental disabilities are being placed in regular classrooms in their home schools the movement , called inclusion , is driven by a simple theory by putting all students together , regular children learn tolerance for human differences , and disadvantaged children have a chance to learn from and with their peers no formal federal policy requires the change , yet it has forceful backers at the department of education ever since 1975 with the individuals with disabilities education act , this is the direction that we have been heading in , said judith e heumann , the assistant secretary for the office of special education and rehabilitation services we have to recognize the fact that we have a disenfranchised group of children moving from the backwaters to the mainstream of society sometimes those changes foster a need to have people change their thinking same help , new place the most ardent supporters say full inclusion is a civil right they point to poignant breakthroughs both by children with special needs who are no longer ostracized and by the classmates who come to care for them done properly , say the movement s backers , inclusion means not a reduction of services but the same services provided in a different setting in practice , though , the extra help sometimes never comes the result can be chaotic and as the movement sweeps across the country , educators and parents are increasingly complaining that while the theory is appealing in the abstract , it often breaks down in application they also argue that it puts a premium on socialization rather than on academics parents of regular children say the practice slows down normal class work and even supporters note that budget constraints and lack of training can turn a good idea into a painful failure for every student touched by it robert brown , a national representative for the american federation of teachers , which has called for a moratorium on the practice , said he believed that west virginia was one example of a state that had moved too far , too fast , partly because of money problems a school gets 5 , 000 from the state for a regular student , he said a special education student gets three times that so by putting a special education student in a regular classroom , they can essentially triple their take a case in point aaron moreland s experience may be a case in point when aaron was first put into mrs bays s classroom , he came with a special assistant three months later , said his teacher , the aide was transferred and mrs bays had to juggle his needs with those of 21 other regular students struggling with math , science , writing and all the normal fears and triumphs of the third grade by last month , his only special help came in a onehour computer class the result was frustration for all concerned aaron s parents speak with admiration of his teacher but acknowledge that she has neither the time nor the training to give their son special help we 're just at the point where it is , 'look fellows , we have a 9 1 2yearold who still ca n't read , said mark moreland , aaron s father we are running out of time this week , their patience at an end , the morelands transferred aaron and his 6yearold sister , caitlin , who does well in school , to a private school there , aaron will be taught in a small class led by a specialeducation teacher caitlin will study with other 6yearolds at her same level
washington , nov 9 even as president clinton reached out to victorious republicans , the white house was casting about today for ways to govern that would not require congressional cooperation looking somewhat chastened and sounding very conciliatory at a white house news conference , president clinton accepted his share of responsibility for the devastating defeats suffered by democrats in congress , and he said that he would try to seek common ground with republicans on issues like welfare reform but while congratulating senator bob dole of kansas , who is almost certain to be the new majority leader , and representative newt gingrich of georgia , the apparent next speaker of the house , mr clinton also warned that his political rivals must now do their part to help him govern we were held accountable yesterday , mr clinton said of democrats in the white house and congress he said that republicans would now have a larger responsibility for acting in the best interest of america he called on them to join me in the center of the public debate where the best ideas for the next generation of american progress must come but the white house was grim today as mr clinton s advisers tried to grapple with the magnitude of the defeat with both houses of congress soon to be in hostile hands , advisers to mr clinton said today that he recognized that much of his legislative agenda might be doomed the advisers said that mr clinton might have to resort to regulations , executive orders and other presidential tools to work around capitol hill , much as ronald reagan and george bush did when the house and senate were in democratic hands for instance , president bush used executive orders to allow states to experiment with new approaches to welfare mr clinton has already begun to follow that example there s a lot you can do without congress , and believe me , we 'll be looking at everything , a senior white house official said the aides also spoke with apprehension about the likelihood that republicans led by senator alfonse m d'amato of new york would intensify a congressional inquiry into the whitewater affair to make it a permanent distraction mr d'amato is in line to be the new chairman of the banking committee these advisers said the president had concluded that it would be pointless to spend the second half of his term waging a confrontation with capitol hill across a broad front they said he would aim to strike accords with republicans on measures that have bipartisan support , like an effort to overhaul the welfare system but the president now expects only modest changes in the health care system , they said , and has little chance of winning backing for the new domestic spending he has portrayed as a necessary investment the president will also have to contend with initiatives like a balancedbudget amendment and term limits that republicans have made central to their campaigns and that they are now likely to try to rush into law mr clinton has been opposed to both proposals , but his chief of staff , leon e panetta , equivocated today when asked about them , suggesting that he could be open to a compromise the advisers say that while mr clinton will almost certainly have to begin exercising his veto power , he is wary of being seen as the kind of obstructionist that he has spent two years railing against asked at his news conference today about the road ahead , mr clinton said , i will still work for the things that make america strong but as he called repeatedly for bipartisan cooperation , he conceded that his own power had been substantially diminished a lot has changed since yesterday , the president said mr clinton and his advisers had steeled themselves for the prospect of democrats' losing the senate , and some had warned that the house , too , might be at risk but none had foreseen that the losses would be so heavy while he did not name any of them , the president took time to express regret that congress would now be without so many democrats whom he said had made this a lot better country the republican victories are the biggest setback for mr clinton since 1980 , when he lost his first bid to be reelected governor of arkansas , and he plainly recognized that today marked an important moment he told reporters he had taken time to reread the speech he gave as he began his quest for the presidency three years ago , when he said that the job of government was to create opportunity and let citizens assume the responsibility for making the most of it they do n't think we 've done that yet , he said , and his advisers conceded that he might now be badly weakened as he begins an expected quest for a second presidential term the president had traveled nearly nonstop for the last three weeks to build support for democrats by calling attention to his achievements at home and , with four frenetic days in the middle east , to what he had accomplished abroad he stayed awake until at least 2 am today to monitor the returns , his aides said his voice was hoarse , and there were deep bags under his eyes as he appeared at the afternoon news conference , his first public appearance since the election in an opening statement , mr clinton tried to call attention to areas in which republicans and democrats had taken similar approaches to solutions he said it was vital that they work together to promote further economic recovery and continued cuts in the federal deficit mr clinton said he would also support republican efforts to give the president a lineitem veto , a tool that he said would make it easier to hold the line on government spending but he made clear that he would oppose attempts by republicans to redeem the full range of promises made in the party s contract with america , in which candidates committed themselves to a program of tax cuts and spending increases that mr clinton denounced as a return to the economically destructive policies of the 1980 s he promised to block any proposals that would take us back to the policies that failed us before and he said he would strongly object if republicans tried to repeal the ban on assault weapons or the controls on handguns approved by congress over their objections the president s tone today was far more gentle than it has been on the campaign trail , where he spent the final days before the election attacking republicans as members of a party willing to let americans suffer as the price for political success repeatedly , he called for bipartisan cooperation and said that he accepted part of the responsibility for the democrats' defeat photos president clinton , at his news conference yesterday , took a share of the blame for the democrats' losses \( pg a1 \) vice president al gore and leon e panetta , the white house chief of staff , checked out the time yesterday at president clinton s news conference , where mr clinton accepted some

after all the years in which the riddle about gov mario m cuomo was why he did n't \( run for president , take a supreme court nomination \) , the question that lingers after his defeat is why he did \( run for a fourth term that it was clear he would have a hard time winning \) the short answer is that the governor , reluctant to withdraw from the fray after a third term in which a recession had sapped his popularity and forced him to manage scarcity , saw running again as the best way to secure a legacy that already loomed as too intangible , and thus end on a high note the more complex answer is that in forsaking glittering opportunities on the national stage , mr cuomo squarely boxed himself into the one job that consumed and compelled him , and that his aides and friends say he loved , albeit in such a brooding way that they were never sure he actually enjoyed it in interviews this week , those friends groped for answers oh , i do n't know , said david garth , his campaign strategist and a political foil of 20 years' standing about everyone i know with any intelligence , including his family , wanted him to take the court but with mario , there s a big contrary streak if the crowd s going one way , he wants to go the other the governor s former press secretary , gary g fryer , was equally succinct i think a lot of people spend a lot of time analyzing mario cuomo , contemplating his moves , and i think a lot of that cottage industry is unnecessary , said mr fryer , now director of public affairs at yale university he s far more simple than people think he is , and the answer can be summed up in the word service' i know that sounds pollyannaish , mr fryer said but the reality is this is a guy who got to high office against the odds he loves what he does he eats , breathes and lives the responsibilities that go with it i'm not even sure it s enjoyable for him it s what he does this is , after all , a man whose wife once said that living with him was like being domiciled with a legal brief , so rigorous was his logic , so endlessly could he argue a point , any point a politician of mr cuomo s acuity could read the bad omens in his narrow 53 percent victory against splintered opposition four years ago , in his rising negative poll ratings , in the historical audacity implicit in even contemplating a fourth fouryear term something only one state governor in american history , nelson a rockefeller , had ever won until mr cuomo s republican contemporary , terry e branstad , did so in iowa last week indeed , mr cuomo took deliberate steps to reconsider a future that had seemed wide open since he burst into national stardom at the democratic convention in 1984 and passed up a run for the white house in 1988 in 1991 , he flirted more seriously , and perhaps dangerously , with the presidency he went so far as to allow two chartered planes to wait on an albany runway on a december friday to take him to new hampshire in time to file for the primary there , but never left the ground a year later , upon the victory of bill clinton , who had once derided him as a mean mafialike figure , then cited his name as the sort who would make a good supreme court justice , the governor was concerned enough about his future to seek out members of mr clinton s transition team to ascertain if mr clinton meant what he said about the court he called to ask if the president was serious , to say that 'i must figure out what to do with the rest of my life , this has got to figure in my equation , ' said one person close to both mr cuomo and the president , speaking on condition of anonymity and the word came back that , 'yes , we were serious , but there s not a vacancy now' for his part , mr cuomo said i do n't remember that i mean , i would n't deny it , but i do n't remember it and it s not like me to have brought it up what is clear is that a few months later , in spring 1993 when a vacancy did occur and mr clinton called to discuss it , friends of both say the governor cut him short with a list of reasons why he could not do it it would be too isolating , he was n't a constitutional lawyer , he was too young to enter a cloistered world his words to me were , 'i feel as though my tongue would be cut out , ' one friend recalled last week at least one friend of both men thinks the nomination may have fallen victim to miscommunication between mr clinton , who did not quite understand that mr cuomo was willing to be begged , and mr cuomo , who was unwilling to be auditioned or to beg himself but most of the governor s advisers sharply dispute that notion , saying that mr cuomo was genuinely put off by the confinement the court implied once such options were foreclosed , the decision to run again came to seem logical , if not inevitable , though many of those closest to him , including his most trusted political adviser , his son andrew , strongly advised against it he felt very strongly about the fact that he has an unfinished agenda , that he got robbed of a lot of the years he had because of the recessions , said his old friend and confidant , meyer s frucher he also felt very strongly that his ability to play a role in the debate that s going on in this country about the direction of the country would be enhanced by having the office
those residents of his district in texas who like to pop off without bothering with facts or fine points must surely feel ably represented by dick armey , their man in the house of representatives mr armey s reputation for quickonthedraw characterizations was reinforced the other day when , during discussion of abortion coverage in a national health care package , he described women who chose the procedure as selfindulgent and damned careless this conjures up the kind of person some suspect accounts for the vast majority of abortions in america that is , a 16yearold on her third boyfriend and fourth pregnancy who skips school , swears by the soaps and thinks idly that someday she might get around to the pill it s a great stereotype for those , like the congressman , who oppose legal abortion but in fact only a quarter of all abortions are performed on teenagers about 17 percent of the women who have the procedure are married in 1987 , one out of every six abortion patients described herself as a bornagain or evangelical christian more than half the abortion patients in one survey said they had been using birth control when they became pregnant the truth is there is no stereotypical abortion patient , whether in her indulgence of self or her absence of care it s only cheaply convenient to pretend there is but mr armey is not alone in his use of stereotype , myth and deeply held nonsense as an adjunct to public policy , what we in the news biz call never letting the facts get in the way of a good story in florida a school board has just passed a resolution requiring teachers to make clear in the classroom that america is unquestionably superior to any other society , culture or political system in all of human history the board s chairwoman , who had also championed the teaching of creationism in the science curriculum , responded to a statewide policy on multicultural education by passing a counterresolution that would require students to be taught that we are the best of the best this , explained one of her allies , will make them more enthusiastic if they ever go to war it would be soothing to learn that the members of the board came to this conclusion after an exhaustive study of the greek and roman empires , the italian renaissance , the industrial revolution , zen buddhism and hammurabi but they are of the opinion that none of that is necessary our form of government is superior to other nations because it has survived when others have fallen , said one member of the school board majority , apparently unaware of the fact that , in the span of world history , our two centuries are as the blink of an eye in this one official act the members of the board have taught the students of lake county , florida , some overarching concepts that are bigger than math or history , writing or study skills that factfinding is unnecessary and jingoism is a quick and easy substitute for intellectual rigor that catch phrases and conclusions are more valid than critical thinking and individual opinion it s so much easier to spit out stereotypes about women who have abortions than to study statistics and talk to real people about their real reasons it s so much easier to assume that you 're superior than to take the time to learn about and dissect other cultures the first is not responsible representation , the second not real education but never mind here only conclusions count perhaps the poor history teachers in florida saddled with this new policy would find it useful to do a unit on a political movement that took much of this country by storm more than a century ago by appealing to fear of widespread immigration and the resulting introduction of other cultures into america s towns and cities the group prospered by fomenting hatred against new arrivals the germans , the irish , above all the catholics prominent politicians joined the ranks , and fearmongering managed to land some of the best known in high office the group was called the knownothings , and certain history books conclude that their movement went bust less than two decades after it began but some days you have to wonder whether the knownothings have been resurrected , more worthy of the name than ever before
east rutherford , nj , sept 7 the giants are already getting sick of hearing about buddy ryan very sick how many super bowls has he won \? said giants defensive end michael strahan i'm serious how many \? when told ryan had won none as a head coach he was the defensive coordinator on the bears' championship team in 1986 strahan replied , well , that speaks for itself buddy ball was a big topic today but not a popular one few players wanted to talk much about the king of the blitz , not because they are afraid of inciting him but because they are tired of hearing his name sweet talk \? in a conference call with reporters today , the arizona coach reiterated what he said on monday to writers in arizona with phil simms gone and dave brown starting at quarterback , the giants have made an improvement most giants players merely laughed at that while those comments might provoke conversation , the more astonishing thing was the way ryan complimented brown , killing him with kindness instead of the blitz for now oh , i'm impressed , he said of brown i think their offense is the same offense they 've had for years except they 've just upgraded the quarterback position and by the way , ryan says he blitzes so much not to put pressure on the offense but to see what scheme the team is using to protect the quarterback if you do n't pick it up we 'll give you a dose of it , said ryan we 'll check your protection and find out how you 're picking it up , so it does n't make any difference who your quarterback is , it s the pickup scheme that we blitz philosophical difference giants coach dan reeves watched film of the cardinals and noticed one big change in the team s defensive philosophy under ryan the cardinals play more eightman fronts and are much more aggressive last season arizona played more of a fourman front that was not as aggressive but nonetheless stuffed the giants' running game in their two regularseason games many teams would rather gamble on defense like the cardinals do rather than be cautious on defense if a defense gambles it sometimes will surprise the offense , but the opposite often happens and the team scores on a long bomb or big run it is sometimes much harder to move the ball against a defense that lays back and does not attack what , reeves worry \? do some of ryan s comments and actions bother a respectful coach like reeves , a true professional who is also popular in the coaching community does n't bother me at all , said reeves , who is the antithesis of ryan coaches have to be the way they are i 've always felt my matchup with a coach was never important
the senate appropriations committee recommended yesterday that the 1702 million budget of the national endowment for the arts be cut by 5 percent in the next fiscal year the recommendation came as part of the committee s final drafting of an appropriations bill for the department of the interior and related agencies in an opening statement to the committee , the chairman , robert c byrd , democrat of west virginia , said none of this reduction is for state programs rather , all of it is directed at those grant programs which have been at the center of recent controversies mr byrd was referring to the endowment s grants in recent years to performance artists whose work , often on highly charged political and sexual themes , has drawn fierce criticism from conservatives most recently , controversy has surrounded a performance in march by the artist ron athey that was sponsored by the walker art center in minneapolis as part of the performance , mr athey , who has the aids virus , had assistants pierce his scalp with acupuncture needles and draw blood from his arms with hypodermic needles he also carved ritual incisions in the back of an assistant , creating patterns that he blotted on pieces of paper towel , which were then suspended over the audience from a clothesline a sternly worded letter on june 17 , mr byrd , along with senator don nickles , republican of oklahoma , sent a stern letter of complaint to jane alexander , the director of the endowment the letter said , without the benefit of your response that safeguards will be instituted immediately to insure that such grossly improper activities are not undertaken in the future , nea funding for fy 1995 is in serious jeopardy last week , in the house version of the bill providing endowment funds , democrats headed off a threat by republicans to cut 5 percent from the endowment s budget the house approved a bill with a 2 percent cut the senate s version of the bill now goes to the floor for debate , for which no date has yet been set
milwaukee , april 18 saying the health care system costs too much and does too little , president clinton took his campaign to change the system to the constituents of three friendly but uncommitted democratic members of congress today as representative gerald d kleczka of milwaukee and wisconsin s two senators , herb kohl and russell d feingold , looked on , the president sought to fire up their constituents , especially members of the communications workers of america the union members had gathered to hear him under the auspices of their telephone company employer , ameritech in a speech , mr clinton defended the provision of his plan calling for universal private insurance that would require employers to pay most of the cost of their workers' health insurance he maintained that the burden on small businesses would be much lighter than its opponents contended the event broke no new ground on the issue it was plainly intended for consumption locally , where it could make news without introducing anything new it was widely broadcast by television stations in this region and will certainly revive attention to the health care issue here , if only briefly pitches for lobbying mr clinton called on his audience to try to persuade your members of congress , without regard to party , that they can do this and be reelected he urged the audience to understand that representatives and senators needed that assurance because they were under tremendous pressure from opponents of one part of his program or another the only opponents he cited today were clerks at hospitals and insurance companies he said they might lose their jobs if his bill was enacted and the burden of paperwork on the health care system was lightened the strongest pitch today for grassroots lobbying came from the union s president , morton bahr , who told his members bluntly the higher the cost of health care , the lower the wages without everyone s being covered by health insurance , he said , companies like ameritech and workers like those in the audience would go on paying too much because they had to cover the care of workers whose bosses dodge their responsibility and do not insure their workers our task now is to mobilize the american people , mr bahr proclaimed he announced that members of the communications workers would be all over capitol hill this week pressing their representatives and senators for action the three members of congress praised mr clinton for making health care a prime public issue , though none have endorsed the bill he proposed mr kleczka told the audience of his wife s sister , a waitress without health insurance who became ill but waited until she had pneumonia before seeing a doctor in an emergency room last week this year we are going to pass major health care legislation , mr kohl promised , though he did not say what it should include mr feingold , in his remarks , referred to a weekend meeting of democratic senators near williamsburg , va , where cheaper variants of the clinton plan were raised by the majority leader , george j mitchell this sort of glacierlike issue is finally beginning to melt , mr feingold said photo president clinton leaving the white house yesterday on his way to milwaukee , where he spoke to members of the communication workers of america about his plan to revise health care \( associated press \)
in 1992 the environmental action coalition , in search of a laboratory for its federal research grant on recycling in public schools , decided on public school 84 on west 92d street in manhattan it seemed like a real new york school , said steve richardson , an official with the coalition , a nonprofit environmental education group ps 84 , which included the dual language middle school , had 950 students from a wide variety of backgrounds it was a new york school , richardson said , in that none of its students had received any training in recycling , even though the board of education has been legally required to have a comprehensive citywide recycling program in place since 1990 initially , the reaction among the kids was that it was n't their responsibility , said blair baker , who was then a teacher at ps 84 once they figured out it was , they totally got into it for the 199293 school year , the coalition , working with department of sanitation and board of education officials , instituted a wasteprevention and recycling program at ps 84 boxes , decorated by students , were provided to collect paper in each classroom , and designated shelves stored paper that had only been used on only one side assigned students collected the paper on fridays and walked the bags to the curb composting bins were constructed students took field trips to the fresh kills landfill on staten island contests to come up with alternative uses for garbage were held , and one first prize went to a world trade center model made out of a used pair of blue jeans leftover food was saved and donated to the homeless a marvelous experience , said sid morrison , the school s principal by the summer of 1993 , the waste generated by classrooms at ps 84 was negligible the waste from the cafeteria had been cut by a quarter custodians reported having to make one rather than three trips to put out the trash each day this year , mr morrison said , the school s ability to sustain its recycling and waste prevention levels was hurt by staff reductions and the ending of supplementary financing by the sanitation department and the board of education yes , we can do it , said mr morrison we can do it if the commitment from the top is there and real the children certainly seemed willing , mr richardson said kids are the key , and kids everywhere have shown they can become committed to it , he said and the schools have the kids
las vegas , nev , nov 6 george foreman crossed the line between athlete and icon saturday night and he did it with a punch he had been saving since the 1970 s the 45yearold evangelical preacher , his body a portly 250 pounds , became the oldest fighter ever to win a title in any weight class twenty years after he had surrendered the same title to muhammad ali s righthand knockout punch in zaire , foreman took it back by sending michael moorer down and out with a right hand in the 10th round until the moment he connected , foreman was clearly trailing in the fight on this planet , foreman said later , encompassing every known person , we will always know that the athlete of all athletes is between 45 and 55 strike a blow for liniment and keep it coming for foreman immediately spoke of facing another former champion , larry holmes , who will be 45 years old if we ever got into the ring together , the smell of bengay would be so great , nobody would even want a ringside seat , foreman said however , what foreman really wants to do now is rest from the ring , do some television talk shows and make a decision on his future in a week or so foreman was 19 years older than moorer and 28 pounds heavier when they stepped into the ring saturday night and while foreman s knockout punch traveled only two feet in space , it also cut across two decades in time on that night in zaire , when ali stunned him and the world , foreman wore bright red trunks on saturday night in las vegas , he wore those same trunks , now baggy and faded in a sense , foreman has come full circle and the line for his next opponents forms to the right would foreman want to meet the former champion mike tyson , currently in prison on a rape conviction but due to be released in march \? the fight of all fights , foreman s jubilant promoter , bob arum , said today foreman , more cautious about a potential tyson match , did not echo arum but arum does believe that foreman should fight next spring , perhaps against the last person he met before moorer that would be tommy morrison morrison defeated him 17 months ago , and foreman had n't fought since it made his victory over moorer all the more bizarre and wonderful going into the 10th round , foreman was trailing on the three judges' scorecards , and the fight was scheduled for only 12 rounds foreman disclosed after the victory that he had not planned an early attempt at a knockout but rather wanted his best shots to come later he was concerned that if he knocked moorer down too soon , the younger man would come back already , sports fans are likening this fight to one of the great moments , and upsets , in sports it was n't the odds , which were n't overwhelming it was something more this age gap , a sense of wonder and perhaps outrage that this slowfooted , ponderous stalker was even fighting for the championship and there was more foreman , who had not even fought between 1977 and 1987 , and whose subsequent comeback had finally seemed to run out of steam , was facing a southpaw champion with a 350 record in the end , foreman had a plan for moorer , but he almost ran out of time as for moorer , he had a plan for foreman , but could n't follow it through the idea was for moorer to fight foreman at an angle and avoid the heavy punches , especially foreman s everpresent left for most of the fight , moorer did what he was supposed to but he never really took charge , never seemed comfortable as the man who took two titles into the ring , from the international boxing federation and world boxing association champions should n't simply counter a blow , or throw a punch and wait for a response , as moorer did still , for much of the fight , the strategy worked foreman , meanwhile , got in his shots , too , but not as often in the ninth round , though , he started to tag moorer with a short right moorer was now facing foreman square up , exactly the stance the old fighter and his even older trainer , angelo dundee , wanted at the end of that round , both corners were anxious teddy atlas , moorer s trainer and allround guru , told him , michael , he s trying to sucker you with the right hand on the other side of the ring , dundee , who says he is 69 but lying about it , scolded foreman he reminded him he had only three rounds left but foreman said later that that was just what he wanted that , in fact , he had planned on an 11thround knockout instead , he whacked moorer several times with rights in the 10th then a really good shot sent a shudder through moorer foreman followed it with a left now foreman s feet were planted now moorer made the big mistake he crouched ever so slightly his chin was on a straight line with foreman s feared right it came straight and true and moorer never had a chance the way he fell , as if chopped , it was apparent that the referee , joe cortez , would count 10 over him the end of moorer s sixmonth reign came at 2 minutes 3 seconds , causing an eruption of sound , of cheering , as if this were the audience from a rocky movie actually , it was n't far from that the setting was the 15 , 000seat arena that is part of the 5 , 005room mgm grand hotel many of the fans were in on a pass , compliments of the casinos that reward their high rollers and probably many at ringside were rooting with their pocketbooks for old george still , the explosion of noise by most of the 12 , 127 present brought this night to somewhere between boxing and theater none of this was lost on foreman he alluded to the wizard of oz afterward , talking of bluebirds flying over the rainbow he even evoked pinocchio as he reflected of how , when you wish upon a star , your dreams come true this was for all my buddies in the nursing home and all the guys in the jail , he said magnanimously in victory , a triumph that swelled his record to 734 with 68 knockouts despite that mark , the wba refused to sanction the bout because of foreman s age and recent record but when arum took the case to court , the wba was forbidden to bring up foreman s age because that would violate federal discrimination laws arum won foreman wanted this fight badly enough to take a minimum of 15 million to moorer s 6 million it turned out , though , that foreman will take home about 35 million , most of which he shares with no one except the internal revenue service he is his own manager moorer will get about 7 million that will seem a piddling amount for foreman if he ever meets holmes , who is to fight oliver mccall in february for the world boxing council crown and certainly , if foreman is still around and still champion , a meeting with tyson could be even greater at the box office the fight of all fights , said arum arum , however , also understands foreman s dramatic thinking there are a lot of scenarios , arum conceded and the most appealing scenario you ca n't top this is to retire my inclination is that this is not what he wants to do photos george

rizo de oro , mexico , jan 15 there are no guns in this small farming community that pioneers cut from the rain forest some 30 years ago none , at least , that an outsider is allowed to see but signs of the insurrection that has shaken mexico since the year began are everywhere in the empty shacks of families who fled their rebel neighbors in terror in the uniform pants and laceup boots that have replaced threadbare trousers and ratty sandals in the swagger of younger men back from their first battles and the prideful things that their fathers say 'whole world is listening' the peasants have awakened and realized that they had to do something in order for them to listen to us , said carlos aguilar , 58 , who helped to found the community beside a cool mountain stream in the southern state of chiapas now the whole world is listening it seems as obvious as it is unspoken that the village rebels were organized and at least partly financed by leaders with a broader political agenda the central concerns of the men who remain here have to do with their families and their crops and their lack of means to maintain either the state capital is farther than some of them have traveled the government is almost an abstraction but even the unwillingness of people in rizo de oro to admit being part of the zapatista national liberation army does not keep them from baring the heart of its war on the government here , as in other villages and towns just north of mexico s border with guatemala , the ancient struggle of indian peasants for land and fair treatment has come crashing into the very symbols of hope that president carlos salinas de gortari has worked to create the sweeping changes in landtenure laws by the government , its free trade agreement with the united states and canada and even the shortcomings of its huge antipoverty program , add up to betrayal and nothing more to the people whose wooden shacks dot this lush valley at a time when economic and political change come to seem almost a constant in some other parts of mexico , such change still strikes the people who remain here as impossible if their poverty seems distant from the lives of many mexicans in the northern and central regions , where down payments have already been made on mr salinas s promises of greater prosperity , the zapatistas here also bear a strong resemblance to the striving , selfreliant people in other parts of the country who have drawn hope from the president s programs the story of rizo de oro is told one way by the families who stayed and another way by those who abandoned their homes on jan 6 , saying they felt threatened by neighbors who had joined the insurgents government officials and others familiar with the area have done little to clarify the accounts still , it is a revealing fragment of the story behind the first latin american rebel movement to emerge in the postcoldwar era , a force that burst from obscurity in the first moments of the new year to seriously threaten what mr salinas s supporters call his revolution unlike the guerrillas in guatemala , they are not seeking out bases of support among the campesinos , but coming up from them , said andres aubry , a frenchborn anthropologist who has lived and worked in chiapas for the last two decades , contrasting the leftist rebels who have fought the guatemalan government for 32 years with the insurgents who take their name from emiliano zapata , the peasant leader of mexico s 1910 revolution in that , they are like zapata himself the rebellion guerrillas strike , then fall back in the early hours of their rebellion , the zapatistas seized the state s secondlargest city , san cristobal de las casas and three sizable towns ocosingo , altamirano and las margaritas since retreating from those places and three more towns through which they passed , the insurgents have for the most part faded back into the remote villages and encampments from which they came the fighting , in which at least 100 people and perhaps many more have been killed , has died down sharply since the government declared a unilateral ceasefire on wednesday the rebel leaders , who remain mostly unidentified , did not immediately respond to mr salinas s offer of peace talks and a pardon for repentant peasant rebels the president expanded his offer in a nationally televised speech , saying he would call a special session of congress to pass a blanket amnesty for all those who committed violent actions in chiapas before 11 am on jan 16 he said subsequent violence would not be covered neither the rebels nor their commanders appear to be holding as adamantly as before to the idea that violence is the only solution to the problems of mexico s impoverished indians in a communique dated jan 6 , the indigenous revolutionary clandestine committee of the zapatista general command described its central objective as making known to the mexican people and the rest of the world the miserable conditions in which millions of mexicans , especially we indigenous people , live and die

the earth is scorched and the jails are full following turkey s massive spring offensive against kurdish guerrillas in southeastern turkey and northern iraq the offensive involved 300 , 000 troops and militiamen according to amnesty international usa , 600 kurdish villages have now been evacuated , with four settlements bombed on a single march day other human rights groups detail unpunished killings of journalists , the criminalizing of parliamentary speech and the jailing of turkish kurds for espousing separatist propaganda to all protests , turkey offers a reflexive reply the kurdish rebels are terrorists true , leftist guerrillas known as pkk are responsible for hundreds of killings , including \( in the words of amnesty international \) children , teachers , local politicians and other civilians but whatever its offenses , the pkk , or kurdish workers' party , is not armed by the us turkey is economic assistance for the current fiscal year is 100 million , military loans total 453 million and direct training is 1 million add to that direct arms sales of 13 billion for 40 singleengine f16 s turkey is a nato ally and seeks entry into the european union so it is a matter of valid western concern when turkey s war against kurds escalates , when free speech is throttled and the political track forgotten as soldiers focus relentlessly on a military solution to a nineyear rebellion before his death early last year , president turgut ozal was seeking a political opening to kurds and the insurgents , for their part , instituted a unilateral ceasefire now the soldiers appear to dominate president suleyman demirel and prime minister tansu ciller , the first woman to lead a turkish government ankara makes much of the fact that the turkish parliament every six months renews its agreement as it did this june , for the sixth time to let us warplanes use turkish bases to protect kurds in northern iraq americans are reminded that president ozal gave full support to operation desert storm it also needs to be said that iraqi kurds themselves are engaging in a violent vendetta between rival factions still , none of this fairly immunizes turkey from criticism and scrutiny , especially since turkish warplanes and troops routinely cross the iraqi frontier in hot pursuit of kurdish rebels bridling at criticism , prime minister ciller threatens to end us arms purchases if congress persists in demanding a 25 percent cut on human rights grounds but concern over an escalating conflict fought with us weapons is scarcely a hostile act americans have learned at tragic cost that scorching villages spreads the very nationalism governments wish to contain and jailing kurdish members of parliament for speaking their minds seems a peculiar way of promoting a political settlement of a bad war
after months of waiting , owners of hundreds of manhattan apartments now stand to learn who paid off the managers of their buildings to gain lucrative plumbing , renovation and hardware supply contracts under court order , the manhattan district attorney s office yesterday made public the names of seven companies cited in the indictments in june of 48 managing agents and the guilty pleas of 37 more managing agents and companies they were charged with extorting kickbacks from the contracting businesses in what prosecutors called an industrywide corruption pattern the charges capped a threeyear investigation that officials said touched many of the city s leading real estate companies and highlighted the systematic extortion of untold millions of dollars from contractors seeking work in hundreds of condominium and cooperative residential buildings , costs passed on over many years to unwitting shareholders and owners some of those bilked rushed yesterday to match the names of the contractors with invoices from work in their buildings to see whether they might be in line for restitution because the payers of the money were portrayed as victims , and in many cases were cooperating with the investigation , they were not identified at the time and have not been been charged with any crime but in response to a judge s order granting a defense demand for particulars of the charges , the district attorney , robert m morgenthau , yesterday translated a code used in the indictments to shield the companies cited as having made payoffs they were identified as central pump plumbing of brooklyn chelsea hardware of manhattan fred smith plumbing of manhattan m kraus plumbing of manhattan richardson lucas , a waterproofing and renovation company , of manhattan steinman plumbing of manhattan , and utility painting of manhattan the specific buildings or contracts linked to the payoffs were not detailed except for chelsea hardware , none of the companies or their representatives returned calls william aronwald , a lawyer for chelsea , said , to the extent the district attorney identified chelsea as having made payments as the result of extortionate demands , those allegations or assertions are essentially correct but he added , chelsea did not make payments just because it wanted to make payments rather , he said , the company was a victim of a corrupt system that forced vendors to make payoffs to survive he said it was possible that in some cases vendors initiated the payoffs , but he blamed the system as fostering such dealings the disclosure of names yesterday does not mean that only seven contractors and suppliers made payoffs , said daniel j castleman , chief of the investigative division it s fair to say that more contractors are involved as targets , he said he also said the investigation had broadened to include other managing agents , contractors and superintendents the release of names was welcomed by cooperative and condominium shareholders and owners and their representatives it s the first specific information through which buildings can identify the potential transactions where they were victimized , said marc luxemberg , president of the council of new york cooperatives , representing some 1 , 800 buildings before , he said , we had only one side of the equation now we can have a more complete picture where the losses came peter canter , an accountant working for three manhattan coops , said he would seek to match the list of contractors and agents for leads to potential overcharges of his buildings and possible lawsuits also , he said , we should n't continue relationships with contractors who bribed our agents the district attorney s office also yesterday announced the names of three former agents for brown harris stevens who pleaded guilty to scheming to defraud they were identified as mark harris , 75 , of glen cove , li eileen malone , 51 , of bronxville , ny , and herbert ross \( no age given \) of queens all were sentenced to a conditional discharge upon payment a restitution
to the question of how many homosexuals are there in america \? a new nationwide study has provided a striking range of numbers and an unanswered question of its own what is a homosexual \? after all , there is no agreement whether homosexuality is a matter of selfidentification , behavior , desire or a combination of these further , the study found pronounced differences between the numbers of gay men and women who live in cities and those in smaller communities , and between those with college educations and those without there are hints , too , of racial distinctions , although these figures may be statistically insignificant the study of 3 , 432 americans from 18 to 59 years of age was conducted by a team of researchers based at the university of chicago and made public earlier this month since then , much attention has focused on its finding that 28 percent of the men and 14 percent of the women identified themselves as homosexual or bisexual for many years , the conventional wisdom was that 1 in 10 american men was homosexual , a number attributed to a 1948 kinsey report but in april 1993 , a survey of male sexual behavior found that about 2 percent of the men had engaged in homosexual sex in the past decade the authors of the new study , the social organization of sexuality \( university of chicago press \) , are the first to say that theirs is not the last word to fetishize 28 as if this is solid to that level of precision is a mistake , said stuart michaels , a researcher at the university of chicago who is an author of the new report and the project manager of the survey and it is to miss the point to quantify or count something requires unambiguous definition , mr michaels and his coauthors wrote and we lack this in speaking of homosexuality moreover , they said , estimates in the survey were likely to be lower than actual numbers , since many homosexuals were probably reluctant to report certain behaviors or feelings to the interviewers even with those qualifications , the findings may explain why many people who live outside big cities never believed that 1 in 10 of their neighbors was homosexual , and why many city dwellers responded incredulously to reports that only 1 man in 50 was homosexual the reality in a big city like new york is different , said robert t michael , dean of the harris graduate school of public policy studies at the university of chicago and another author of the study in the united states' dozen largest cities , 102 percent of the men and 21 percent of the women reported having had a sexual partner of their own sex in the last year asked about their entire adulthoods , 164 percent of the men and 62 percent of the women said they had had at least one sexual partner of their own sex in rural areas , 1 percent of the men and sixtenths of 1 percent of the women reported a sexual partner of the same sex in the last year for their entire adulthoods , the figures were 15 percent for men and 28 percent for women larger cities are magnets for migration , the authors suggested , because of their generally higher tolerance , less scrutiny by neighbors , more work and leisure opportunities and wellestablished gay groups and neighborhoods educational levels seem to have a strong bearing on selfidentification , the study concluded , particularly for women for example , only fourtenths of 1 percent of women with less than a high school education identify themselves as lesbian in contrast , 36 percent of those with a college degree do so paula a brantner , interim legal director of the national center for lesbian rights in san francisco , said she was not surprised by the findings without the sense of security offered by a college degree , she said , many people ca n't afford , both financially and psychologically , to come out along racial lines , 15 percent of the black men surveyed identified themselves as homosexual or bisexual , as opposed to 3 percent of the white men sixtenths of 1 percent of the black women did so , compared with 17 percent of the white women to many africanamericans , 'gay' or 'lesbian' still have the ring of being white terms , tied up with white identity , said donald suggs , director of public affairs for the gay and lesbian alliance against defamation , when asked about that finding so too , he said , did the clinicalsounding word homosexual mr suggs said black people tend to see themselves less in terms of sexual orientation and more in terms of their racial identity how much political effect the new survey will have is open to debate for representative barney frank , a massachusetts democrat who is gay , the answer is , none whatever how many members of the nra are there \? mr frank added i do n't know i do n't think my colleagues know what s important politically is not how many there are , but what you do about it the extent to which you mobilize enormously outweighs the numbers randall l sell , a doctoral candidate at the harvard school of public health who has studied the prevalence of homosexuality , asked regarding the overall number why should we care \? most of the reasons people tend to be talking about are civil rights , where it just does n't matter but the rev lou sheldon , chairman of the traditional values coalition , based in anaheim , calif , said the new numbers spoke very decisively to the political fate of antidiscrimination measures or domesticpartner provisions , as well as to efforts to repeal such laws in certain inner cities , we know the progay movement is stronger , mr sheldon said but politically , the leverage is not there when you take the numbers and spread them across america robert h knight , director of cultural studies for the family research council in washington , said , the numbers show that americans do n't have to succumb to the idea that any and all forms of sexual expression are desirable graphs demographics differences in the homosexual population shows men and women who reported having sexual partners of the same sex last year \( source the social organization of sexuality , university of chicago press \)

washington , march 24 the house surprised even itself today and voted lopsidedly , 315 to 110 , to make virtually all lobbyists report how much they spend to influence congress , and to ban altogether the meals and gifts they have long rained on lawmakers it was the most muscular attempt to curtail the influence of money on the lawmaking process since at least 1989 , when congress enacted broad ethics reforms , and the first overhaul of the rules governing lobbyists since 1946 despite some complaints that the measure did not go far enough , some democrats who have crusaded in the last year to repair congress s sorry public image proclaimed it a huge step forward this is a very strong bill , said eric fingerhut , a firstterm democrat from ohio who has become the house scold on issues of financial ethics it goes much farther than i ever thought we 'd be able to go through this house the bill s chief democratic sponsor , representative john bryant of texas , predicted that the prohibitions on gifts and other favors would become stricter at the next stop in the legislative process a conference to combine the house bill with a less stringent measure that the senate passed last year it s been a good day for political reform , said senator carl levin of michigan , the democratic sponsor of the senate bill the bill passed today intends to control lobbyists' influence on legislation in at least three ways first , it rewrites the legal definition of a lobbyist , now vague , to include anyone who is paid more than 2 , 500 in any six months , or any group or firm that spends more than 10 , 000 a year , to influence government action second , it requires them to file twiceayear reports disclosing their clients , the issues they are working on , their income and expenses and the congressional and federal offices they visit , among other matters finally , the bill bars lobbyists from giving legislators or their aides meals , gifts , entertainment , trips or anything else of more than inconsequential value , like coffee and doughnuts house members can currently accept no more than 250 in gifts from any one person in a year , but that does not include meals , trips or any gift worth less than 100 mr bryant and many other lawmakers said their behavior would not change because they do not socialize with lobbyists nearly as much as the public believes a washington lawyer and tax lobbyist , allen klein , agreed very little of my business has been done over lunch , he said it s going to have a positive effect on the public perception , but it s going to have a very limited effect on the way business is done here neither mr bryant nor many other supporters had suspected earlier today that the legislation would pass so easily , if at all for one thing , it came to the floor , under a procedure that allowed a mere onethird of lawmakers to defeat it rather than the majority of no votes generally demanded surprising opposition the gloominess was deepened by a lastminute call for defeat from an unexpected quarter the powerful public interest lobby , common cause the group contended that lawmakers had opened a loophole in the measure by applying the bans on gifts , meals and plush travel only to lobbyists but not to the corporations that hire them in the end , however , most house members appeared to conclude that the public opprobrium they risked by opposing tighter rules would be more painful than the rules themselves , and they slowly lined up behind the measure about a dozen members who had cast no votes earlier in the roll call switched to yes when it became apparent that passage was inevitable that followed a debate in which lawmaker after lawmaker asserted that house members honorable , most wonderful people who work extraordinarily hard , committed to doing good in the finest democratic institution in the world have been wounded by the mistaken perception that they can be swayed by free skiing vacations , tickets to national football league games and dinners in fourstar restaurants the people who work here are wonderful people , but we have a problem , representative thomas m barrett , democrat of wisconsin , said in a typical oration the problem is that people perceive that we have special privileges that they are not entitled to no free lunches anymore representative vic fazio , democrat of california , added , every member of this congress came here for a reason and no one , no one came here for a free lunch that said , the goodbye to free lunches that the house bid today was extraordinarily long , and at times seemed close to tearful the senate lobbying bill , passed last may , requires only lobbyists , not lawmakers , to disclose favors worth more than 20 that are given to senators or staff members but instead of referring the measure to a committee , the house delegated its version of the bill to an ad hoc task force of eight highranking republicans and democrats

price battles are breaking out in the deepdiscount broker business , leaving some firms shellshocked , some on the attack and some posing as noncombatants through all the smoke , savvy investors will discern one thing the spoils of war the first shot was fired in january by national discount brokers , based in new york a new subsidiary of the sherwood group , an investment and research firm with 80 million in 1993 sales , national heavily advertised a flat fee of 30 a trade , topped by a 3 handling charge the fee applied to all overthecounter trades and to trades of fewer than 5 , 000 shares of listed stocks for larger listed deals , the firm tacked on a penny a share on the whole order the 33 fee undercut many discounters , particularly on larger trades the industry s average fee for trading 1 , 000 shares of a 5 stock was 72 last year , according to the american association of individual investors national s debut plus a skittish stock market that may slow the broker business has prompted aggressive competition among deep discounters , said mark d coler , president of mercer inc , a new york research firm it s like a gas war , with a station on each corner and a new price every day , said kenneth kraska , president of the r j forbes group , a deep discount broker in melville , li for investors , the benefits extend beyond falling prices to flat fees that vastly simplify the search for the least expensive deepdiscount broker and , while service counts , too , price is of high importance in this economyminded industry several of these very cheap brokers who handle about 20 percent of a discount market dominated by charles schwab , fidelity and quick reilly have sharply dropped their minimum transaction fee , which is the lowest price charged regardless of trade size on april 1 , forbes dropped its minimum from 45 to 35 , and a month later , etrade , a computeronly discounter in palo alto , calif , reduced its minimum from 35 to 25 these fee reductions , at 22 percent and 28 percent , are big bites and shrinking minimums are just one front in the war brown company , a large deep discounter based in boston , used to charge 25 plus 3 cents a share for trading listed stocks , and 25 and 2 cents a share for unlisted ones as of june 1 , the fee is a flat 29 , for listed and unlisted trades , up to 5 , 000 shares to trade 1 , 000 shares of a listed equity , brown will now get 29 , not 55 a 47 percent drop do the cuts hurt the brokers \? anybody who says they like competition is a liar , said george brown , president of the company bearing his name at fidelity s spartan brokerage , trading 500 shares at 50 cost 64 until yesterday now , the bostonbased discounter charges 55 a 14 percent difference these percentage savings vary with trade size , even within the same company the guy who set the fire is feeling the heat , too two days after brown moved to 29 , national dropped its price for unlisted trades from 30 to 25 and dispensed with the 3 handling charge prices are getting simpler as well as lower traditionally , discounters use intricate fee formulas that include many aspects of a trade share number , dollar value , share price but some discounters , reacting to national s opening salvo , are adopting flat fees for listed stocks at etrade and national , and for listed and unlisted stocks at brown , the new flat fees cover all trades of fewer than 5 , 000 shares and for unlisted trades at national , etrade and forbes , the sky s the limit you can do a billion shares at the flat rate , said mr kraska of forbes of course , as its rivals hasten to point out , national did not invent the flat fee many discounters use pershare prices , usually 1 to 3 cents , subject to overall deal minimums combined , these features act as a flat fee at 2 cents a share and a 34 transaction minimum , investors at lombard institutional brokerage , based in san francisco , will pay an effective flat rate of 34 for all trades of listed stocks between 1 and 1 , 700 shares however , given the range of minimums and pershare charges , these formulas usually operate as flat fees only up to about 2 , 300 shares , and often fewer the new , nationalinspired flat rates simplify much larger trades clarity is coming elsewhere , too at spartan , the old fee schedule had 28 pages listing 1 , 400 transactions the new one needs just a few phrases 40 plus 3 cents a share for trades under 5 , 000 shares , and 40 plus 2 cents a share for trades over 5 , 000 shares all subject to a 45 minimum for investors , this simplicity may have more value than falling prices with straightforward fees , they can find the cheapest broker without laborious calculation and who the cheapest broker is will change much less with trade size but the new pricing at spartan wo n't help all investors equally people who trade in large amounts get a bigger discount under the new fees , said donna morris , a fidelity senior vice president some smaller traders may even pay more under the new method , and small trades are broadly defined trading 300 shares at 30 a 9 , 000 deal costs 44 under the old system , and 49 under the new spartan further segments the market by requiring 40 trades a year and an account minimum of 20 , 000 similarly , investors may like national s 25 flat fee for overthecounter trades , but , for listed trades , they may find a better deal than its 33 fee \( why the 8 difference \? because national can execute unlisted orders inhouse through an affiliate , sherwood securities \) investor wariness will still pay off , too lombard s 34 minimum may look cheaper than forbes s 35 but lombard has a 250 handling charge forbes has none and brokers quickly remind salivating investors that service still counts if it were all about price , we 'd all have yugos , said lombard s president , v eric roach lombard offers such benefits as realtime stock prices and a ratio of one customerservice person for every two brokers ms morris likes service , too spartan may cost more than some , but it is a serviceintensive deepdiscount broker that is open around the clock and has fidelity s big resources behind it computer and telephone trading , noload mutual fund investing and interest payments on cash balances are other valuable services some discounters provide but lower prices , not service , are today s news will they be tomorrow s \? i think we 'll see more , mr brown said large players like brown and national may fear this prospect but small ones are even grimmer we 're fine now , mr kraska said but i ca n't see going any lower photo national discount brokers touched off a price war early this year with print advertisements like the one at far left brown company and the rj forbes group soon joined battle graph falling prices prices charged by deep discount brokers for trading 500 shares of a 30 overthecounter stock source the new york times
millions of investors who flocked to closedend municipal bonds funds last year looking for taxfree income have been sorely disappointed this year the funds lost an average 83 percent of their value in the first four months of the year , compared with a 63 percent drop in taxable bond funds people looking for a silver lining will find that closedend municipal funds are now selling at the lowest prices in years closedend funds issue a fixed number of shares and trade like common stock on major exchanges they usually trade at prices that represent a discount or a premium to the underlying value of their holdings thomas j herzfeld , a miamibased trader and analyst of closedend funds , said the municipal funds , which have almost always sold at hefty premiums , are now trading at discounts averaging 3 percent closedend funds are most attractive when selling at a discount , because if the price rises merely to the level of the underlying securities , it will produce a capital gain for shareholders municipals' low prices are unwarranted , many market professionals say investors have overreacted to the recent backup in interest rates and have driven fund prices lower by indiscriminately selling into market weakness , said anthony n maltese , senior analyst for closedend funds at smith barney shearson closedend municipal funds were introduced in 1986 there are now more than 200 , with assets of more than 516 billion part of the reason for their popularity is that the funds' yields can surpass those of mutual funds , which are priced by their net asset value closedend funds can leverage their portfolios , magnifying both potential gains and losses the ability to leverage paid off handsomely as interest rates declined over the last three years for many years , demand for the funds fueled sales and kept prices high that began to change in late 1993 , when john nuveen company , the most prolific of the closedend fund sponsors , was forced to withdraw seven new funds for lack of demand last year , 77 issues came to market so far this year , there have been none as demand dwindled , premiums turned to discounts on the funds when the federal reserve began pushing up shortterm interest rates early this year , it spelled more trouble most of the funds own longterm issues , which are particularly vulnerable to rising interest rates those that leverage suffered most net asset values went the way of trading prices down consequently , most investors who bought municipal funds last fall are sitting on large losses buyers of newer issues have been hit especially hard because those issues came to market with hefty underwriting costs built into their share prices because bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices , the funds' yields have risen to more than 7 percent from less than 6 percent last fall although obscured by interestrate problems , the municipal bond market is technically strong , said colin mathews , an analyst of closedend funds at morningstar inc over the last three years , municipalities issued many bonds to refinance older debt that had higher rates in 1993 , refinancing accounted for 60 percent of new issues but rising interest rates this year have made refinancing less attractive the number of new bond issues is running 30 percent behind the yearearlier pace , mr mathews said these factors suggest weak supply but demand for the bonds , which generate taxfree income , is expected to be strong because of higher top tax rates in addition , the market s longterm fundamentals look good , mr maltese said fed tightening should slow economic growth , he said , and investors will gradually move to longerterm bonds for the extra yield while closedend municipal funds are cheap by historical standards , the analysts advise investors to look beyond prices because munis still have room to fall , riskaverse investors should avoid funds that use leverage until interest rates settle down , said mr mathews he recommends nuveen municipal value , which uses no leverage investors willing to accept slightly more risk can reap higher yields in the leveraged funds mr maltese says prices of the leveraged funds have been under severe selling pressure because investors mistakenly believe that any drop in shortterm rates will severely crimp dividend payments he maintains that the funds have cash on hand to pay dividends and are less sensitive to interest rates his picks \? four investmentgrade funds sponsored by nuveen insured municipal opportunity , premier insured , premier muni income and quality income mr mathews likes the junk municipal funds lowerrated issues are less sensitive to interestrate changes and thus held up relatively well in the first quarter also , junk bonds tend to perform well as the economy strengthens mr mathews recommends mfs municipal income , an unleveraged fund with a 12month yield of 77 percent not everyone is a junk fan mr maltese says junk funds are a bad bet because of the weak economic recovery and big deficits in state budgets investors holding large losses might consider bond fund swaps , said mr herzfeld , the analyst in miami by selling shares at a loss and then buying shares in a similar fund , an investor can lock in a tax loss but keep the same market position graph showing the difference between the average share price and net asset value per share for national closedend municipal bond funds \( source thomas j herzfeld advisors \)
mineola , li , feb 28 the long island lighting company and one of its longtime critics , the state consumer protection chief , clashed today over whether a recent advertising campaign by the utility accurately represents the effects of the company s proposed rate freeze for 1995 and 1996 at a news conference today , richard m kessel , executive director of the state consumer protection board , said that even with the rate freeze lilco would still be charging more because of increased fuel adjustment charges , which are authorized to compensate for lower electric sales and other expenses he complained that lilco s advertisements failed to mention these increases and were misleading but suzanne halpin , a lilco spokeswoman , said the ads were accurate and stated very specifically that we 're proposing a twoyear freeze in base electric rates while ms halpin acknowledged that some increase under the fueladjustment clause was likely , she said that it was an entirely separate matter from the rate freeze and should not detract from the freeze s potential savings to customers of as much as 300 million mr kessel is trying to make an issue where none exists , ms halpin said surprise for long islanders the dispute comes two months after each side submitted competing rate proposals to the state public service commission the utility requested a freeze of its base rate for 1995 and 1996 , followed by a 4 percent increase in 1997 mr kessel proposed a total freeze for at least three years lilco s proposed freeze surprised many long islanders as a sharp departure from the increases that had been anticipated as part of its agreement with the state to close the shoreham nuclear power plant since that 10year settlement was reached in 1989 , the base electric rate here has gone up about 4 to 5 percent each year to allow lilco to repay the 56 billion debt incurred in building the plant as a result , electric bills here , among the highest in the nation , have become a political issue , and lilco s proposed freeze , made possible by low interest rates and reduced oil costs , was a publicrelations gain a 467 , 000 promotion after the freeze proposal was announced , the utility spent about 467 , 000 on television and newspaper advertisements and inserts in customers' bills to tout the proposal and the savings it would bring the utility did not mention the estimated rate increase of 1 to 2 percent it expects over the next two years because of lowerthanexpected electric sales , mr kessel said mr kessel , who filed a complaint about the campaign with the public service commission today , contended that lilco was hiding its increase under the fueladjustment charges , which were adopted in the late 1970 s to help utilities cope with the fluctuating cost of oil since that problem no longer exists , he said , the provision should be dropped but lilco officials said that the public service commission allowed utilities to use the charge , and they defended it as an accepted part of the ratesetting process
washington , aug 26 in a memorandum to democratic candidates earlier this summer , representative vic fazio , chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee , could not have been clearer health care will be the key to the '94 elections but now that the white house and congressional leaders have essentially abandoned their push for universal health insurance before november , democrats are confronted with a far more delicate challenge preventing health care from becoming the key to their defeat from president clinton on down , leading democrats had looked to health care to save their party from widespread losses in the november elections even when the white house was in the thick of whitewater and no one seemed to give mr clinton credit for an improved economy or anything else , democrats implored the naysayers to just wait when democratic incumbents delivered on their party s promise of health coverage for all , they said , they would be rewarded on election day a big enough issue \? instead , the democrats , already jittery about november , find themselves with three options , none particularly appealing passing a modest package of changes before november , and billing them as progress , the first step to universal coverage or pointing the finger at uncooperative republicans for blocking a bill \( although moderate democrats may be as much to blame \) or changing subjects altogether to campaign on successes like the crime bill but while crime is a surefire electionyear issue , it may not be one that gives democrats a big edge over republicans no candidate supports lawlessness administration officials say they will try to portray whatever congress may pass this year on health as the first step to an overhaul effort that can continue next year not as a capitulation on mr clinton s vow for universal coverage but that might be a hard sell because the white house has devoted the past year to trying to persuade the public that health care was the most critical issue , and that universal coverage had to be the centerpiece unfulfilled pledges they really blew it , said martin wattenberg , a political science professor at the university of california at irvine people will see this as , 'we gave control to the democrats and they still could n't do anything' voters do n't have a very long memory what they remember is a party that pledged itself to this as the top priority , but when push came to shove , they did n't do anything pledges like this one by donna e shalala , secretary of health and human services , may come back to haunt the democrats this is about universal coverage , dr shalala said in an interview earlier this summer universal coverage has got to be part of it while some in the party see an opportunity to attack republicans in the stalemate that dragged down big health bills , others think it is better to move on while failing to do a comprehensive health care bill can never help you , said former representative tom downey of new york , a democrat with close ties to the white house , wringing your hands can hurt you more what the democrats have got to do is change the subject and talk about other things on the agenda , like gatt , superfund and telecommunications how much do voters care \? it may be too late mr clinton has dwelt on health overhaul since taking office , pushing it to the top of the national agenda , and there is no evidence that the issues like telecommunications even register with many voters a new york times cbs news poll in late july found that 8 in 10 americans said it was very important that every citizen receive health insurance coverage while many democrats acknowledge that the latest turn in the health care debate is bad news for them , it may not be devastating despite the polls that showed wide public support for a health care overhaul , lobbying efforts by opponents have also left many americans frightened that their current coverage would be reduced , or , at the very least , confused by the assortment of proposals and counterproposals the issue has been so unsettled that it has not moved front and center in campaigns there were virtually no television campaign commercials on health care because candidates were waiting to see what happened and if a comprehensive bill may have been doomed because the issue never took off , for the same reason , voters may not care enough to punish incumbents for not producing one the public support for major reform is less than it was at the beginning of this debate , said senator jeff bingaman , a new mexico democrat who is running for reelection this year to a large extent that is because campaigns to raise people s concerns and to increase doubts were very successful some democrats may even be relieved that even as congress tries to patch together some sort of bill , they no longer have to cast what might have been a politically perilous vote on a major package lawrence r jacobs , a professor who specializes in health and politics at the university of minnesota , said the failure to tackle comprehensive reform did not have to be fatal if incumbents , democrats or republican , could justify their own positions need 'coherent explanation' though it seems reasonable to expect that democrats will get hurt on this , i do n't think the fact that the house of health is crumbling will lead to a major fallout in terms of congressional races , mr jacobs said members need to be able to go home and provide a coherent explanation for their position they will try to put the best face on a bad situation by portraying the republicans as opposed to change , locked in old ways he said mr clinton could point to the health care quagmire as a reason to elect more democrats in november he has every reason to frame this as a referendum issue 'give me a congress i can work with , ' mr jacobs said though the democrats are searching for other issues to run on , frank luntz , a republican pollster , said his party had put itself at much at risk as the democrats by not moving on health care overhaul it will play against incumbents because it will suggest that congress just does n't function anymore , he said the challenge for both parties is twofold successfully blaming the other the republicans have to communicate what they prevented , that sometimes it s better to do nothing than do something harmful some democrats hold the view that people beyond the capital will not be disappointed because they never expected congress to pass a sweeping bill in the first place maybe i'm the naive optimist out here in the other washington , said charles rolland , chairman of the washington democratic party but if we have to take a smaller step than originally intended for the first step , the voters will understand
gay and lesbian standup comics are not exactly new to prime time shows like wnyc s in the life and comedy central s out there have paved the way to wider exposure tonight hbo opens the electronic closet s door even wider with two backtoback editions of comedy halfhour suzanne westenhoefer is featured in the first , bob smith in the second both performers appeared earlier in out there , an all gayandlesbian comedy special as far as show business is concerned , what would have been unthinkable in the 1980 s is becoming almost commonplace today interviewed on a local news program this week , the singer melissa etheridge spoke matteroffactly about how being a lesbian affects or , equally significant , does n't affect her work amanda bearse of fox s married with children , thought to be the only openly gay actress on a regular primetime series , is the host of the second production of out there , on comedy central on oct 11 , national coming out day finally allowed to be themselves , and bolstered by the weeklong celebrations of stonewall 25 , performers are increasingly pulverizing traditional images of gay men and lesbians as society s outsiders tonight s hbo shows were taped before largely gay audiences , and the material is given some insider spins , but all audiences well , most audiences should come away with a few insights and a lot of laughs ms westenhoefer takes a direct approach as she joyfully swoons over heroes like martina navratilova and k d lang no apologies , and none needed like most gay comics , she has a knack for turning the conventional on its head wedding showers \? i do n't bring a gift anymore , she says , i take one away and , oh yes i really like straight people i just do n't want them teaching our kids mr smith is no doubt more accessible to general audiences as an amiable , sort of boynextdoor type , he chats easily about growing up in buffalo , in a very conservative roman catholic family he plays with stereotypes that , of course , are molded from truth he says that he knew early on that he was a gay kid , slyly confiding that my treehouse had a breakfast nook even as a boy scout , he swears , his swiss army knife had a melon baller and a garlic press other children might have brought apples to the teacher , he says , but i brought baked pears alicia in high school , he discovered a head start program for homosexuals drama club if not explicitly confrontational , mr smith is adept at needling doing a riff on the catholic church s stand on homosexuality , he says he himself has decided that it s ok to be catholic as long as you do n't practice catholicism as for a gay agenda , he calls for full civil rights and wants our national anthem to have a 25minute dance version all in all , ms westenhoefer and mr smith are rattling preconceived notions that s as good a goal as any for standup comedy comedy halfhour hbo , tonight suzanne westenhoefer , at 11 bob smith at 11 30 produced by john moffitt and pat tourk lee directed by mr moffitt
to the editor in arguing against the use of community ratings for setting health insurance premiums \( do n't hand the young the health bill , viewpoints , july 24 \) , m l mitchell and richard thau contend that because the average 25yearold consumes 560 in health care a year and the average 55yearold consumes 2 , 345 , it is unfair to charge the same premium for both by this reasoning , it is even more unfair that 55yearolds are taxed to pay the cost of public education because they consume virtually none of this service because nearly all public education services are consumed by those 25 and younger , they should pay taxes proportional to their consumption of the product but let s look at it this way the taxes we pay for education and the community rating premiums we would pay for health care are the dues we should pay for membership in our society for education , the costs are largely backloaded for health , they would be largely frontloaded we should stop intergenerational quibbling and get about promoting the classical notion of a citizenry sound in mind and healthy in body alfred p maurice vancouver , wash , july 25 the writer is professor emeritus at the university of illinois at chicago
fire island , li in the old days , lighthouse beach was for the birds no one can say , exactly , when the nude sunbathers discovered it but it made sense that they chose this quiet stretch of seashore to be left alone who thought they would have company \? but they do , lots of it the restored fire island lighthouse is bringing loads of visitors to the beach , including children problems \? and how what you have is two groups who 've started coming in much greater numbers , said jack hauptman , who oversees the beach as superintendent of fire island national park and whenever you have two groups , there s going to be competition actually , nudists are beach garbos they 've been quiet but the lighthouse preservation society , which has worked for 10 years and raised 1 million to restore the lighthouse , wants the world to see this beacon on the beach without distraction it wants the nude sunbathers out of mind , and therefore out of sight , at least near the lighthouse we just do n't think it s appropriate for nude sunbathing in front of a national historic site , said gayle e haines , the society s president we do n't think it s right when schoolchildren are around in part , the problem is location the beach is just east of robert moses state park , on the fire island national seashore many visitors to the lighthouse use the state park s easternmost parking lot and walk a quarter mile on the beach to reach the lighthouse , passing nudists galore along the way , ms haines said now , the children come in buses that park square by the lighthouse but the children go on field trips along the beach i 've spoken to teachers who 've said it was a problem , ms haines said teenagers , especially , are embarrassed to see them this is n't the first time the preservation society has raised its hackles over the sunbathers a few years ago , a lighthouse preservation society board member was so fired up about the nudists that he wrote letter after letter to long island legislators , to the national park service and to the president \( of the united states \) but within the preservation society , there were dissenters who thought this was much ado about no clothes and the preservation society , mindful of fire island s liberal history , is taking pains to stress that it does n't want to ban anyone from anywhere ban is verboten one of the things about fire island is that it s known for tolerance , mr hauptman said the nudists have been coming to the beach for as long as most people can remember , he said , with never a problem i think it s a nonissue , just silly , said nancy , a bather from manhattan who would not divulge her full name you do n't have to see nude bathers to get to the lighthouse , and most naturalists do n't want to be gawked at by kids , anyway but the lighthouse is attracting more and more visitors and it expects more , especially school groups the society plans to build a learning center next door that will offer lessons on lighthouses , keepers , lifesaving and barrier beach dynamics it s very hard as a teacher , said ms gaines , who has led groups on educational tours if you 're talking to kids about barrier beach dynamics or explaining the importance of dunes and they see some nude sunbathers well , it s hard enough to keep the attention of kids these days what about a few life lessons \? lighthouse beach offers a rare opportunity to educate children about the frailty of the human condition kids have to learn sooner or later why the almighty invented clothes sure , mrs gaines said a creative teacher is one that makes a lesson out of something that might otherwise interrupt a lesson but you ca n't do that with this ! this is not on the new york state curriculum none of the visitors to the lighthouse who fill out comment forms mentions the nudists , mr hauptman said they just praise the beach , he said but he plans to meet with friends of lighthouse beach , a nudist group , in the next few days one idea mr hauptman has is for the group to post signs alerting lighthouse visitors to the clothingoptional beach areas it used to be done in an informal way , he said there 'd be orange flags staked on the beach now , we 'll make sure people will know there might be nude sunbathers some new signs are already up and mr hauptman figures there will probably have to be an area offlimits to the sunbathers this is not a big deal , he said anyway , in a week the issue will be moot summer is ending , at least as far as the academic calendar the world follows the sunbathers will go away , leaving lighthouse beach to the peregrine falcons and hawks maybe , ms gaines said i 've heard that as long as the sun is out , she said , the sunbathers will come
vandenberg air force base , calif , july 29 an intercontinental missile being shipped by rail from wyoming was hit by apparently random gunfire that caused at least 11 million in damage , the air force said today bullets gashed the first and second stages of the 70 million missile , an mx , but it was not in danger of exploding , officials said some parts will be salvaged for use elsewhere , the air force said a base spokesman , maj billy birdwell , said , in the days of dwindling budgets and the fact that we 're not producing the mx anymore , to lose one like this is outrageous the missile , disassembled and packed in unmarked boxcars , was shipped by train from the fe warren air force base near cheyenne , wyo , around june 15 and arrived at this coastal base , 120 miles northwest of los angeles , five days later for a scheduled test launching on sept 7 during a routine inspection , officials discovered that two sections of the fourstage missile , still in boxcars , had been pierced by bullets none of the boxcars bore identifying marks and other boxcars were also hit , said capt leevolker cox , a spokesman for the 20th air force at the fe warren base the air force and the fbi were investigating the shooting so far it looks like a random act rather than something calculated , lieutenant dorrian said the damaged 71foot missile was sent to ogden , utah , where some parts will be salvaged , captain cox said
mexico city , sept 26 the record mexico compiled in conducting what many observers said were the first free and clean elections in decades is being tarnished by irregularities in several areas and accusations that political parties are bargaining over election results an election tribunal in the northern state of nuevo leon last tuesday annulled the results in 42 precincts in the important industrial city of monterrey because of irregularities as a result , the narrow mayoral victory of the governing institutional revolutionary party , the pri , was overturned victory will be handed instead to jesus hinojosa tijerina , 67 , a leader of the conservative national action party , the pan when mr hinojosa takes office on oct 31 it will mark the first time monterrey , with a population of 13 million , has been governed by the opposition election officials have also overturned pri victories for two seats in the federal legislature from the states of jalisco and michoacan conflict has continued in chiapas state in the south where the victory of the governing party candidate for governor has been accepted by state election officials but rejected by opposition leaders , who maintain there was widespread fraud the tension caused by the electoral conflict is heightened by the still unresolved zapatista rebel uprising that began on jan 1 a ceasefire has been in effect since jan 12 therebels back the opposition candidate , amado avendano , and assert that the results were manipulated by state government officials they have vowed not to allow the pri s candidate , eduardo robledo , to take office as scheduled on dec 8 international and mexican election observers have uniformly said that the elections on aug 21 for president , the federal legislature and many local offices were generally fair and clean for the first time , photo credentials , computerized registration lists and indelible ink were used to prevent fraud irregularities still were recorded , but observers said they were not significant enough to have changed the results of the presidential election a national mexican organization called the civic alliance that monitored thousands of urban and rural polling places issued a final report last week that recognized the results but expressed concern over the accumulated weight of the irregular votes none of the irregularities taken individually is large enough to affect the results , the organization concluded in its report however , it said , simply accepting them creates a tolerance for irregularities and fosters a culture of electoral impunity after it became clear that the pan had come in second in the presidential race , party members concentrated on the results in monterrey , where the pri candidate was leading by 6 , 140 votes critics accused the pan of bargaining for a victory , suggesting that it had agreed to recognize the results of the presidential election , where they also asserted there were irregularities , in exchange for the mayoralty of monterrey pan officials deny it when the results were against us we were accused of contriving a deal , felipe calderon , the party s secretary general , said at a news conference on thursday the same people now say that we now are contriving a deal because our victory has been recognized mayoral results in monterrey were brought before state election officials , who agreed that enough irregularities had taken place to annul the votes in 42 of the 121 polling places where there were accusations of serious oversights and missing documents without those votes , the pri candidate , jorge manjarrez , slipped to second place , 1 , 408 votes behind pri officials have agreed to respect the tribunal s decision in the final step of the legal process overturning the original election results , the municipal electoral commission of monterrey on saturday recognized the modified results with this victory and others , the pan now governs 76 percent of the population of the state of nuevo leon , mr hinojosa said in an interview that means we have a great chance to win the governorship in 1997 in chiapas , some analysts believe opposition parties are pressing the pri to change the election results by threatening renewed violence if mr robledo takes office they have so far been unable to prove the widespread fraud they assert took place sergio aguayo , head of the civic alliance and an analyst at the colegio de mexico , said that in monterrey the postelectoral conflict appeared to have been resolved for the first time in mexico through the legal process in chiapas , he said , the political parties are demonstrating and blocking highways because they feel legal processes do not work monterrey and chiapas represent two ways of resolving conflicts in mexico , mr aguayo said it s still not clear which way will be used more often in the future map of mexico showing location of monterrey

marian goodman is waiting for the men to arrive the men 'll be here , said the 40yearold assistant store manager at bloomingdale s flagship in midtown manhattan , accelerating past a snowwhite clinique counter toward trays of ties layered like freshly caught fish you see the panic shopper you can see the look on their faces men , she declared , are panic shoppers after 18 years in department stores , ms goodman s instincts , about shoppers , hot items and men s buying habits , are honed like a good boning knife and this is the time of year when those instincts are tested in this last week before christmas , ms goodman and thousands of buyers and executives at department stores , toy stores , apparel shops and jewelry boutiques across the country are on trial many typical stores generate 50 percent of their sales and 70 percent of their profits during the period from thanksgiving and christmas , said walter f loeb , a retailing consultant in new york no hard data are yet available about how this christmas shopping season is faring but wall street analysts are estimating that sales will be up 6 to 8 percent , and profits somewhat less , over last year across america , from the biggest retailers to the neighborhood toy shop , the sounds most eagerly awaited are not santa s ho ho ho , or bing crosby s liquid white christmas , but the beep , ratchet and ring of cash registers and the rustle of shopping bags filling and though those bags are filling , come january many retailers may rue their bottom lines some shoppers are buying with abandon , but others seem cautious as they browse i'm getting people things they would not spend money on for themselves , explained a harried debra fulscher , the director of client services and administration in the chicago office of trimedia inc , an advertising and marketing firm , who was shopping in downtown chicago last week after driving in from her home in barrington , ill , ms fulscher visited tiffany s and bought a 425 gold cross for her boyfriend i wanted to make it something special instead of just going to a regular jeweler , she said besides gifts for her own family , she bought some presents mostly clothing and toiletries for a 4yearold girl on chicago s south side , whose family was adopted by a church group that provides gifts to the needy also cruising chicago s stores was brenda large of ironton , ohio , who was shopping between sessions at a conference she was attending ms large said she expected to spend about 3 , 000 on christmas gifts the economy continues to be pretty good in our area , she said it has n't had much of a negative effect on us there were the usual presents of clothing for some of her adult children , but this year she also plunked down money for some pricier gifts a television for a daughter who attends ohio state university and an exercise bicycle for another daughter and her husband yet , even with such enthusiastic shoppers , blips of concern are popping up across the retailing map prechristmas sales are already in full swing at many stores , paring profits dramatically even as sales volume surges many retailers are looking at the lower end of their expectations , mr loeb said vicki malafronte , her ears wedged with rhinestone earrings , bustled around one of her perfume counters at nordstrom s in san francisco , and fretted it s frustrating the crowds are n't showing up yet , even though the weekends have been okay it s just not cranking up like it was last year many senior executives , when questioned about sales , begin by exuding holiday and commercial cheer in equal bounty , but , when pressed , they acknowledge some worries last year we had the best christmas in our history , and this year we expect to do better , said john h costello , a senior vice president for marketing at sears , roebuck company in chicago at the 2 , 000 sears stores across the country , mr costello said customers were focused on both wants and wishes , adding , they are buying practical gifts they need , as well as little luxuries that make christmas a little more special in the sears store in hicksville , li , the bags are nice and full , but certain categories are doing better than others , said thomas clarke , the general manager there hardware , a sears staple , has been coming through very , very nicely , he said in men s wear , ramie cotton sweaters with lots of vibrant colors mixed in together , wrinklefree pants by docker and haggar , are all doing very well and outerwear is finally starting to kick in you know , when it starts to get to 30 degrees , you ca n't go out without a coat on , so that s definitely picking up what is not doing so well , he said , is women s wear women s is not really cranked up because the men are not shopping yet , he said but jewelry is a really big boomer very large increases over last year the average ticket is well over 100 , from 100 to 200 other retailers are singing the apparel blues , too i think generally speaking apparel sales throughout the industry have not been up to expectations , said henry j russman , a spokesman for the 1 , 250store jc penney chain , which offers lowerpriced men s and women s wear and donald hess , chief executive of parisian inc , a birmingham , ala , clothing retailer with stores from detroit to sarasota , fla , said , the year continues to be a pretty tough year for apparel
washington , feb 28 mci communications said today that it would invest 13 billion in a fastgrowing competitor to cellular telephone companies called nextel communications , a move that seems certain to step up the rivalry in wireless communications mci , which will acquire 17 percent of the company , will market nextel s full range of digital wireless telephone , data and paging services under the mci brand name and will package them with its existing longdistance service nextel and one of its other investors , the comcast corporation , both retain the right to market nextel s services under their own company brand names , although nextel executives said they expected to eventually phase out use of the nextel name the new alliance addresses mci s one glaring weakness in the communications market the absence of a wireless capability to match the american telephone and telegraph company s pending purchase of mccaw cellular communications for 126 billion needed cash for nextel , the deal provides the cash it needs to build wireless networks around the country and gives the company access to mci s marketing prowess , which is highly regarded nextel s stock jumped 5625 a share today , closing at 4425 in nasdaq trading on friday , possibly anticipating today s announcement , some investors had bid up nextel s shares 2125 customers have been asking us to provide a totally portable communications service , bert c roberts jr , mci s chairman and chief executive , said this alliance means that nextel is the platform on which we will build an integrated wireless strategy the move also marks a strategic bet by mci that the quickest way into advanced wireless communications does not lie with the coming federal auctions of radio frequencies for personal communication services those wireless services , which will used a new generation of pocketsized phones and handheld computers , are expected to begin in the next few years bad news for administration while mci officials said they would still bid on many of those frequencies when the auctions begin later this year or early next , today s deal made it clear the company would invest primarily in radio frequencies already controlled by nextel that could be bad news for the clinton administration , which has been predicting the government will reap 10 billion from auctions of the nation s airwaves but with one of the biggest potential bidders directing much of its money elsewhere , the auctions could yield far less as for nextel , which is based in rutherford , nj , the company is still small compared with mccaw , which is the country s biggest cellular telephone operator but nextel in recent years has spent several billion dollars acquiring radio licenses across the country that have traditionally been used for systems that dispatch taxi and truck fleets but which nextel plans to upgrade with digital technology that can combine cellular , paging and other messaging services nextel has bought radio licenses covering 180 million people in 45 metropolitan areas that gives it a potential coverage three times bigger than that of mccaw , though mccaw s systems are all constructed and have customers nextel s new digital networks , by contrast , are only now getting started nextel , founded in 1988 by morgan e o'brien and brian mcauley , spent years quietly buying licenses from fleetdispatch companies before expanding rapidly with a burst of big acquisitions last year digital service in los angeles nextel recently inaugurated its new digital service in los angeles , where customers can use a single device to talk , send typed messages or receive regular paging signals by the end of this year , nextel executives say they will have the new system operating throughout california , as well as in big regions surrounding new york city and chicago the deal announced today with mci would give nextel the additional cash it desperately needs to build its networks nextel has already raised nearly 2 billion from stock and bond offerings , as well as 300 million from its other big partner , comcast but much of this has been spent moreover , only last month nextel sold 700 million in bonds to accelerate construction nextel hopes to complete its nationwide network by the end of 1996 the deal would give mci quick access to an alldigital wireless network covering most of the american population because the system transmits entirely in digital form represented by the ones and zeros of computer code the sound quality is expected to be better than traditional cellular and more amenable to data communications the prices are not likely to be any cheaper than cellular telephones , however , despite the new competition mr o'brien , nextel s chairman , said prices would be competitive with cellular , though perhaps cheaper than a combined package of cellular , paging and message services 'great move' it s a great move for mci because it gives them the one piece they did n't have in telecommunications , said jeffrey hines , an analyst at paine webber inc who covers the wireless industry nextel is a startup , but they 've got a lot going for them they have a geographic presence second to none comcast , a cable television company based in philadelphia that also owns cellular franchises and other telecommunication properties , said it would retain its current 17 percent stake in nextel the wireless systems being built are similar to those used for cellular telephones they use a smaller number of radio frequencies than cellular , but they use digitalcompression technology to squeeze more customer traffic into the available space nextel s digital transmission technology was developed by motorola inc , and is being adopted by the other two big providers of the services , which in the industry are known as enhanced special mobile radio the other two providers are dialpage inc of greenville , sc , and cencall communications inc of denver cellular telephone carriers are also converting to digital technology , enabling them to avoid the static of today s analog networks , which transmit information in the less precise form of electronic signals that mimic sound waves but because cellular carriers already have billions of dollars invested in their existing networks , the conversion process is gradual and will not be widespread for several years photo this alliance means that nextel is the platform on which we will build an integrated wireless strategy , said bert c roberts jr , mci s chief executive , who announced his company s investment in nextel nextel s digital transmission technology was developed by motorola \( paul hosefros the new york times \) \( pg d9 \) graph wireless

on the contrary being the life of a famous rebel , soldier , traveller , explorer , reader , builder , scribe , latinist , lover and liar by andre brink 376 pp boston little , brown company 2295 a newly democratic south africa confronts its novelists with the same problem that the end of the cold war posed for the writers of spy stories is there any life left in the old conflict that i 've spent my career defining \? for years andre brink , at great risk to himself , wrote realistic novels exposing the cruelty of apartheid now , with the urgency of racial conflict diminished , he responds with more fanciful novels that look to his country s past , even to its myths how did this horror come about \? must interracial contact inevitably culminate in misunderstanding , violence and oppression \? his answer appears to be yes but with the proviso that as long as a flicker of good will endures , injustice need not be permanent his previous novel , cape of storms \( 1993 \) , was a surreal fable about the first european encounter with africans five centuries ago at what is now the cape of good hope on the contrary being the life of a famous rebel , soldier , traveller , explorer , reader , builder , scribe , latinist , lover and liar is in some ways even odder it is also set in the cape colony , but the time is the 18th century as suggested by the florid subtitle , intended to remind us of picaresque novels like defoe s colonel jack and fielding s life and death of jonathan wild the great the colony is very much a frontier territory although it is nominally governed by a committee in the netherlands , real power resides with the corrupt and callous dutch administrators in cape town , here called cabo the european interlopers have been around long enough for an indigenous white population the afrikaners to achieve an identity of its own mr brink is quick to point out that even then the afrikaners , of whom he is one , were a surly lot , distrusting the dutch and , as they pressed their settlements into native territory , despising the people they called hottentots through his narrator , mr brink provides an unforgettable image of the settlers relying , it seems , almost exclusively on slaves and hottentots for whatever work is to be done on their farms , they spend their time eating , drinking , breeding and bickering the narrator , estienne barbier , reveals the end of his story at its beginning condemned for high treason , he lies in a stinking dark hole awaiting his fate bound to a cross his right hand and his head severed from the body , subsequently to be drawn and quartered , the head and hand to be placed on a stake in the roode zands kloof , and the four remaining quarters to be displayed in four different places alongside the most frequented highways of the settlement as prey to the air and the birds from heaven an irresistible beginning in those days they tried to make capital punishment a credible deterrent but it promises a grand tale that is not to come from prison , estienne casts his narrative as an imaginary letter directed to an escaped slave who cannot read arriving after a perilous voyage at cabo in 1734 he claims his ship was saved only after its cargo of slaves was thrown overboard estienne , a frenchman and a stowaway , poses as an inspector of fortifications conscripted into the army , he joins an expedition into the interior to see how the dutch east india company posts are faring his assignment is to make the official record of the trip the brutality he witnesses is appalling , and his determination to record it sets him at odds with the despots in cabo to condense what follows estienne becomes an outlaw he is jailed he escapes he hides on remote farms , sleeping with innumerable widows he helps a slave escape like scheherezade , she is both a lover and a storyteller , and in south africa then and until recently storytellers were on the wrong side of the law in time , estienne launches a rebellion , and a price is put on his head if this sounds simple enough , mr brink makes sure that it is n't on the contrary is n't a bad novel it s ambitious and imaginative , and it makes the important point that the afrikaners' savagery toward blacks was based on fear nevertheless , the author struggles with a serious confusion of styles he could easily have written a contemporary picaresque novel estienne fulfills the picaro s requirements as a man of loose morals who does menial work and moves around a lot but from its early manifestation in la vida de lazarillo de tormes in 1554 , the picaresque novel has been noted for its laconic cynicism and irreverent wit there s none of that here mr brink is a moralist and not , at least in this novel , inclined to humor estienne carries a copy of don quixote and reads it as many do the bible he dreams the impossible the inarticulate dream the desire for the beyond was as fierce as the lust of the flesh as long as you or i can name it it is not enough what i want lies beyond even beyond names ok , but basically what estienne dreams of is finding monomotapa , the african el dorado , the city of gold the other important baggage he brings from europe is joan of arc being french , he calls her jeanne she sits somewhere inside his skull and prods him to do the sort of thing that brought her to the stake neither mr brink nor estienne thinks it funny when she says you cannot avoid trouble forever , estienne it s better to get involved from the beginning later jeanne says , never trust the cunning of your enemy what can she mean \? never trust , or never underestimate , your enemy \? jeanne , we remember from shaw s play , can be provocative , but here she s an astonishing bore la pucelle remains calm while estienne refers to women by a slang word for their genitals but then estienne lacks charm he can be boring himself love of parents , i know now , love of brothers and sisters , of family and friends and lovers , all this dies away only the love of the earth remains scarlett o'hara could n't have said it better drawing

lost love a true story of passion , murder and justice in old new york by george cooper illustrated 272 pages pantheon books 23 the narrative form that george cooper employs in lost love is as unusual as the lively story he creates with authority about one of the most sensational courtroom trials in postcivil war america the book resembles historical fiction but it is indisputable historical fact , using the voices of the past in such a way that it reads like a novel mr cooper s technique brings to mind in cold blood , which was somewhat disingenuously called the first nonfiction novel when it appeared in 1966 , because truman capote used fictional techniques to examine the motives of his young killers what mr cooper achieves in lost love might be called novel nonfiction because the book s vivid personalities become the basis of a nearoperatic , truelife tale interposing his own narration only where necessary , he seamlessly weaves together letters , dispatches , court testimony and news accounts the story goes beyond a case of the subtitle s passion , murder and justice in old new york it also includes aspects of civil war reporting , the battle of vicksburg , confederate prisons , new york newspaper rivalries , lectures as entertainment , the growth of the broadway theater , civil rights , feminism and , especially , romantic and social attitudes in the united states during the era that edith wharton s novel called the age of innocence in lost love , the reader encounters a number of iconic personalities who fade in and out of the story horace greeley , james gordon bennett , the rev henry ward beecher , edwin booth , daniel frohman , kit carson and mark twain some of them appear in period engravings between the text just as they were seen in frank leslie s illustrated newspaper and other contemporary publications , lending visual reality to the narrative although the book is strongly sourced , regrettably it lacks an index the heart of the story one might well describe it as the broken heart centers on albert deane richardson , a civil rights advocate and famous war correspondent for greeley s new york tribune , and abby sage , a beautiful actress and author , who married him on his deathbed at the astor house hotel both were aware that he was dying their marriage lasted 60 hours they were married by none other than mr beecher of plymouth church , brooklyn as the author notes in one of his interesting sidelights , which make his book an informative as well as literary experience henry ward beecher had made religion safe for capitalism to a country founded on puritan asceticism and selfdenial , he preached a doctrine that glorified wealth earned through hard work this was a theology for the times it would be difficult to improve on the villian of the story , daniel mcfarland , who was abby s first husband and the father of their two children on the evening of nov 25 , 1869 , richardson entered the tribune s offices in printing house square to pick up his mail he was expecting a letter from abby after her divorce had been granted mcfarland who comes across as a drunk , a liar and a pretentious lout stepped out of the shadows , drew a pistol and pumped lead into richardson s stomach the civil war correspondent who had survived battles and confederate prison camps became a goner in his own newspaper s office he lasted only a few days his assassin was jailed in the tombs to await trial mr cooper , a writer and former law professor at columbia university , describes the details of the trial with keen awareness of the parallels to modern criminal cases mcfarland s lawyer , john graham , had a simple strategy with the willing help of the press , he planted the idea with the jury and the public that mcfarland was defending the honor of the american family when he shot richardson mcfarland was turned into the common man richardson was made into a libertine abby , into a fallen woman it was a classic defense of blaming the victim fundamentally , the defense used the insanity plea to save mcfarland the judge instructed the jury members that they had to acquit if there was reasonable doubt of the defendant s sanity when the jury brought back a verdict that freed mcfarland , people in the courthouse cheered , and he became the man of the hour a rather pompous editorial in the new york times on may 11 , 1870 , went along with the defense it said that medical testimony found the prisoner insane at the time of the shooting and added , even without reference to the connection between richardson and mrs mcfarland , the jury could scarcely have brought in any other verdict than the one they did with occasional drunken sightings , the blowhard mcfarland later disappeared somewhere out west after getting mcfarland off , the reputation of his lawyer soared and in 1873 , graham was retained to defend boss tweed , the crooked leader of tammany hall , whose felonies had been exposed by the new york times but he could not prevent tweed from being sentenced to jail for 12 years on charges of corruption the romance between the journalist and the actress is handled with victorian delicacy it was a lost love that remained constant for abby sage she was a truly remarkable woman who remained loyal to richardson s memory and their unfulfilled love after the trial , she supported herself by public recitals and stage appearances she wrote plays and became a play doctor for daniel frohman , who as a boy had been befriended by richardson to mark twain s delight , she adapted his prince and the pauper for the stage in 1900 , at the age of 63 , she contracted pneumonia and died in rome mr cooper ends lost love on a romantic note and in her final listing in the new york city directory , for 1900 , after a lifetime of achievement , she did not refer to herself as a playwright or author or lecturer she remained , to her death , simply 'richardson , abby sage , widow of albert' photo of

joliet , ill , may 10 john wayne gacy , convicted 14 years ago of the sexrelated killings of 33 young men and boys , was put to death by lethal injection early today as the nation s worst serial killer on record the execution , which took place in the old stateville penitentiary here , followed lastminute appeals by mr gacy s lawyers , asserting that their 52yearold client was mentally incompetent , that he was out of town at the time of 16 of the killings and that illinois' method of execution was unconstitutional but none of the state or federal judges appealed to on monday , including justice john paul stevens of the united states supreme court , would stay mr gacy s execution howard a peters , a corrections official , said mr gacy was pronounced dead at 12 58 am , nearly an hour after the injection of three lethal chemicals had been scheduled to begin the execution was delayed because gelling prevented the chemicals from flowing through a delivery tube , mr peters said the prisoner gave a final statement proclaiming his innocence , mr peters said demonstrations pro and con mr gacy inspired a range of passions since the first of his victims was discovered beneath his suburban chicago house and today those emotions were all the more evident opponents of capital punishment gathered in chicago to urge that mr gacy s life be spared , as others , like the guardian angels anticrime group , gathered there to demand that his execution be carried out although the authorities said mr gacy had at one time confessed , he later insisted that he was innocent , even going so far as to state his case in a recording that the public could hear by dialing a 900 telephone number but the authorities said the evidence of his guilt was overwhelming mr gacy was convicted in march 1980 of murdering 33 boys and young men between 1972 and 1978 all but six of his victims were found buried beneath his house an ordinaryseeming businessman , mr gacy had dressed as a clown to entertain children , had served as a democratic party precinct captain and had organized annual celebrations of polish holidays attracting hundreds of people it was n't like he had horns , or a sign , said michael albrecht , who shadowed , then arrested , mr gacy he was speaking monday on one of the many radio talk shows in the chicago area that were dominated by mr gacy s pending execution he was very popular , very well liked you just ca n't tell although a gacy defense lawyer has been quoted as calling his client a poster child for the death penalty , opponents of capital punishment argued that even mr gacy should not be executed it s an american tragedy that we 're doing this , jay miller of the american civil liberties union said on monday at a news conference called by a coalition opposing the death penalty no matter what that person did , we 're setting a terrible example that human life is really not worth it on monday morning , mr gacy was taken from the downstate menard correctional center , where he had spent the last 14 years , and was flown by helicopter to the penitentiary here he was put in a 7by9foot cell in a onestory structure called building x , which had been cleared of its 40 inmates a guard was posted opposite his cell door on a suicide watch his lawyers said mr gacy had never shown signs of distress or remorse mr howell , the prisons spokesman , said he was very chatty he was talking up a storm even discussing the prospects of the chicago cubs for his last meal , mr gacy , who in the mid60 s managed three kentucky fried chicken restaurants in iowa , asked for fried chicken , fried shrimp , french fries and fresh strawberries , prison officials said the case gripped the public at the end of 1978 , when the police began digging up body after body from a crawl space under mr gacy s modest but comfortable home near o'hare international airport eventually 27 bodies were found under the house two others were found elsewhere on the property , apparently buried there when mr gacy ran out of room in the crawl space , and four more were found dumped in the des plaines river a jury concluded that the victims had been lured to the house for sex , then killed , beginning in 1972 usually they were tricked into allowing a rope to be tied around their necks and twisted tight with a stick only 25 victims have been identified the others were buried in charity funerals under gravestones that said only , we are remembered mr gacy received more mail and methodically answered it than any other inmate at the prison callers of his 900 phone line paid 2388 to listen to the full 12 minutes of his recorded denial of the crimes on death row , mr gacy took up art , producing crude paintings of his pogo the clown character and other cartoonish works , all churned out in his cell at the menard correctional center the paintings and sketches now command 200 to as much as 20 , 000 apiece from collectors about 100 , 000 from contributions and the sale of his paintings will go to his heirs two children , two stepchildren , and one sister the state had challenged mr gacy s right to control the money but last week

washington , sept 13 calming fears that inflation might be rising sharply , the government reported today that consumer prices climbed in august by the same threetenths of 1 percent that they rose in june and july the latest figures caused none of the consternation of friday , when producer prices showed a surprising surge of sixtenths of 1 percent , roiling the financial markets still , many economists maintain that the pace of inflation is increasing , forecasting that consumer prices will rise around 35 percent this year after two years of increases of less than 3 percent analysts said the august increase in the consumer price index remained moderate because the increases in producer prices the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers , distributors or other buyers have not yet worked their way to the consumer level but analysts say that the pressure on consumer prices will continue in the months ahead , as commodity and other prices drift higher we are looking at a slow upcreep , said eugene j sherman , research director at m a schapiro company in new york , noting that core inflation has moved up to 31 percent in the last six months from 26 percent for the six months through february today , the financial markets seemed to react to the news in this light bond and stock prices rose after the release of the consumer prices report , but gave up some of their gains later in the day the dow jones industrial average ended up 1952 points the bond market was at least encouraged that the report renewed its conviction that the federal reserve would forgo any further tightening of monetary policy this month and wait at least until the november meeting of its policymaking panel in a related report , the labor department calculated that average weekly earnings adjusted for inflation fell eighttenths of 1 percent in august from july august was the first month this year to post a drop in earnings compared with a year earlier inflationadjusted earnings last month were fourtenths of 1 percent below the level of august 1993 but it was the consumer price index , which rose a tad less than many analysts had expected , that was the main focus of attention analysts found themselves reassured that friday s sharp rise in producer prices represented a convergence of factors that was unlikely to be repeated they noted that the goods component of the index , accounting for about 43 percent of the total , rose threetenths of 1 percent in august , the same as in may and june and less than in july the narrower producer price indexes include few services or imported goods and their link with what consumers ultimately pay is often loose , economists say analysts also took comfort in the fact that the socalled core consumer index , with the volatile food and energy components removed , also moved up threetenths of 1 percent last month the same rate as in february , march , may and june and , thus , was showing no clearly worrisome acceleration for april and july , the core rose twotenths of 1 percent annual pace below 3 we have n't really seen any kind of a sustained pickup in inflation , said michael p niemira , chief economist with mitsubishi bank in new york inflation is now running at a pace of 29 percent for the latest 12 months , compared with 28 percent for the 12month period that ended in august 1993 patrick c jackman , a labor department price specialist , pointed to various factors that seemed likely to keep the september rise in consumer prices to a minimum the price of gasoline , up 37 percent in august and 78 percent over the latest three months , has turned down , and there will almost certainly be no repeat of coffee s record leaps of about 22 percent in both july and august moreover , seasonal factors may again restrain the apparel component , which fell for the second consecutive month in august on endofseason sales of spring and summer wear coupled with smallerthanusual price increases on new fall and winter lines if you look at the very short run , the situation looks better , mr jackman said he and others , however , see a gradual rising of inflation into next year , driven in part by an environmentalprotection mandate that is expected to raise the price of gasoline by as much as 8 cents a gallon in some metropolitan areas consequences of growth howard keen jr , chief economist at conrail , said it was hard to believe that the economy could expand as rapidly as it has an average annual pace of 45 percent in the latest three full quarters without some price acceleration he said that his railroad s shipments of truck trailers , mainly filled with consumer goods , are particularly strong , possibly reflecting inventory building by optimistic merchants many economists have been assuming that the apparently unwanted inventories that accumulated during the second quarter would be worked off during the summer the services component , accounting for just over 56 percent of the index , moved up fourtenths of 1 percent in august , today s report also showed , the third consecutive small acceleration graph consumer prices shows percent change month to month , seasonally adjusted \( source bureau of labor statistics \) \( pg d6 \)
chicago , oct 31 the weather alone was frightening it was cold , windy and rainy at soldier field on this halloween night , but none of that was as chilling to the chicago bears as the whipping dispensed by the green bay packers the bears started slowly and finished that way the packers started with a few slips but finished upright , thwarting the bears by 336 i 've never played in conditions like that it was like playing in hurricane camille , except it was 80 degrees cooler , said green bay quarterback brett favre , who ran for one touchdown and passed for another it was unbelievable i went out in pregame and said , 'i might not complete a pass , ' and i almost lived up to it green bay led by 140 at halftime and never looked back in scoring the game s first 27 points the finishing touches were a 1yard , thirdquarter run by edgar bennett and , in the final quarter , a bennett 13yard score on a swing pass from favre and a 9yard scoring run by reggie cobb for bennett , it was a threetouchdown night chicago which entered this game averaging only 184 points scored per game and had not scored more than 22 points in any game this season knew it was in trouble after falling behind , regardless of the terrible weather quarterback erik kramer was ineffective and was replaced by steve walsh to begin the second half walsh finally connected , in between the packers final two touchdowns with receiver jeff graham on a 5yard pass that was the bears' only score in this huge game for strong midseason standing in the national football conference central race , chicago slipped to a 44 record and green bay matched that mark both are tied with detroit for second place behind the minnesota vikings \( 62 \) there was one highlight for the bears at halftime , in an upbeat ceremony , the numbers of the bears greats dick butkus and gale sayers were retired chicago finished with five turnovers , the packers with none this was not a game for the faint of heart at kickoff , the temperature was 43 degrees , the winds gusted up to 53 miles an hour and the windchill factor made the temperature seem 8 degrees the bears had their 91st consecutive sellout admittedly with 19 , 563 noshows but more than half the crowd had left by halftime because of the weather it was an important and emotional game for steve mcmichael for the last 23 meetings between these two teams , mcmichael had lined up at defensive tackle for the bears this time , the 15year pro , because of a free agent move to green bay in the off season , was on the line for the packers it figured that the team that could establish a running game and stick with it would have the upper hand early and late in this 149th clash between the colorful rivals turnovers , however , played as large a role in the packers rumbling to a 140 halftime lead the packers found the running on the left side to their liking the matchup there was left tackle ken ruettgers , left guard guy mcintyre and center frank winters versus the bear right end alonzo spellman and right tackle chris zorich it was a matchup the packers steadily won , with that left side leading green bay to a 22394 lead in rushing yardage favre was 0 for 7 passing until late in the third quarter but he scampered for 36 yards down the right sideline and dove in on the final yard for the touchdown and a 140 green bay lead with 4 46 left in the half

pink and yellow and each of the fullest intensity of their hue as i sat on the sofa with enez whipple , the bright pink of her sweater was echoed by the pale pink of the tulips on the coffee table before us against the white walls , and the chairs and the sofas that i would remember as white , came yellow pillows and little yellow details it was the time of the yellow outside through the large windows of this east hampton house built around an old water tower , came the vista of yellows of daffodils , daisies , birds singing outside on a table in the dining room , a distance away but connected in the wide open space , there were white china fruits , and somehow , in my memory although whether or not they were really there , i do n't know i add white china flowers there were none of the paintings of the abstract expressionists on the expansive white walls , nor the photographs of the many trail blazers first showings of the photographs , for example , of the interior of the last office of freud , nor echoes of hans namuth or dorothy norman or arnold genthe , the people whom enez whipple had repeatedly granted a safe space to show in their earlier , more volatile days , during her 40year stint as director of east hampton s guild hall even the new glossy print book , just out , that enez whipple had put together to tell the story , guild hall of east hampton , an adventure in the arts , was absent from that friendly white and pink and yellow living room in the last 10 years , since enez whipple s retirement , guild hall has had four different directors , a fact not surprising considering the tensions and the complex meshings of conflicting agendas that has always marked this community , where repeatedly artists in all areas have come for the particular quality of the light what was it about enez whipple that had allowed her to hold the position as coordinator of it all , creating , well before such a thing was in fashion , a home for interrelating the arts \? 'temple as a museum' it was the original vision of a museum as a temple that you went to be educated in you went to the theater , and during the intermission you went into the garden and saw outdoor sculpture in the 30 s , when guild hall was founded , only 29 percent of museums engaged in performing arts programs , so that by luck we were pioneers in the total art experience , she said with the modesty and simplicity that would be characteristic of her talking about her career , even as i asked her what about her had allowed her to take on that role enez whipple landed in guild hall more or less by accident she came from a little upstate town about 15 miles from syracuse , where she would eventually attend the university , a student in theater arts there on the front porch she did the usual things every child does , putting on little plays with the other children who felt the way i did , mostly farmer s children and children of the paper mill , undertakers' chairs and all the rest her mother , who had gone to syracuse university before her , had trained to be an opera singer , but she had to give it up because of a disease of the vocal chords her father , a rather stormy soul , was an inventor like her mother before her , her first interest was in music she was a piano student from an early age , although she did n't have what it took to be a concert pianist , she said without any particular sadness still , i had a great love for it ironically , in the beginning she did n't have any particular interest in the visual arts i just did n't think of it but in college , her friends all were in the school of fine arts , she said there she was to develop the particular gift of coming to an understanding of new areas of art purely through friendships , that was to deeply mark her subsequent career there she continued to study the piano since theater was my second love , and i did n't particularly want to teach , i started to do master s work in directing and theater arts tie to cultural center guild hall opened in 1931 enez whipple came to east hampton 10 years later the era of the grand old summer colony was in its last radiance , already a bit tattered and becoming forlorn , when enez whipple first arrived in the hamptons with her new husband , whip , a cartoonist who was on guild hall s summer board of directors when i saw the rollins dance studio rehearsing a scene out of 'a midsummer night s dream' in the garden , drifting around the courtyard in their long dresses , i felt i had never seen anything like it , that it was all a kind of enchantment , she recalled it was the end of the era of the great estate , and i was very glad to have been able to experience it she worked informally at first , assisting her husband who was really too busy to do very much for guild hall , until gradually the job became hers , until gradually , after three years , she became first , summer director , and then , at first unofficially , and later officially , the yearround director as well as enez recapitulates the first wonderment of that long ago rehearsal on the grass , the surprise of those long floating dresses and the fairy tale quality of it all , even now , more than 50 years later , and with her four decadeslong history of involvement behind her , one feels more the quality of that first childlike fascination , rather than the sense that it is she who has actually made a mark which came first \?
at first , after kelly vilar quit her job as community board 11 s youth coordinator , the spot went unfilled because of a dinkins administration mandate that laidoff city workers be given hiring preference of the more than 100 people interviewed former sanitation workers , former health department workers , and former child welfare caseworkers none passed muster but then , last year , the department of youth services cut financing for the job in catch22 fashion , the department said , the money was revoked because the position had not been filled so local youth officials , who have refused to give up the fight to reinstate the money , were heartened by mayor rudolph w giuliani s announcement on friday that he was ordering an investigation into the agency s policies the east harlem community as a whole has really suffered from the department s cuts and the lack of a youth coordinator , said renee avery , president of the east harlem neighborhood based alliance corporation the mayor said the review would focus on how the department uses its 66 million budget and why it stopped financing older and wellestablished socialservice organizations and awarded contracts instead to newer groups with no track record eddie baca , chairman of community board 11 , said he had noticed this phenomenon in east harlem , where such longstanding programs as the beacon community center , the largest afterschool program in the neighborhood and el barrio martial arts , a decadeold program , have just been cut by the department but for east harlem , mr baca said , the more pressing problem is the lack of a youth coordinator these coordinators serve as advocates and run interference between youths and government and socialservice agencies without one , mr baca said , the area has experienced worsening problems with high school dropouts , teenage pregnancy and unemployment department of youth services officials are now planning a system in which neighborhoods share youth coordinators marty algaze , manhattan director of the mayor s community assistance unit , said that final budget determinations will dictate how many coordinators the city can afford while that policy might save money , community leaders believe it will not solve their problems it s absolutely pointless to have somebody parttime , said mr baca they might as well just not do it jkb

leading with my heart by virginia kelley with james morgan illustrated 286 pp new york simon schuster 2250 intimate memoirs by the offspring of famous and distinguished parents are commonplace intimate memoirs by the parents of famous and distinguished offspring are rarities we read such books for reasons that have little to do with the merit of the works themselves , and we can assume that they are written or , in any event , published to be read in such a light the obvious interest of virginia kelley s posthumously published leading with my heart derives from the fact that its author was the mother of president clinton with all respect to that american original , as she was called at her funeral , it is not very likely that a memoir by virginia kelley of hot springs , ark , would have been commissioned by a major publishing house , apart from its subject s family connections yet there is nothing exploitative or selfcongratulatory about leading with my heart , nothing sentimental or disingenuous the memoir , a collaboration between kelley and james morgan , a former magazine editor and a freelance writer from hot springs , fairly throbs with its author s vitality her voice is as direct as ordinary conversation i'm friendly , i'm outgoing , and i like men its exuberance is that of the midwestern land and cityscapes of the painter thomas hart benton , in which common populist scenes acquire a surreal , mockheroic , frequently caricatured hypervividness this is not an art for all tastes , perhaps , but it is art nonetheless , by its own definition uniquely american virginia kelley s arkansas world might have been depicted by benton as a cornucopia of midwestern and southern popular culture from the 1920 s through the 90 s she loved to dance , to drink , to smoke , to play the horses \( she estimates she spent as much as a third of her time at the hot springs race track \) she loved to go to parties with men and women as gregarious as herself , whose happiness in life was to eat and laugh and go and do above all , she loved to make public appearances in bright , eyecatching colors , her hair carefully styled , and so elaborately made up , complete with spiderlike eyelashes , that it required as long as 90 minutes for the daily ritual of preparing her face \( indeed , the dominant , rather defiant metaphor of leading with my heart is makeup , what kelley called paint \) in this zestful world , emotional peaks and crises are best expressed through popular song , as if , in her memory , kelley s life were a romantic technicolor film , complete with soundtrack we hear , variously , the andrews sisters' bei mir bist du schon , bing crosby s cheery do n't fence me in , glenn miller s string of pearls and such mellow dance tunes as i 'll be seeing you , you 'll never know and i 've heard that song before in later years , after the death of her third husband , kelley would listen to barbra streisand performing the way we were , a song that tore me up but her great love was elvis presley , who entered her life on sunday , sept 9 , 1956 , when , along with millions of other americans , she first saw him on the ed sullivan show i'm telling you , i had never heard such a spiritual sound coming from anyone it was the sweetest , most beautiful singing in the world i know a lot of people do n't like elvis , but he s my taste , the way horse racing and vegas and bright makeup and leather boots are my taste bill used to laugh and say that i loved elvis so much because he was so good to his mother leading with my heart , as its title suggests , is a celebration of the life of feeling it is not selfreflective , except in the most modest terms \( the way i 've gotten through life , kelley tells us , is by living in the present \) three times widowed by the age of 51 , having lost one husband to an automobile accident , another to alcoholism and cancer , and another to diabetes , kelley , though raised a baptist , was not a fervent believer her concept of god was vaguely benign , but detached more pragmatically , she devised a psychological process she called brainwashing to deal with the vicissitudes of fate inside my head i construct an airtight box i keep inside it what i want to think about , and everything else stays beyond the walls inside is white , outside is black the only gray i trust is the streak in my hair inside is love and friends and optimism outside is negativity , ca n'tdoism and any criticism of me and mine most of the time this box is strong as steel yet the virginia kelley of leading with my heart is the quintessence of the selfdelighting extrovert , one who genuinely likes people i 've always enjoyed talking with strangers the more different they are , the better i like them i can truthfully say that i have never felt one pang of jealousy toward anybody in my life , and that attitude started when i was a girl and there are wonderfully revealing passages that illuminate not just kelley and her sons but the very essence of the political personality
bordentown , nj when shahid s was strutting around newark with an automatic pistol jammed into his waistband , stealing cars , selling drugs and mugging people , he would sometimes hear older boys talking about the prison where new jersey sends its most incorrigible teenagers but shahid , who stole cars for money and excitement and said he felt no pangs of conscience over shooting someone that he thought deserved it , did n't imagine the prison here as some kind of hellhole to be avoided at all costs it seemed more like a testing ground , where he could see how he measured up against the worst of the worst it was like an adventure to me , he said something i wanted to find out about , a little quest , a little indiana jones for two years now , shahid , an 18yearold who was arrested for car theft , has been locked up here in central new jersey , behind the steel doors and barbedwire of the state s toughest institution for teenagers , the juvenile medium security facility his first days were , indeed , kind of exciting all the other inmates seemed to be on his case , and he felt he had to be quick with his fists or forever be their goat but it was n't long before the excitement and menace wore off and life became a numbing routine of eating , sleeping , watching television and shooting hoops the juvenile medium security facility , the end of the line for troubled young people in new jersey , is among the nation s harshest institutions for youths it is a warren of stark cells , where every movement is watched by guards , schooling is minimal , therapeutic counseling has all but been abandoned , and solitary confinement for up to 30 days is the principal means of trying to change behavior in a nation obsessed by brutal crime , politicians and lawenforcement officials are coming under increasing pressure to get tough on young criminals , even if just to keep them off the streets so they cannot commit more crimes people turn on the television and see younger and younger kids committing heinous crimes , and think , 'they 're kicking us , we must kick them back , hard , ' said hunter hurst , director of the national center for juvenile justice , a nonprofit group in pittsburgh they want to send a lot more kids to institutions , and , unfortunately , that s the direction we 're going in but the results of incarceration are usually disappointing around the country , up to 75 percent of the youths who leave places like the juvenile medium security facility soon get into trouble again , said barry krisberg , president of the national council on crime and delinquency , a private research center in san francisco and many experts say prisonlike juvenile institutions do more harm than good they reinforce all the aggression that the kids went in with , said edward j loughran , the director of the robert f kennedy memorial juvenile justice project in boston , which advocates small therapeutic institutions still , the number of young people in juvenile institutions nationwide rose to more than 90 , 000 in 1991 , the last year for which statistics are available , from 70 , 000 in 1979 and most experts say that , with the public calls for tougher punishment and the planned construction of new juvenile institutions , the numbers are likely to rise more sharply in the next few years in addition , every state has begun sending teenagers involved in the most serious crimes into the adult courts and prisons , bypassing the juvenile justice system entirely dr howard n snyder , a research director at the national center for juvenile justice , said no comprehensive figures had been compiled on the number of cases that were being transferred to the adult system but he said juvenilecourt judges alone transferred 11 , 700 cases in 1992 , up from 7 , 000 in 1988 overall , he estimated , at least 23 , 000 juvenile cases were transferred the state legislatures are all moving to try juveniles in adult court , which is really a move to lock up more kids in big institutions , said mark soler , of the youth law center in washington but those institutions are incredibly expensive , and they 're also schools for crime the kids come out as very tough , hardened criminals there s lots of data showing that kids in small communitybased programs do better , but we 're clearly moving in the opposite direction from what works this year , new jersey plans to spend more than 61 , 000 to keep shahid in the institution here that is more than twice what it spends on an adult inmate because of the higher staffing and educational requirements for juveniles the 61 , 000 would send two young people to harvard for a year , with 8 , 500 left over like many of the nearly 100 other young men here in

washington , oct 30 the president s house , at 16th street and pennsylvania avenue nw , is already protected by metal detectors , sharpshooters , electronic sensing devices , concrete barricades , guard dogs and earthen berms yet none of that stopped a gunman from spraying the white house with bullets on saturday as a result , the shooting which caused no injuries but left pockmarks where bullets had hit the facade of the white house has set off a new round of official discussions on what can be done to tighten security the treasury department , the parent agency for the secret service , was already considering extra precautions because of a breach in white house security last month , when a small airplane bounced off the south lawn , crashed through the branches of a magnolia tree and came to rest in a crumpled heap two stories below the bedroom of president and mrs clinton and today , dee dee myers , the white house press secretary , said the treasury inquiry would be expanded to include the shooting the latest incident immediately revived interest in the idea of closing off pennsylvania avenue around the white house , a precaution favored for several years by the secret service white house officials said mr clinton would wait for the treasury s report before making any decisions , but they added that he preferred to keep the avenue open asked whether automobiles or pedestrians should be excluded from part of pennsylvania avenue , george stephanopoulos , a senior adviser to the president , said , this is not something that he would like to do the president has always said that the white house is the people s house , mr stephanopoulos said on the nbc news program meet the press several lawenforcement officials said there was no way they could prevent a determined assailant from attacking the white house as long as pennsylvania avenue remained open to all pedestrians and autos but they said that neither closing the thoroughfare nor restricting access to lafayette park would guarantee that the white house was beyond the range of highpowered weapons mr clinton clearly chafes at life inside the white house bubble , and that makes the job of protecting him all the more difficult shortly after he took office , private donors financed the construction of a jogging track around the south lawn so the president could enjoy his regular morning run without extensive security precautions but mr clinton prefers getting outside , so at dawn commuters often see him jogging past the city s monuments , trailed by his secret service retinue and a parade of police cars and press vans ms myers said mr clinton does not want the american people cut off from what is one of the most significant symbols of this democracy mr clinton acknowledged the role played by the men who subdued the gunman when he spoke at a dinner on saturday night referring to the gunman , mr clinton said , the man was captured in part because ordinary citizens who were standing there did their duty , and i hope that is an example for others around the country robert edward haines , one of three men who seized the gunman and wrestled him to the ground on saturday , was a hero today in lafayette park , where tourists congratulated him and took his picture mr haines , sauntering through lafayette park today with his wife and young son , described his encounter with the gunman this way i got on top of the man , grabbed his gun with my left hand , put my right knee on the guy s chest and tried to pull the gun away from him with both my hands , but it would n't come the gunman , identified by the secret service as francisco martin duran of colorado springs , apparently had the weapon , a semiautomatic chinesemade rifle , strapped around his neck mr haines , now 47 , says he ran for president in 1992 and is running again among those praising him today was alan a rosner , an accountant from albuqerque , nm , in town for a convention , who said mr haines looks like a hero to me the gunman was fumbling with his rifle , possibly trying to reload it , when two other passersby tackled him on the sidewalk north of the white house on saturday the two men , harry rakosky , 34 , of san antonio , and ken davis , 24 , of hagerstown , md , said they did not feel like heroes mr davis is being trained for a job as a correctional officer in maryland , and mr rakosky works for a private security company in san antonio they and mr haines acted spontaneously on saturday , without consultation or coordination mr davis said he noticed a commotion 8 to 10 feet away from him , then saw a man pulling a rifle out of his trench coat i stood there facing him , said mr davis i was dumbfounded i thought , what could be done about this \? he pointed the gun at me , holding it at waist level i just kind of froze i backed up into pennsylvania avenue he turned back toward the white house and resumed firing then he kept firing as he was walking mr davis said the gunman dropped a cartridge clip and was trying to load another one he was fumbling with it , said mr davis he was nervous i started running toward his back harry hit him high , in the back i grabbed his legs as he went down he kicked a tiny bit and stopped the barrel was against his side , pointed up for his part , mr rakosky said the gunman was concentrating on his weapon and started putting in another magazine , and i thought that would be a good time to take him out i think the lord had me at the right place at the right time , mr rakosky added carl j meyer , a secret service agent , said he doubted that absolute security for the president was possible we ca n't have the president operating in a vacuum , he said mr meyer said there must be a balance between security for the president and public access to his activities moreover , he observed , mr clinton really is invigorated when he goes out and meets people diagram a closer look security at the white house access 1 all visitors and staff must pass through metal detectors staff members and other authorized people \( like reporters \) have passes that are only good at specific points of entry visitors must receive a special security clearance before entering bombsniffing dogs check every vehicle other defenses 2 a 10foot high metal fence separates the grounds from the public sidewalk officials say that security improvements have been made to the fence in recent years , but details are a closely guarded secret 3 sice 1983 , concrete barriers have lined the sidewalk to deter attacks by vehicles 4 guards patrol grounds motion detectors and cameras also detect intruders 5 rooftops are patroled by guards airspace in the area is restricted and monitored by radar 6 windows in the central mansion are bulletproof 7 streets are blocked by traffic when the president s motorcade passes the pennsylvania avenue exit is rarely used by the president , but his route of entry and exit are intentionally varied
when people talk about integrated resources , the nationwide real estate syndication firm that filed for bankruptcy almost five years ago , only a few observations will not draw a big argument one is that the company has gone through one of the ugliest bankruptcy cases they have ever experienced integrated resources owed its existence almost entirely to the sales prowess of drexel burnham lambert s junkbond star , michael milken when both drexel and integrated collapsed on the same day in february 1990 , integrated s infuriated creditors included some of the nation s biggest banks , whose lawyers were soon presiding over a gordian knot of litigation the only other largely undisputed observation about the integrated case is that the haggling would probably still be going on but for a tenacious money manager from san francisco named meridee moore by uniting divided creditors , by adhering to ironclad deadlines , and by putting a clear price tag on every moment of delay , ms moore brought a spirit of compromise into a case that many thought was hopelessly paralyzed by mistrust and suspicion she restored rationality to the process , said chuck davidson , who represented steinhardt management in its successful bid for the company s assets richard ader , a general partner of an integrated subsidiary involved in the case , added that by insisting that legal skirmishes be avoided unless they benefited creditors , she put a leash on the lawyers frustration with the nation s bankruptcy code has already produced amendments , signed into law last month by president clinton , that are supposed to speed and streamline the process those who think further reforms are needed could cite the integrated case but to see the case as merely the byproduct of a flawed system would be to miss its broader lesson that no system can resolve disputes unless the people in it can resolve those disputes that is where persuasive negotiators like ms moore come in i was very clear with everyone about what i wanted , said ms moore , an intense 36yearold who is one of eight partners in farallon capital management , which manages more than 1 billion for institutional clients and which had bought a small stake in integrated s debt i wanted the most amount of money in the least amount of time the outcome she helped achieve is certainly better than many creditors had expected this month , the company renamed the presidio capital corporation will emerge from bankruptcy under a plan submitted by steinhardt the plan will ultimately provide senior creditors with at least 70 percent of their original claims of about 11 billion , which two years ago were worth barely 40 percent of face value the junior creditors will get at least 31 percent and up to 45 percent of their claims of 672 million , which they see as an achievement in a case that might have left them emptyhanded ms moore , a yale law school graduate who worked for six years at lehman brothers before joining farallon in 1991 , did not singlehandedly achieve that result , of course some people credit mr davidson , a problemsolver who emerged as one of two key bidders for integrated s assets others cite the role of edward s weisfelner , a new york lawyer working for the least powerful class of creditors mr davidson , on behalf of steinhardt management , had negotiated an exclusive settlement in early 1992 with a battalion of limited partners whose legal claims against integrated s hundreds of real estate partnerships clouded the potential value of the company s assets that gave him significant leverage in the bidding a few months later , mr weisfelner helped block a less advantageous reorganization plan offered by the company s own management but nothing had been able to produce consensus the company s growing pile of cash sat in lowinterest accounts while the creditors bickered , none of them trusting that they would get a fair deal the mistrust was partly rooted in the company s past many powerful creditors were hostile from the beginning toward integrated s senior management , which under the bankruptcy code had considerable power over the reorganization process moreover , most of the banks that had lent to integrated led by the chemical bank were being sued by the company , which had accused them of unfairly cutting off its lines of credit that litigation not only generated bad feelings between the company and those defendant banks but also drove a wedge between the bank creditors and the other creditors who might benefit if the company won the case adding to the acrimony was the fact that the bank creditors were opposed to sharing a penny of the company s assets with the least powerful creditors , the subordinated note holders , among them the investment firm t rowe price compounding all this was the fact that the bidders for the company s assets , steinhardt management and the pritzker interests in chicago , each had to be sponsored by an official creditor committee thus , a creditor group had to simultaneously haggle with its pet bidder and also advocate that bidder s plan in the larger haggling
moscow , feb 18 mikhail zhvanetsky , russia s most popular comedian , was recently asked about reform much has changed , but nothing has happened , he began , but then paused in feigned confusion or is it that much has happened , and nothing has changed \? the audience loved it the joke echoed the discussions that fill kitchens and courtyards , the commentaries in the papers , the debates that resound from many distant foreign capitals extraordinary changes have come to russia , things that no one would have dreamed of a few years ago commercialism and criticism bright kiosks and private shops packed with every conceivable goody line the streets the papers freely bash lenin , boris n yeltsin and anyone else foreigners travel unrestricted through oncesecret cities olympic coverage is interrupted for volvo commercials but old ways have proven tenacious no sooner had president yeltsin crushed one hostile legislature than russians elected another dominated by chauvinists and communists , and the new deputies began by voting themselves cars , moscow apartments and salaries matching those of cabinet ministers after a brief parade of reformers , the cabinet under prime minister viktor s chernomyrdin has reverted to what the economist grigory a yavlinsky describes as typically soviet a coalition of industrial interest groups scrambling to secure inflationary credits , backed by a bloated bureaucracy and shady businessmen who have made millions speculating on inflation 'let it go as it s going' their only discernible strategy , says yegor t gaidar , the sidelined pioneer of radical reform , is let it go as it s going nine years after mikhail s gorbachev proclaimed the process of perestroika , or restructuring , and two years after mr yeltsin broke up the soviet union , many russians wonder whether russia has entered irreversibly on a path of westernstyle development , or whether it is only passing through another of its shortlived lurches the failures rampant crime and insecurity mulling russia s plight , a babushka at the farmers' market reached for old folk wisdom the russian , she declared , wo n't budge until the roasted rooster pecks him in the rear the theme has many variants among the endless proverbs and snatches of verse with which many russians shape their worldview these days , it is invoked so often that it takes on the quality of a selffulfilling prophesy , as if it is a given that all russia s endeavors are doomed to founder in some congenital russian inertia indeed , it is hard not to wonder why reform is such a mess in russia true , russia has won extensive freedoms , it has changed in many ways , and despite wrenching upheavals , it has so far avoided collapse , civil war and revival of dictatorship the subways still run , moscow streets are clogged with cars , and there has been no mass hunger or cold but the failures are glaring the gap with the west has not been closed , as mr gorbachev promised back in 1985 , and economists wonder how the country will make it through spring this month , the main producer of vodka seemingly the one industry that could not fail suspended production under an avalanche of taxes instead of shaping a new middle class , the weakening of state control has fostered pervasive crime a report recently prepared for mr yeltsin said that up to 80 percent of all private enterprises in russia were paying heavy tribute to the mafia , the generic name for the armies of racketeers and bandits that have sprouted across russia streets that once knew no crime have become dangerous an orderly at moscow s first city hospital reported an average of 40 serious mugging victims daily about 10 , 000 hoods are said to operate full time in st petersburg eight leading bankers have been slain over the last year haphazard credit and export policies have enabled a handful of businessmen to amass huge fortunes , which they flaunt in the finest tradition of the old russian merchants , scattering pedestrians as they race through moscow in their exotic sedans with heavily armed bodyguards while foreigners look on the gaudy kiosks as signs of prosperity and plenty , many russians view them as humiliating reminders of eroding values and growing poverty except for a small fraction that has found support abroad , the intellectual elite of the soviet union scientists , professors and writers feels increasingly forsaken and alienated optimists have justified this as an unattractive but necessary process of primary capital accumulation but little of that capital has stayed in russia the government estimates that 25 billion has gone in the last two years to switzerland , austria , cyprus , north america and other distant havens life expectancy , low in the old soviet union , has sunk even further with deteriorating health care according to new figures , the life expectancy for men dropped from 62 in 1992 to 59 in 1993 , while infant mortality rose from 178 per 1 , 000 to 193 trauma deaths accidents , suicides , murders , military casualties , poisonings rose last year from the fifth to the third leading cause of death
mineola , li , march 19 ten months after armand p d'amato was convicted of fraud in a scheme to influence his brother , senator alfonse m d'amato , the new york legal establishment has taken up his cause , saying he was convicted of something many lawyers do and should be allowed to do filing misleading bills while the case drew much attention with revelations that an official at the unisys corporation had paid mr d'amato to win access to the senator , as a legal matter the crime was not influencepeddling but mail fraud mr d'amato was convicted and sentenced to five months in prison because his law firm sent bills to unisys for consulting work that mr d'amato never did now , as mr d'amato pursues his appeal , his case has become something of a cause celebre in legal circles five bar association groups , along with the prominent new york lawyer arthur liman , have filed a brief on mr d'amato s behalf , and he has also found an ally in the new york civil liberties union the bar groups maintain that billing practices like mr d'amato s are commonly employed and are protected by the confidential relationship between a lawyer and client they say lawyers have the right to obfuscate or even misstate their charges if a client asks them to but others are surprised and angry about mr d'amato s newfound support richard uviller , a former prosecutor and professor at columbia university law school who teaches criminal law and ethics , said , i frankly am ashamed of the bar associations and arthur liman for arguing that deception should not be liable for criminal prosecution a bill is a lawyer s statement of what he did , the professor said a lawyer is not required to lie , even at the request of a client a bill that states that services were rendered for something not rendered is a deceptive statement but in briefs filed in january , mr d'amato s lawyers for the appeal , john l warden and robert j giuffra jr , the five bar groups and the civil liberties union said that such billing practices were not unusual and that using them as a basis for convicting mr d'amato could have serious repercussions we 're clearly concerned with an overcriminalization of the law , mr liman said if the management of a corporation asks that a bill be described in general terms rather than specifically , can that be treated as a fraud on shareholders , especially when the management of the corporation knew what the services were , that they were of lawful purposes , and asked that the description be opaque \? this case , mr liman added , is part of a tendency to use criminal law where the issues are ethical , not criminal and a brief by the civil liberties union called for a reversal of mr d'amato s conviction , because there is no evidence that the federal mail fraud statute was ever intended to reach this far based on previous decisions , the brief argues , the law should not be applied to minor corporate transactions , like mr d'amato s deal with unisys , that do not cause a substantial economic loss for shareholders and that do not conceal illegal activity , like bribery or kickbacks the government disagrees with this interpretation free on bail mr d'amato , 49 , formerly a partner in a thriving law firm in mineola , is free on 10 , 000 bail pending his appeal he was convicted on may 7 of seven counts of mail fraud involving 32 , 500 he was paid by unisys for several reports that he did not write at his trial , the federal government argued that mr d'amato was hired by a rogue unisys employee to provide access to his brother they said he defrauded the company by taking part in a billing scheme to conceal the true reason the company hired him the senator has said he was unaware of his brother s arrangement with unisys at the trial , both sides agreed that armand d'amato s lobbying of his brother was not illegal indeed , at a sentencing hearing in october , stephen p scaring , mr d'amato s trial lawyer , argued that mr d'amato had provided true value to the company , describing him as a man who could reach out to senator d'amato not like everyone else can , who could contact the senator by picking up the telephone , and who could get a letter written maybe that would n't have been written otherwise simply following orders as mr scaring told it , mr d'amato was simply following the billing orders of the executive who hired him and had provided other valuable services that the bills did not mention but the government contended that unisys was defrauded because top unisys officials would not have agreed to pay mr d'amato for such ethically questionable services the two sides disagree over whether mr d'amato s contacts at unisys were acting without proper authorization , and if so , whether mr d'amato knew it a major piece of evidence was a purchase order that mr d'amato told his law partner , jeffrey forchelli , to sign in february 1988 the order was for reports on congressional proceedings that mr d'amato never wrote he admitted in court that unisys employees had written the reports , none longer than five sentences , and given copies of them to him to place in his files the prosecution argued that this arrangement was so unusual that mr d'amato must have realized something strange was going on
the hague , dec 20 top military commanders of the united nations , nato and countries contributing to the united nations peacekeeping force in bosnia met here today and said they had agreed on measures to strengthen its effectiveness , come peace or more war their recommendations included proposals to increase the force s size from the current level of 24 , 000 and to provide it with new transport helicopters and other aircraft and with armed nato escorts that would enable the united nations force to get supplies into towns by air when convoys are blocked on the ground highranking military officers from 14 nato countries , including the united states , said in a statement that they had agreed with officials from russia and 13 other countries contributing to the united nations protection force in the former yugoslavia on detailed measures that would strengthen its ability to help civilian victims of the war and encourage a political settlement none of the recommendations were revealed in detail in the communique but gen henk van den breemen of the netherlands , the host of the meeting , said we talked about air mobility , transport helicopters and aircraft and armed escort helicopters when road access is denied if you look at all the proposals , the consequences could be more people gen john m shalikashvili , the chairman of the united states joint chiefs of staff , took part in the twoday meeting and was also part of its consensus on additional measures , but american officials said that no american soldiers would join the united nations force lieut gen bertrand de lapresle of france , the overall commander of the united nations forces in the former yugoslavia , made some of the proposals and said he supported all of them the goal would be to make united nations operations less vulnerable to coercion by the bosnian factions , particularly the serbs , who have often blocked relief convoys general de lapresle said he had asked for such additional military capabilities as engineer commando units to help maintain communications links while traveling through difficult terrain or when encountering hostile behavior by combatants the generals said they had also discussed regrouping some units to make them stronger , and had talked at length about a french proposal to establish a protected ground route from the croatian port of split to the bosnian capital of sarajevo through a 10mile stretch controlled by the bosnian serbs a study group was set up to work out the details of such a corridor , general van den breemen said other recommendations included development of an emergency supply plan for sarajevo and for isolated muslim enclaves like bihac , srebrenica and gorazde , but no details were made available here general van den breemen said that the military commanders had discussed strengthening nato air escorts with german tornado fighterbombers , which have special weapons for detecting and destroying surfacetoair missile launchers like the ones the serbs have moved close to bihac and sarajevo the german cabinet had been planning to inform the allies this week that it would be prepared to send the planes into combat , but only if the force had to be pulled out of bosnia under fire the chief of staff of the german armed forces , gen klaus naumann , attended the meeting but did not comment publicly the military recommendations would have to be approved by political officials in the contributing countries , by the united nations and by the nato alliance

has not had a permanent black resident in more than 60 years it was the first time since the mid1960 s that the federal government had enforced the integration of a housing project with such an armed escort residents of the 74unit housing complex had resisted all other efforts at integration last year , four other black families quickly moved out after enduring what they described as unremitting hostility from some whites here roberta achtenberg , the department of housing and urban development s assistant secretary for fair housing and equal opportunity , said today s operation , carried out before dawn under the cover of darkness , reflected the clinton administration s determination to achieve integration in scores of housing projects around the country where judicial integration orders had either failed or been ignored in recent years she said that federal officials planned to move several more black families to the vidor project in coming weeks and that she expected more such operations to comply with similar orders elsewhere volunteered to move in ringed by a chainlink fence , the complex , vidor village , remained under 24hour police guard this evening reporters were not allowed onto the complex , which consists of clusters of modest beigevinyl and redbrick apartment units surrounded by oaks and loblolly pines federal officials said that 18 of the white residents , unprodded , had held a welcoming party at noon for their new black neighbors two single women with seven children between them , a single black man and a single black woman the new residents , who volunteered to move into vidor village after being asked by federal officials who picked their names from waiting lists for public housing in three nearby towns with large black populations , began arriving in three cars shortly after 5 30 am they were accompanied by several moving vans and officials in hud cars , along with a police escort the housing department has paid offduty vidor police officers to protect the complex intermittently during the last year , a practice described by housing officials as a routine way of providing security in many housing projects around the country several white residents of vidor village said that they were tired of portrayals of vidor as a bigoted town and that they wanted integration to work many residents here blame outside ku klux klan agitators for previous frictions at the complex ilene pierce said she went over this morning to say hello to one of her new neighbors she said she was a little bit intimidated , but that they had the right to live anywhere they wanted , mrs pierce said they all seemed like anybody else , trying to make a living and getting on with their lives and raising children some white residents complained that it was only now , with blacks being brought in , that the housing department had undertaken longpromised improvements to the project for lowincome people for instance , five washing machines were installed recently , the first ever at the complex four months ago , housing secretary henry g cisneros came to vidor and took control of the local housing authority , which he accused of dragging its feet on a longstanding judicial integration order we do n't in america in 1993 anywhere tell anyone they ca n't live anywhere because of the color of their skin , he said at the time , and he promised to move in a critical mass of black families to insure integration would work mr cisneros said in washington today that security for the blacks in vidor would remain in place for an indefinite period he said the local authorities had promised to cooperate michael lowe , grand dragon of the texas knights of the ku klux klan said today that the black families were being forced on the people of vidor 'leave us alone' the move was unannounced but as word quickly spread this morning , reporters and onlookers converged on the scene at a news conference at our lady of the lourdes catholic church , city councilman gary wells asked reporters to leave us alone in coming weeks as the town tried to integrate with the brief exception of the four black people , two men and two women , who left here last year , vidor has not had a black resident since the 1920 s i would like to welcome these new residents to this great city , said mr wells there will possibly be problems but there will also be solutions vidor , a town of about 11 , 000 people set in texas s piney woods near the louisiana border , was known several years ago as a center of klan activity one of the blacks who left last year said she was frequently met by racial epithets and another said he just got tired of wondering what abuse he would hear from a passing car as he walked down the street but none was ever physically injured and hours after the man , bill simpson , moved out , he was shot to death in nearby beaumont in what the police said was an unrelated , random robbery attempt his accused killer is black abuse from outsiders in any event , many here said the worst abuse of the blacks came from outsiders after the last black resident moved out in september , a white supremacist group from mississippi , the nationalist movement , led a victory in vidor parade , which was sparsely attended , down the city s main street ms achtenberg specifically praised vidor s mayor , ruth woods , and the vidor police for working with her to see that integration was carried out ms achtenberg declined to confirm reports from some of the white residents that several prospective black tenants had backed out of today s move at the last minute at one point early last year , there were 1 , 300 blacks on the housing waiting lists in beaumont , orange and port arthur , three nearby , largely black cities , but not one had volunteered to come to vidor monthly rent at vidor village is based on a tenant s income and ranges from 325 to nothing , other than the cost of utilities ms achtenberg confirmed that while four blacks and their children had agreed to move into town this morning , more than 100 other blacks had been interviewed and , presumably , said thanks but no thanks there is no question , she said ,

a tiny new new york agency , offering another example of the fundamental changes remaking the advertising industry , is creating work that is beginning to appear around the world for a giant marketer the agency , krimstein clapps ltd , was opened in september by ken krimstein and john clapps , creative partners for three years at the huge new york shop mccannerickson the pair , copresidents and cocreative directors of krimstein clapps , are introducing a consumer and trade campaign for gilbey s gin , a brand with an annual budget of 15 million that is marketed in 150 countries by w a gilbey ltd , a unit of the international distillers and vintners group of grand metropolitan plc the campaign is being offered to the couple of dozen agencies that handle gilbey s in various markets , which can run it as is , adapt it for local use or create their own ads if they test as well as the krimstein clapps effort it is already running , or set to run , in australia , bahrain , barbados , britain , kenya , spain and sweden , but not in the united states the campaign created by mr krimstein , the copywriter , and mr clapps , the art director , carries the theme dive right in it features anthropomorphic versions of gin garnishes that cannot wait to become intrinsic ingredients in drinks made with gilbey s in one print advertisement , for instance , lemon and lime wedges duel each other with colored plastic cocktail swords in another ad , an olive tells a gilbey s martini glass , go ahead , make my day and in a third , a lemon , lashed into a parachute , is poised to make a perfect landing into a tall glass of gilbey s we viewed them as the experts on the quality of where they were going , mr krimstein said of the garnishes , which serve , in essence , as endorsers the message is that gilbey s tastes so great , he added , you want to get into it the campaign , which will be extended into commercials , is evocative of the 1960 s campaign by papert , koenig , lois that concocted fanciful conversations between bottles of wolfschmidt s vodka and drink mixers like tomatoes and oranges it s classic 'product as hero' advertising , but done in a way that tries not to take ourselves too seriously , said mike spurling , the gilbey s international brand director at wa gilbey in london it communicates a dynamic , funloving , younger , more accessible positioning there are several trends that are embodied by krimstein clapps s campaign for gilbey s , which runs a distant no 4 in america , trailing seagram s , gordon s and tanqueray gilbey s sells more strongly in markets like canada , south africa and the asiapacific region , and worldwide the brand sold 23 million nineliter cases last year one trend is the fragmentation of agency services , enabling a grand met to hire a creative hothouse like krimstein clapps , mr spurling said , then hire larger shops for tasks like research and media services we found we wanted to give highly creative people a maximum amount of opportunity to do what they 're good at , he added , with a minimum amount of bureaucracy another trend is the growth of socalled global brands , which can be sold anywhere through campaigns imbuing them with single distinctive personalities this is a very , very simple idea , mr spurling said of the dive right in theme , that translates easily and clearly to consumers worldwide yet , rather than saying the object was a consistent piece of communication around the world , he added , we wanted something that would be absolutely relevant to consumers in any market if we get consistencies , that s an added benefit and finally , the campaign s transatlantic origins are indicative of recent technological breakthroughs that enable mr clapps to scan shots into a computer in new york that can be seen in london in an hour and then shipped around the world , he said the three men met in 1990 , when mr spurling was the american marketing director for smirnoff vodka , another grand met brand , and mr krimstein and mr clapps worked on the smirnoff account at mccann the gilbey s campaign is not running in the united states because the advertising decisions here are made by the brand s american importer , the jim beam brands company , which uses fallon mcelligott for its products the gilbey s american account has been inactive of late competitive media reporting , a company that tracks ad spending , reported none for 1993 , compared with 32 million in 1992 , when a print campaign appeared carrying the theme the authentic gin and using imagery of the roaring twenties mr spurling said he hoped the brand would resume its american presence soon other accounts that krimstein clapps handles include the waldbaum s supermarket chain in metropolitan new york , for which it introduced a humorous radio campaign last month emphasizing unbeatable prices , and the china grill restaurant in manhattan
kiryas joel , ny the people of this hasidic village are so passionately devoted to their rebbe , or grand rabbi , that few will marry , change jobs , buy a house or undergo surgery without his blessing yet for four years , the villagers , members of the satmar hasidic sect , have been responsible for running a public school system , which by its very nature must provide a greater tolerance for dissent and individual freedom the united states supreme court is expected in march to examine whether the state legislature s creation of that school district in 1989 for the benefit of a single religious community is constitutional but a group of satmar dissidents says that even if that action is upheld , the religious community has so far shown itself to be too insular and hierarchical to run a publicly financed school system the dissidents contend that the authority of the rebbe , moses teitelbaum , and officials close to him prevails over the public school system and people who have questioned or challenged public school elections , they say , have paid a steep price within their religious world , suffering banishment from the village s main synagogue , congregation yetev lev d satmar , and the expulsion of their children from the principal yeshiva , the united talmudical academy there s a total intertwining of church and state , said michael sussman , a lawyer who has represented several of the dissidents in legal actions against the congregation the leaders of the school district reject such accusations , saying they have been scrupulous in keeping the school free of religious influence the dissidents were ostracized , they say , for showing disrespect to the rebbe , not because they opposed the schoolboard slate respect for elders precedes the learning of torah , said abraham weider , president of the school board and of the synagogue , quoting a rabbinical proverb and that is why we have no crime , no drugs and the largest village in new york state without a police force the state legislature created the kiryas joel village union free school district to allow handicapped children to receive government services without the ridicule their uncommon garb drew in neighboring public schools last summer , new york state s highest court found that the district s very existence was unconstitutional because it created a symbolic union between church and state in hearing an appeal of that ruling , the supreme court will examine only the constitutionality of the district s creation , not of its operation and governance yet some critics believe it is precisely the operation most glaringly the way the school board is elected that violates the constitution romanian roots the yiddishspeaking satmar have their roots in the romanian city of satumare the ravages of the holocaust brought them to the williamsburg section of brooklyn , and when that community grew too crowded in the mid1970 s , an offshoot was planted in this rustic area 30 miles north of the bronx named village of joel after rabbi joel teitelbaum , the grand rabbi who died in 1979 at age 92 , it resembles a hasidic shtetl , with blacksuited men scurrying along , bewigged women pushing baby carriages while other children pull at their elbows , and homeowners airing their feather quilts with the onset of winter obeying the biblical injunction to be fruitful , satmar families average 10 children , so that of the 12 , 000 kiryas joel residents , 5 , 300 are of school age all but 80 those most severely disabled or retarded attend the village s separate yeshivas for boys and girls those 80 are in the new public school , but 500 or so of the yeshiva students also attend the school for up to three hours a day for special governmentfinanced services classes for the learning disabled , classes in english as a second language , counseling and physical therapy a visit to the squat brick schoolhouse , in the company of the district s superintendent , dr steven benardo , discloses some differences from typical public schools but no clearcut violations of the churchstate wall the school s kitchen is kosher and on those jewish holidays when work is forbidden , the school is only nominally open and mr benardo acknowledges that he takes pains with older children to honor the satmar prohibition against mingling boys and girls but no classes deal with religious content and during hanukkah , no menorahs or holiday decorations were visible even though such symbols are common in public schools since we 're being scrutinized i 've got to be glatt kosher , mr benardo jested , using the term for being incontrovertibly kosher outsiders as teachers while most teachers' aides are villagers , none of the 18 licensed teachers and 30 therapists come from kiryas joel satmar residents could not qualify because the satmar prohibit college education as too great an immersion in the profane many teachers are from more lenient orthodox communities in nearby monsey mr bernardo , the former head of special education programs in the bronx , is jewish , though not orthodox
players and executives from the united states tennis association player development program gathered in the stands of the shady grandstand court at flushing meadows yesterday the match was not particularly compelling the seventhseeded and 13thseeded boys were facing each other in the third round of the united states open junior singles the stands were scattered with a handful of fans , most having drifted over from the stadium court next door but the usta representatives had reason for their visit on the court was justin gimelstob , the 13thseeded boy and the final remaining american in what is the premier american event on the international junior tour scott humphries and paul goldstein , the top two juniors from the united states , were upset in the first round only 4 of the 17 american boys in the junior draw made it to the second round and only one , gimelstob , was left in the third round everyone came out to root for him , said rodney harmon , a usta national coach for the junior development program it was not enough in a performance hampered by a sore right foot , gimelstob fell to andrew ilie of australia , 67 , 61 , 64 it s a shame that none of us performed better , said gimelstob , 17 , whose parents live in whippany , nj some of us had some tough matches we 'll have to see if we can save face next year in the boys' junior doubles , one american team faced another in the quarterfinals yesterday humphries and goldstein advanced to the semis by beating gimelstob and john roddick of austin , tex , 76 \( 86 \) , 61 along with humphries , goldstein and roddick , gimelstob is one of a handful of players the usta hopes to see develop into the next wave of american tennis talent of the topranked american men seeded at the 1994 open , four pete sampras , michael chang , jim courier and todd martin have been associated with the usta development program but only martin , who will face andre agassi in the semifinals saturday , can be considered a true product of the program we 're not embarrassed , harmon said of the poor showing at the open i think we 've had a really good year scott humphries made the semifinals at the italian open juniors , justin was in the third round at the french , and scott won at wimbledon it could always be better , but it could always be worse it was better in the girls' division where 3 of 19 americans advanced to the quarterfinals fourthseeded meilen tu of northridge , calif , defeated nannie de villiers \( no 16 \) of south africa , 61 , 75 dawn buth of wichita , kan , defeated surini de beer of south africa , and tara snyder , also of wichita , beat kataun marosi of hungary , 46 , 62 , 63 stephanie halsell , a texan seeded no 7 , lost yesterday to yvette basting \( no 15 \) of the netherlands 76 \( 74 \) , 64 at least one american girl will advance to the semifinals because tu plays snyder friday , while booth challenges topseeded martina hingis of switzerland for gimelstob , the next year is crucial he has one year of eligibility left as a junior \( 18 is the age limit \) , and he will soon have to decide whether to accept a tennis scholarship to college or turn pro he is in position to solicit scholarship offers from some of the top college programs in the country it all depends on how i'm playing in a year , said gimelstob maybe i 'll go to college and maybe i wo n't gimelstob chose to leave his family in january and move to palos verdes , calif , in order to live and train with his coach , robert lansdorp at palos verdes he has the opportunity to play against collegiate players from ucla and participate in a better yearround training program

upton , li , dec 8 an experimental cancer therapy for irradiating tissue deep inside the brain appears to have halted the growth of an inoperable brain tumor in a long island woman , raising hopes for the first practical treatment for a disease that usually kills victims within a year of diagnosis the treatment is boronneutroncapture therapy , a twostep process that delivers radiation to cancer cells by putting an attractant near the cells that soaks up radiation much as a blotter soaks up ink in the first step , the patient is injected with boron 10 , a naturally occurring nonradioactive isotope of the element , combined with an amino acid that the body naturally concentrates in the tumor then radiologists direct a stream of neutrons at the patient s head the neutrons that hit the boron split its atoms into an alpha particle , which carries radioactivity , and a lithium atom since these fragments travel only 10 microns or so , or the diameter of one cell , the radiation they deliver is very localized the rest of the neutrons pass through the unaffected area the therapy has been tested on small animals at the brookhaven national laboratory here , but was rushed into service for a human patient , joann magnus , of wesbury , li , because of political pressure on the department and a determined campaign by mrs magnus , a professional fundraiser in may , she was told she had glioblastoma multiforme , a fastgrowing tumor that can double in size in days it is diagnosed in about 7 , 000 americans each year lee atwater , the republican political strategist , and ethel merman , the entertainer , both died from glioblastoma multiforme a similar approach to these tumors was widely tried 30 years ago , but researchers concluded that the treatment did not cure anyone and probably hastened several deaths in japan , doctors have experimented with this technique , but have been using neutron beams with lower power , requiring surgical removal of part of the skull and many hours of irradiation recently , researchers at brookhaven national laboratory here and at other sites have been working with a better radiation beam and a new boron compound that concentrates in the tumors to a greater degree than the form used earlier , but none wanted to try the procedure on humans until they were certain it would be successful after a surgeon at of beth israel medical center , in manhattan , dr richard bergland , told mrs magnus about the experiments at brookhaven , she began a campaign to be the first human subject in 30 years she s the persuasive one , said her husband , who is a lawyer after about the third time someone says no to me , i give up with pointers from her brother , a professor of technology at the university of maryland who has done consulting work for the energy department , and research from her son , a medical student , she set out to persuade the department of energy , whose reactor here is one of two in the united states that produce neutrons at the proper energy for the treatment she wanted this so desperately , said hazel r o'leary , the secretary of energy she was talking to the research office , and it was n't happening , finally mrs magnus called mrs o'leary s office when i heard about her situation , i said , 'make it happen , ' mrs o'leary said today her efforts were also helped by several senators who criticized the energy department at a hearing in may for not pursuing such experimental treatments on sept 13 , mrs magnus was given the boron with an intravenous drip and was then exposed to a neutron beam coming out of the reactor for 41 minutes at brookhaven the treatment appears to have delivered three times as much radiation to the tumor as to the surrounding tissue and i do n't glow , she said today , in a meeting with mrs o'leary , who was here to tour the laboratory the interaction of neutrons and boron is well known neutrons are a component of atomic nuclei that are released when an atom is split in a reactor they go on to strike other nuclei and split them , sustaining a chain reaction brookhaven has a reactor that produces surplus neutrons that are used for various kinds of atomic research boron is widely used in nuclear physics because its nucleus has a shape that tends to snag passing neutrons in civilian power reactors , it is inserted to reduce the power level or shut the reaction down entirely mrs magnus s oncologist , dr manjeet chadha , of beth israel medical center in manhattan , said it was too early to judge the success of the treatment but the energy department is preparing an application to the food and drug administration to try boronneutroncapture therapy on 10 to 12 patients in the next six to eight months as a further test photo joann magnus , right , who received a promising new therapy for a usually deadly brain tumor , met with energy secretary hazel r o'leary yesterday at brookhaven national laboratory on long island , where ms magnus underwent

myrna march nudged the cat from her lap and took her husband s hand you 'll be running for both of us , she said , referring to the race for the cure in central park , where on sunday her husband will be one man among many women raising money and calling attention to breast cancer selfconsciously , the woman who had been a singer and model touched the blonde wig she has worn since once again starting chemotherapy to kill a cancer that has recurred in her breastbone while her husband runs , she will be resting up from her latest dose of the tiring treatment breasts and hospitals , her husband , dr arnold roufa said , retracing the couple s love story and explaining how he came to qualify for the race it keeps coming back to breasts and hospitals they met in 1969 while he was a resident in obstetrics and gynecology at st luke s and she was a patient undergoing minor surgery i was doing rounds and i saw her , the most beautiful woman i had ever seen , with red hair and a gorgeous figure , amazing , in a lowcut nightgown ms march smiled at the recollection i was always large breasted , she said a 39 d when i sang and modeled , my breasts opened doors i got jobs because of my talent , but i got auditions because of my breasts dr roufa said he kept visiting her , enchanted by the way she talked , the way she thought they became friends , and then best friends and lovers in 1973 , divorced from their respective spouses , they married a year and a half later , i found a lump , said ms march , who by then was writing rhythm and blues songs my mother died at 39 too vain to see a doctor i got several medical opinions it was cancer , and i had to face my first mastectomy that , she said , was the hardest time i had crazy thoughts i thought i was being punished for bad things i had done , for flirting , luring away men from their wives she postponed the operation and spent a lot of time with a psychiatrist gradually i realized how much our society overvalues breasts , she said they are used to sell cars , but what s their purpose \? even to suckle babies , there s now formula her husband , she said , had long ago made me realize that the most important of the sexual organs was the mind two years later , ms march found a growth in her remaining breast and , that breast , too , was removed she said in some ways she was strangely relieved i felt that none were better than one before i felt like a unicorn by this time dr roufa was heading the ambulatory unit of the obstetrics department at st luke s i was seeing thousands of patients i was working with the hospital breast project , encouraging women to check themselves regularly i knew that one out of nine women would face breast cancer in their lives one out of nine i would tell my patients about myrna i would boast of our life together about her vitality i thought her experiences sensitized me to the way women feel and made me a better doctor , but i never expected what happened next , which is what really qualifies me to run this sunday it was a time of growth for both husband and wife ms march had started a musicpublishing company , marchon she was working with nell carter , a close friend , and she was branching out into country music her husband s practice was growing , and under his wife s urging he was learning to play the piano and wearing his hair in a pony tail then i started to feel pains in my breast , dr roufa said every day i was telling women to test themselves , and my breast was becoming sore and enlarged and i was ignoring my symptoms i knew that a certain amount of men get breast cancer , but the figures are so low about 900 a year throughout the country that i did nothing i could n't believe i might be a breast cancer victim finally , it was so painful i went to a surgeon it was cancer and now i was the one who had to have surgery ms march interjected , oh , rouf , why do you always have to show me up \? they could laugh now , but at the time the strains on the marriage were great it was his turn to have crazy thoughts , ms march recalled he would look at me , and i could tell he was thinking he had caught his breast cancer from me dr roufa admitted he had such thoughts i was a doctor , a scientist and a specialist who knew better still i had such thoughts but myrna challenged me and forced me to talk about my feelings that s what we 've always done , talked about things ms march agreed how else can you find out how the other person feels \? in this marriage , it was obvious both partners knew and on sunday , ms march will almost certainly feel herself in her husband s running shoes , while he , qualified to race by the experience of his own breast cancer , will empathize with her , as she rests from chemotherapy
when it comes to wine , rarity is an asset no one pays 300 for a bottle of chateau petrus because of the taste it s a very good wine , of course , but the price is based on the fact that so little of it is made there s a good chance that if someone could produce a large quantity of petrus and drop the price , not a few buyers would wonder what all the fuss had been about as late as the 1970 s , wines made from the viognier grape had something of a legendary quality about them in fact , there were only two condrieu and chateau grillet both of them , and particularly chateau grillet , were quite rare today there are dozens of viognier wines condrieu is a village along the rhone river in france , about 25 miles south of lyons only viognier is grown on the steep slopes and terraces surrounding the village , and all of it about 50 acres is used to produce a single white wine that takes the village name , condrieu three miles south of town but still within the condrieu wine district is chateau grillet , a vaguely renaissancestyle country house with seven acres of viognier that are entitled to use the chateau name rather than that of the village the grillet vineyard , in a natural amphitheater , produces a white wine similar to condrieu but with the capacity to age for many years most condrieu is best when young how to describe the wine \? the english wine writer clive coates calls it both delicate and concentrated in flavor , light and ethereal but nevertheless high in alcohol other writers have remarked on its muskiness , its intense apricot flavors and its bouquet of alpine flowers i would compare it with gewurztraminer , not so much in taste as in style both the aroma and the taste are intensely flowery and spicy , just like gewurztraminer , but with different flowers and different spices because so little is made 12 , 000 cases in a good year , none in a truly bad one both condrieu and chateau grillet have always commanded premium prices up to 45 a bottle for condrieu and 100 or more for older bottles of chateau grillet the two names still stand for the best wines made from the viognier grape , but condrieu is no longer the only place where it is grown a few acres are cultivated in the wine region adjoining condrieu , cote rotie , where it is authorized for use in that intense red wine a little has been made for many years in the southern rhone area , notably at the domaine steanne in the village of stgervais but the most significant plantings in recent years have been in the ardeche , a sparsely settled region west of the rhone , and in the new world , specifically california among the newer regions , california led the way in the late 1970 s at present there are about 30 california wineries making wine from the vio gnier grape , mostly in small quantities according to the viognier guild , an organization of producers and fans of the wine , there are 200 acres of viognier grapes planted in the united states , of which about 100 are already bearing fruit besides california , viognier can be found in colorado , utah , new mexico and virginia there are experimental plantings in italy and australia in france , there are now about 800 acres of viognier planted , with most of the grapes cultivated by growers with small vineyards in the languedocroussillon region in the south it is from these growers that the rhone wine specialist melvyn master buys the grapes for the viognier in his les jamelles line of wines available in most major markets in this country , les jamelles viognier sells for about 12 perhaps the most extensive plantings of viognier in france were completed about five years ago by georges duboeuf , the prominent beaujolais maker who in recent years has been releasing several rhone wines , principally cotes du rhone , under his own label mr duboeuf planted 250 acres of viognier in the onceremote ardeche region and last year produced his first commercial wine from those vines , about 7 , 000 cases the united states' allocation of this wine quickly sold out no surprise , since the price was an astonishingly low 495 the 1994 vintage should be available in the spring with viognier available at 5 to 12 , it is doubtful that condrieu and chateau grillet will ever again have the same mystique the wine at chateau grillet and condrieu , made from lowyielding old vines by producers like georges vernay and jean pinchon , is going to be more intense , more complex and more intriguing than lesser versions from france or california but the inexpensive versions are putting the wine in proper perspective it is an interesting wine to taste and talk about and even to match with some rich foods , but it is no match for a good white burgundy , a chablis or a california chardonnay tastings beringer cabernet sauvignon 1991 , knight s valley about 12 one of the great comeback stories of the wine business is the rise and fall and rise of beringer vineyards only the final phase concerns us here the napa valley winery s return to prominence in the 1980 s under the intelligent ownership of the swiss conglomerate nestle and the inspired winemaking of the late myron nightingale and , currently , ed sbragia countering the trend toward specialization among california wineries , beringer makes a wide range of wines even so , nothing has been allowed to detract from the quality of its cabernets this wine , from beringer s vineyards in knight s valley , just north of the napa valley , could be a benchmark for cabernets in the midprice range from a vintage not always noted for its depth , this is nevertheless a rich , beautifully balanced wine , quite drinkable now and for a halfdozen years to come drawing
seoul , south korea , june 18 for the first time since the korean peninsula was divided five decades ago , the presidents of north and south korea agreed today to hold a summit meeting , which is likely to focus on defusing tensions over the north s suspected effort to build a nuclear weapon the agreement was brokered by former president jimmy carter , who delivered the offer from north korea s 82yearold leader , kim il sung , after returning to seoul this morning from a threeday visit to pyongyang south korea s president , kim young sam , immediately met mr carter at blue house , the presidential mansion in the mountains ringing seoul , and told him that the sooner the better , aides said but south korean officials acknowledged that there was reason to question whether a summit meeting between the two countries , still technically at war , would ever take place they noted that many agreements between north and south have been thrown onto the scrap heap the staterun korean broadcasting system suggested in a television analysis tonight that this could be another attempt by the north to buy time and escape from a tense situation mr carter also used his visit to deliver a stinging critique of the clinton administration s strategy of seeking united nations sanctions against the north as part of an effort to force mr kim to give up his nuclear weapons program at a news conference outside the american ambassador s house here , mr carter said he believed that economic sanctions were doomed to failure and would do nothing but further poison relations between the north and the rest of the world the declaration of sanctions by the un would be regarded as an insult by them , branding it as an outlaw country , he said it would also constitute a personal insult to their socalled great leader , kim il sung , mr carter said , by branding him as a liar and a criminal this is something in my opinion which would be impossible for them to accept , he added he did not mention the north s frequent threats to regard any sanctions as an act of war mr carter s criticism and the prospect of a korean summit meeting may take much of the steam out of the administration s push for sanctions , which may be exactly what the north korean leader wanted seoul sought a northsouth summit meeting as early as 1981 , when south korea was ruled by the military strongman chun doo hwan when kim young sam took office last year as the south s first civilian president in decades , he repeated the offer but posturing and the imposition of conditions on both sides have always scuttled hopes of a meeting before one was ever scheduled some experts on north korea here believe that now the situation may be different because both men stand to gain politically from a meeting mr carter traveled to north korea as a private citizen , not as an envoy of mr clinton , a point he made repeatedly today but the former president s frequent contacts with the white house and his description of a stillvague offer from the north to freeze its nuclear program temporarily if highlevel talks began with the united states have clearly changed the dynamics of the standoff differences with clinton on the one hand , it has given the administration another opening to try to make diplomacy work , just as the white house is pressing for sanctions and weighing reinforcement of the 37 , 000 american troops here but mr carter s sharp differences with the white house over sanctions and his seeming embrace of mr kim also threaten to unravel the administration s effort to keep up the pressure by building a consensus for economic sanctions in the united nations security council the sanctions issue became a point of dispute on friday at the white house after mr carter , in comments broadcast by cnn , appeared to tell his north korean hosts that the administration had agreed to suspend its drive to punish the north mr clinton and his aides quickly said they had done nothing of the sort mr carter insisted today that his words had been misinterpreted the sanctions , he said , would be held in abeyance only if mr kim agreed to open the nuclear program to full inspection 'reverence' to leader but he made clear that he viewed the sanctions drive as a misguided effort that would only harden the north koreans' will to confront the united states he said this view was confirmed after observing their psyche and their societal structure and the reverence with which they look upon their leader mr carter said that mr kim had assured him that north korea was not building nuclear weapons mr carter heaped praise on kim il sung , the aging warrior who started the korean war 44 years ago i found him to be vigorous , intelligent , surprisingly well informed about the technical issues and in charge of the decisions about this country , he said there are frequent rumors that mr kim s health is declining but in television coverage of mr carter s visit , the north korean leader appeared alert and active one of the surprises of the trip is that mr carter met mr kim s wife , who is rarely seen in public south korean press reports indicate that mr carter was also offered an opportunity to meet kim jong il , the 52yearold son and heir apparent of kim il sung , but turned it down the younger mr kim almost never sees foreign visitors , and experts on north korea have often speculated that he lacks an ability to lead and to command respect from the military no nuclear freeze
eden prairie , minn excuse some minnesota vikings players and fans for rubbing their eyes and scratching their heads during the last off season when quarterback jim mcmahon was the team s major freeagent choice , but to many , this seemed like less than a shot in the dark did somebody say herschel walker \? we had just played in the nfc championship game in 1987 , and then made the playoffs in the '88 season , and there we were in '89 trading the future for herschel walker , said steve jordan , a vikings tight end none of us personally meant to slam herschel , but we could n't understand it we let go of guys like issiac holt and jesse solomon , who had meant so much , and we gave away all of those draft choices to dallas for herschel it not only hurt the team for the present but it seemed to ruin the future with no top draft choices coming in over the next few years , some guys on our team , not pushed by new competition , got complacent this team was in a mental funk has n't that trade been called the worst in nfl history \? it sure has and here were the vikings in their first stab at free agency selecting the oftinjured , controversial mcmahon 'what about joe montana \? ' the controversial part concerning his personality did not concern me , jordan said but i was thinking like everyone else if we 're going to get a veteran , gimpy quarterback , what about joe montana \? if we were going to move in the direction of youth like we had been , what about a younger quarterback \? the vikings were set on mcmahon because coach denny green insisted that mcmahon was the man now , as the vikings \( 97 \) enter the second straight year of playoff action under green with this afternoon s matchup against the giants \( 115 \) at giants stadium , green s move has been proven the right one the doubters , like jordan , are now believers i did n't look at the personality part of it or anything on the surface , green said i looked at his record i looked at his winning attitude i looked at our team being strong on defense and still improving on offense and him being the type of leader that would play to the strengths of both our offense and defense the vikings enter the playoffs with the league s topranked defense , designed under the creative eyes of the defensive coordinator , tony dungy they are in despite being 56 , and then 67 , late in the season they won their last three games , two over playoff teams and the seasonending victory at washington , to make the field and mcmahon has been a big reason why in the vikings' threegame winning streak that concluded the regular season , mcmahon completed 659 percent of his passes for 651 yards , with 6 touchdowns and only 2 interceptions last draft picks used meanwhile , the ugly residue of the walker trade has finally subsided , with the last draft choices that minnesota gave up in that trade being used in 1993 and with minnesota in the playoffs now , doom and gloom have turned into promise the vikings may be a wildcard team and an underdog this afternoon , but getting in the playoffs means they have a chance to reach the super bowl and as far as the giants are concerned , well , this is a matchup minnesota likes after all , the vikings played nine games against playoff teams this season and the giants played only three minnesota is 115 under green in road games this season , the vikings won at denver , at chicago and at green bay and had the toughest schedule among all 12 playoff teams they believe that they have the physical stamina to compete against the giants' running game and that their offense is more explosive than the giants we had n't made the playoffs in the two years before i came , so getting people to get over excuses and to become more resultoriented was the key , green said we made some moves with guys like herschel and keith millard , and we pushed the team to develop greater mental toughness i think the strength of schedule means something we 've done it over the season 'i do n't see anybody panicking' and green and the vikings say it should mean something that they enter the playoffs with three straight victories while the giants enter with consecutive losses mcmahon helps set the tone though injured much of this season , he was 83 in games he started he was asked about playoff pressure if it scares anybody at this point , they do n't need to be here , he said i do n't see anybody panicking about it what about the harsh giants stadium weather expected today \? both teams have to play in it , he said weather can be a factor if you let it be a factor then it s your own fault what about phil simms \? i do n't care about the other quarterbacks , he said i do n't play against them that s the defense s job no excuses only results a change in assistants the vikings' offense has received a jolt lately from mcmahon , from receivers cris and anthony carter , from running back scottie graham and from a reshuffled offensive line that has not allowed a sack in the last 14 quarters cris carter , one of the league s more acrobatic receivers , led the team in catches with 86 , averaged 125 yards per grab and made nine touchdown receptions after the vikings' second game this season , green fired the offensive coordinator , jack burns , and turned the offense over to the tight end coach , brian billick burns , a former washington redskins coach , wanted to run the offense exactly the way washington did green insisted that his team was not the minnesota redskins the change from burns to billick has gotten more offensive players involved and loosened up the scheme on early downs although the vikings did not enjoy an array of top draft choices over the last few seasons , they have been resourceful look no further than graham for an example he was working at a pharmacy when the vikings called and signed him to the practice squad last fall he did not carry the ball until a dec 5 game at detroit since then , he has led the team in rushing yards with 487 and reached the end zone three times remember , too , that the vikings lost the dazzling back terry allen to injury before the season began it took this team some time to jell , but that s what the 16game season is about 16 games to find out what you 're made of over the long haul , green said we 've had people come out of nowhere and make significant contributions throughout the lineup our guys have met the challenge we 're ready for new ones photos the vikings think their defense , with carlos jenkins , jack del rio and henry thomas , from left to right , can stop the giants' running game \( allsport \) \( pg 2 \) coach dennis green of the vikings \( ken levine allsport \) insisted that quarterback jim mcmahon \( otto gruele allsport \) was his man instead of going after a younger quarterback \( pg 1 \)
adam bonin has read all the horror stories about lawyers how hard they work , how little respect they get , how thankless their profession has become yet from the first time he saw la law , mr bonin says , he knew he wanted to be a lawyer that show made law look so cool , said mr bonin , a 21yearold philadelphian recently accepted by the university of chicago law school i like being on the spot and being in the spotlight , and that means law or politics becky pennell , 23 , of richmond , wash , who is at stanford law school , takes the cautionary tales about the profession more to heart but ms pennell said she planned to work with the homeless and did not think the public images of lawyers would apply to her yes , it s discouraging when people do n't differentiate between ambulance chasers and legal aid attorneys , she said but in public interest law you are not working to get more billable hours or to make partner , but to have a positive impact on the world it is almost impossible to pick up a law journal without reading yet another story about how miserable the lot of lawyers has become they work 80 hours a week or more , yet their chances of making partner are getting slimmer every day many feel like hypocrites , increasingly forced to defend , say , environmental polluters by day , even if they attend sierra club meetings by night in place of the respect once accorded lawyers , they cannot attend a cocktail party without hearing yet another lawyer joke no dearth of law students in such an environment , law schools should be facing a tough sell to undergraduates wary of spending three years and probably close to 90 , 000 to pursue a reviled profession and in fact , the flood of wouldbe lawyers has declined to about 85 , 000 this year from a peak of 94 , 000 in 1991 , according to the law school admission council but such drops can easily be pegged to the economy and the aging of the nation s population and at the top schools , applications are stable or even rising we 're going to be in business for a while , said nan mcnamara , assistant dean for admissions at new york university school of law , whose applications were up this year at yale law school , officials are bracing for too many students while applications are holding steady , the yield the number of students a school accepts who actually enroll turned out to be 217 , instead of the 175 students yale had expected our yield rate has been going up each year , said jean k webb , yale law school s director of admissions is it the recession \? is it the continued belief that lawyers get high salaries \? is it a spillover from the medical profession , where morale is even worse \? we 've looked at all these possible reasons , and the truth is , we do n't know what it is gerald l wilson , a prelaw adviser at duke university s trinity college , where more than 20 percent of the graduating class goes on to law school , said of the applicants , they all know the job market is bleak , the profession is changing , but each one thinks he or she will be the exception law school admissions deans say they are picking up the same attitude none of our applicants are saying , 'gee , i did n't know there are unhappy lawyers out there , ' said richard i badger , dean of students and head of the admissions committee at the university of chicago law school , where applications were up 8 percent this year they say they know what they want to do and these other unhappy people did not in interviews , admissions deans and law students said that many students assumed , with some justification , that backbreaking hours and backbiting environments are largely the hallmarks of bigcity law firms handling huge corporate cases these students are looking to careers in public interest law , as legal aid lawyers or environmental advocates , for example , or to careers with smaller firms in mediumsized cities at stanford , for example , the proportion of students joining law firms immediately after graduation has decreased by about 9 percent over the last five years , while the proportion going to judicial clerkships has increased 7 percent and the proportion going into public interest law is up 3 percent students increasingly realize that what they are losing financially by going into public service , they are getting back in triplicate in job satisfaction , said madeline kochen , director of public interest law programs at stanford even students going into conventional law firms insist that they can find the ones that will not force them into moral dilemmas kevin j o'connor , 27 , who will graduate from rutgers university school of law at newark next year , has already accepted a job with porzio , bromberg newman in morristown , nj mr o'connor says everyone seems happy at the the 40member corporate law firm , which specializes in litigation and environmental law he added i do n't think i will feel uncomfortable defending corporations in product liability suits it is the plaintiffs' attorneys who usually bring the cases without merit indeed , law students seem to have a penchant for differentiating between them \( the lawyers who give the profession a bad name \) and us \( those who will restore the law to its former prestige \)
it was true we would have a gooseegg omelette together , the balakian reynolds nalbantian family and me , but never so much as now , surrounded by this family of literary critics and one utopian economist , would i have such a feeling that thought was food , and idea was feeling and talking was home in an age in which so many seek the solace and stimulus of the organized artists' colony , creating their safe families through elective affinity rather than biological destiny , here was an old world family that was at once a selfcontained artists' colony and the allaccepting place of return that is perhaps every creator s dream around the diningroom table where the windows gave out to a view of green fields and then ocean , intellectual emotions ran high , voices were more often heard chorally than individually , and readjustments of position were passionate and continual the threehourlong meal , which took in whatever guests happened to be passing by , was not an unusual thing i 'll tell you why i'm not crazy about proust , said anna balakian , the matriarch of the family who has long been in the forefront of surrealist criticism a lovable provocateur , who was one of the first comparatists within the american university structure , she said this with a slightly sly smile as she held up the volume on esthetic autobiography just published by her daughter suzanne nalbantian , which makes proust one of its main focuses i do n't like delving into the past only , anna said even at my age now i do n't like looking into the past and i do n't like confessional writing because i am reserved we call her the victorian surrealist , suzie countered with obvious affection , hardly interrupting the ongoing chorus something volatile that both mother and daughter shared in the dark hair and flashing dark eyes , a regal quality in the deeply armenian roots , anna s hair pulled back into an oldfashioned bun and graying somewhat , suzie s demeanor just a bit formal for someone of her generation and age even as anna began to explain that it is only natural that someone like herself , who had grown up in istanbul when it was still called constantinople , in a family that for all its internationalism and cultural outreach was still prim and proper , should have wanted to rebel we had surrealist paintings on the walls instead of wallpaper , although i never liked surrealist writing much , suzie added with a smile , even as she described with an obvious fondness her adolescent meetings with andre breton and anais nin , how her aunt , nona balakian , one of the first woman editors at the new york times book review , used to give her books from her locker every time the family visited the office of the newspaper haig nalbantian , four years suzie s junior , whose interest in the practical side of the utopian dream had led him into economics , sat smiling and saying , none of us are particularly attracted to the dark writers , a statement heartily applauded by his mother , but immediately countered by both suzie and her husband , david reynolds , an americanist historical critic , whose canon very much treats the dark underside of the american romantic dream so often in families the beliefs of one seem to threaten the other , and the notion of shared work deteriorates with the first sign of any real difference so often families are afraid to be too close , especially in areas of creative work what was it that was so different here \? anna s latest book , the snowflake on the belfry , which argues , following heidegger , that the critic has as little power to affect the work of art as a snowflake has to make the church bell ring , seemed somehow to contain the answer for it posited basic , irrefutable principles of what art is , untouchable by critic or any other it posited the need for certain esthetic quests particular affinities , and even judgments about the relative success or failure of any particular artist , fell far by the wayside in the shared definition of what art is and what a critic s role should be for here in this family , that strove for something called truth so taboo in these days of viewing everything through the lens of the relative , that questioned and that judged relentlessly , were searchers who believed that there was something to be found and from morning to night , together and separately , they would devote their every waking moment to this as i commented on how moved i was by the togetherness offered that allowed the space for the very separate and risktaking inquiry of each , they seemed to answer me in chorus , saying yes it is our love that helps to reinforce our common purpose of writing and our love of our writing in turn makes our family life more stable and more exciting people watching us from the outside might think we do n't have any fun , for we rarely leave the house but we do n't see it that way perhaps psychology is wrong about the need to leave the family , haig said with something of his mother s provocative lilt i guess it is the proustian side of us , our staying at home , haig added , telling me that during the week , when he is not in sagaponack he still lives in the upper west side apartment into which he was born , that even after their parents left home he and suzie maintained the apartment for years , neither one of them ever going away to college
rye , ny , sept 30 mike richter had all but signed his new contract and would most likely have been ready to play in saturday night s season opener in new jersey against the devils mark messier had not progressed with his talks and was on the golf course for a second consecutive day and corey hirsch , who already knew where he was going to be on oct 1 , packed his bags and delivered an angry barrage before joining five of his teammates on a trip to the minor leagues at least hirsch and the group headed to binghamton knew they had some games to play the remaining rangers , who sat in the players' lounge this afternoon to watch national hockey league commissioner gary bettman announce that the regular season had been postponed , have no idea when , or even if , they will be playing after what looks to have been the team s final practice for a while , richter said he was just waiting for herb pinder , his agent , and neil smith , the rangers' president , to complete the details of the stanley cup champions' goaltender s new contract pinder was in toronto today and could not be reached for comment as far as i'm concerned , it s in their hands , richter said of the fouryear deal , reported to be worth more than 10 million they will finish it up whenever they finish it up we 're very , very close i'm sure we 'll get it done by the opening of the season no further contract talks were held between the rangers and messier , however , and none are scheduled for the weekend messier s accountant , barry klarberg , said he expects the two sides to resume conversations on monday and to continue negotiating despite the season s postponement hirsch , who said he thought he had nothing left to prove in any setting except the nhl , made a strong bid to make the team during the preseason and did not take his demotion well it did n't matter , said hirsch it was inevitable , even if i had a shutout every game it will be like this until something s done i'm not going to play before richter and healy richter , who has been in training camp despite the lack of a contract , will be backed up by glenn healy it s not that i think i'm too good , but when you 're ready to play , you 're ready to play , hirsch continued they 've told me to be patient , that i will play but it s getting harder and harder to be patient when you see a lot of teams that need goaltending , and this is probably the last team in the league that needs goaltending it had nothing to do with corey s play , said coach colin campbell he played very well but we have one of the best goalies , if not the best , in the league , and we have the best backup by far binghamton was scheduled to begin its american hockey league season tonight and open at home saturday night but hirsch said he will take his time reporting they 're going to give me a couple of days to think about it , he said i need to go there with the right attitude i'm not happy about it , but what can i do \? there s absolutely nothing i can do i either go home or go to the minors i think something should be done sooner or later if i had a dollar every time they told me they were going to trade somebody , i 'd be a rich man while the rest of the rangers gathered to watch the league s news conference , hirsch intermittently walked in and out no matter what they say , it does n't have any effect on me , hirsch said about the nhl lockout the team already told me lockout or no lockout , i 'll be going down healy , richter and nick kypreos were to fly to toronto on saturday to see the rangers' player representative , adam graves , at a union meeting the rangers are scheduled to meet as a team sunday to decide what they will do until oct 15 campbell said that he believed the team s practice facilities here would be available , although he doubted there will be any formal practices and for once , he saw something positive in the league s announcement i'm going to be selfish here , campbell said i'm speaking as coach of the new york rangers we have the opportunity now to sit for two weeks and have our eight or nine guys who are injured mend there is a silver lining in that slap shots along with goalie corey hirsch , also sent to binghamton on friday were left wing darren langdon and defensemen barry richter , peter fiorentino , mattias norstrom and michael stewart photo the rangers skating off the ice yesterday at rye playland after what could be their final team practice until the nhl labor dispute is settled \( alan zale for the new york times \)
in that classic memory play about amanda , a faded dixie beauty and mother , there s a delicious moment when amanda almost loses her temper the scene is her rundown little flat in st louis the exhausted mother watches her beloved child limp like quasimodo to the ancient davenport and collapse oh , amanda sighs , if only i had connections in the mafia , i 'd have someone come and break both your legs her child gently demurs do n't try to make me laugh , mama you know i have asthma amanda is at her wit s end your asthma , your leg , your eczema you 're just a mess , lawrence we are in tennessee williams country , but not in the glass menagerie rather , it s the glass menagerie as reimagined by the playwright christopher durang after , i assume , being grossed out by three or four too many secondrate menageries now retitled for whom the southern belle tolls , this menagerie has not only been cut to less than 30 minutes , it has also changed the fey , fragile laura to a fey , fragile fellow named lawrence , and the gentleman caller to a feminine caller named ginny , a strapping young woman whose heart belongs to the offstage betty the exuberantly disrespectful for whom the southern belle tolls is only one of six pieces , collectively titled durang durang , now being performed on stage ii of the manhattan theater club with the help of mr durang , the fine art of parody has returned to the new york theater in a production you can sink teeth and mind into , while also laughing like an idiot for at least half the time life briefly looks less gray it says something about the flabby state of our popular culture that firstrate parodies have become only slightly less rare than verse dramas there was a time when television s saturday night live could be counted on for the occasional nastily informed sketch among others , i remember the sendup of persontoperson shows in which an affably unobservant interviewer , chatting with elizabeth taylor on a television monitor behind him , remained oblivious to the fact that the star was choking to death on a chicken leg saturday night live has gone soft sid caesar , imogene coca and carol burnett have either retired or remain inactive as parodists mel brooks s winning streak seems to be on hold parody in the theater has all but disappeared , along with the revue , of which the sendup sketch was a staple what happened \? you might well think that because our world is already so nakedly foolish and grotesque , there s nothing left to parody , or that because we 're all so terminally posthip , nobody cares about anything it s a sad situation in the same way that parody dismembers and ridicules the thing being parodied , it acknowledges that there are things \( i almost said values \) worth defending through the upsidedown equations of parody great parodists need great or very large targets , and great or very large targets require parodists of rare sensibility combined with humor , which is even more rare max beerbohm , the granddaddy of modern parody , took as his victims henry james , h g wells and rudyard kipling james thurber , e b white , s j perelman and wolcott gibbs , all of the new yorker magazine , had a field day sending up postworld war i america if you want to get their measure , look up gibbs s collection more in sorrow , and read his profile of henry luce and the luce publishing empire , written in an exquisite simulation of timestyle s backwardreeling sentences of the mid1930 s the last line of gibbs s take on the luce dream where it all will end , knows god ! woody allen has done his best to keep the form alive with his prose pieces , but it ca n't be a coincidence that his funniest , most freewheeling parodies have all been inspired by comparatively classic subjects from without feathers , there are lovborg s women considered , in which mr allen solemnly sends up the kind of ibsen study beloved in academe , and if the impressionists had been dentists in this , a series of letters written to theo by his needy brother , vincent reports on his own adventures \( yes , it s true the ear on sale at fleishman brothers novelty shop is mine \) and those of his colleagues seurat , who is quite moody , has developed a method of cleaning one tooth at a time until he builds up what he calls 'a full , fresh mouth' it has an architectural solidity to it , but is it dental work \? i have no idea why good parody , including mr durang s , can be so insidiously satisfying in part , i suppose , it appeals to a primal need to burlesque established icons , and an urge to deflate reputations , thereby to force reexaminations of what have become given , if often dusty , truths yet the successful parody can also delight someone whose knowledge of the thing being parodied is not all that great i think of my own amusement with david ives s philip glass buys a loaf of bread , a musical sketch in all in the timing good parody can not only coopt its subject , but it can also delight all except the most fanatical admirers of the target
in any year , the process of shaping new york city s budget can prompt disagreements but this year , with a new republican mayor bent on deep cuts in spending and jobs , even the tiniest procedural details can provoke political confrontations mayor rudolph w giuliani and borough president ruth w messinger of manhattan exchanged pointed accusations yesterday after mr giuliani declined to send representatives of the city s agencies to a hearing on the mayor s preliminary budget plan at the borough president s office ms messinger said the mayor s refusal violated the usual budget process outlined in the city charter she accused him of ignoring promises to give more influence to the city s five borough presidents and of jeopardizing whatever consensus he hoped to build for the budget to be presented in april 'following the law' i am following the law and i am exercising my obligations to the people i represent , ms messinger said yesterday during a break in her daylong public hearing on the budget plan at her office in the municipal building i expect that the administration would do the same at a news conference and in an interview later , mr giuliani dismissed the borough president s criticism as silly and he accused her of selectively quoting the paragraphlong section of the charter that requires borough presidents to hold hearings on a mayor s budget plan it may be the advantage of being a lawyer , mr giuliani , a former federal prosecutor , said you tend to read the whole paragraph , instead of just half of it potential for conflict the exchange underscored the potential for conflict that mr giuliani can expect in the budget process from at least some of the city s democratic elected officials , particularly ms messinger , who has made no secret of her intention to run for mayor in a letter on jan 24 , ms messinger invited the commissioners of each of the city s agencies , or their aides , to attend the annual budget hearing , during which residents or advocates of particular issues can address or question members of the borough board , which includes the borough president and local members of the city council and community boards last friday , however , her office learned that none would attend , prompting her to protest in a letter to the mayor , which noted that the charter required officials of city agencies to attend hearings when asked on monday , in a memorandum made available by ms messinger s office , the mayor s chief of staff , randy m mastro , told the commissioners to attend the hearings but later monday mr mastro reversed that order in a brief note to ms messinger in an interview , mr giuliani said ms messinger s request was not reasonable , given that he presented his plan only last week and that other borough presidents had not made the same demand on his administration he added that the administration would hold a hearing with all of the borough presidents in march , as became the practice under the dinkins administration that meeting , ms messinger responded , was not related to the borough board s mandated hearing on the budget the other borough presidents said yesterday that they generally did not invite agency officials to testify at their hearings on preliminary budget plans but spokesmen for the borough presidents of queens and the bronx said such requests were an option that remained open to them the provision of the charter in dispute , section 241 , requires each borough board to hold a public hearing about its budget priorities upon adequate public notice and to submit a response to the mayor it concludes , officers of agencies , when requested by the borough board , shall appear and be heard saying he had studied the section at some length , mr giuliani contended that the provision about the officials' appearances at hearings was not intended to apply at any time , any place and any manner the whole thing , he added , is silly photo ruth w messinger , borough president of manhattan , holding a public hearing yesterday on the budget plan \( ruby washington the new york times \)
the residents of woodside have long used the brooklynqueens expressway as their eastern boundary , a definitive break between their middleclass , predominantly white neighborhood and jackson heights , one of the most ethnically diverse , immigrantrich neighborhoods in new york city but five years ago , jackson heights and its problems overcrowding , drugs , noisy social clubs and prostitution began growing to the west now , woodside s eastern half , especially along roosevelt avenue , is indistinguishable from jackson heights and , caught between an old queens increasingly fearful of the new , residents in woodside are grasping at a different boundary i used to think that the bqe was the dividing line , said john gillooly , who said he fled from jackson heights to woodside four years ago now i hope the long island rail road is although several communities are feeling the tensions from the demographic changes in queens in the last decade , none are perhaps more symbolic than woodside , which buffers the largely white neighborhoods of sunnyside , maspeth and long island city against the immigrant populations of jackson heights , corona and elmhurst and while longtime residents are reluctant to mention race , pointing instead to crime as the object of their fear , a 20 percent decline in woodside s white population between 1980 and 1990 suggests that it has something to do with that fear mr gillooly , who left jackson heights after 12 years because he said he could not let his two children play outside , was one of many residents who began rallying in october after the four provinces club on 58th street was held up three men invaded a meeting at the irish club , brandished guns , fired once and made members lie on the floor before robbing them the community s pressure for more police protection led last week to a meeting with police commissioner william j bratton , who toured the area for 30 minutes and then talked with residents for an hour at a parish center so far this year , unlike the rest of the city , reported rapes and homicides are up sharply in the 108th precinct mr bratton blamed some problems on drug activities in some social clubs in eastern woodside but mr bratton also pointed out reported crimes have declined steadily here in recent years mr bratton called woodside a neighborhood in transition , and said , we do n't want to lose woodside we do n't want to lose queens some , like mr gillooly , believe that the eastern half of woodside has already been lost john caffrey , who bought a coop near 64th street a decade ago , has seen many of his neighbors , mostly irish , german and italian , move away a lot of them have gone to maspeth because it s clean and quiet , said mr caffrey , 63 , a member of the woodside community council , a civic association ed coyne , 66 , is president of the woodside community council , and lives on 53d street in a house that was bought by his wife s grandparents his section of woodside , he said , had not seen the drugs and crime of the east end yet on a tour of his area , he pointed to detached and row houses with small , wellkept lawns we 're fighting for this , he said i raised six children here i do n't want to give it up we must draw a line in the sand , he added it s a shame we have to be that parochial , but it s a fact of life norimitsu onishi photo on roosevelt avenue , the new queens is more obvious than the old \( chester higgins jr the new york times \) map of woodside

if nora johnson s generation is responsible for giving mine a voice , it now seems to be angry that we have something to say the philosophical simplicity of abortion in the 1950 s might find an excuse in the absence of technology or the presence of a society reluctant to focus on the act only on its social implications but this is the 1990 s we have the technology to enable pregnant women to see life as it develops in the womb abortion may be uncomfortable , risky and inconvenient ca n't it also be complex \? the only simple aspect of abortion is the fact that where there was once a life , there is none alice regan ruvane new york , ny
washington , june 30 the supreme court today upheld the core of a florida state court injunction intended to keep disruptive protesters from blocking access to an abortion clinic the 6to3 ruling , written by chief justice william h rehnquist , was greeted with relief by abortion rights groups and with sharp disappointment by abortion opponents balancing the right of patients and employees to unimpeded access to the abortion clinic against the protesters' right to free speech , the court upheld a buffer zone of about 36 feet around the clinic in melbourne , fla , that kept protesters away from the entrance and parking lot and off a public rightofway chief justice rehnquist said the buffer zone burdens no more speech than necessary to accomplish the governmental interest at stake under the same analysis , the court also upheld a ban on excessive noise during the clinic s operating hours , finding the restrictions justified by the need to insure the health and wellbeing of the patients at the clinic excerpts , page a16 but the ruling struck down , as too broad and inadequately justified by the facts of the case , a 300foot buffer zone within which protesters could not make uninvited approaches to patients and employees , as well as a buffer of the same size around the houses of the clinic s doctors and staff members however , the court indicated that a smaller zone or restrictions on the size and duration of demonstrations at the houses would be constitutional justice antonin scalia filed a bitter dissenting opinion today that lent particular drama to the scene in the courtroom on the final day of the court s 199394 term with constitutional challenges filed to a new federal law intended to halt disruptions to the operations of abortion clinics , and inevitably headed for the supreme court , the florida case was closely watched for signs of how the justices will respond the florida injunction , issued in 1993 to protect the aware woman center for choice , was one of dozens of similar injunctions issued by state and local judges around the country as abortion clinic operators turned to the courts for help with protracted and at times violent protests the injunction had been subject to two court challenges , with the florida supreme court upholding it and the united states court of appeals for the 11th circuit , in atlanta , striking it down within weeks of one another last fall the supreme court took the case in january to resolve the conflict since then , the case has become the focus of even closer attention as congress passed and president clinton signed into law the freedom of access to clinic entrances act , intended to provide federal remedies , including injunctions and criminal penalties , for violent protests at abortion clinics while there are significant differences between the florida injunction and the new federal law , the tone of the court s opinion today indicated that any broad constitutional attack on the new law is likely to fail particularly significant , in the view of abortionrights lawyers who scrutinized the opinion today , was chief justice rehnquist s discussion of florida s interests in insuring the wellbeing of patients as well as public safety and order , goals the chief justice said were quite sufficient to justify an appropriate injunction 'vindication' for congress representative charles e schumer , a brooklyn democrat who was the principal sponsor of the new law , said the decision today was a complete vindication of congress s approach justice scalia s opinion was signed by justices clarence thomas and anthony m kennedy the three accused the majority of sacrificing important first amendment interests to suppress normal and peaceful social protest the first amendment is in grave peril , justice scalia said the dispute between the chief justice and justice scalia was particularly striking because the two are normally allies and both are opponents of the court s precedents upholding the constitutional right to abortion first , the chief justice read a summary of his majority opinion , speaking for several minutes in his customary matteroffact tone then justice scalia began an angry rendition of his dissenting opinion , at one point referring to abortion mills , a phrase that did not appear in his printed opinion scalia cites 1944 case both from the bench and in his written opinion , he drew an analogy between the ruling today and the court s notorious and discredited 1944 decision that upheld the wartime internment of japaneseamericans what was true of a misguided military order is true of a misguided trialcourt injunction , justice scalia said glancing at the reporters crowded into the courtroom s press section , justice scalia said he was sure the decision would be reported as an abortion case but that it would go down in the lawbooks as a free speech injunction case and the damage its novel principles produce will be considerable justice scalia said the decision was novel primarily because the demonstrators from the antiabortion group operation rescue and several related organizations who were made subject to the injunction had not previously been shown to have violated any law
if major league baseball is prepared to fade from 1994 without a world series , maybe it s ready for another new and unusual development a new rival league the baseball establishment has n't had one since the federal league lived briefly 80 years ago given the monthlong strike that is on the verge of wiping out the rest of the baseball year and the prospect of a continued shutdown into next season , talk has stirred about the resuscitation of a plan that was looked at but did n't remain viable five years ago a replacement league could be on the horizon i 've had many inquiries , and i'm convinced there are many wellestablished , capable people out there who would love to be involved in the baseball industry , said richard moss , who as general counsel of the players union for its first 10 years successfully took on the owner establishment in landmark cases it s not a unique idea , he added other people have talked about it i do n't know if anyone else is working on it i think the players could be ready to play next april that s all it takes when donald fehr , head of the players union , was asked about a new league , he said we 'll have to look at any and all options i have n't looked at anything yet from delay to cancellation moss was a founder of the baseball league , a venture that became a victim of circumstances in 1989 after a promising planning phase moss and his partner , david lefevre , a new york lawyer , who also had connections to major league baseball , had lined up owners for eight teams and initially planned to begin play in 1990 but delayed the debut until 1991 , then canceled their plans altogether collusion was over and players were being signed to longterm contracts , moss said , explaining the problems the baseball league encountered the economy went into serious decline , and real estate people were losing a lot of the people in our venture were real estate people there also was the donald factor donald trump was going to be one of the eight owners i have agreed to become a part of it , trump said in august 1989 , to work with them and make this league a great success meshulam riklis , a friend of trump and husband of pia zadora , was also set to own a team but when the owners met in new york to plan the announcement of the creation of the league , trump and riklis did not show up shortly after the meeting began , their aides arrived and announced to the other owners and the founders that trump and riklis did n't think the league was ready to proceed to the next step momentum is lost their vacillation turned a stick of dynamite into a watersoaked firecracker the league lost its momentum and never recovered but now moss sees another window of opportunity approaching , like a locomotive at full speed to pick up speed , though , the train needs passengers in the form of players where would they come from \? to a large extent from the existing major leagues , moss suggested he classified major league players by their contract status those eligible for free agency or are released , not tendered contracts or not offered salary arbitration as onetime free agents with repeater restrictions they 're clearly free , moss said , estimating that 250 players would fit into that category those signed to multiyear contracts moss said their availability would have to be determined through litigation it will come down to how the owners' action is perceived , moss said if they deliberately tried to create this situation and have not negotiated in good faith , there s a possibility you could get players out of those contracts those with less than six years of major league service and not eligible for free agency they would have to be litigated , moss said , but the only thing holding them is the reserve system my view is the reserve system is an internal system , holding them to a club so they ca n't go to another in the system it has nothing to do with another system if those players were added to a prospective player list , moss said , about 550 would be free to move 50 percent equity besides maybe having the only game in town , moss s new league may offer players another inducement 50 percent equity , a 50 percent share of the profits and a 50 percent share in the decisionmaking process if you ask players how they feel about a new system , a new league , said moss , who also serves as an agent for players , if my sampling is representative , you 'll find 98 percent enthusiasm but a new league would n't be interested only in major league players , moss added we 're not above considering some of the people presently involved in major league baseball , he said , meaning owners i can see a significant and profitable role ted turner could play , for example he did n't mention donald trump do n't defend cap , miller says marvin miller , the first leader of the baseball players union , has long been a critic of the players union in the national football league he never was impressed with the leadership of ed garvey in the 1970 s , and he does n't think much of the job gene upshaw did in taking his members under a salary cap he also does n't go for upshaw s spirited defense of the cap
garden city , li , aug 16 during the 1980 s , increasing numbers of blacks attained that most potent symbol of the american dream a home in the suburbs but in many suburban areas , an analysis of census data suggests , black homeowners are paying higher property taxes than whites on homes of similar value the analysis , done by prof andrew a beveridge of queens college , looked at 30 cities and 31 suburbs and found that black homeowners are taxed more than whites on comparable homes in 58 percent of the suburban regions and 30 percent of the cities in the new york region , the disparity was common on long island and in new jersey it was also prevalent in the suburbs of chicago , san francisco , los angeles and eight other cities the disparities range from property tax bills that were 47 percent higher , or 412 a year more , for blacks in the philadelphia suburbs to 33 percent , or 38 more , in the dallasfort worth suburbs sociologists , politicians and tax experts said they did not think that the disparities stemmed from deliberate racism by the taxing jurisdictions or tax assessors rather , they said , the differences probably resulted from several related trends one is the flight of businesses from some suburbs as black homeowners move in and whites leave , saddling newcomers and those who stay behind , including whites , with a heavier tax burden another is pressure on governments by wealthier , longterm homeowners not to reassess properties in a timely fashion , leaving a higher tax burden for newer homeowners , a group that tends to includes blacks dr beveridge s findings were based on the responses of blacks and whites who were asked by the census for the market value of their homes and the property taxes they paid in 1990 because the analysis depends on homeowners' subjective estimates of their homes' value , it may be less reliable than more conventional studies of tax inequities that rely on data from actual home sales but the findings are consistent with those of other researchers who have used sales data to look at selected communities , and the census data provides a broader picture , allowing comparisons between regions across the country dr beveridge s analysis , conducted for the new york times , was inconclusive when looking at property taxes in major cities it found that while blacks paid higher taxes on comparable homes in nine cities , whites paid higher taxes in seven in new york , blacks paid taxes at a rate 66 percent higher than for whites in manhattan and 107 percent higher in brooklyn , but when taxes on homes in the three other boroughs were included , the differences citywide were no longer statistically significant in 13 other cities , as well , no significant differences appeared but a pattern of inequity emerged in the suburbs in 18 of 31 suburbs , blacks were taxed significantly more than whites for comparable homes in a dozen suburbs there was no statistically significant difference , and only in suburban miami did whites pay significantly more dr beveridge said that since the study did not break out data on hispanic homeowners , who can identify themselves as white or black on the census , the results in the miami suburbs might be skewed by the recent migration of hispanic people there adding to hardships in move to suburbs after reviewing the study s , findings , billy j tidwell , the national urban league s director of research , said the tax disparities compounded hardships he has documented as blacks move to the suburbs they include difficulties obtaining mortgages and racial steering away from white neighborhoods we are talking about fundamental breadandbutter racial issues , he said it appears we have a long way to go , perhaps longer than we had recognized dr beveridge , the director of the program for applied social research at queens college , said the data sharpened an emerging picture of the obstacles many blacks face as they join the middle class it means that if one of the routes in the usa to middleclass status has been to move to the suburbs and live a comfortable suburban life style , trying to achieve that is going to cost more for blacks , he said in the 1980 s , according to the census , the number of blacks living in the suburbs rose to 1 in 3 , from 1 in 4 for much of the decade , housing values skyrocketed as voters were swept up in a populist , antitax wave on the realestate front , that mood translated into pressure against frequent reassessments to reflect increasing values voters reasoned that while the values of their homes may have been rising , their incomes were not as a result , a number of jurisdictions though none in new york state now raise propertytax assessments only on a house s sale the practice , sometimes nicknamed welcome , stranger , and illustrated most pointedly in proposition 13 , the 1978 grassroots antitax measure in california , rewards longterm residents with lower tax bills , and places a greater tax burden on newcomers of all races in central cities or the rings around them , whiteoccupied housing has increased in value more than housing in areas of black concentration , and the assessed valuations have failed to keep pace , said george e peterson , a specialist in taxation and government finance at the urban institute in washington as a result , the ratio of taxes to property value tends to be higher in black neighborhoods , and in poorer neighborhoods in general political pressure not to reassess
an 11monthold boy with a mysterious case of aids was most likely infected with hiv in a new york city hospital when he was less than 2 weeks old , new york city and federal health officials reported yesterday the case is baffling because the officials cannot precisely determine the source of the boy s infection his parents have both tested negative for hiv , the virus that causes aids , and he never received blood products , the officials said they refused to identify the infant or say where or when he was hospitalized , citing state confidentiality laws and the standard publichealth practice of withholding the names of institutions that cooperate in investigating hospitalacquired infections city health officials said that the boy was still living , but refused to comment on his condition if documented , the case would be one of the rare times hiv was transmitted in a healthcare setting 'no overt breaches' dr susan blank of the new york city health department said in an interview that no overt breaches in standard infection control had been found at the hospital , where health workers have been trained in standard infectioncontrol measures dr blank , the senior author of a published report of the case , added , there was nothing we could point a finger at but because the boy s illness might have resulted from a breakdown in infection control at the hospital , health officials said they were reporting the case to underscore the need to adhere to standard procedures to prevent the spread of hiv and other bloodborne microbes beginning this year , the new york state health department has required all physicians , dentists , nurses and other healthcare workers to take an infectioncontrol course as a condition of renewing their professional licenses in reporting the boy s case in the lancet , a british medical journal , the health officials said they would probably never be certain how the boy became infected with hiv because there were a number of unavoidable gaps in their investigation of the case seeking more information dr blank said her team also was reporting the case in the hope that it might result in additional information in the investigation the boy was born and spent the first two days of his life in the hospital he was circumcised either at the hospital or elsewhere at age 11 days , he was admitted to a hospital in new york city for a bacterial eye infection due to chlamydia trachomatis , which he apparently acquired in the birth canal he remained in the hospital for a week health officials declined to say whether the boy s birth and his subsequent admission for the eye infection occurred at the same hospital at 3 months , the baby developed recurrent oral thrush , a fungal infection at 5 months , he stopped gaining weight at 8 months , he had difficulty breathing and was admitted to a hospital again doctors diagnosed pneumocystis carinii , a penumonia that is a common complication of aids tests confirmed that he had aids neither parent showed evidence of infection with hiv in blood tests , and additional tests to detect what are known as hla antigens showed with 999 percent certainty that the couple were the parents of the infected boy , officials said the boy lived with his parents , and the only other people who cared for him were three of his grandparents tests of two grandparents showed they were not infected with hiv the third refused an hiv test from the health department , but was reported as being free of hiv in a test for an insurance policy the boy never received blood products in the hospital , he underwent 99 procedures that involved the use of needles or contact with mucous membranes seventy procedures involved applying medication or solutions to the eyes the remaining procedures included obtaining blood specimens , putting a tube in the bladder , putting a needle in the spine for a lumbar puncture , and inserting an intravenous tube the circumciser , who tested negative for hiv , cleaned his instruments after each use , in accordance with standard medical procedure the obstetrician and all 26 other health care workers who cared for the boy during his first two days of life had been trained in infection control eleven were interviewed a year later , and none recalled any breaches in infection control none agreed to be tested for hiv of 15 other children on the same hospital ward , two had aids one is alive and his strain of hiv differs significantly from the boy s the other child died and no virus sample was available for comparison , making it impossible to determine whether the child was the source of the boy s infection documented patienttopatient transmission of hiv is rare , said dr mary e chamberland , an aids expert at the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta , which joined the new york city health department in investigating the boy s case the most recent report came last year from australia , where four patients who underwent minor procedures in a surgeon s office became infected with the virus a specific lapse could not be identified

as a trophy and a higher personal rating within the sport there will be no winners' and losers' purses , no sponsor stipends , no network payoffs , no merchandising receipts , no proceeds from the gate the fourman team he calls aspen , together since march in preparation for this particular event , will disband on sunday , win or lose the polo superstars whom matthews signed for a few hundred thousand dollars apiece , memo and carlos gracida , will become unrestricted free agents they will be free to play for another owner for the next circuit event , or season , whichever is the better deal matthews will enter his next tournament , return to the bidding wars for the top professionals he will not tell them they must accept a salary cap he will not lock them out if they refuse his terms he is a rich man , but polo is his pastime , his passion it is not business and has nothing to do with municipal tax breaks or antitrust by definition , that makes matthews a sportsman , which is what george steinbrenner fancies himself while growling at his ballplayers between bites of his hot dog from the yankee stadium owner s box one more thing doug matthews is also a player it s as if steinbrenner said , 'we 're playing chicago tomorrow , and i'm playing third base , ' he said on friday another way to explain highgoal or worldclass polo is to envision a basketball league in which one of the five players on every team had to be an owner , not a hired professional say the 39yearold madison square garden president , dave checketts , organized a franchise he could start himself at shooting guard , buy the best available talent but if he were a joke of a player , he would become a laughingstock trying to drive the lane against patrick ewing this is not like a celebrity proam

butt in a saddle matthews is a 49yearold annapolis graduate and former navy pilot his business is aircraft buying and financing he said highgoal polo owners or patrons \( pronounced patrons \) , as they are called are , on average , men of comparable means to the baseball steinbrenners some , like the australian kerry packer , are much , much richer most of them spend millions a year to finance their teams the average threeweek tournament , matthews said , requires about a quartermillion in expenses such as player contracts and transportation and care for horses the united states open , culminating with sunday s championship match between aspen and the white birch team of peter brant from greenwich , conn , has lasted six weeks at the meadowbrook club once upon a time , matthews tried to buy pro basketball s atlanta hawks from ted turner five years ago , about the time he became infected by the polo bug , he took a look at the financial records of the new jersey nets with the benefit of perfect hindsight , he is thrilled to be paying the likes of the gracida brothers , out of mexico city , as opposed to investing for the privilege of renegotiating derrick coleman s contract in their own right , the elite polo pros , most of whom are from the horse culture in argentina and train their own horses , make a nice living polo players , amateur or pro , are rated on a scale of 0 to 10 goals a 10goal player , matthews said , can earn about 15 million a year out of approximately 150 highgoal pros , there are a dozen 10goalers both memo and carlos gracida , whose combined resume includes 18 united states open titles , are 10goal players in college , matthews set pistolry records that still stand he played some basketball after four years on the polo tour , his rating is still zero goals , as compared with peter brant , a 17year veteran whose rating is six that makes matthews s signing of the gracido brothers to go with a third player , the sixgoaler tiger kneece of aiken , sc , a major coup in this , his first united states open there is some reservation when a new sponsor approaches you and says he intends to play highgoal polo , said memo gracida but doug s approach was very serious he convinced us he was ready to work we 've been at this since last march riding , training the horses , watching films there are greater considerations for the pros , he said , than the size of their contract no 10goal player in a sport in which reputation rules wants to get stuck with an egotripping loser athletically speaking , carlos gracida compared highgoal polo professionals to pete sampras and michael jordan none want to risk their careers with a bumbling patron who might get them hurt matthews , in fact , had a fall at the beginning of the open we had to slow him down , said memo gracida things have worked out the aspen team won all eight of its matches to reach the final they are looking for new challenges , carlos gracida said , when asked why highgoal polo s patrons are out there with them to which doug matthews added you 're out there on a finely trained horse , going 35 miles an hour , making stops and turns , no seat belt , trying to knock into the other guy without injuring the horse or yourself then a hard ball leaves that mallet at a hundred miles an hour people have no idea how much goes into it , how much you really have to feel that horse what s the reward \? said matthews , repeating the question there is no reward , other than the competition , the pure exhilaration of being out there this is , in my opinion , the purest of pro sports photos the mallets swing during wednesday s polo match at bethpage state park , site of today s us open final polo players scramble near the scoreboard at bethpage after the open ends , the players become free agents doug matthews , who calls polo the purest of the pro sports , has signed two superstars for his team , aspen , which is playing in the us open \( photographs by

hi , thank s for coming out on such a terrible night , gabriel aiello was saying as he stood by the door of his restaurant last week it was one of those icy evenings , and mr aiello kept saying , we 're glad you 're here ! as people staggered in out of the cold long before they had reached their tables he had managed to make every customer feel welcome , drawn them into his restaurant , given them a sense that he cared about their comfort it did not end at the door all over the restaurant people would look up from their menus to find mr aiello at their elbow can i help you \? he kept asking need some suggestions \? he was everywhere , bringing wine to this table , chatting with that one is this why i think of gabriel s every time i want to eat near lincoln center \? well , there is also the food what is served at gabriel s has been called tuscan it is not it is far too american for that , too original what tuscan restaurant ever made tuna into a sausage , grilled it over a wood fire and then served it with a pile of peppers glistening with olive oil \? the fat little link , which looks like an ordinary sausage , has borrowed so much flavor from the wood fire that if you did n't know it was made of fish you would struggle to define it spicy mussel soup is not tuscan , either but it is a wonderfully warming soup , a great bowl filled with plump little mussels in a fabulously fragrant broth look around the restaurant and the dish you see on almost every table is buckwheat polenta buckwheat , the grain that is used for both kasha and soba , is extraordinarily nutritious but can be heavy the chef , ralph perrotti , has lightened it with cornmeal , melted robiola cheese on top and a sprinkle of truffle oil the result is an earthy and seductive bowl of food , perfect for a snowy night mr perrotti has a restless culinary imagination he never plays it safe i have not loved all of his experiments , but i have certainly admired the spirit in which they were created goat cheese cannoli who could resist that description \? and that is pretty much what arrives at the table , a crisp snail of pastry filled with a goat cheese mixture and surrounded by a coulis made of fresh tomatoes the dish may not be wholly successful everything is a little too forceful but each bite is an interesting exercise in flavor and texture the salads here are also inventive but they work , from plain mixed lettuces dressed with sherry vinegar to green beans tossed with walnuts and romano cheese my favorite is shaved fennel with blood oranges and parmesan , a little ballet of contrasting tastes none of the pastas are ordinary pappardelle tossed with a sauce made of rabbit , chanterelles and prunes is an explosion of flavor , the earthy richness of the mushrooms played against the strong sweetness of the prunes halfmoons of pasta come filled with a mixture of spinach , pine nuts and aged ricotta but the real winner here is homemade gnocchi , little dumplings so light they float into your mouth and down your throat before you even have time to chew is there too much rosemary in the sauce \? perhaps , but generosity tends to be the norm at gabriel s entrees are also served with a liberal hand roast kid is a big , tasty hunk of meat an enormous mustardtopped veal chop comes wrapped in the sweetsour aroma of balsamic vinegar a shank of lamb is another hefty portion , so well cooked that the meat drops from the bone at the touch of a fork , landing in a heap of tiny white beans that are studded with cheese and flecks of parsley then there is the baby chicken , which has been soaked in buttermilk , dusted with rosemary , flattened and cooked on the grill this small golden bird arrives with more flavor than any chicken has a right to the buttery , slightly lumpy mashed potatoes are a dividend when i think of gabriel s , the dish i most long for is the sea bass cooked in a terra cotta casserole the fillets of fish are layered with artichoke hearts , sliced potatoes and fresh thyme , and the flavor is so unfamiliar that it haunts you why does it taste like vanilla \? you find yourself eating one forkful and then another , trying to separate the individual flavors , knowing that even if you order this dish again it might never taste the same desserts , with the exception of the wonderful sorbets and gelatos , are less exciting both the hazelnut torte and the chocolate almond torte tend to be dry , and the poached pear is a little too hard roasted pumpkin and mascarpone napoleon is a nice rustic idea that does n't quite come together but the ice creams , especially the hazelnut , and the sorbets , particularly the blood orange , are superb have them topped with warm fudge , caramel or chocolatehazelnut sauce and you end up with a sundae for grownups that is an entirely satisfying way to end a meal the service here is lovely , but the wine service is especially impressive the list of italian and a few american wines is unusual , interesting and intelligently arranged , and the staff can talk knowledgeably about each one night our waiter even talked us out of ordering the 1988 chianti from rocca di castagnoli , suggesting that the less expensive barbera from giacosa would be better with the food we had ordered much as i like the list , i think it could use more fullbodied wines at affordable prices food with this much flavor can stand up to powerful wines , and it is a shame that there is nothing powerful on the list for less than 30 in spite of that , when people ask me where i 'd like to eat , i find myself thinking about gabriel s it s not just that the service is so charming and that the food so appealing but also that in a city filled with impersonal restaurants conceived by corporations and controlled by accounting departments , gabriel s feels as if it is run by real people gabriel s bar and restaurant  11 west 60th street , manhattan , \( 212 \) 9564600 atmosphere the clubby , comfortable oldfashioned room is dominated by a bar in front and filled with an eclectic mix of people very busy before 8 pm , the room calms down later in the evening service professional and very caring recommended dishes buckwheat polenta with robiola cheese , grilled tuna sausage , grilled mushrooms , spicy mussel soup , homemade gnocchi , pappardelle with rabbit and prunes , grilled baby chicken , sea bass with artichokes and potatoes , gelato , sorbet price range lunch appetizers 6 to 650 , pastas 12 to 21 , main courses 12 to 16 dinner appetizers 6 to 10 , pastas 14 to 18 , main courses 20 to 26 wine list the mostly italian list is quirky , personal and carefully chosen hours lunch noon to 3 pm mondays through saturdays dinner 5 30 to 11 pm mondays through thursdays , until midnight fridays and saturdays closed sundays credit cards all major cards wheelchair accessibility everything on one level what the stars mean \( none \) poor to satisfactory good very good excellent extraordinary ratings reflect the reviewer s reaction primarily to food , with ambiance and service taken into consideration menu listings and prices are subject to change
the boards of federated department stores inc and r h macy company gave their formal approval yesterday to a merger between the two department store operators but the two companies did not make any announcement because their lawyers were still hammering out differences over the interpretation of technical details before executives sign the agreement none of the differences are expected to derail the merger , however , representatives for the companies said yesterday the merger will pave the way for macy to emerge from bankruptcy protection later this year under federated s umbrella , which also embraces bloomingdale s , abraham straus , rich s and several other regional department store chains the approval by the boards was mostly a formality the companies will file a disclosure statement later this month that will offer at least a glimpse of how the combined company will look , perhaps including which stores will be closed or sold and how many jobs will be eliminated macy is expected to dismiss about a third of the 300 administrative employees at its manhattan corporate headquarters later this week the combined company will spend about 32 million on severance packages and performance bonuses talk of another bid there was speculation yesterday that another suitor for macy might arrive on the scene dan dorfman , a columnist for usa today , wrote that he would not be surprised to see the may department stores company up the ante for macy with an offer worth between 42 billion and 43 billion the macyfederated merger is valued at about 41 billion , and many people involved in macy s bankruptcy believe federated is overpaying a spokeswoman for may declined to comment on the report many analysts believe may would be more interested in acquiring the mercantile stores company , a 273 billion department store company operating mcalpin s , gayfers , maison blanche and 10 other regional chains in the midwest and south still , may is one of a handful of retail companies that could muster the financing needed to buy macy mercantile specifically addressed rumors about discussions with may at its annual shareholders meeting three months ago , when it said it was not for sale and not in negotiations about a sale but strong rumors that it was in negotiations with may arose again last week when mercantile s stock jumped about 13 percent on heavy trading volume i think there is a definite possibility that may is looking at mercantile , walter f loeb , a retail analyst and consultant , said many analysts believe may would be interested in macy s stores in the southeast , which dillard department stores inc also wants court decision favors federated separately , the federal district court in manhattan ruled last week that federated had the right to deduct breakup fees it paid to the edward j debartolo corporation , a large mall development company , and macy in the 1980 s in 1986 , when a canadian real estate company , the campeau corporation , bid for the allied stores corporation , debartolo stepped in with a counteroffer that allied ultimately turned down in favor of an improved offer from campeau two years later , federated turned down an acquisition with macy in favor of a bid from campeau federated , which represented the combined federated and allied , later deducted 177 million in fees it had paid debartolo and macy for breaking the deals it had struck with them the internal revenue service challenged that deduction , but the court ruled on friday that it was proper robert willens , a tax expert at lehman brothers , estimated that the ruling saved federated between 90 million and 100 million in taxes and accrued interest
it was almost 13 years ago when it became clear that labor unions had lost much of their clout president ronald reagan broke the air traffic controllers' strike , and left the strikers unemployed in retrospect , that action seems to have set the tone for an era in which the power of workers to get more , as samuel gompers is said to have put it when asked what organized labor wanted , had ended it was a time when the fear of inflation had grown to the extent that the public wanted something done , not just in the united states but around the world in britain , margaret thatcher was breaking the power of unions and in france a supposedly socialist government was imposing austerity the fear of inflation then is now only dimly remembered by many prices had begun climbing in the late 1960 s , and inflation kept rising through price controls and through recessions by 1981 , almost everyone expected oil prices to top 100 a barrel within a few years interest rates were high and rising , and a few months after the controllers' strike was broken the government sold an issue of 30year bonds with a yield to maturity of 1578 percent there was disagreement about what government could do to bring inflation under control , but there was consensus that there would not be the political will to do it now , the situation is reversed higher interest rates are being blamed on almost everything except concern about inflation it is widely believed that labor costs cannot rise rapidly because there are too many people willing to do any given job , if not here , then in some other country but a funny thing happened when the nation s unionized trucking companies decided to save money and better compete with nonunion companies by replacing fulltime workers with part timers the teamsters' union struck , and won a partial victory there are similar stories to be told overseas in france , the conservative government decided to allow employers to pay less than the minimum wage to young workers , reasoning that would help to reduce unemployment students figured it just meant they would earn less , and took to the streets the government backed down in this country , the average worker has seen his weekly pay rise by 15 percent , after inflation , in the past year that may not sound like much , but it comes after years of declines that coincided with falling inflation and weak unions change is again in the air none of this alters the fact that jobs can be exported but it may be worth noting that the clinton administration , after establishing its freetrade credentials with nafta , is sounding tough in trade talks with china and japan protectionism , even if cloaked as retaliation for closed markets or righteous anger over human rights abuses , would be another inflationary force all of which may help to explain why longterm interest rates have climbed more than most people expected inflation is not going to accelerate tomorrow , but one trend that helped to depress it has lost power and may be reversing graphs showing the dow industrial average for the past week , average weekly earnings in private nonfarm jobs from 1975 to 1994 and yield on 30yera treasuries from 1974 to 1994
recordbreaking cold imposed an icy disorder on the new york region and along the east coast yesterday , from power shortages to disrupted school days , from frozen railroad track switches to scuttled dinner plans the temperature was 2 degrees below 0 in central park at 6 am , the lowest ever recorded for the date , and rose to 10 degrees later in the day , making it one of the coldest days in the last halfcentury a dozen cities in the midwest and east recorded their lowest temperatures ever , though gradual easing of temperatures is expected today and friday as the arctic cold front that moved in last weekend begins heading north with coal piles frozen and fueloil barges immobilized in iceclogged rivers , power plants ran short of fuel as a result , authorities imposed a series of planned blackouts and other power reductions throughout new jersey and stretching south to virginia cold , cold , cold in snowbound kentucky a state of emergency was in effect for the third day in a row , with all four of the interstate highways crossing the state closed to most vehicles in minnesota , whose hearty residents mock the cold and snow with winter carnivals , about 20 percent of the state s public schools were closed yesterday and chicago recorded its sixth consecutive day of subzero temperatures though by afternoon the temperature had climbed to 7 degrees new york medical emergency authorities said they were receiving hundreds more calls than usual because of people falling on the ice , increased traffic accidents and respiratory emergencies caused by the cold the population of new york s homeless shelters swelled tuesday night to 6 , 650 , about 1 , 000 more than on an average night trains slowed or stopped amtrak canceled half its trains between new york and washington and long delays were reported on the long island rail road and other commuter lines in washington , the federal government sent workers home early yesterday and gave all but essential personnel the day off today in response to the electrical shortage state workers in new jersey were sent home an hour early , and in pennsylvania state workers were also sent home to conserve electricity beyond all the mechanics of life , the cold in new york announced itself on millions of chapped faces it froze fingers and the hudson river , it made the nearly nude models on billboards in times square almost too painful to look at and it made one want to shout to the statue of george m cohan , standing near the theater ticket booth hat in hand put it on ! luxury was being able to order lunch in and the frozen heros of the day were the people making the deliveries on bicycles winter was overstaying its welcome john putnam , a guitarist passing through times square yesterday afternoon wearing both a hat and a hood said i have n't noticed people starting to bug out yet , but it s early we still have two months of this people are getting cabin fever meteorologists attributed the continuous onslaught of snow and frigid air to a high pressure ridge sitting over the west coast rather than pacific winds blowing west across the united states , the ridge is forcing air masses north across the north pole from siberia to canada , and then the frigid air is sweeping down into the midwest and the east the national weather service said yesterday s mean temperature in new york was 4 degrees the coldest day in the last 50 years was jan 21 , 1985 , when the mean temperature was 35 degrees the coldest ever was feb 15 , 1943 , when the mean temperature was zero degrees with a low of 8 degrees below zero any way its measured beyond what the thermometer said , almost everyone had a way of measuring the cold at the kingsbay ymywha in brooklyn , none of the elderly men who regularly show up for their morning swim and steam bath made it yesterday and upstairs at the y , among the regular poker players , sam yablonsky said , this is the first time in 10 years that we did n't have eight people to start out at 8 o'clock alex von bidder , the manager of the four seasons restaurant , said business was down as people canceled lunch and dinner reservations , opting to eat in but he was not wringing his hands it s like everything else in new york , he said people adjust to it adjusting to the cold was particularly difficult for homeless people , some of whom stayed on the street despite attempts by city officials to get them to go to shelters mark robinson , 37 , who had set up camp last night under a sheet of blue plastic on a steam grate near the united nations , said he found it easier to sleep out in the cold than in a crowded shelter it s a challenge , but i'm warm in here , mr robinson said , as he disappeared under his makeshift tent should have stayed home' commuters also faced an array of problems on the long island rail road , 125 of the 144 morning rushhour trains were delayed many for more than an hour and the rest were canceled among other problems , track switches froze and a rail that supplies power failed at the woodside station , forcing suspension of all service between penn station and jamaica , the railroad s main transfer point , for more than an hour it took me an hour and 45 minutes just to get here from deer park , said tony laspina , an advertising executive standing at the jamaica station i should have listened to my wife and stayed home icy roads caused problems throughout the region on interstate 80 in new jersey , traffic was backed up for six miles yesterday morning between denville and rockaway dangerous driving conditions forced some schools to cancel classes for the day and many more began classes late still , life managed to slip and slide along j stephen sheppard , a new york city lawyer , braved the 10minute walk from his apartment this morning to the department of motor vehicles on worth street to renew his driver s license when he arrived , frozen and numb , and found a long line of people waiting on the sidewalk outside the office , he got in a cab and headed for work my cabdriver told me that he has been taking fares two or three blocks this morning nobody wants to walk
los angeles you know what really stinks \? the young navy officer asked me he pushed aside his third scotch and leaned across the table in a chain restaurant near the naval air station in norfolk , va , where the tailhook prosecutions have crept along for more than a year and where he was one of the dozens accused of conduct unbecoming what about all the female officers who were going wild at tailhook \? how come they have n't been prosecuted \? going wild \? you know , wearing sexy clothes , dancing like a bunch of party girls , getting their legs shaved in the suites he lowered his voice some , he continued darkly , even had sex with other officers how come they are n't being prosecuted for that \? this whole thing stinks of a double standard the double standard lament comes up repeatedly with tailhookers how come the female officers got to go wild , and not the guys \? at first look , this seems a ludicrous argument assault , not partying , was the offense that prompted protest from the female officers who attended the annual convention of naval aviators in las vegas in 1991 lieut paula coughlin , a helicopter pilot , blew the whistle on tailhook because a crowd of men formed a gantlet down a hallway and tore at her clothes , grabbed her breasts and seized her buttocks with such force she was hoisted airborne the dozens of other women attacked in the hallway said their fellow officers hurled them to the floor , yanked off their underwear and molested them this was not fun and games many women who fought back only met with fiercer assaults and epithets like whore and bitch perpetuating the confusion between assault and mere bad taste may be the only lasting achievement of the tailhook affair the prosecution stumbled to a close last week with the dismissal of the three final cases that were pending courtmartial and the resignation of lieutenant coughlin in the end , she s the only junior officer who is out of a job sure , the investigation embarrassed the top brass and cut short some careers yesterday , adm frank kelso , the navy s top officer , requested early retirement so the navy could close this difficult chapter last week , a military judge found that , contrary to his denials , admiral kelso had witnessed misconduct at the convention and failed to stop it but the 28 junior officers actually disciplined were censured for these charges only indecent exposure , conduct unbecoming an officer and making false official statements in other words , they were reprimanded for making halfnaked buffoons of themselves and lying about it later none of the 28 and none of the original 43 men who faced administrative action were charged with assaulting or molesting women they got in trouble for such sins as streaking and dropping their pants by focusing on the officers' adolescent antics , the navy not only missed the point it reinforced the same false message that has become increasingly prevalent in recent years advocates of the rights of women are really just prudes , antisex feminism , we hear once again , is just a euphemism for puritanism ironically , the prudes waggling their fingers at the male tailhook exhibitionists were n't female officers or feminists they were men from the military establishment it was the military that granted immunity to ringleaders of the gantlet so that they could testify against a bunch of streakers tellingly , in his 111page ruling last week dismissing the final three tailhook cases , the navy judge , capt william t vest jr , focused not on the violence against women but on tailhook s reputation for wild partying , heavy drinking and lewd behavior when he suggested that sex , not assault , was on trial here , the young accused officer i talked to had a point if there s anything to gain from the hash made of the tailhook investigation , perhaps it s the \( slim \) possibility that the bawdy officers who were disciplined might feel more empathy for women who , after all , have always faced censure for exhibitions of lustiness the men might remember that if there is a double standard at play here , that shoe is generally on the other , feminine foot if they do n't like how the shoe feels , maybe they wo n't insist that women wear it drawing
carousel will be 50 next year , but as of this morning it is the freshest , most innovative musical on broadway it is also the most beautiful time and again you will marvel at the way the british director nicholas hytner and his designers transform the curved stage of the vivian beaumont theater at lincoln center , where the production opened last night sculptors of space , they summon out of the starflecked darkness breathtaking images of a 19thcentury seacoast town in maine in the scheme of things , this brawling little world is nothing , a mere speck in the cosmos , ignored by the indifferent moon overhead but it is so full of life and love struggling to make itself felt that it is everything clearly , a rueful philosopher abides deep within the immensely gifted mr hytner just as often , you will gasp at the bold moves and risky choices made by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein 2d the success of oklahoma ! two years earlier had proved their partnership worthy carousel would sanctify it as much a musicalized play as a musical , it explores in some of the team s most enduring songs the troubled souls of billy bigelow , carnival barker and ne'erdowell , and julie jordan , the millworker who falls for him and then suffers his abuse with a kind of helpless fortitude what s the use of wondr'in' , julie s attempt to explain the unexplainable bond between them , may be the sweetest surrender to fate ever penned but then , this is a luminescent musical shot through with pain and bewilderment , an uplifting musical in which the lives of most of the major characters are either miserable or misspent the paradoxes and contradictions are precisely what keep carousel alive and vital the simplerminded entertainments tend to die young there is one big obstacle to your enjoyment , however , and you should probably know it right now with a few exceptions , this carousel , which originated in late 1992 in london at the royal national theater , is indifferently sung those who fondly remember john raitt or gordon macrae in the role of billy , or the likes of barbara cook and shirley jones as julie , will find the evening short on vocal luster the most powerful voice in the company belongs to the mezzosoprano shirley verrett , who appears as the warmhearted nettie fowler but the diva seems uncomfortable belting out june is bustin' out all over and only slightly more sure of herself with you 'll never walk alone mr hytner s blanket solution to this problem is to have the performers approach the songs as monologues , sound the lyrics for their hidden impulses and then simply act the stuffing out of them over the years , rodgers and hammerstein have come to stand for a cornfed american goodness and the more saccharine forms of optimism it s an erroneous impression , largely spawned by the sound of music and hammerstein s moralistic injunctions to climb ev'ry mountain or whistle a happy tune mr hytner will have none of it he wants to restore the grittiness to carousel and , in that respect , gorgeous singing matters less to him here , i suspect , than the proletarian authenticity of the characters that michael hayden , who plays billy , comes across as a boy in a man s part is no doubt intentional billy is callow and unthinking , a touseled idol for 19thcentury teenage girls he really does n't start to grow up until he dies and goes to purgatory the strapping firstact soliloquy has the character bursting with the wonder and pride of impending fatherhood as mr hayden sings the number , however , what registers is fear and confusion , eating away at the soaring melody sally murphy is a more assured singer , but her julie has a wan and slightly unkempt air she is attracted to danger and instinctively flouts authority she would probably get along with tonya harding by darkening the characters in this fashion , mr hytner allows his actors to work with a denser subtext than usual romance can turn rough and sweaty quick tempers keep undermining the puritan proprieties when , speaking of billy , julie admits to her friend carrie pipperidge , last monday he hit me , the flat , emotionless confession may come out of the blue , but it comes as no surprise you wo n't cotton to mr hytner s method if you like rodgers and hammerstein for their sunniness on every front , a heightened dialectic between light and shadow , decency and prurience is central to the vision and gives the production its distinction the very first sight to greet you , during the pantomimed prologue that opens the show , is a huge clock under it , julie and seven other women , exhausted automatons , slave away at a massive loom the clock strikes 6 the women let out a whoop of liberation , run to exchange their drab smocks for more festive garb and make their raucous way out the factory gates all the while , the stage is revolving then , as if in a giant kaleidoscope , the garish elements of a carnival begin to float into view uncle sam on stilts , a dancing bear , the gaping jaws of a funhouse door and finally the wooden steeds of the carousel itself propelled in great circles by a headstrong waltz and the tipsy excitement in the air

the knicks would have enjoyed winning their 10th consecutive game against any team but for new york , beating the chicago bulls made last night even more enjoyable continuing their unbeaten march through the month of march , the knicks outlasted the bulls , 8778 , at madison square garden their 10th consecutive victory gave the knicks \( 4619 \) their longest winning streak of pat riley s threeyear tenure as coach the last time the knicks won 10 consecutive games was during the 197273 season , when they won 11 straight games , and ultimately the nba championship last night s victory pulled new york into a tie with the atlanta hawks atop the eastern conference as the threetime defending national basketball association champions , the bulls \( 4323 \) have nothing to prove to the knicks but whenever these teams meet , the knicks look upon the matchup as a test and on this occasion , new york passed 'no respect for us' i think the bulls have no respect for us at all , from the coach right on down through the team , riley said and they have a right to do that they 've got the rings on their fingers until we can beat them as the lakers had to beat boston , as detroit had to beat boston , as chicago had to beat detroit until we can beat them when it counts , they will dismiss this the fact that they 've never shown us any respect is fine with us , but it s also a reality until we can eliminate them and move on , they have the bragging rights during the regular season hubert davis , stepping forward in the absence of the injured john starks , led the knicks with 24 points and 6 assists it may have been davis s best performance as a knick , considering the opponent scottie pippen led the bulls with 25 points , but the knicks held the allstar guard b j armstrong to 4 points on 2for7 shooting the bulls managed just 16 points in the fouth quarter pippen agreed with riley s comment when he said they talk about respect they only way they 'll get it is to win a championship the knicks took control in clutch situations a 12foot jumper by pippen over davis pulled the bulls to within 4 points , at 7672 , with 3 50 left then , after patrick ewing \( 18 points \) missed a 20foot fadeaway jumper , pippen drove to the basket past davis , then fed horace grant with a pretty pass grant dunked , pulling chicago to within 2 but the knicks scored the next 7 points derek harper drove to the basket , then whipped a baseline pass to anthony mason , who made a 12foot jumper from the baseline to put the knicks ahead by 7874 then , after toni kukoc missed a threepoint attempt from behind the key , ewing drove to the basket and was hacked by pippen ewing made both free throws at the 2 18 mark to put the knicks ahead , 8074 after armstrong , who was shut down by the knicks all night , missed a driving shot to the basket davis brought knick fans to their feet , making a 25foot 3pointer in front of the bulls' bench , putting the knicks ahead , 8374 , with 1 51 left the bulls called time davis ran to the knicks' bench , smiling , where he got a highfive from riley coach was excited , and i was excited , said davis i'm always confident , even though i know i need to improve i got open shots tonight , and i hit them indeed , his 7for10 shooting helped ease the absence of charles smith , who missed his second consecutive game with a sore left knee neither team established control in the first half , which ended with chicago ahead , 4442 both teams were ready the bulls had won five straight games , and the knicks knew that chicago was not impressed with new york s ninegame winning streak coming into the game after all , none of those nine victories had come against the bulls it s always nice to beat the world champions , a team that has been your adversary and nemesis , riley said before the game nothing has to be said but there were several troubling signs for the knicks they had difficulty with the bulls' fullcourt press , even though chicago did not use it often when the bulls doubleteamed derek harper in the backcourt , it forced him to give up his dribble , which led to trouble for the knicks anthony bonner and hubert davis both had turnovers against chicago s press in the first half , letting the bulls know they could use the press if they needed it later ewing had a quiet first half , finishing with just 10 points no team is better than chicago at doubleteaming the knicks' center , thanks to the agility of scottie pippen and horace grant bill cartwright can play ewing physically , and cartwright knows that pippen and grant are nearby to put pressure on ewing from different angles pippen led all firsthalf scorers with 14 points , but davis had an important 12point first half for new york , setting the stage for an intense second half neither of these teams would be surprised to meet again in the playoffs but any time the knicks and bulls meet , it feels like a playoff game and this game was no different rebounds despite his history of knee trouble , charles smith was confident that the soreness in his left knee would not develop into a serious problem smith missed his second consecutive game last night , but he planned to travel with the team to minnesota , although he was not certain he would play tomorrow night against the timberwolves side effects forced smith to stop taking antiinflammatory medication for his knee , resulting in renewed pain and swelling smith underwent arthroscopic surgery on dec 7 for cartilage damage , and he missed 31 games before returning on jan 20 he had undergone arthroscopic surgery on both knees last summer asked if he would be healthy for the playoffs , smith said no question once i get on a certain cycle to take the antiinflammatories again , i 'll be fine i know my own body the knee is sore from the pounding of games , and from being unable to take medication asked what the side effects of the medication were , smith said it made my kidneys work extremely hard , causing pain it s painful , the stomach gets upset but i 'll be fine photos hubert davis , whose three 3pointers helped the knicks win , driving by horace grant , left

time has n't had a stop , but it s doing a graceful pause at the booth theater , where broken glass , arthur miller s small , intense , deceptively prosy new drama , has set up shop it was just a halfcentury ago that mr miller made his broadway debut with the man who had all the luck , which closed after four performances , to begin a career that in 1949 was to include death of a salesman , a modern classic and the work by which everything he has since written continues to be judged in a metier where people burn out fast , he s still remarkable for the acuity and scope of his moral vision it s this vision , as well as the miller voice , which remains as strong and unrelenting as a prophet s , that distinguish broken glass and give it a poignance so rare these days that it s almost newfashioned the play is ostensibly about a failed marriage , but the failure mr miller examines has less to do with connubial relations than with one man s warped perception of the american way like willy loman in death of a salesman , the hero of broken glass has n't misread society s signals so much as he has blindly accepted them the time is 1938 , the year of the anschluss , when hitler walked into austria and announced , it s mine , and of kristallnacht \( the night of broken glass \) , when rioting against the jews in germany suddenly alerted the rest of the world to everything that was to come phillip gellburg \( ron rifkin \) is the head of the mortgage department of the brooklyn guarantee trust company in fact , he s the only jew ever hired by the company and proud of it he s also proud of his son , who has graduated from west point and is making a career in the army , largely , it seems , to prove phillip s point that jews do n't always have to be lawyers , doctors or businessmen phillip is a small man but he s a gigantic mess half of him is as antisemitic as stanton case \( george n martin \) , the white anglosaxon protestant head of brooklyn guarantee the other , only vaguely recognized half is the bewildered son of immigrants , a firstgeneration jewish american trying to assimilate as his life falls apart in the course of the play , phillip remembers the joy he experienced many years before , walking down orchard street with his thenyoung beautiful bride , sylvia \( amy irving \) i felt so at home and happy there , he says , a street full of jews , one moses after another but they all turned to watch her go by , those fakers something you forget about mr miller is that he can write dialogue with the best of them wonderfully vivid , funny , ironic and economical he does n't waste words but , because he favors prosaic locutions , his gift for language is not often recognized it s sylvia who forces phillip to examine his once perfectly buttonedup life when the play opens , he s consulting his neighborhood doctor , harry hyman \( david dukes \) , about sylvia who , nine days before , developed an inability to walk , stand up or move her legs , something that has just been diagnosed as hysterical paralysis in every other way , she seems fine , though she has also become obsessed by the news from germany this especially irritates phillip , who blames the sensationmongering newspapers he s also worried about germany , he tells the doctor , but , after all , it s 3 , 000 miles away among other things , he s afraid hitler will give fancy new ideas to american antisemites phillip is desperately conflicted , the sort of passiveaggressive who , in a more conventional drama , would be a supporting character , which is the role he would assign himself in his black suits , black ties , black shoes and white shirts , he does n't want to call attention to himself mr miller places him at stage center and , with the awful gentleness of a surgeon operating without anesthesia , skins him alive in mr rifkin s richly detailed performance , the spectacle fascinates , though always at a somewhat chilly remove mr miller does n't invite easy sentiment sylvia is a far more nebulous character , a woman who gave up a promising business career of her own to become a good jewish wife and mother , only to realize , too late , that she had married half a man now , in a barren middle age , she has caught a glimpse of the void and panicked ms irving , looking waferthin and beautiful , initially seems too young for the role , but she surprises as she demonstrated in heartbreak house some years ago , she s an actress of substance , intelligence and style hers is a most felicitous performance the other performances are good , especially those by mr dukes \( as the doctor \) and mr martin \( as phillip s boss \) yet no matter how their characters are disguised , they exist principally to make the plot function broken glass unfolds in 10 scenes with a gathering , ibsenlike force as the doctor attempts to uncover the roots of sylvia s illness the play is meticulously constructed this is evident in the way that mr miller eventually reconciles sylvia s preoccupation with events in germany , which initially seems associated with some kind of atavistic memory , with what has \( or has n't \) been going on in her bedroom the craft may be meticulous but it is not entirely satisfactory the ultimate revelations simply confirm the audience s suspicions , instead of somehow turning them upside down
stockton , calif until a decade ago , the diamond walnut plant here could be a rollicking place to work we gave parties for supervisors , said deborah goodin , 49 , a longtime employee we put up balloons we brought in strippers if a supervisor got married , we 'd go out and buy a set of silver there was nobody who was any better than anybody else back then , the women at the walnut processing plant were trailblazers long allowed only to sort and pack nuts , the women were then allowed to vie with men for better jobs , like running machinery challenging strike dismissals but today , in this city in the flat and sunny heart of the world s most productive farmland , the women of diamond walnut are only vying to get their jobs back a strike that began over wages two and a half years ago has turned into a challenge of the right of employers to hire permanent replacement workers diamond says it owes a huge debt to the replacement workers it says they worked long days and weekends in 1991 to ship diamond s biggest harvest ever , saving growers from financial disaster in the face of the strike of the 225 strikers , twothirds are women they have been living on their teamsters' union strike pay of 200 a week , onehalf to twothirds of what many of them earned at diamond the workers hired to replace them are mainly younger men , who make an average of 850 an hour , about what the strikers had been earning clinton wants to end practice the strike has drawn the attention of the clinton administration , which is citing diamond walnut in urging congress to stop employers from dismissing workers who strike using permanent replacement workers infuriates unions because they say it undermines their most effective weapon in standing up to management but some companies argue that the strategy is necessary to stay in business labor secretary robert b reich sent the head of his women s bureau , karen nussbaum , to investigate the strike here he also won both sides' agreement to discuss their differences this month with john calhoun wells , director of the federal mediation and conciliation service diamond , an 82yearold cooperative owned by 2 , 000 growers , is the world s largest supplier of walnuts , shipping 200 , 000 tons a year the seeds of the current trouble were sown almost a decade ago to save the company from bankruptcy , the workers and their union , teamsters' local 601 , agreed in 1985 to pay cuts of 30 percent and 40 percent , with wages dropping to 6 and 7 an hour from 10 diamond has since rebounded it sold 204 million worth of walnuts last year , the most ever , and 46 million more than five years ago profits nearly doubled to 112 million in the same period last year , the company paid growers nearly 72 cents a pound for their nuts , 26 cents more than in 1989 and twice the amount of 1985 but as diamond s revenue rose , workers complained that only about a dollar an hour had been restored to their wages in 1991 , they sought a raise of another dollar an hour , which would still have left them below their earlier wages diamond offered 10 cents and bonuses ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand , in good years at the same time , the company asked workers to pay for part of their health insurance 33 a month for a family training replacements seeing no gain , the workers walked out on sept 4 , 1991 diamond was prepared anticipating a strike , management had hired new workers to stand beside the regular workers to learn their jobs infuriating the union , which could do nothing about it when the strike started , the company was fully staffed to handle what turned out to be its biggest harvest ever management then made the replacement workers permanent now , ms goodin , who has been with the company 20 years , along with cynthia zavala , goldie fuqua , and judy sullivan , join other picketing workers in front of the company s 13acre plant , enclosed by chainlink fences with razor wire coiled on top none hurl stones or invective at the men who drive through the security gate to work in their former jobs but they are angry ms fuqua , who started at the plant 22 years ago , said we had to take a stand they kept wanting more and more the thing that gets me is they 're saying they 're loyal to their replacement people what about us \? ms sullivan , who worked at the plant for 26 years , said we thought when we walked out we would negotiate and in two weeks we would go in and have our jobs back then they bring people in for us to train and tell us we 're not getting nothing all we wanted was a dollar inside the plant , fork lifts carry bags and boxes of nuts over acres of concrete floor machines grade nuts to be sold whole they pound others open and cut them into halves and smaller pieces laserequipped machines sort the light meat of the nuts from the dark and blow away the dark just 33 of the plant s 300 fulltime workers crossed the picket line to keep their jobs threequarters of the new workers are men , and , with an average age of 36 , they are nine years younger than the mostly female workers they replaced 'family more important' among the older replacement workers is mark hanson , 45 , a canning machine operator in july 1991 , he lost a job repairing jet aircraft in new mexico and moved to stockton with his wife and two daughters he saw diamond s helpwanted ads and drove to the plant i turned the corner and saw there was a strike in progress , he said taking a striker s job gave him pause but my family is more important , he said , so i went to work his starting pay , near the highest in the plant , was 1010 an hour he has since received two 10centanhour raises and a 2 , 000 bonus last year diamond maintains that if the strikers bailed the company out of a jam a decade ago , people like mr hanson have won its loyalty for saving the 1991 harvest our commitment is to the replacement workers , said sandra mcbride , the company spokeswoman any farmer who had mortgage payments stood to lose his property if we could n't process at that point the union had put our backs to the wall strikers see a ruse the workers say that explanation is a ruse for breaking the union in her report on the strike , ms nussbaum of the labor department wrote that diamond s law firm , littler , mendelson , fastiff tichy of san francisco , has a reputation for helping companies use any legal means to circumvent union representation and the chairman of the national labor relations board , william gould , has doubts about the use of permanent replacement workers though legal , he said , is not equitable or sensible our focus as a country has to be on promoting substitutes for strikes but sometimes , from a worker s perspective , there is no alternative photo in a strike that has turned into a battle against the right of employers to hire permanent replacement workers , pickets have been at the diamond walnut plant at stockton calif , for two and a half years marleen freeman , left , vera wofford , center , and earthle henry were on the line this month \( darcy padilla for the new york times \)
bengals 34 , oilers 31 jeff blake may pass for more yards and win bigger games , but none will be more theatrical limping severely on a bruised ankle that required xrays in the fourth quarter , blake threw four touchdowns passes yesterday and a 50yard completion that set up the cincinnati bengals' second straight victory doug pelfrey hit a 40yard field goal as time ran out for a 3431 victory over visiting houston the victory added to the growing legend of blake a 166th draft pick in 1992 who won american football conference offensive player of the week honors last week by throwing for 387 yards in his second national football league start his encore was simply fairytale he bounced off the xray table to lead two late drives on a bruised left ankle i was n't coming out , blake said they

turned a onehanded catch into a gametying 20yard touchdown reception with 2 minutes 34 seconds left , the final moment in a 71yard drive in which blake somehow dodged allout blitzes long enough to get rid of the ball the bengals took over on their own 11yard line with 1 13 left and gave blake the time he needed for more magic he hit running back harold green on a slant out of the backfield for a 31yard gain , then stood in against heavy pressure to complete a 50yarder to pickens at the houston 22 blake picked himself up , handed off a couple times , then turned matters over to pelfrey , who hit 6 field goals last week in a 2017 overtime victory over seattle blake finished 23 of 33 for 354 yards and the first 4touchdown performance by a bengals quarterback since 1989 pickens had 11

brilliant career , rushing 26 times for a careerhigh 237 yards an even 200 in the second half as the lions kept their playoff hopes alive in the silverdome sanders needed the big night to keep from

my guest was gazing covetously at the richly patterned china on our table do you think they would notice if i just slipped one of these bread plates into my purse \? she joked she looked left and right , picked up a plate , flipped it over gianni versace ! she read i did n't know he made plates as well as clothes and look , there are little holes to hang it up with i knew these were too beautiful to eat off of the gorgeous plates at fantino are just one element in a room so filled with luxury that just walking through the door makes you feel pampered your feet pad along soft carpets , your eyes are soothed by the peachy glow of the walls and when you sit your body is embraced by tapestried armchairs there are paintings on the walls , flowers on the tables and everywhere an impression of space are there other people in the room \? certainly , but you would hardly know it just by listening fantino is a civilized experience the service , as you might imagine , is impeccable the waiters have so perfectly mastered the art of invisibility that we were baffled one night when a dessert arrived with happy anniversary written around the plate in chocolate script how did they know \? we asked each other , completely forgetting that the waiters had heard us toast the celebrating couple earlier in the evening at the time , we had been completely engrossed in the grissini the crisp , grainy polenta breadsticks are served warm they are so good it is tempting to just sit there all evening , eating basket after basket , dunking them into tiny dishes of bright green olive oil but seductive though they are , a little selfcontrol is in order the first courses at fantino are absolutely extraordinary this is italian nuova cucina , the aristocratic cooking that is to the food of the trattoria as haute cuisine is to french bistro food fantino s chef , gennaro villella , first cooked at rex in los angeles , where his delicate style was an instant hit and no wonder his antipasti are unlike anything else now being served in new york his cooking depends on excellent ingredients and unusual combinations forceful smoked sea bass is served with eggplant so sweet it tastes , in contrast , almost like apples the two sit on a fluffy bed of frisee punctuated with smooth white beans , the textures a startling counterpoint panzanella , the classic tuscan bread salad , has been reinvented pumpkin bread croutons are mixed with a julienne of smoked duck breast , zucchini and mint the flavors come crashing happily together even a plain green salad is lavished with attention infant greens are dotted with croutons and perfect tomatoes and tossed with the finest olive oil but it is the pastas that are most memorable mr villella s panzerotti are lovely puffs fatly filled with a fine mush of vegetables and robiola cheese a hearty lamb sauce shot through with the tang of fresh tarragon clings to robust pappardelle with real character casuncelli , little ravioli , are stuffed with a sassy mixture of capon and baby artichokes so potent that a tiny bite fills the mouth with flavor tagliatelle with green asparagus and lobster is another surprise the mixture may sound wimpy , but the tastes , in concert , are remarkably forceful the joy of these dishes is that each is dominated by the natural tastes of the food this is a cuisine that depends on finesse and balance one misstep and the entire dish falls apart mr villella s touch is sure if the meal stopped here , this would be a fourstar restaurant unfortunately , neither the entrees nor the desserts live up to the promise of the beginning of the meal there are certainly high points i loved the rounds of roasted rabbit perched on a pleasantly bitter bed of broccoli rape enlivened by the sweetness of white raisins and the richness of pine nuts rack of lamb with braised endive and radicchio was bound by a wine and prune sauce the flavors raced off in different directions , first sweet , then sour , only to meet in a delicious middle ground and duck braised in sweet vinsanto was a novel and delicious idea but many of the main courses were a letdown mr villella s fish are particularly disappointing salmon with orange and basil salad in an aged balsamic dressing sounded fabulous , but the fish was overcooked swordfish on braised black cabbage was dry and fishy red snapper with grilled zucchini and a fondue of black olives was salty and desserts verged on the absurd with dishes overwhelmed by too many ingredients and too many flavors rhubarb sorbet came sandwiched between chocolate and cinnamon leaves , floating in a soup of barley and wine a little mascarponeespresso pudding was surrounded by an anise sauce a slice of white and dark chocolate mousses was mired in a mint sauce the only one i liked was a fig and almond tart with mango sauce but a little barley in your rhubarb seems a small price to pay for an evening of quiet luxury it is entirely possible to stick to the best dishes at fantino and have fabulous food and excellent wine for little more than you would pay for dinner at one of new york city s noise palaces the price includes some of the most solicitous service i have encountered in the last year it was so vigilant , in fact , that for the first time i found it impossible to steal a menu stuffing a plate into your pocketbook is obviously out of the question fantino  112 central park south , in the ritzcarlton hotel , \( 212 \) 6647700 atmosphere a room so soft , quiet and luxurious it is easy to imagine marie
