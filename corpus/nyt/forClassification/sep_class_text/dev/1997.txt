in recent months , the metropolitan transportation authority has quietly installed new ceilingtofloor turnstiles offering subway riders access to 19 station entrances that had previously been unstaffed and offlimits after hours the turnstiles seem to be a welcome convenience , open to metrocardbearing riders even after token booth clerks go home but the mta also plans to install 400 more turnstiles , accompanied by metrocarddispensing vending machines , at most of the city s 468 subway stations , and some subway riders are concerned that the turnstiles may eventually replace clerks entirely , leaving entrances unstaffed and riders more vulnerable during offpeak hours or worse around the clock the mta says it is not planning to leave any additional stations unstaffed , even during off hours , despite the new turnstiles none of the 400 that are coming in now will affect anyone s job , said tom kelly , an agency spokesman nevertheless , the changes to automation and the possibility that token booths might not be necessary leaves many riders , who say they take comfort in the presence of a clerk at lonely stations or late at night , worried it s not a good idea for them to have no one in the window , period , said kim smith , 19 , a straphanger and student at john jay college of criminal justice who was waiting on the 28th street platform on the 1 and 9 lines , where one of the new turnstiles was recently installed many riders will walk an extra block or two to an entrance where they know there is a token clerk the mta is still evaluating the changes at the 19 entrances that have been made accessible at night with the new turnstiles while it has no immediate plans to replace clerks with turnstiles , the agency does expect to lose about 150 of its 3 , 350 clerks though attrition over the next couple of years , mr kelly said and about 1 , 000 clerks will be retrained as customer service agents mr kelly said he could not elaborate on their duties , except to say they would become more like station managers over the past six months , officials with new york city transit , the division of the mta that operates the city s subways and buses , have been meeting with security experts for advice on how to maintain public safety on subway platforms once the new turnstiles are installed in the entire system alan foster , a member of the permanent citizens advisory committee to the mta , said the agency was still fishing around in its quest to balance controlled labor costs with public safety the agency has been under intense pressure in recent years to cut personnel costs it is definitely a place they have to look , mr foster said i think they have to be very cautious as to how to do this joseph g rappaport , the coordinator of the straphangers campaign , a subway riders advocacy group , said he welcomed the new turnstiles in entrances that were previously inaccessible but , he said , he worried about whether the mta would use the turnstiles to reduce staffing or leave more station entrances unstaffed at night the turnstiles are an improvement , he said , at entrances where there had been no token clerks , like the jackson avenue entrance to the northbound no 2 and no 5 lines , and the southbound 28th street entrance for the 1 and 9 lines but if this were the trend for the future across the system at dozens or hundreds of stations , mr rappaport said , it will mean riders will be less safe it will be an invitation to crime the 19 entrances where the new turnstiles were installed this summer had long been unstaffed for several hours each day the entrance to the 28th street station on the downtown no 1 and 9 lines , for instance , had been closed between 10 pm and 7 am each day now , metrocardbearing riders can enter around the clock , although no clerk is there the new turnstiles , designed to thwart vaulting farebeaters , are like revolving doorsthey replace what used to be known as iron maidens , the clunky tokenoperated revolving turnstiles that frequently swallowed up tokens and became unpopular among riders the mta plans to install the new metrocard turnstiles at another 128 stations by the end of 1998 and the rest of the 400 by the year 2000 , according to the agency s strategic business plan some riders said the new turnstiles would make no difference to their sense of security , since they do not expect token booth clerks to protect them and they said they would welcome the new turnstiles if they would make the system more accessible and cost effective i would like to have someone there , but if they 're not , you should be able to use the subway , said bill lerstad , a long island resident who said he uses the subway mostly during the day but among some riders , the prospect of change has raised eyebrows at the 28th street station in manhattan , dawn geller , 26 , just stared at one shiny new turnstile with skepticism if she was not within gazing distance of a token booth clerk , she said , she would not dare stand on that platform after hours just so when i come in , i can stand here and just look at the token booth guy , she explained , pointing to the window you know how guys come up at you and go , 'hey , what s your name \? ' not that a token booth clerk could offer much protection from real danger , her friend , evo love , interjected but , ms love , 24 , said , i guess it gives you some subconscious comfort

washington , aug 31 for more than a decade , a group of senators from the northwest has been trying with little success to break up the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit , complaining that it was too large and , more important , was dominated by judges from california who issue liberal environmental rulings but this summer , the lawmakers , all republicans , managed to insert a littlenoticed rider into an appropriations bill that would split the circuit it passed the senate days before the august recess the house has approved a different measure , one that would authorize only a study of the issue , and it is likely to balk at the senate s swifter approach nonetheless , the senate action is the high watermark of the effort to dismantle the ninth circuit , which decides federal appeals from nine western states and two territories , making it by far the nation s largest appellate court the senate vote also comes almost 60 years to the month after president franklin d roosevelt tried and failed in his famous court packing scheme to enlarge the supreme court because he was angered at its rulings on his new deal programs critics of the latest effort in the senate , including some usually reticent federal judges , describe the effort to split the ninth circuit as similarly motivated , a kind of court unpacking plan in response to unpopular judicial decisions chief judge procter hug jr of the ninth circuit said in an interview that the primary motivation behind the dividethecourt effort was that many of the court s decisions had been unpopular and had caused political problems in the northwest if there are a few highprofile cases that are decided in such a way as to be unpopular , there is a remedy for that through the supreme court , he said my sense is that this is a wholly inappropriate reason to suddenly decide on changing the entire structure of a court albert t goodwin , a former chief judge of the circuit , has been more explicit , once telling reporters that the effort was a reflection of the frustration that timber and mining interests felt about the ninth circuit s ruling in favor of preserving habitats of the spotted owl judge hug and judge james r browning , also a former chief of the circuit , have even arranged to come to washington next week to lobby house members to resist the move but not all of the court s judges agree with judge hug judge andrew j kleinfeld , who sits in fairbanks , said he thought it was absolutely necessary to divide the circuit and its workload he said that with a complement of 28 judges , the court was too large , too unwieldy and too unmanageable it s impossible for a judge on our court to keep up with all the rulings of the other judges , he said this has resulted in a far less coherent and disciplined body of law from this circuit the federal appellate courts , the level just below the supreme court , are organized into 11 regional circuits and one in the district of columbia the new legislation would leave just california and nevada in the ninth circuit while creating a new twelfth circuit composed of what s left alaska , arizona , hawaii , idaho , montana , oregon , washington and the pacific territories \( guam and the northern mariana islands \) the legislation is opposed by the white house , the majority of judges on the ninth circuit , including the last three chief judges , the american bar association , the california bar association and gov pete wilson of california , who has called it judicial gerrymandering the reason this effort was successful in the senate earlier in the summer appears to be that the ninth circuit recently aroused the ire of senator ted stevens , the alaska republican who is chairman of the appropriations committee senator stevens had previously been a steady but lukewarm advocate of dividing the circuit , but he seemed energized by a decision last year in which a panel of the circuit s appellate judges , none from alaska , decided a tax case involving alaskan indian tribes after that , he declared it was time for a change mr stevens inserted the provision about the ninth circuit into the appropriations bill for the departments of justice and state the rider , an often used way of effecting policy , passed with no hearings and no consideration by the senate judiciary committee , which would usually deal with such an issue the alaska case involved a ninth circuit ruling in december that two indian villages in the state had the same broad sovereignty rights , including taxing power , as indian villages in the lower 48 states senator stevens denounced the ruling as upsetting the state s economy and told the anchorage daily news that he would raise anew the effort to split the circuit that court has too much to do to even learn about alaska , he said i do n't think any of those judges ever have been to alaska and yet we have them issuing an opinion like this which has so much to do with our future senator stevens s comments mirror those of the more aggressive sponsors of the effort to split the court senator conrad burns , republican of montana , has said that his state needed judges who grew up in the region who would be more sensitive to how we manage our own resources but the senators in the northwest have emphasized instead the issue of the court s size , arguing that it makes judicial administration unwieldy the court was set up in 1891 , before california grew into the most populous state in 1996 , 8 , 502 appeals were filed with the ninth circuit , according to the administrative office of the courts the next busiest circuit was the fifth , in the southeast , which had 7 , 546 cases filed a senate study in 1975 recommended splitting the circuit and doing so by dividing california down the middle but the executive director of that study , prof arthur hellman of the university of pittsburgh law school , now says the division may be unnecessary he said there was little doubt that the motivation behind the effort to divide the court was a misguided belief that it would produce more conservative rulings he said critics mistakenly think that the judges in california are , as a whole , more liberal than those in the other states essentially , these people want to secede from a circuit that includes california , he said
behind the scenes in the stock market , bitter fights are waged between the longs and the shorts those who think a stock should go up and those who think it should go down now , one of those fights , and the tactics used in it , are getting a lot of exposure it involves the solvex corporation , a small company based in new mexico with a lease on oil sands in alberta it is building a plant that it says will produce oil and other products from the sands the company says the plant will go into service this month the company has been beset by plenty of bad publicity , and by a federal investigation of trading in its stock solvex has sued two firms that it says have sold its stock short and an engineering firm that questioned its technology , and says it may sue others a large block of its stock was bought , evidently illegally , by a british fund manager who has since been fired those shares , presumably , will soon be available on thursday , solvex breathlessly announced that it had uncovered documents showing that people who borrowed its shares and sold them short , betting on a decline in price , had acted in clear violation of federal securities laws the implications of the documents could be farreaching and , in addition to the shortsellers , involve certain members of the media and our basic trust in fairness of the american business system , said john rendall , the company s chief executive w jack butler , the president , said there was a coordinated effort to discredit solvex , and disseminate information that is false and knowingly false thus it was with eagerness that i embarked on a review of the documents , mostly email messages to and from employees of a defendant , zweig advisors , that solvex obtained through discovery in its civil suit here s what i learned shortsellers talk to one another , to reporters and to investigators for the securities and exchange commission after they bet that a stock will fall , they forecast that it will do so none of that is stunning whether the claims made by the shortsellers are true they doubt the technology will work and challenge the accuracy of the company s assertions of progress is not readily apparent but there is nothing i can find that indicates that the shorts spread information they did not believe , as mr butler asserts there is one interesting aspect to the case , which will not improve the ethical reputation of the shortselling community some of them seem to have gotten the company to give them private information by signing confidentiality agreements , on the representation that they were considering providing financing for the company that does n't sound very honest , but it also appears that the confidential information did not convince the shortsellers that they were wrong the company evidently thinks the shorts committed insider trading by trading after they got the information as for the media , the company cites negative reports on solvex in the wall street journal , barron s , money magazine and cnbc in 1996 \( it does n't mention a negative 1995 column in this newspaper \) it appears that some journalists got information from shortsellers , who hoped the company would not obtain financing but the documents do n't indicate that anyone shorts or journalists doubted the accuracy of the stories who s right \? we 'll find out , but not in court mr butler says the company has enough financing to complete the plant if so , we 'll see if it works graph subject of litigation shows the stock price of solvex , weekly closes , 199597
americans cannot live with last summer s terrorist bombing in saudi arabia until those who carried out the attack are brought to justice and the financial and logistical help they received is made plain attorney general janet reno and louis freeh , the director of the federal bureau of investigation , have every reason to press the saudi government to share information about the investigation of the june bombing , which killed 19 american airmen and wounded 500 others the american relationship with saudi arabia is complex and delicate , but candor is sometimes needed ms reno and mr freeh have introduced some by complaining that unfulfilled promises of saudi cooperation have prevented a thorough investigation of the truck bombing of the khobar towers apartment complex in dhahran they are particularly worried that the saudi authorities will behead the primary suspects before americans have a chance to question them that is what happened last year during the investigation of a 1995 terrorist attack against americans in riyadh the execution of the main suspects prevented an exhaustive inquiry that might have determined whether there is a broader terrorist network in saudi arabia and the middle east , possibly involving iranian support the saudi royal family wants american military protection but none of the complications that can come with it the saudi leadership is also reluctant to acknowledge that the kingdom may now be home to a violent opposition intent on overthrowing the monarchy and evicting american forces still , the saudis ought to realize that their allergic reaction to american assistance in the bombing investigation is destructive to both saudi and american interests the clinton administration s impatience with the saudi investigation has not been matched by an equal determination to hold accountable the american military officers who were responsible for the inadequate security in dhahran william cohen , the new secretary of defense , should not condone efforts to excuse the negligence of brig gen terryl schwalier , who was the american commander in dhahran the air force s initial review of the bombing found no justification for disciplinary action , despite a pentagon inquiry concluding that general schwalier failed to take essential steps to secure the housing complex if the final air force report , due soon , is not amended , mr cohen should overrule it the military services seem to think that holding officers accountable for devastating blunders undermines morale and unfairly singles out individuals for punishment the real danger to morale and professionalism is shielding officers from responsibility and setting no price for failure
two investors , acting separately , have acquired big stakes in dow jones company , increasing pressure on the company to improve the performance of its telerate financialinformation service james j cramer , who manages a private investment fund , said in an interview last night that he held slightly more than one million dow jones shares and the dow jones news service , which is owned by dow jones , reported that michael f price , who is known for successfully pushing reluctant companies to take steps to improve their stock prices , now owned 45 million shares based on the about 96 million shares that dow jones has outstanding , that would give mr price a 47 percent stake and mr cramer 1 percent mr price could not be reached for comment last night mr cramer said that he had had no contact with mr price i'm in good company , but i have never spoken to him or any of his people , mr cramer said roger may , a dow jones spokesman , said he could not confirm any recent stock acquisitions by mr price or mr cramer fortune magazine has reported that the two bought shares in dow jones last week the magazine said that mr price believed dow jones stock was undervalued last week , dow jones announced that it would spend 650 million over the next three to four years to overhaul telerate , an electronic service that provides securities prices and news to traders and professional investors the service has been losing ground to competitors like bloomberg lp and reuters holdings plc the announcement dismayed investors , in large part because executives acknowledged that the revamping would crimp profitability for at least the next two years as a result , the stock dropped 10 percent in one day , to 3675 it closed yesterday at 3550 , down 875 cents a fortune article earlier in january said that several heirs of dow jones s founders were unhappy with the performance of the stock , which has lagged over the last several years , even as the overall stock market soared that article had given the stock a shortterm lift because the founding family maintains control of the company through a special class of stock , outside investors cannot force dow jones to change , mr cramer said but he added that he viewed the stock as undervalued and that the company would be willing to listen to his suggestions about how to improve its performance mr price has a strong track record of forcing companies to take steps to improve returns for shareholders he is widely credited , for example , with prompting the chase manhattan corporation to agree to a takeover by the chemical banking corporation , which then changed its name to chase manhattan an expert in investing in the securities of bankrupt or troubled concerns , mr price last year sold heine securities inc , which manages the mutual series funds , to franklin resources for more than 600 million dow jones , whose publications include the wall street journal and barron s , reported last week that earnings slipped sixtenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter and were flat for the year its revenue from financialinformation services , which include but are not limited to telerate , rose 19 percent last year from 1995 , to 9797 million operating profit from the unit fell nearly 21 percent , however , to 1558 million by comparison , revenues from business publishing reached 12 billion last year , up 157 percent from 1995 , while operating profits rose nearly 70 percent , to 1594 million dow jones bought telerate for 16 billion in a series of acquisitions starting a dozen years ago in announcing the new investment in telerate last week , dow jones s chairman and chief executive , peter kann , told analysts during a conference call that none of us are satisfied with where we are in this business today kenneth burenga , chief executive of dow jones telerate and president of dow jones , said last week that telerate remained a major player in the 6 billion market for financialinformation services , and that the investment plan would allow telerate to regain lost market share and benefit dow jones shareholders analysts , though , said that many of the latest steps were an attempt to only catch up with what major competitors were already doing for example , mr burenga said that at some point later this year telerate would begin to offer historical and analytic information about financial securities on its computer screens , products that have been available on bloomberg machines for years
irving , tex tiger woods swung his driver and his golf ball soared up , up and away on this 533yard seventh hole at the tpc at las colinas , it would roll to a stop about 330 yards away in the fairway , but while the ball was still a white dot high in the sky , a young man in the gallery yelled , i did that in my dreams last night so did i , somebody else said , smiling , and tiger woods laughed but that somebody else was not just another envious duffer in the gallery that somebody else was nick price , who has won the pga championship twice and the british open once he was out there playing with woods during the first two rounds of the gte byron nelson classic , but with his friendly wisecrack , he , too , seemed to be in tiger s gallery in golf these days , tiger s gallery is the place to be yesterday , woods was serenaded by applause from an estimated 80 , 000 people while shooting a threeunderpar 67 , giving him a twostroke lead at 15underpar 195 in today s final round , as many as 100 , 000 people might be waiting for him to appear on the first tee scalpers , never before seen at a golf tournament here , were asking 100 for yesterday s ticket maybe more today unlike in other sports , golf spectators can see woods up close and personal you do n't need a box seat behind the dugout or a celebrity seat at courtside your golf ticket wo n't get you inside the ropedoff fairways , but every so often woods is right there near the ropes , where you might even hear him talking to his golf ball do n't get behind the tree , he could be heard saying after a hooked tee shot in the opening round do n't it did n't all golfers talk to their golf balls , but when woods talks to his , it seems to obey and sometimes he talks to himself , as he did on the sixth hole yesterday after a spinless flop shot from a grassy greenside swale created a bogey i absolutely , he was heard grumbling , ca n't hit that shot his gallery talks to him too young or old , the fans can be heard shouting , let s go , tiger and every so often he acknowledges those voices , as he did while walking from the 15th green to the 16th tee friday when a little boy stared up at him hi , tiger woods , the boy said woods smiled too many touring pros stare straight ahead too often , as if they were robots , but much of the masters champion s charm is that he is human after a birdie or a good shot , he 'll flash that boyish smile on the way to the next tee , he 'll slap a hand or two extended to him from behind the ropes after a bogey or a bad shot , he 'll flash annoyance with a snap of his head or muttering after a par , he 'll well , after he putted out for his third straight par on friday s back nine , he walked over to the ropes behind the green and handed his golf ball to a small boy maybe he 'll have better luck with it , woods would say later with a smile it was n't working for me through the years , golf icons such as bobby jones , ben hogan , arnold palmer and jack nicklaus have had huge galleries , but none of them ever attracted as many kids as tiger woods does as a kid of 21 himself , he s aware of his popularity , especially with the kids there s a new influx of people who have n't even considered playing the game , especially kids , he said i think kids now see golf as maybe a sport that might be kind of cool to play , rather than just one of those wimpy sports like we all said growing up in his gallery , those kids are n't just teenagers playing golf many are little kids but his popularity demands security in addition to the marshals in irving , four uniformed police officers and several in plain clothes are never far from woods before , during and after his round i wish the crowds would understand and be more respectful where i did n't need the security , he said tournaments are trying to feel out how many people we need going from the clubhouse to the putting green , we had way too many marshals and police officers and security i think it drew more attention than it did to deter it it s upsetting if the fans mob me , like they did in phoenix and los angeles those are situations that potentially become very dangerous a little kid got trampled at the players championship people kept walking over him until i moved them and got him up that s what can happen if we do n't have the security but as he walked not far from the ropes , a little girl , maybe 4 years old , was heard to say , i saw tiger woods all around her , grownups smiled and laughed but that little girl was talking for everyone in tiger woods s gallery photo amid a throng of admirers , tiger woods played his tee shot on the 18th hole yesterday in irving , tex \( associated press \)
jerusalem historic turning points are not always easy to discern the september 1993 handshake on the white house lawn between yitzhak rabin and yasir arafat appeared to be such a turning point , representing the beginning of israelipalestinian reconciliation but mr arafat undermined everything this handshake represented when he held a series of meetings between march 9 and 13 with leaders of hamas and other militant groups , at which he gave what amounted to a green light for the resumption of terrorist attacks that was an assault on the very premise of the oslo agreement that once the plo renounced terrorism , israelipalestinian differences , no matter how enormous , could be resolved through negotiations it is a grave error to assume that this attack on the underpinnings of the oslo accords began with the political tensions of the last few weeks arising from the construction of new jewish housing in the eastern part of jerusalem in january 1996 , the head of israeli military intelligence , maj gen moshe yaalon , told a knesset committee that the organizational infrastructure of hamas continues to be built , whether with weaponry or the mobilization of activists he added , arafat is preserving this situation for finalstatus negotiations with israel clearly , terrorism was kept as a bargaining chip , even if it was conducted by palestinian opposition elements within six weeks of the israeli intelligence chief s testimony , bus bombs killed 59 israelis in tel aviv and jerusalem faced with overwhelming american and israeli pressure , mr arafat finally cracked down on hamas and islamic jihad but by august 1996 well before mr arafat s september confrontation with the netanyahu government over the opening of an archeological tunnel in jerusalem the palestinian authority began releasing hamas and islamic jihad military leaders who had been imprisoned several months earlier these were not men who preached in mosques , but operatives with expertise in explosives , including some who had been trained in iran what is to be done now \? first , it has to be clear that a peace process without security will not work true , palestinianisraeli disagreements are very real but nothing can justify last week s bombing of innocent civilians in tel aviv the palestinian authority must be held accountable for its greenlight policy it must change it to a permanent red light the palestinian authority also must comply with the obligations it reaffirmed at the signing of the hebron agreement they include combating systematically and effectively terrorist organizations and their infrastructure the willingness of the palestinian security forces to do this cannot depend on the pace of negotiations it has to be constant second , the principle of reciprocity must be treated seriously israel made tangible moves over the last few months it withdrew from hebron , freed female palestinian prisoners and transferred a significant amount of money to the palestinian authority \( despite the authority s debts \) israel also granted 56 , 000 work permits to palestinians \( compared with 22 , 000 at the time of the israeli elections \) in addition , israel decided on the first of three further redeployments that will increase the west bank area under full palestinian control from 28 percent \( under mr rabin and his successor , shimon peres \) to more than 101 percent the palestinian side met none of its posthebron undertakings this process wo n't work if it is a onesided giveaway so the israeli government has not closed the door to the peace process but if negotiations are to advance , sanctioned violence must be eliminated no nation can be expected to negotiate if it is faced with terrorism being unleashed every time an impasse is reached only if the foundation of the oslo agreement is restored to produce real security will the 1993 handshake prove to be a true historic turning point otherwise it will be remembered as a historic error

the metropolitan opera s walking wounded , the mezzosoprano cecilia bartoli and the conductor james levine , retreated to the smaller stage of alice tully hall on thursday evening ms bartoli dropped out of an internationally broadcast performance of mozart s cosi fan tutte at the met last saturday , citing a strained back , after mr levine and the two male leads had already withdrawn because of illness here , in a program of italian and french songs with mr levine at the piano , both performers looked in the pink mr levine literally , evidently sunburned from his recuperation in florida vocally , at least , ms bartoli seemed at her formidable peak \( joseph volpe , the general manager of the met , who had made no secret of his displeasure over ms bartoli s cancellation , was on hand to examine the patients \) as ms bartoli has shown repeatedly , hers is a voice made for rossini a sprinkling of rossini numbers here showed her gifts in the best light , none more so than an encore , the accelerating canzonetta spanuola , with the coloratura ultimately wound tighter than a spring spanishtinged numbers were a particular delight throughout the evening , providing an outlet for ms bartoli s theatrical flair in berlioz s zaide , she doubled on the castanets , an entertaining turn but one that suggested she should not give up her night job anytime soon another spanish entry came in a delicious set of ravel s chants populaires , folksong settings in a variety of languages and dialects , all of which ms bartoli plausibly mouthed the only real disappointment came at the outset , in a set of bellini songs and ariettas ms bartoli s command of color and ability to shift from note to note seem boundless , and in the opening vaga luna che inargenti , she slathered on the colorations almost too lavishly , giving an impression of oversweetness and the one real limitation of her voice , in sheer size , came to the fore in bellini s arialike l'abbandono even in the intimate confines of tully hall , ms bartoli seemed a pocket diva , wanting more sound in the climaxes than she had to give the rest was sheer enjoyment mr levine , typically , was a superb , considerate accompanist \( and yes , with no insult intended , accompanist is the right word in much of this material \) he may have been too deferential at times , but he projected so well and so evenly right down to the quietest passages that his playing always made its effect
white plains , april 30 quietly insisting i did not do that , rita gluzman was sentenced today to life in prison for killing her husband , yakov , a prominent microbiologist , with an ax after he told her he was divorcing her for another woman mrs gluzman , a soviet emigre once so devoted to her husband that she went on an 18day hunger strike to help him get out of the soviet union , was the first person sentenced for a killing under a 1994 federal law that makes it a crime to cross state lines to injure a spouse or intimate partner many in the federal courtroom here were mindful of the oddity that the law , which is part of the violence against women act and is aimed principally at abusive husbands , claimed a woman as one of its first convicts at least two men have also been sentenced under the law , but those cases did not involve homicide the sentence itself did not come as a surprise , because the sentencing guidelines mandate life imprisonment for harm resulting in death but the solemn halfhour sentencing was filled with drama mrs gluzman s 26yearold son , ilan , was in the courtroom and watched as his mother was dispatched to prison for life for conspiring to kill and dismember his father he did not speak , but he had already sent a note to the judge asking for leniency dr yakov gluzman s parents , chaim and sophia gluzman , remained in israel to attend a niece s bat mitzvah , but their presence was felt in a letter to the judge read by a prosecutor , cathy seibel , in a courtroom filled with friends and colleagues of the victim for 25 years she gradually demolished him emotionally and in the 26th year she dismembered him physically , the letter said by her evil act rita has ruined the life of her son , whom she left fatherless , and marked him with the stigma of a mother convicted for murder after we raised yakov to be a good man and a worldrenowned scientist who devoted his life to research and to the benefit of humanity , she suddenly took him away from us , the letter went on mrs gluzman , 48 , who as an american had acquired a taste for minks and bmw s , sat tensely as the letter was read when she spoke in her own behalf she was brief your honor , i did not do not do that and still say that in front of the world , she said but judge barrington d parker jr had already pronounced sentence and lectured mrs gluzman none of us can ever know what transpired between you and your husband , the judge said the only thing we know is that nothing that occurred can possibly justify what you did to him you are a woman of considerable courage , capacity and accomplishment for whatever reason , you allowed yourself to disintegrate around the relationship and the pain that grew out of it mrs gluzman s one victory today was that judge parker recommended that she be sent to the mediumsecurity women s prison in danbury , conn , rather than to a maximumsecurity prison farther away , as ms seibel and her coprosecutor , deirdre m daly , had urged after the sentence , mrs gluzman s sister , marianna rabinovitch , her mother , pola shapiro , and her son , ilan , walked out of the courtroom with their arms locked the family is behind her , mrs rabinovitch said we will be always she did and built many things in her life that should not be forgotten mrs gluzman s lawyer , lawrence hochheiser , said she would challenge the constitutionality of the domestic violence law because it is premised on federal authority over interstate commerce crossing state lines to commit a crime , he argued , has nothing to do with commerce yakov gluzman , 49 , a ukrainian native , was famed among cancer researchers for his work with viruses at his death , he was director of microbiology at lederle laboratories in pearl river , ny , and was planning to move to israel to join a bacteriologist he was in love with at mrs gluzman s trial , the chief witness was her cousin , vladimir zelenin , who was indebted to mrs gluzman as a new emigre desperate for work and legal residency he told how mrs gluzman plotted the slaying , taking him to a store to buy an ax and to a market to buy garbage bags for disposing of the body he described how on april 6 , 1996 , he and mrs gluzman , who lived in upper saddle river , nj , ambushed mr gluzman in his pearl river apartment and repeatedly whacked him across the head with two axes while she swabbed the floor of blood , he cut up the body in the bathtub the next morning , a police officer saw mr zelenin disposing of the body in the passaic river in east rutherford , nj mrs gluzman was caught six days later in a bungalow at cold spring harbor laboratory on long island , where her husband had once worked she had four stolen license plates and travel brochures the authorities brought federal charges of domestic violence , rather than state charges of murder , because there was almost no physical evidence at the murder scene to corroborate mr zelenin s account federal charges do not require corroboration a jury found mrs gluzman guilty on jan 30 the crime has shattered many lives , most hauntingly that of the gluzmans' son , ilan he has taken over his mother s electroplating business in east rutherford , working with his aunt , mrs rabinovitch his life is devastated , said his lawyer , robert l ellis
until a few days ago the planets seemed to be lining up for assembly speaker sheldon silver to deliver a blow to gov george e pataki s 73 billion plan to cut long island electric rates through a partial takeover of lilco mr silver , a manhattan democrat who is singularly positioned to kill the plan or send it into limbo , reluctantly gave his approval this month after having demanded and received a guarantee that rates would be cut at least 14 percent for 10 years there was neither a clap of thunder nor a pealing of bells but supporters and critics agreed mr silver s approval might have been the most important event in assuring adoption of a plan to set long island s energy future until at least 2030 the rest , many of those involved in the case said , was just filing papers with federal agencies and awaiting expected approvals even opponents said a groundswell of public opposition would be needed to change the probable outcome the plan , which would create the largest bond issue in american history , would replace lilco with a publicprivate hybrid in which a state agency , the long island power authority , would take over the transmission and distribution of electricity while a new utility formed by a merger of the long island lighting and brooklyn union gas companies continued to own generators and supply power the savings would come from authority refinancing , principally of lilco s 45 billion regulatory asset for the shoreham nuclear power plant , with proceeds from the 73 billion in taxexempt bonds the authority would also avoid certain taxes that lilco pays as a private company and would not have to earn profits for the benefit of shareholders with state backing assured and , perhaps , the highest hurdle cleared , mr pataki s appointees at the power authority , as well as the two utilities , are moving on to washington , where a 2 billion capitalgains tax exemption for lilco would have to be secured before the internal revenue service rules on exemptions change mr silver said in a letter to mr pataki that it would be irresponsible to block the unique and limited opportunity to take advantage of the exemption the plan also needs approval from the federal energy regulatory commission , which has broad authority over power providers and a history of moving slowly and deliberately the agency has already approved the merger between lilco and brooklyn union the state public service commission would also have to approve the deal but the psc , controlled by mr pataki s appointees , supported efforts to negotiate the deal and is unlikely to block it oddly , mr silver delivered his approval just as opponents had mustered their most powerful cases against the plan the approval also coincided with the release of critical consultants' reports the assembly energy committee , after hearings that included pointed questioning of the chairman of lilco , dr william j catacosinos , said the plan was flawed , held questionable benefits for customers and gave lilco an undeserved windfall on the eve of his vote on the public authorities control board , whose unanimous approval was needed for the plan to progress , mr silver was counseled by the chairman of the energy committee , paul d tonko , democrat of amsterdam , to reject the plan the doubledigit rate savings promised by lipa are achieved because the financing is front loaded , mr tonko wrote to mr silver any real benefit to customers disappears over the life of the plan mr tonko said the plan was built on the unrealistic belief that the technology used to generate and distribute electricity will not change when customers pay back the bonds even promises to protect jobs at lilco , an aspect of the deal that brought union support , are open to questions , mr tonko said the company formed by the lilcobrooklyn union merger , he said , would be a prime target for a takeover by another company that might be less willing to guarantee jobs another democrat in the assembly , paul e harenberg of bayport , the sponsor of legislation that created the long island power authority , was also imploring mr silver to reject the proposal other assembly democrats from long island , and at least one republican assemblyman , also opposed the plan i am very disappointed by the speaker s decision , said mr harenberg , who wanted lilco to share more of the cost for the failure at shoreham i did all i could to try to get him to go in a different direction , and for a while i thought he would i think now we are stuck with a bad deal we now have a deal that was made by three people , none of whom lives on long island other assembly members backed the deal there are many components of the deal , and they have to be considered together , michael a l balboni , republican of mineola , said there are many tangible benefits mr balboni said critics tended to isolate parts of the plan , failing to place them in the context of the overall negotiations among the power authority , lilco and brooklyn union

toronto , feb 9 it was the same kind of tiered stage used for award ceremonies at the olympics gold , silver and bronze medals were standard here too even the triumphal music was similar but when athletes like thabelang gumbi of south africa or liu yanpeng of china stepped forward on shaky knees to receive medals for skating in the 111meter dash at the sixth special olympics world winter games that ended here on saturday , the national anthems of their countries were not sung nor were their nation s flags unfurled organizers of the games say that is because at the special olympics , the handicapped athletes and 2 , 000 others like them from 75 countries are expected to represent more than their homelands we do n't count medals , we do n't use flags , said timothy p shriver , president and chief executive of the special olympics he said the games are an attempt to show the world that what counts is not being better , or stronger , but recognizing the best in people no matter where they came from , what they look like , or how their minds work when the special olympics was started 29 years ago by mr shriver s mother , eunice kennedy shriver , it was not much of an international event canada was the only country besides the united states to take part in the first games , held on a blustery day at soldiers field in chicago now , nearly three decades later , this year s winter games were billed as the largest international sporting event of 1997 through the years the basic goal has remained the same to help the athletes see themselves in a new light it is hard to say just how much taking part in the special olympics may change the lives of the athletes when they return home but while they are here , they have the chance to visit a dentist or have their eyes checked some get to be television sports commentators , or newspaper reporters and as they listen to the announcer read off their names and call them to receive their medals , their faces indicate that life has grown sweeter , at least for a while mr gumbi , 18 , who lives just outside johannesburg , could not express what he felt as he raced haltingly around the slick ice at veteran s arena but in the stands , the volunteers who traveled with the team s 16 members were on their feet shouting thabelang , thabelang it just proves that something could be done for these children , said doreen selekane , one of the volunteers she has been fighting for the rights of the mentally handicapped in south africa since 1982 , and against apartheid all her life at one time , she said , someone like mr gumbi , whether black or white , would have been locked up at home and never let out another volunteer , angela braun , said the rink where her handicapped daughter lorna trains in johannesburg has now been desegregated , and the whites only signs have been removed but much still has to change in south africa , both concerning race and prejudice toward the mentally retarded , she said people still fear lorna because they do not understand her and economic inequality remains none of the black athletes' parents could afford to come over here because of the financial conditions of the country , mrs braun said , and that s sad as another heat of the 111 meters \( the distance was one lap around a hockey rink \) was almost ready to be run the other day , a burly man from inner mongolia named daxidorji , the head of the chinese delegation , leaned over from the stands and urged mr liu , 18 , who only started skating a year ago , to do his best mr liu skated hard , but when he crossed out of bounds on one of the turns , he was disqualified he received a medal anyway , as all athletes here do mr daxidorji could not explain why all 14 athletes on the chinese national team this year are from inner mongolia , nor how handicapped children get the special care they need when they return home but he said that while mr liu and the other athletes in the orange and gold ski suits of china were competing in this year s world games , they feel terribly happy to enjoy the sports with everyone , black and white , boys and girls , young and old that much , at least , was clear
independence day is the traditional end of new york s state legislative session but with two weeks to go , the senate and assembly have not even begun to tackle their 1997 agenda the fight over rent regulation kept business at a standstill now the senators and assembly members may fail to deal with critical problems in their rush to get home for summer vacation history suggests there is even more danger that they will pass bad legislation in the lastminute confusion the first priority , of course , is to pass the state budget , which was due april 1 but is late for the 13th straight year the two parties have not yet even agreed on how much money the state will have to spend , a matter that was supposed to be taken care of in march the state is also facing a federal deadline on welfare reform , but given the late hour and lack of consensus , the legislature will probably simply tinker with the present system to make it compatible with national laws , while postponing real changes until another day that is a typical albany response to any challenge , but probably the best that can be hoped for under the circumstances however , the state must accept responsibility for its fecklessness and hold the localities harmless for any penalties they incur because of the delay there is another deadline , however , that the legislature cannot slough off with a wink and a nod the state law regulating lobbyists will expire at the end of this year the present law is among the weakest in the country the next version should tighten the rules on giftgiving to legislators and outlaw campaign fundraising parties during the session those parties are little more than an invitation to lobbyists to stand in line and ante up to the legislatorhost of the evening they were one of the lawmakers' favorite methods of passing the time during this year s long idle months the 10year trial program permitting the televising of state civil and criminal trials also expires at the end of this month the cameras have been a valuable tool in public scrutiny of judicial proceedings if the leaders cannot agree to making the law permanent , the trial program should be extended in a rational world , the rest of the legislators could have dealt with some of these issues while assembly speaker sheldon silver and the senate majority leader , joseph bruno , were fighting about rent control the long weeks without even a meeting on the rent issue would have been valuable time to take the first steps toward instituting chief judge judith kaye s important proposal to simplify the state s court system a conference committee could have worked out an agreement on computerizing the state elections board and putting campaign filings on line longdeferred antidiscrimination legislation covering gay people should have been voted on in both chambers problems with malpractice insurance and putting the environmental bond act into effect could have been fixed none of those things were done because , in albany , all significant legislation is held until the final days of the session and decided in one monster tradeoff between mr silver and mr bruno now , having gotten itself into this hole , the legislature should set aside plans to tackle complicated but not pressing matters like requests for more deregulation from the banking and insurance industry a frenzied rush toward adjournment , when legislators are voting on booksized bills they received only an hour earlier and exhausted staff members are drafting sloppy legislation full of inconsistencies that will never be corrected , is no time to start big new projects if the lawmakers feel thwarted , they should put pressure on their leaders to conduct business in a more reasonable way next year
the other day roger corman was having difficulty on the set the movie was overdrive , an action thriller starring robert wagner and steve guttenberg as a race car driver whose skills at the wheel get him in and out of a lot of trouble it was our last day at the track , and we had a little problem because we use multiple cameras , mr corman said at the track \? for the man often referred to as the king of b movies , many of them made in several days on sets you could practically spit across , the mention of camera crews at a race track somehow sounds odd one might even say it casts aspersions on all those gangster , western , rock , hotrod , science fiction and horror films churned out on the cheap in the 1950 s and 60 s times have changed the very low budgets and short schedules i worked with are no longer acceptable to the audience , said mr corman , the 70yearold producer and director who helped the likes of jack nicholson and francis ford coppola get their starts we must move up to give them something more these days , in fact , there really are no b movies , at least in the old sense from the 1930 s to the 50 s the b s were the poor relatives that filled out the bottom of double bills and later moved out on their own in theaters and driveins now b movie generally describes straighttovideo grist that heavy renters pick up along with a features beyond that , the meaning blurs it s a word not much used in hollywood , mr corman said they just say lowbudget film or independent film or exploitation film by that definition , the trashiest fodder lands in the same pew as the english patient more precisely , b movies are genre films the genres still hold action adventure , the suspense thriller , science fiction and horror , mr corman said the difference is that they are bigger and better now exploitational \? certainly b movies plagiarize freely , but since when did hollywood not cannibalize its own \? at least many b movie makers do it with wit , a sense of fun and tongue in cheek remember , too , that originality can play hob with sixfigure budgets late last month , mr corman s company , concordenew horizons , released the death artist on tape , a nicely campy film starring justine bateman and anthony michael hall as a young fellow who earns fame as a sculptor by plastering over corpses corman fans will recognize it as a remake of his 1959 bucket of blood last year the company also made carnosaur 3 primal species , an action epic about dinosaurs run amok that may copy jurassic park but does n't look half bad for maybe onehundredth of the cost and to prove that a corman movie can be as cuddly as the next producer s , there was looking for trouble , about a young boy and a carnival elephant that rivals bill murray and larger than life for cozy family fun carnosaur 3 played in theaters , as do about onethird of the dozen movies concordenew horizons makes every year in 1996 three films had what the company calls limited regional theatrical release wasp woman , a remake of a 1959 corman film about a woman who discovers that insect venom stops aging but turns her homicidal shopping , about british youths looting fancy stores , and black rose of harlem , a 1920 s story about a jazz singer \( cynda williams \) and a gangster \( nick cassavetes \) other films went right to the video store or to roger corman presents on showtime the term b movie may rate cast , content and boxoffice performance \( some hitconscious video dealers regard any movie that makes under 5 million as a b movie \) , but to most viewers the label is about quality that s a sore subject with film makers danny kopels , president of the small independent rocket pictures , notes that many hollywood films , particularly thrillers , are nothing more than genre movies dressed up by big money last summer he introduced mr corman to a convention in las vegas it was a week after 'independence day' opened , he said i pointed out to the audience that roger corman has probably made two dozen 'independence day s in his career , which probably had better scripts , better story lines , but not better production values because he does n't quite have those budgets to play with mr corman makes no claims about quality , but he does say that a sea change in the old b movie has been brought about by the huge amounts of production money spent by the studios that has forced him to increase his own outlay , if not exactly to keep pace then to lose some of the lowbudget look overdrive costabout 2 million to make , a good amount by old corman standards much of the money goes to capture mr guttenberg exceeding the speed limit for the action films , there s more action , he explained the amount of action audiences would accept in the 1960 s was less than it is now the horror must be more explicit with the old edgar allan poe movies i made with vincent price , the horror was implied now the audience wants to see it , which is a step back in my estimation if there s artistry in a horror film , it s in the indirect approach and in movies with sexual content , even those with a r rating , there will be some nudity where there was none in the 50 s and 60 s in the death mask , which is rated r , the nudity is full frontal but how far can a new look take the lowbudget b s \? these days , video stores stock everlarger quantities of megahits rather than broaden their selections that excludes many smaller titles , which in turn drives away heavy renters mr kopels , though , draws comfort from an earlier age what is the video store but the drivein of the 90 s \?

washington , aug 12 about 20 , 000 pounds of frozen hamburger patties sold across the country by an arkansas company may be contaminated with deadly e coli bacteria , the agriculture department said today the agency said that the meat was distributed in june and early july by numerous retail and wholesale outlets , and that most of it was probably in people s freezers if it had not already been eaten the department learned about the problem from state health officials in colorado , where about 20 people became ill after eating some of the hamburgers in early july we think we 've caught this early , jacque knight , a spokeswoman for the agriculture department s food safety and inspection service , said today she said that no deaths had been reported and that none of the people stricken in colorado had become seriously ill ms knight said the patties had been distributed by hudson foods of rogers , ark , which has announced a recall she said hudson foods had a good record for cleanliness and had been very cooperative in tracing the shipments e coli bacteria are associated with fecal matter and can cause death or severe illness , including bloody diarrhea , especially if the contaminated meat is undercooked in 1993 , four children died in the northwest , and hundreds of other people became violently ill after eating contaminated hamburgers from jack in the box fastfood outlets ms knight said anyone finding the patties in their freezers should take them back to the store for refunds if people have already eaten some of the meat and did not become ill , they probably have no reason to be alarmed , especially if they cooked the burgers thoroughly , she said e coli are very virulent in very small numbers , ms knight said foodsafety experts generally recommend cooking hamburgers so that the meat is at least 160 degrees inside to put it another way , they recommend against rare or mediumrare burgers the suspect hamburger patties are in 48ounce packages labeled hudson beef burgers , individually quick frozen , with the code 156a7 in three pound packages labeled hudson 100 pure beef patties , individually frozen , with the code 156b7 , and in 15pound boxes labeled hudson 60 1 4 beef patties uncooked , individually quick frozen , with the code 155b7 consumers with questions can call \( 800 \) 5354555 in july 1996 , president clinton announced new rules for inspection and controls in the meatprocessing industry the most sweeping changes in a halfcentury , they were intended to do away with the old sniff and poke method used by meat inspectors since the federal meat inspection act was passed in 1907
in the second such accident in two weeks , the last car of a subway train derailed at a switch early yesterday in brooklyn , leaving four people injured and the car itself damaged beyond repair even as officials began examining yesterday s accident , which involved a southbound no 2 train leaving the franklin avenue station , investigators said they believed the earlier crash in harlem was most likely caused by human error on the part of a track worker that accident , on july 3 , left 15 people injured yesterday s crash was more likely caused by a mechanical problem , investigators said , though no official determination had been made in either case about 1 15 am yesterday , the 10 cars of the no 2 train were making the turn south toward the president street station on the leg of the line that leads to flatbush avenue most of the train , nine and a half cars , made the turn but the last four wheels did not make the switch , traveling east on the line underneath eastern parkway the issue is what caused the last four wheels , the rear truck , to stay on the wrong track , said jared lebow , a spokesman for the new york city transit authority he said the driver and the conductor underwent routine drug testing as part of the investigation the spokesman said the train was traveling about 15 miles per hour when it crossed over the switch , one of 1 , 700 switches in the system in the july 3 wreck , which involved an a train , the train had been traveling about 35 miles per hour , resulting in more injuries and more damage to the car investigators at the national transportation safety board said yesterday that in the first accident , near 135th street , there had been a switching problem reported on a parallel track and that a repairman had been working on it around the time of the accident maybe he was working on the switch on the parallel track and bumped the switch on the track where accident occurred , said keith holloway , a spokesman for the board we are looking at human error as a cause mr holloway said some of the mechanical equipment was still being tested , but the switch on the a train track where the derailing occurred was working correctly the board was not taking part in the new investigation leroy b spivey , the transit authority s vice president for system safety , said the results of the two accidents were similar in that the trains diverged after crossing a switch , but he said it would be premature to rule on the cause of either accident but other officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that yesterday s accident appeared to be a mechanical problem involving the track and the switches none of the 120 passengers was in the last 51foot car when it jumped the rail and hit a graffiticovered , concrete protective wall the impact shattered some of the thin concrete and left what looked like a giant karate chop in the middle of the car , bowing it slightly suddenly we heard a big noise boom ! said jean pintro , who had been returning from his job as a doorman in manhattan mr pintro , 27 , one of two men treated and released at kings county hospital , said he slid off his seat and banged his head he said that for nearly two hours , the passengers , who were taken into the first five cars , were told repeatedly that they would be evacuated from the darkened tunnel but he said rescuers did not get everyone out until 3 am siyani wiggins , a 19yearold returning from a recording session in manhattan , had been trying to walk between cars when the train derailed he said he was thrown backward and smacked his tail bone he said he sat huddled in the dark fearing the worst , especially after the air conditioning failed and the temperature mounted i was sitting there paranoid like the train might be hijacked , said mr wiggins , who was brought out on a stretcher i was hoping ai n't nobody coming through there to rob me the accident halted all train service to the seven stations on the southern leg of the no 2 and 5 lines for the morning rush hour , the transit authority provided special shuttle buses for the estimated 15 , 000 commuters affected , mr lebow said train service was restored at about 3 15 pm jane paul , a homecare provider who works the overnight shift in new jersey , said she usually arrives in the 42d street station in manhattan at about 10 am and gets to nostrand avenue in brooklyn by 10 45 am it was nearly noon yesterday before she got even close , and she was most upset that the conductor failed to announce which stations would be skipped despite saying the repeated delays were caused by the derailment what is this \? ms paul said why did n't the driver say anything \? in order to liberate the train with the derailed car , transit workers had to push the ninth and tenth cars back out onto the track running under eastern parkway because the 10th car had bowed , it would have ripped into the platforms it passed , so transit workers sliced it apart with torches the switches involved in the accident are moved by the control tower at the utica avenue station each train driver signals the tower when the switches need to be moved , which is done with electric buttons that trigger air cylinders the switches at this point are mechanically similar to those at 135th street in that once a train is on them , they can only be moved to make sure they are locked in place they cannot be reversed after the wreck , the only immediately visible mechanical damage was one 39foot piece of rail that had abrasions on it and had to be replaced , as well as one signal that had been knocked over , said mark a yanche , a senior official in charge of track repair at the transit authority photos transit workers laboring to restore the no 2 train to service the train s last car derailed yesterday morning , leaving four people injured \( william lopez the new york times \) the derailment of a no 2 train early yesterday morning halted all train service to the seven stations on the southern leg of the no 2 and 5 lines in brooklyn for 14 hours lea white directed commuters to buses \( john sotomayor the new york times \) \( pg b6 \) diaram a closer look where the train derailed the last car of a no 2 train approaching the president street station in brooklyn yesterday jumped the track 1 200 feet north of the station , nine of ten cars moving at about 15 miles per hour switched tracks 2 early yesterday morning , the back wheels of the tenth car did not switch tracks , continuing eastward this car hit a concrete protective wall four people were injured \( source transit authority \) \( pg b6 \) map of brooklyn showing location of president st station \( pg b6 \)
as the trading deadline approaches at 3 pm today , some rangers fret and some are unconcerned we have n't talked about it at all , wayne gretzky said after scoring one of the new york goals in last night s costly 43 loss to the ottawa senators at madison square garden it has n't been a distraction , said mark messier while gretzky and messier probably do n't need to worry about a telephone call from neil smith , the president and general manager , others , like defenseman ulf samuelsson , are less sanguine you always have your suitcase ready , he said last night s result ended the rangers' threegame winning streak and left them at 52 in their last seven games it also cost them ground in the chase for fourth place and homeice advantage in the eastern conference playoffs because florida defeated the devils , the panthers increased their lead over the fifthplace rangers to 5 points both teams have 11 games remaining the fourth and fifthplace teams meet in the first round the one with the better record gets homeice advantage in the meantime , samuelsson probably does n't need to worry about being traded , either although the rangers are deep on defense , at least one of their regulars is not doing well aleksandr karpovtsev , samuelsson s regular defense partner , did not play much late in the game on his way out of the locker room last night , karpovtsev said his sore back is getting worse now i feel pain , karpovtsev said pain shooting down my legs pain in my back pain in my groin asked if he would have to take a few games off , karpovtsev replied no i have to play the team needs me the rangers need more than a healthy karpovtsev especially on the forward lines but they probably wo n't get it because smith said again last night that he will not trade youth for experience and will probably not trade his top draft choice , either with luc robitaille out for at least four weeks with a broken foot bone and aleksei kovalev gone for the season with knee surgery , coach colin campbell will most likely have to mix and match his four forward lines campbell shuffled them last night and the team responded , coming from behind twice to tie the game , once from a twogoal deficit , once from one down gretzky , who is out of his goalscoring slump , got his 20th adam graves got his 29th , and patrick flatley his eighth but the rangers also got a rare bad game from goalie mike richter , their most valuable player most of the season richter accidentally helped create the first ottawa goal by shaun van allen when his clearing pass took a strange bounce off the glass and landed in senator possession a fluke , richter said the third goal , by tom chorske , came on a slap shot from near center ice that traveled between the goalie s legs it s going to happen , said richter , who said the puck began to screwball on its 85foot journey to the goal the winning goal , by bruce gardiner , came with 2 minutes 13 seconds left in regulation after richter blocked aleksei yashin s shot but let a long rebound into the slot as shawn mceachern of ottawa jostled with brian leetch i thought it was interference , richter said he was holding brian s stick a little but he pushed me forward the other goal , by radek bonk , was scored while the senators were shorthanded gretzky , new york s best player last night , tied the score at 33 at 15 08 with a slap shot from high in the leftwing circle that beat goalie ron tugnutt high on the glove side , one of his gamehigh eight shots on goal it was gretzky s fourth goal in the last 10 games after a 21game drought through the third quarter of the season besides the goal , gretzky had several sparkling moments one came earlier in the third period , when he won a faceoff in the leftwing circle by slapping the puck against the near boards , chasing it down himself and passing to the blue line to set up a good shot had the rangers scored on that play , he would have deserved two assists we 've had some tough losses , gretzky said this ranks up there campbell said the rangers lost , in part , because of four tough goals and because sloppy things happened and because we got a little carried away with gambling he did not like the way the rangers tried to move the puck through the ottawa trap you 've got to have some patience , campbell said when they say , 'red rover , ' you ca n't come over every time messier , who was on the ice for ottawa s three evenstrength goals , did not seem too concerned we got caught trying too hard to win the game and it backfired on us , messier said if anything , we might have been a little too anxious afterward , smith vowed not to trade young players or prospects , as has been his history i guess niklas sundstrom is safe , smith said so too might be daniel goneau , christian dube and dan cloutier , who are working their way up through the system asked if the rangers have any deals pending , smith said there are three or four possibilities and they could all fall through none of them are earthshattering would he consider trading the team s no 1 draft choice , as he has in the past \? you never say never , smith said i would doubt it very much at 3 o'clock i become just one of the fans photos ron tugnutt blocking a shot by the rangers' niklas sundstrom during the senators' victory last night at the garden tugnutt made 38 saves \( barton

washington , april 24 there was no lack of words flowing from the senate today as the final vote on the chemical weapons convention neared here are three samples trent lott republican of mississippi and the majority leader in a very real sense , the credibility of commitments made by two presidents one republican and one democrat is at stake i will vote for the convention because the judgment of the most senior former and current military commanders believe it will make our soldiers , sailors , airmen and marines more safe in potential battlefields and less likely to face the horrible prospect of chemical weapons i will vote for the convention because i believe the united states is marginally better off with it than without it it will provide new tools to press signatories for compliance it will enable us to gain access to sites and information we are currently unable to examine along with many of my colleagues , i have expressed grave doubts about the wisdom of president clinton s approach now , however , we will have an opportunity to fully debate this policy and this treaty joseph r biden jr democrat of delaware the debate we are commencing is not only about a global treaty which addresses the chemical weapons threat it is about nothing less than america s leadership role in the postcoldwar era over the course of two decades and three administrations , the united states has led the world in developing a comprehensive treaty designed to outlaw chemical weapons now , less than a week before that treaty takes effect with or without the united states the world watches as the senate faces a fundamental choice will we remain in the forefront of the battle to contain weapons of mass destruction the preeminent security threat of this era or will we retreat from the challenge \? why do we need this treaty \? the answer is very simple we cannot contain the threat of chemical weapons on our own jesse helms republican of north carolina and foreign relations chairman of course i will be disappointed if the senate votes tonight to ratify the cwc but i find some solace in the fact that , thanks to our efforts , this treaty is much less harmful than it would have been make no mistake this is a dangerous treaty but it is a little less dangerous thanks to the efforts we made to amend it , and deliver the truth to the american people last september treaty proponents were pressing the senate to vote on a treaty that had none of the key protections that some of us succeeded in inserting in this treaty had we not been a phalanx of common sense standing in their way , the exact same treaty would have been before the senate for ratification today , and that would have been a disaster the treaty before the senate tonight was toned down with 28 conditions those include , among many others , conditions that limit the cost of the treaty to the american taxpayer , place safeguards on intelligence sharing , enhance our chemical defenses , and protect confidential business information
baseball traditionalists , as marginalized in the sports world as liberals are on the political front , must have spent the last month or so wondering if the game they love as currently constructed would exist next year , let alone in the 21st century after all , a fever to tear up the leagues and start over was in the air , realignment so radical it would have made the chicago seven blush but just when it seemed that this traditioneating monster was out of control , baseball reeled in the dr frankensteins who would remake the game these agents of change , a number of clubs now seem ready to say , badly underestimated the timehonored roll calls that make baseball special baseball owners have rediscovered that leagues do matter so , too , does the lineage of each team , especially the original 16 franchises , the grand dames of the grand old game that history , those traditions within cities , within leagues , assure easy identification , allowing baseball fans to get into october without road maps precisely because what they knew from childhood remains intact that comfort zone not found in other sports where tiers of confusing playoff formats muddy the picture seemed in grave danger for most of the summer fortunately , some of the biggest traditionalists turned out to be baseball owners themselves that is why executives who once bandied about proposals that would have put 15 teams on the move next season are now retreating to the drawing boards instead of considering a plan under which seven national league franchises and eight american league franchises would change leagues , now only 10 might switch leagues , four from the national league and six from the american good tradition should count more than expediency and the moves that would have caused storied franchises to be dispossessed and repackaged along geographic lines was being considered for reasons of expediency , to be sure the argument went that radical change was being considered to satisfy the fans whose appetites for regional rivalries were whetted by interleague play but that argument never rang true this has never been about satisfying fans , or nurturing or building on traditions no , this was about television , an industry that wants a game that requires no clock to stay within the boundaries of prime time if you think not , consider the recent words of jerry colangelo , the owner of the fledgling arizona diamondbacks , about a proposal to realign into divisions based on time zones the networks love the concept , he said it would make so much difference in terms of time zones , having the games on tv at a decent hour it makes so much common sense it s ridiculous delivering baseball to fans at a decent hour does make sense but at what cost \? that question , thankfully , occurred to enough owners to stop proposals before they ever came close to a formal vote now , with the owners set to meet in three weeks , this coolingoff period for radical realigners could ultimately become a total freezeout now no one pretends that protecting tradition is the only factor in changing the tide toward a more conservative approach the mets are said to be very reluctant to join the yankees in the american league because they do n't want to have to match george steinbrenner s spending binges and the cubs do n't want to wind up with the white sox and play the crosstown team an inordinate number of times because one superstation in chicago televises both games still , pride and heritage apparently have counted for something especially to the cincinnati reds , the pittsburgh pirates and the atlanta braves founding father franchises of the national league who were unsettled by the prospect of moving to the american league those teams were joined by at least four other national league clubs in radicalrealignment resistance that included the mets whose reluctance to compare bank books with the yankees nicely dovetails with a national league reluctance to abandon new york city , a traditional nl hotbed again now none of the four seems in danger of having to change leagues even steinbrenner , the owner of the most storied franchise in the american league , a man who seemingly has no low gears , has cautioned his fellow owners to go slow steinbrenner has n't bitten at the prospect of playing the mets 16 times a tantalizing prospect in the narrow big apple view as opposed to playing downandout teams like the twins , a s and royals but perhaps steinbrenner , one of the league s senior owners , understands better than most that rivalries can be cyclical what is unattractive today can be a prime draw tomorrow remember , it was n't that long ago that players like george brett , jose canseco and kirby puckett were boxoffice draws here while the yankees had to schedule giveaways to attract fans to see the nowmighty mariners only the leagues have remained constants hopefully that will never change
detroit , may 22 game 4 of its western conference final series with detroit would be , the colorado avalanche insisted , a true indicator of the team s strength and savvy it would rank as a return to the brand of playoff hockey that brought the stanley cup to colorado a year ago the avalanche players were left to reexamine not only themselves and their proclamations , but also a stunning detroit club after the red wings demolished colorado , 60 , tonight at joe louis arena the victory , featuring more of the mashing defense \( starring vladimir konstantinov \) and sterling goaltending \( mike vernon , again \) that have been detroit s hallmarks against the avalanche , gave detroit a 31 lead in the fourofseven series heading into game 5 on saturday at denver the game also marked a return to the ugly fisticuffs that dominated the two teams' meeting in detroit on march 26 , when even vernon and avalanche goalie patrick roy squared off the third period tonight dissolved into a parade of fights and major penalties , infractions totaling 204 minutes even the coaches squabbled scotty bowman of detroit and marc crawford of colorado could be seen jawing angrily as sparring players were separated , and infractions sorted , by referee paul devorski he was pretty emotional , bowman said , referring to the 36yearold crawford his eyes were coming out of his head , so i guess he was pretty excited crawford said obviously , emotions got a little out of whack you say some stupid things he said some stupid things on the ice , and before the fighting , most of the night s higher emotions centered on the red wings the red wings were merciless against colorado at both ends of the ice detroit stormed to a 20 first period lead on a pair of goals by igor larionov , then made it 50 in the second period on goals by slava kozlov , sergei fedorov and kirk maltby larionov , normally a reticent shooter , ripped two early goals past roy , the first coming on a power play at 1 minute 52 seconds from a spot behind and to the right of the net , larionov attempted to send a centering pass to martin lapointe but the puck deflected off the skate of colorado s aleksei gusarov and past roy for a goal that put detroit on top , 10 larionov scored again , at 7 15 , on a backhand shot from the hash marks outside the right circle led by konstantinov , who doled out bonecrushing checks , the red wings played a furious second period in building a 50 lead maltby s second goal of the night came early in the third period , completing the scoring and helping the 34yearold vernon to a shutout and another victory in what has been a remarkable string of playoff performances for roy , game 4 proved a far different story the avalanche goalie had said before the game that detroit had not shown that it could pay the price necessary to win the cup , or to beat the avalanche roy , however , was nowhere to be found in the third period as detroit poured it on he had been dismissed following the second period because , crawford said , of a charley horse in his left leg detroit outshot colorado by 3819 in the game and by 142 in the first period as the avalanche took five consecutive minor penalties against none for the red wings that imbalance , and perhaps the frustration of finding his team in the hole so quickly , caused roy to verbally strafe devorski , earning the goalie a 10minute misconduct penalty forty minutes after the 3 1 2hour game had ended , roy limped stifflegged through the joe louis arena concourse , his lowered head , inaudible voice and painful gait a perfect metaphor for the circumstance in which the avalanche players , last year s national hockey league champions , find themselves today photo the crowd cheering the unassisted goal of kirk maltby of detroit \( reuters \)
hopes to be the first balloonists to make a nonstop voyage around the world were dashed yesterday for the three crewmen of a british balloon when its loss of lift forced them to land in the sahara after less than a day aloft when they began to lose altitude , the crew tried to maintain height by throwing out ballast and then heavy objects , but to no avail when the crew tried to jettison an external fuel tank they found it had jammed , and one of them , alex ritchie , wearing a parachute , climbed outside the crew capsule and freed the tank we owe a debt of gratitude to alex , richard branson , the captain , said after the balloon landed in the algerian desert he saved our lives mr branson , 46 , is chairman of the virgin group of companies , which owns virgin airways none of the crew members were injured in the landing , and the valuable crew capsule , packed with expensive equipment , escaped serious damage the project director for the flight , michael kendrick , said in london that the cause of the failure had not been determined two other balloon teams , one swiss and one american , are preparing their own attempts to fly around the world , with prospects of launching this weekend despite unremitting failures by many aeronauts in the last decade , longduration balloonists with the necessary financial backing of many millions of dollars continue to vie for the last great goal of lighterthanair aviation a nonstop circuit of the globe dr bertrand piccard , a swiss psychiatrist and cocaptain of the breitling orbiter balloon , said by telephone yesterday that he and his fellow pilot , wim verstraeten , expected to launch their balloon from chateau d'oex , switzerland , on sunday their expected route would take them over greece , turkey and then over asia the american contender , steve fossett , expects to lift off about the same time from busch stadium in st louis mr fossett , unlike his competitors , will fly alone in an unpressurized crew capsule in a similar attempt last year , he was forced to land after flying from south dakota to eastern canada on tuesday the british balloon , the 195foothigh virgin global challenger , rose from an airfield near marrakesh , morocco , and headed eastward at 30 , 000 feet but after crossing the border into algeria , the balloon , flown by mr branson , per lindstrand and mr ritchie , began to lose altitude the balloon was apparently not damaged by a rather rough launching , but nevertheless seemed to have lost helium asked whether the problem might have resulted from miscalculation of the balloon s lift versus weight , mr kendrick said all possibilities were being studied he said he could not predict whether mr branson and his team would make another attempt next year during the winter ballooning season i suppose it would depend on how our competitors do , he said you know richard he never wants to be second in anything
for a chief executive , charles r rinehart has long been unusually glum about the prospects of the company he runs his new recipe for success buy another company that is in just as bad a position and dismiss thousands of redundant employees mr rinehart heads h f ahmanson company , the largest savings and loan institution in the country late monday it made an unsolicited offer to buy the great western financial corporation , the country s secondlargest savings institution , for stock worth 66 billion but there is little profit in the traditional savings and loan business of making mortgage loans with money raised from certificates of deposit , and this deal will not change those economics nor will it eliminate the tens of billions of dollars in loans the two companies made in the late 1980 s to finance california homes now worth far less than the mortgage balances due mr rinehart hopes that the combined companies can move more quickly toward being more like banks , expanding offerings to include checking accounts , consumer loans and business services most of all , he hopes to close 201 branches , primarily in california , and eliminate 400 million a year in expenses ahmanson declined to say how many people would lose their jobs should the deal go through but as a rule of thumb , analysts said , since the company declared that it would shed 45 percent of great western s annual expenses , the same proportion or 6 , 300 of its 14 , 400 jobs will disappear in a very unusual tactic , all of those job cuts would come at the expense of great western employees in a voicemail message to ahmanson employees yesterday , mr rinehart said that none of them would lose their jobs or receive reduced responsibilities as a result of the acquisition the policy in most mergers is to choose the best person from either company for each job we felt we had to dance with the ones that brung us , mr rinehart said yesterday , adding that most companies do not do enough to motivate and reward their employees if consummated , the deal would combine two institutions that financed the construction of many of the sunny suburbs that blanketed southern california after world war ii ahmanson s home savings of america built monolithic , muralclad bank branches amid the new developments great western emphasized cowboy imagery in its ads , with john wayne and later dennis weaver as spokesmen but as it did for the cowboy , the sun is setting on the savings and loan both great western and ahmanson are making far fewer new mortgage loans than they used to perhaps the best indicator that an era has ended two weeks ago , great western said it would end its cowboy ads and dismiss dennis weaver so it could have a more modern image for most of the last two decades shares of the two savings companies have traded within about 1 of each other but in the last year , ahmanson has surged ahead on friday , ahmanson shares closed at 4050 , 18 percent more than great western s share price of 3425 the gap reflects the rising confidence of investors in mr rinehart and ahmanson s strategy and their increasing frustration with the slow progress made by great western under its chief , john f maher ahmanson s management has shown they are very smart , very aggressive and interested in increasing shareholder value above all else , said thomas o 'donnell , an analyst with smith barney he praised ahmanson s costcutting , stock buyback plan and purchase of 61 former first interstate bancorporation branches that were sold after that bank s acquisition by wells fargo company investors have criticized great western for being slow to cut costs the increase in the relative price of ahmanson s stock helped give it the power to make an offer that great western should find too good to refuse ahmanson offered to exchange 105 of its shares for each share of great western based on ahmanson s stock price friday , that made the offer worth 4253 a share wall street embraced the prospects of a merger , running ahmanson s stock up by 4375 , to 44875 that means its offer to great western shareholders is now worth 4711 a share great western s stock jumped 10625 a share , to 44875 the success of ahmanson s bid will largely turn on whether other companies emerge with higher bids for great western in theory , great western represents the best way for a big banking company to enter california but many analysts and investment bankers feel that the huge weight of the lowyielding mortgages on great western s books will ultimately scare off most big banks most eyes on wall street turned to washington mutual inc , the acquisitive savings institution based in seattle when the company moved into california last year by buying american savings bank , washington mutual s chairman , kerry killinger , said it would like to buy more california companies analysts read that as a nonetoosubtle reference to great western yet it would take a leap for washington mutual to outbid ahmanson it could close some duplicate branches , but great western has more overlap with ahmanson moreover , mr killinger has said that any acquisition must raise pershare earnings by 10 percent in the first year analysts said that the price he would have to pay to outbid ahmanson would not meet that target a spokesman for washington mutual said only that the company wanted to continue to grow in california and was studying its options most analysts said yesterday that it was unlikely great western would remain independent because the pressure from shareholders to sell to someone would be too great graph strategic fit shows what each company would bring to the proposed combination of hf ahmanson and great western financial \( source hf ahmanson \) \( pg d10 \)
villa maria del triunfo , peru , april 26 it would probably be safer for them not to say anything at all , but any worker or child who is asked will tell you where nestor cerpa cartolini s body rests in this slum south of lima the body of mr cerpa , the marxist rebel leader who was killed on tuesday when government commandos stormed the japanese ambassador s residence and rescued 71 hostages , lies at the top of a steep , parched hill , under the constant watch of the police as mourners from another funeral make their way down , some touch the black cross over his shallow , stony grave they cross themselves and kiss their fingertips oh , there s nestor , one woman whispered , not breaking her stride poor man , her companion said now , you can rest at the cemetery , nobody ever bothered carving steps into the hillside , and so mourners tread carefully down , digging their heels sideways into the dirt and stone the graves here are shallow and too small to accommodate a coffin one mourner , his senses dulled by liquor , slid and tumbled down the hill after a funeral a crowd of other mourners burst out laughing and lost their footing , in a sudden freeforall of spinning bodies that went crashing into crosses and graves you call this human rights , a poor man said , shaking his head the body of the 43yearold rebel arrived here on thursday just after nightfall , when the work of ordinary gravediggers had ended for the day it was accompanied by three police cars an hour later , neighborhood residents said , the body of one of mr cerpa s comrades , also killed in the raid , arrived the comrade s body now lies a few feet away in an unmarked grave , a steel cross thrown over the spot in editorial and government offices down on level ground , mr cerpa is overwhelmingly reviled as a terrorist who merited the allout assault that killed him and the 13 other rebels after a fourmonth siege but here where the poor and disenfranchised bury their dead , a different symbolism and morality prevail i do n't see why they had to kill them all , said a shopkeeper , who had heard reports that several younger rebels were killed after having thrown down their weapons and surrendered the reports of executions appeared among japanese hostages who returned home as well as among those in peru agriculture minister rodolfo munante made such a report but later denied his own televised description of a young rebel who surrendered but was gunned down president alberto k fujimori has said there were no summary executions , but few in this neighborhood believe him any person , knowing that they 're about to die , would repent , the shopkeeper said and as long as they 're alive , they can change she agreed that the president had the right to order the raid on the compound , saying , there were innocent people in there , and they had families that were suffering each day they were held and she said the unrestrained violence of the maoist shining path , another rebel group , before mr fujimori took over , had made people afraid to go to work downtown but for most people who stopped by her shop , mr cerpa , the leader of the tupac amaru revolutionary movement , was not in the same class as the shining path , she said if he were , he would have stuck to his threat at the start of the siege to kill hostages he was not a terrorist , she said he was a revolutionary the band of youths he led in the siege seemed naive one had asked a hostage whether it was possible to walk back to peru from cuba , where the captors had been offered asylum i'm poor , but i have thoughts and feelings , too , the shopkeeper repeated several times mr fujimori maintains that the rebels have no popular base of support , but , in seeming contradiction , has scattered their remains and identified only two of the 14 killed , saying he wanted to avoid political demonstrations at their gravesides people here suspect that the bodies , if exhumed as the families have requested , would show signs of mutilation or desecration a day after the commando raid , mr fujimori returned to the house with government cameras rolling and was photographed near the headless , armless body of a dead rebel villa maria del triunfo is , historically , built on the bloody secrets of an iron hand one worker and longtime resident said that before it was a neighborhood , villa maria was a clandestine cemetery for the victims of government tortures and executions he remembers children , too poor to own toys , playing in the streets with the crosses they had pulled up from graves mr cerpa s grave carries a framed picture showing a silver icon with a figure of jesus , inscribed our lord of justice , and a note from his family and many flowers his unknown comrade , buried nearby , had only a few blooms from a pink gladiolus a young girl reached down and took some yellow mums from a plastic soda bottle that was serving as a vase you have so many , and your comrade has none , she said over mr cerpa s grave put those back , ordered a man in a tshirt who stood nearby but he wo n't miss them , she said his family brought them , the man said let the other one s family bring flowers , then since the other rebel was unidentified , that was clearly impossible , but nobody argued instead , they backed away the man said he was paid by the family to guard the tomb his colleague poured water over the dusty flowers cemetery workers said later that the only surveillance was provided by the police one woman remained , her face set in anger , speaking low so as not to be overheard he fought for us , for the poor , she said , turning her face from the police look at how we live look at how we die photo relatives of nestor cerpa cartolini , the rebel leader killed in

i was startled to read the article entitled censoring books is a bad idea in the june 22 long island weekly , authored by barbara bernstein , who is the executive director of the nassau chapter of the new york civil liberties union briefly , ms bernstein s article relates to a levittown school superintendent s removal of a book that he deemed unappropriate from a middle school s reading course the book was not removed from the library , thus it is still available to be read by any student whether or not the superintendent exercised good or bad judgment is debateable but for ms bernstein to charge that the the decision looks very much like censorship seems to be a very shaky stretch of the imagination because the superintendent clearly has the authority to take the action he took now let s contrast this very iffy charge of censorship with an unmistakably blatant case of censorship that the very same civil liberties union attempted to help perpetrate on the taxpayers of nassau county again briefly , approximately seven years ago a very courageous parent by the name of frank russo learned through his children that nassau community college teaches a course in human sexuality that appeared to have pornographic content mr russo , under the auspices of new york state s freedom of information laws , and exercising his rights as both a parent and a taxpayer at this taxpayerfunded public institution , first requested , then was forced to demand , to see all of the materials such as films , videotapes , audio material , etc , used in the course the college was so proud of these materials that it arrogantly refused his requests by invoking the rationale that to do so would be a violation of academic freedom mr russo immediately filed suit in new york state supreme court to force the college to disclose the material after a fiveyear odyssey in the state court system , the state s highest court , the court of appeals , in 1993 ruled unanimously in the case known as russo v nassau community college , that under freedom of information laws the public does indeed have the right to see all of the course materials in all public schools in new york state from kindergarten through graduate school parents always assumed that they inherently had these rights mr russo s courageous actions now transform this assumption into state law ironically , this triumph of the public s right to know versus nassau community college s right to censor totally backfired on the college this state decision is now being cited in state courts all over the united states as a landmark case against censorship now guess who filed an amicus curiae \( friend of the court \) brief with the court of appeals on behalf of the college s position to help abet the college in its attempt at censorship \? none other than the new york civil liberties union with the full knowledge and approval of ms bernstein thus , when i read her article i felt compelled to expose this glaring and unfathomable inconsistency on the union s part and its nassau chapter chairwoman ms bernstein , i agree that censoring books is a bad idea but censoring a parent s right to know what is being taught to his her children in a public institution of higher education is infinitely worse william schroeder rockville centre

after five decades of incremental growth through a series of adjoining limestone and brownstone town houses on the upper east side of manhattan , the council on foreign relations is poised to build a new midblock structure that would serve as a study center and conference hall the lshaped building would replace a bedraggled and denuded town house at 50 east 68th street , between park and madison avenues , and wrap around to fill the rear yards of nos 50 , 52 and 54 , all of which are owned by the council the front of the building would be five stories high , lining up with its neighbors , and the rear would have one story and a cellar , with a 2 , 100squarefoot conference room , library , kitchen and pantry over all , the construction project would cost 10 million , which includes refurbishing the existing buildings half that amount has been pledged by peter g peterson , the former secretary of commerce , who is chairman of both the council and the blackstone group , an investment banking firm the new building is to be named in his honor this is principally to better serve our members and secondarily to improve the neighborhood in which we live , said leslie h gelb , president of the council to the outside world , the council presents a stately face in keeping with its image as an intellectual hub of international affairs elegant , tasteful and so discreet that its name does not even appear on the italian renaissance doorway at 58 east 68th street , the main entrance into its complex inside is a different story it s a warren of scholarship , said byron bell of belllarson architects and planners , designers of the new building up a few stairs down a few stairs around a corner conditions are so crowded that one office has been fashioned around the hearth of an old fireplace a laser printer has no place else to sit but on the landing of a stairwell and when events draw a large crowd , the 151st person is out of luck because of the legal capacity of the david rockefeller room , the largest in the house of particular concern to the council is its ability to attract and keep the scholars , known as fellows , who make up its studies department , write books and articles and organize study groups and roundtable discussions some of the offices are quaint but not functional for someone who is effectively going to live there , mr gelb said another concern is the limited size of the existing public rooms , strained to bursting when a prominent figure like yasir arafat makes an appearance those who cannot fit in the rockefeller room must sit across the hall and watch the proceedings on video monitors we want conference spaces to hold the people we bring in in one room , not three , said michael p peters , senior vice president of the council the council settled at 68th street and park avenue in 1945 , after harriet barnes pratt gave her mansion to the organization her husband , harold irving pratt , an heir to the oilrefining fortune of charles pratt , had been a council member the pratt house , no 58 , was built in 1919 and expanded in 1954 next door is no 54 , a brownstone that was given a french renaissance limestone facade and a twostory mansard roof the next house , no 52 , retains a brownstone front and also has a later beaux arts bay window no 50 was built in 1878 but has been so stripped of features that its style is officially described by the landmarks preservation commission as none the commission will review the council s plans on march 25 , as the buildings are within the upper east side historic district the new facade would be in limestone , to complement its neighbors it would also pick up such details from the pratt house as a rooftop balustrade and scallopshell ornamentation the secondfloor windows would be gently arched , and the entry would be recessed , with 10foot columns flanking the vestibule the landmarks committee of community board 8 gave its approval monday night to the new facade design and the demolition of no 50 but it recommended that the full board disapprove the rear addition , which is on its agenda tonight that central garden , those rear yards are very much an integral part of the character of upper east side historic districts , said elizabeth ashby , cochairwoman of the committee so we could n't support that but shelly s friedman of friedman gotbaum , a lawyer for the council , said the rearyard addition was permitted under zoning rules , which give more latitude to community facilities like scholarly and cultural institutions moreover , mr friedman said , other zoning controls had effectively preempted expansion upward or outward the path of least resistance is to develop the rear yard , he said photo the council on foreign relations' four buildings on east 68th street \( jack manning the new york times \)
in the last year , the widespread use of combinations of new and older drugs has changed the face of aids , promising to transform a fatal infection to a manageable chronic disease there are several combinations , many that include the new protease inhibitors , or antiviral drugs all can drive the amount of hiv , the aids virus , below the levels of detection in the blood for up to 18 months , which is as long as testing has been done with such therapy , some individuals have left their death beds and many who were less seriously ill are leading more normal lives the good news is that there are a bunch more smiling faces in my clinic today than were there a year or two ago , said dr julio montaner , an aids expert in vancouver , british columbia but for an unknown number of other people , the drugs are failing for them , combination therapy is another in a long list of bitter disappointments after the initial flush of success , many important problems and questions have emerged among those cited in interviews with 20 experts were these has publicity about the initial wave of success created unrealistic expectations about a therapy for which longterm effectiveness and safety are unknown \? is the therapy failing some people because they took the wrong combinations , before doctors fully understood how the drugs should be prescribed \? can an aidsdamaged immune system ever be restored to normal \? are health officials doing enough to monitor strains of hiv that have become resistant to new therapies \? these are among the problems and questions that 21 , 000 experts will discuss at a fiveday scientific meeting on aids that starts in washington on wednesday , along with perhaps the biggest question in the minds of everyone with aids can the disease be cured \? although no one has accurate numbers on how many people use combination therapies , it is estimated that among the roughly 750 , 000 people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus , tens of thousands of people in the united states are using them and there is no question that many doctors' practices have changed dramatically dr jeffrey b greene said that he had been making house calls on dying patients too sick to come to his office about twice a month in the 13 years he has been treating aids in manhattan i have not made a house call in six months , dr greene said it s pretty incredible at case western reserve university hospitals of cleveland , dr michael m lederman said that on average , about 8 of the 650 patients in the hospitals' aids clinics died each month over the last three years but the number of the hospitals' aids deaths has fallen in recent months and in december , for the first time , there were none dr chris m tsoukas , an aids expert at mcgill university in montreal , said the new therapies had contributed to about a 50 percent decline in the daily number of aids patients at several hospitals in canada dr tsoukas said that his team cared for about 1 , 000 people infected with hiv , and that each day in recent years 8 to 16 of them were in the hospital but , dr tsoukas added , for the first time in the 14 years that i have been practicing , we have had not had more than three patients in the hospital in a single month clearly , the era of treating hiv with a single drug is over , and the new combinations appear to be the most potent therapy developed in the 16year battle against acquired immune deficiency syndrome , experts said but too little time has passed for anyone to know whether the drugs will lose their effectiveness , and after what period , and some experts are concerned that the gains have been oversold as victory against the disease a triumphant attitude has emerged that makes it sound like we are on the verge of solving this whole thing , said dr ronald bayer , a professor at the columbia university school of public health in manhattan dr bayer , who has been interviewing doctors who have treated aids since the disease was identified in 1981 for an oral history project , said the thing that is amazing is how so many have forgotten that we have seen moments of what appeared to be great promise quickly turn to disappointment one example is azt , which , though effective , is not the cure that some people had hoped it would be another is a genetically engineered product known as recombinant cd4 , which failed to have any benefit in clinical trials some patients have not been helped by combination therapies , although again , no clear numbers are available but one reason for some of the failures has become clear some doctors had been tacking a protease inhibitor on to whatever else a patient was taking , a practice that appears not to work in many cases many experts now say at least two drugs that a patient has never taken should be used for initial antihiv treatment or when a switch is made from a failing drug regimen and the drugs must be started simultaneously to avoid drug resistance doctors really did not appreciate that point when protease drugs first became available a year ago , said dr roy m gulick , an expert at new york university thus , he and other doctors said , many patients were started out on a drug regimen that would fail a large number of them
washington , april 8 president clinton is , above all , a man of motion he darts across the country , cramming event upon event well into the night he consoles those afflicted by disaster , beguiles curious audiences and draws energy from the throngs who find magic in a presidential visit in fact , the touring white house has been a hallmark of this presidency and travel was expected to loom ever larger in a second term that has none of the grand legislative goals that characterized mr clinton s first years in office but in the weeks since mr clinton tripped late at night on a staircase outside the home of the golfer greg norman and ripped a tendon from his knee , his injury has slowed the perpetual motion machine that is the clinton presidency and this has posed a predicament because so much of mr clinton s current concept of his job consists of being a circuit rider through the states , urging others to take action , like adopting education standards or employing welfare recipients in this preacher presidency , mr clinton relies heavily on his energy , his travels and physically imposing presence to lend power to his words and make up for his limited ability to sway a republicancontrolled congress he long ago gave up such sweeping legislative plans as health care overhaul and beyond his search for an agreement on balancing the budget , his agenda is more minimalist , geared to a time when voters have lost faith in government activism yet the injured knee has altered the president s pace quite literally after a recent outdoor ceremony at the white house to promote a chemical weapons treaty , mr clinton had to inch slowly on crutches up a driveway to the oval office , past reporters who questioned him along his way at one point , he lifted a crutch and pointed wistfully toward the white house putting green he is barred from using a trip to california that had been planned for late march was scrapped a state visit to mexico has been delayed several weeks into may and combined with a nowcompressed version of what originally was planned as a 10day tour of the caribbean and latin america although mr clinton is to begin traveling again next week in a measured pace that will accelerate with several foreign visits in may , his aides say the white house has mostly shelved more presidential stops in state capitols this spring to promote education standards most state legislatures will be shutting down their sessions by the time the president is expected to be significantly more mobile and aides want to make sure that mr clinton does not risk reinjuring himself by pushing too hard inside the white house , the schedule has changed as well mr clinton begins his work day one hour later , at 10 15 am , after physical therapy , his aides say white house advisers accustomed to a demanding leader with little interest in sleep have had to adjust their scheduling to accommodate the president s somewhat reduced energy level it was particularly noticeable , they say , for the first two weeks , after mr clinton pushed himself to attend a helsinki summit meeting with the russian president , boris n yeltsin , within days of his fall and operation this is a vigorous president and one of the advantages we have is his youth , his vitality , his ability to get things done , and anything that inhibits that is not a positive , a white house aide said unable to move around the country , mr clinton nonetheless has maintained almost daily appearances in and around the white house , making the kinds of smallscale announcements he did during his 1996 campaign on issues that polls show resonate with americans he sent congress legislation to fight fraud and abuse in medicare and medicaid he named a commission to insure health care quality he said he would work to make sure that medicare and medicaid allowed women in their 40 s to follow the national cancer institute s recommendations that they get mammograms every one to two years he announced that california was backing his call for states to adopt education standards white house aides consider such announcements the president s lifeline to the voters and his way to avoid harm from the campaign finance controversies they say that such issues resonate with the public , keeping the president s approval ratings up above 50 percent , thus allowing him to maintain clout with congress yet even some white house officials admit that without the sizzle of an outoftown presidential motorcade and the saturation local coverage this produces , some of the events have not had the afterglow they produce when mr clinton is on the road it s clearly a disadvantage for him , said geoffrey garin , a democratic pollster clinton is at his best when he s able to take the show on the road , and it s probably doubly true now because washington s not a very good place to be associated with now adding to a sense that the president is grounded is the fact that little has happened so far in the negotiations on a balancedbudget agreement , which mr clinton has called the most fundamental issue he is facing for now , white house officials say that mr clinton remains in good humor he has not gained weight , and probably lost a little weight , said michael d mccurry , the white house press secretary he said mr clinton had stayed on a lowfat diet to counter his inactivity and was lifting weights to improve his upper body strength when the president turned up at a georgetown birthday party last friday night for kati marton , the author and journalist , and george stevens jr , the television and movie producer , mr clinton spoke animatedly about president yeltsin and compared injuries with ms marton s husband , richard c holbrooke , the former bosnia peace negotiator mr holbrooke recently tore ligaments in his ankle he described his rehabilitation in impressive specificity , mr holbrooke said he could n't have been more gracious in contrast with his appearance in a wheelchair with mr yeltsin , mr clinton stood for 40 minutes today at a joint news conference with prime minister jean chretien of canada mr clinton has also switched from unadorned steel crutches to black ones that blend in more with his suits and have special gelfilled , shock absorbing grips , tips and arm pads designed by thomas fetterman , a lifelong crutchuser nine out of 10 people buy black , mr fetterman said it s techie , sophisticated and invisible but some of mr clinton s aides worry that , with months to go before the president is fully mobile , the hard times are still ahead , particularly because mr clinton draws his political energy from crowds , especially the enthusiastic throngs that provide a respite from the troubles that plague him in washington he feels trapped here , said one clinton adviser he s often asked about the white house gates , whether they are to keep people out or keep him in at some point , there s nothing else like just getting out and being with people
she stands on the broadway stage with the lights burning , the director barking , her heart jumping and suddenly her mind is leaping back to 1984 and there she is , a struggling comedian rehearsing her first big show , worrying that her voice will crack and that her jokes will leave the expectant audience cold then , in a flash , it is 1997 again , and the actress rehearsing on stage is whoopi goldberg , the hollywood celebrity , not whoopi goldberg , the budding phenomenon thirteen years have come and gone since she first exploded on broadway with the onewoman show that launched her film career since then , she has hobnobbed with bill clinton , starred in more than 30 films and snatched up an oscar along the way but as she prepares to return to broadway for the first time since her debut , replacing nathan lane on tuesday in a funny thing happened on the way to the forum , ms goldberg finds herself relishing the knots in her stomach , savoring that connection to the old days and to the raw energy that first propelled her to stardom after a year of being battered by one boxoffice flop after another , she craves that connection more than ever and in returning to her roots in the theater , she says she hopes to stretch again as an artist and to revive the passion for her craft that has been sapped by her most recent , frustrating years in the world of film indeed , some of her colleagues say , it is particularly thrilling to see ms goldberg take a creative risk on broadway now because they feel she sometimes wastes her talent on projects beneath her it s a big change and i'm excited and i'm scared , she laughs in her smoky voice as she talks about the new role it s like trying to walk on water sometimes you make it halfway through and then you sink it s very scary but i need to be nervous i need to stretch she has just burst through the doors of her luxury hotel on the upper east side of manhattan , her black trench coat flapping behind her she settles in at the bar for a pot of tea and some conversation about her homecoming , about her topsyturvy career and her longing for professional rejuvenation after a busy year in which none of her films eddie , bogus , the associate and ghosts of mississippi were hits i need a change , ms goldberg says , dropping a pack of marlboros on the table she is simply dressed in a knit tunic , baggy gray pants and canvas shoes her dreadlocks dangle past her shoulders , and tiny lines radiate from her brown eyes some say she is older , but she insists she is 41 i need a new challenge but the role in forum is an eyebrowraiser even for a woman who loves to defy convention , who transformed herself from a welfare mother into one of hollywood s highestpaid actresses , and who has taken on a wide range of characters , from a fake nun to a computer nerd to a basketball coach for the next 20 weeks , ms goldberg will be a black woman starring in a broadway role that has always been played by a white man she will be an actress , unaccustomed to singing on stage , leading a musical production and she will be following in the footsteps of the tony awardwinning , notoriously adlibbing mr lane , who plays a roman slave trying to win his freedom by arranging a love match with his master and a young courtesan in the process , mr lane manages to grope and ogle a host of scantily clad women my first impulse was what \? acknowledged jerry zaks , the director of forum , about his reaction to the suggestion that ms goldberg replace mr lane , who is heading to hollywood to work on a new film even ms goldberg , who played five different characters in her first foray on broadway , whoopi goldberg , presented by mike nichols , says she was taken aback when her agent , jeff hunter , suggested the part but only for an instant initially , you know , i thought , 'no , i do n't want to do this , ' she says , shooing away the hotel waiter as she pours her own cup of steaming tea because it s hard to follow nathan lane it s hard to follow something as big as this i mean , he won the tony last year it s already insurmountable but every second , every day that i get more comfortable , i look around at the empty seats in the theater as we 're rehearsing and i think , 'i know this this is in my body this is where i come from' and now i'm back and it s nice it s like coming back to the old neighborhood it is a true homecoming ms goldberg , after all , grew up in new york city , in public housing in chelsea it was there , in an apartment at 26th street and 10th avenue , in front of a blackandwhite television set , that the little girl who was born caryn johnson fell in love with the world of acting because there were no limitations on what was possible , she says you could be anybody in the movies simply put , ms goldberg wanted to be a star and that determination kept her going , even when she was a ninthgrade dropout from washington irving high school , when she was a teenage drug addict and when she was a struggling comedian , raising her daughter on her own eventually , she would win an academy award for best supporting actress for her role in the film ghost , and become the highestpaid actress in hollywood in 1993 , earning an estimated 8 million for her part in sister act 2
players and umpires are scheduled to hold a socalled summit meeting with major league baseball officials tuesday , but players are reluctant to attend for fear of retaliation by the umpires , people familiar with the planning of the meeting said yesterday players feel there will be some kind of repercussions if they say anything in the meeting , so none of them want to attend , said jerry crawford , a national league umpire and president of the umpires association crawford and a baseball official said they understood that brian mcrae of the chicago cubs was the only player who had given a commitment to attending the meeting in palm beach , fla however , david cone of the yankees said he , too , planned to attend the meeting is an outgrowth of the september incident in which roberto alomar of baltimore spit at an umpire , john hirschbeck richie phillips , the umpires' lawyer , scoffed at the notion that umpires would retaliate against players for anything they said at the meeting that s foolish , he said
indian wells , calif , march 10 it s hard to be as good as you used to be when you used to be the best jim courier is finding that out , the hard way the former no 1ranked courier was also a twotime champion here at the newsweek champions cup in 1991 and 1993 , back in the days when he used to beat underlings like spain s francisco clavet without breaking a sweat that was then this is now what s past is past , what s present is here , and none of these guys are giving me anything because i won some grand slams , said courier , who has won four today a redfaced courier , 26 , was reduced to ripping off his sweatbands , and slamming his racquet and his cap onto the court , in a silent but very visible protest of a line call that left him down by 42 and 030 as he tried to serve himself out of trouble in the final set the tantrum was just one more act of futility on a long , hot and , for him , lost afternoon this year courier s stay in the desert , a spot he once loved enough to settle into a second home near this golf and tennis oasis , lasted only a single round as lately happens too often for comfort , he put up his dukes against a baseliner with a forehand just as ferocious as his own and failed to outslug him the 37thranked clavet , a 28yearold clay court artisan with three titles in his resume , seemed almost sympathetic after pounding courier , seeded 16th , into submission , 64 , 46 , 64 , in the hardboiled 107degree sunshine on the stadium court i think maybe he s not with the same motivation as he was before , said clavet , who fell in straight sets in both prior encounters with courier during the american s heyday i think he wants to come back again he s practicing hard and playing a lot of tournaments , but it s pretty hard to get back to no 1 these days courier s every match has become a construction project or more accurately , a reconstruction project and he brings everything except a hard hat to the tennis court but his penchant for working hard in a hardnosed way failed to help him fend off clavet the lefthanded spaniard badgered courier s weaker backhand side , and he not only hit 16 forehand winners to courier s 9 , he also saved five of the six break points courier held against his serve courier lost his serve in the ninth game of the opening set and sent a forehand wide at set point though he battled back and broke clavet as he served at 45 in the 10th game of the middle set , courier went down a break in the third game of the final set and could not recover above all , i was a little too inflexible , said courier , who has yet to figure out a plan b with his new coach , harold solomon , on days like today when his plan a is not intimidating his opponent in ways i am like 17 again , starting over with a new coach it s like a rebirth , he said it s a long season , so there s no reason to blow up , but it s definitely cause for concern so a year that began on an encouraging note in a different desert , with a title in doha , qatar , has taken a discouraging turn since his davis cup heroics in brazil , where he not only won both his singles matches but also signed up for round 2 while still hooked to a bag of intravenous fluids , courier s results have dwindled this was the third consecutive event in which he failed to pass the second round i 've got to start to play a little wiser , he said match points the tournament lost 11thseeded tim henman before he even reached the court tonight for his openinground match against jeff tarango henman has tendinitis in his right elbow and was replaced by mikael tillstrom spain s felix mantilla , seeded 12th , was another casualty he lost , 06 , 63 , 63 , to 67thranked sandon stolle in the evert cup for women here , topseeded arantxa sanchez vicario defeated asa carlsson , 61 , 63 , and thirdseeded anke huber fell to 12thseeded nathalie tauziat , 64 , 63
wall street is booming , and tourists are flocking to new york in record numbers until recently , one apparently had nothing to do with the other yet lower manhattan is now swarming with cameracarrying tourists , whose brightly colored tshirts and shorts contrast vividly with the suits and stripes that otherwise abound downtown that is because increasingly , these tourists are in town to visit the financial district they are making reservations weeks in advance to see the 140 billion in gold ingots stacked in the federal reserve bank of new york s vault , posing for pictures in front of the big bronze bull on broadway and lining up weekdays as early as 8 am to snag one of the 3 , 000 tickets given away to see the floor of the new york stock exchange to meet the rising demand , the federal reserve opened a 750 , 000 visitors' gallery last month the new york exchange is finishing a 2 million remodeling of its decadesold tourist center and has extended its hours so that 700 , 000 people a year can pass through the american stock exchange , which sacrificed its visitors' mezzanine years ago to make way for a new trading floor , is studying ways to build a new one even the obscure new york mercantile exchange spent 1 million for an exhibit hall and two public viewing galleries at its new waterside headquarters in battery park city at the museum of american financial history , a small , 10yearold institution whose exhibits run to 200yearold bonds and 19thcentury stock certificates , a surge in attendance led to a move in april from the space around back where it had paid no rent to the front of the old standard oil building at 26 broadway and heritage trails new york , a nonprofit group that gives walking tours of lower manhattan historic sites , added a

down at the trading floor was as exciting as going to the statue of liberty it actually is a place , ms strojny marveled after watching the tumult it s not telephoned in , it s not computered in it s sort of like watching history happen the financial institutions say they are getting into the tourism business not to make money but to burnish their image the merchandise we sell is there because people want something to take home , said robert zito , a spokesman for the new york exchange , which has a gift shop that sells everything from women s scarves with the exchange s logo to bullandbear paperweights it s not a profit center by any means tourism and financial officials tick off several explanations for the bull market in bullmarket tourism , including the heightened attention the media pays to the dow jones industrial average and the popularity of the stock market game , a nationwide stockpicking simulation in which 650 , 000 schoolchildren now participate but basically , they say , it derives from the same phenomenon driving the expansion of the stock market itself the tens of millions of americans who have recently begun investing through mutual funds or through individual retirement accounts , pensions and 401 \( k \) plans with the market going as well as it has , and people in the 90 s putting their money in a lot of different financial vehicles , they 're coming to new york and going downtown to see either where their money is going or where it s coming from , said stephen j morello , president of the new york convention and visitors bureau he added

in the last two decades , innovation and entrepreneurship have transformed the landscape of american stock markets now the securities and exchange commission is trying to catch up and change a regulatory structure that is clearly straining to cope with the changes the sec will issue today what it calls a concept release , setting forth broad ideas for changing the way it regulates stock markets and , possibly , making it easier for foreign stock markets to operate in this country the proposal will no doubt set off a scramble among stock markets to influence the rules to their benefit it is hoped that a revised regulatory framework will emerge for established exchanges like the new york stock exchange the aim is less regulation but at the cost in all probability of increasing competition for the trading of some stocks for wildly successful newer electronic markets , instinet in particular , the result is likely to be somewhat greater regulation , though not as much as established exchanges now face the package is meant to be deregulatory , but still to provide basic protections for investors , said richard lindsey , the sec s director of market regulation currently , such markets as the big board , the american stock exchange , nasdaq and the various regional exchanges are regulated as exchanges but many newer markets , including instinet , are regulated as brokerdealers , which means they face less scrutiny in some areas but must also meet rules , such as minimum capital requirements , that arguably are irrelevant instinet is an electronic system that allows brokers and institutional investors to trade stocks it handles about 18 percent of the volume in nasdaq stocks and 3 percent of the turnover in big board issues , but it does so in relative secrecy trades on the market are reported through nasdaq , but until recently quotes posted on instinet were distributed only on that system now , as a result of sec rules announced last year , quotes from broker members of instinet are reflected on all market machines if those prices are better than otherwise available but quotes from institutional investors are not it is likely that any changes adopted by the sec would require dissemination of all such quotes and would look for a way to open up the markets so that the best quote on any market would somehow be accessible to those trading on other markets if the sec does change its regulatory framework , one likely victim of that change will be the big board s rule 390 , which bars members from trading certain stocks those listed on the exchange before april 1979 except on another exchange in practice , that has kept instinet and other newer competitors from gaining volume in those stocks the rule would probably be irrelevant if instinet and the others were reclassified as exchanges one possibility of the new rules would be to allow exchanges much more freedom to change their rules or trade new products without extensive sec review another area being explored by the sec involves foreign stock markets , which currently can operate in this country only if they register with the sec none have done so , although in practice american investors can ask their brokers to trade for them on virtually any market in the world most foreign exchanges are electronic , and there is no technical reason why terminals for such exchanges could not be in this country the sec is looking for a way to enable foreign markets to do that , although they would be able to trade only companies that had been registered in the united states were that to happen , a canadian company , for example , could register with the sec but keep its only listing on the toronto stock exchange , while still being easily traded by american investors just how the new rules would work , whether for domestic or foreign stock markets , is far from settled at one point in the preparation of today s release it had more than 300 questions in it , on which exchanges and the public were to be asked to comment and while the number may change , it is certain to be large in any case , it appears that the way stock markets are regulated , which has changed little since competition among markets was encouraged a quartercentury ago , will soon be revised in significant ways
the story of junk by linda yablonsky 325 pages farrar , straus giroux 23 so how does a girl get from point a to point b from a wholesome childhood in an allamerican suburb to a grungy life as a heroin addict and dealer in greenwich village \? how does a nice girl end up smuggling heroin from thailand in condoms pushed up her rectum \? well , this is the tale linda yablonsky sets out to tell in her chilling if sometimes tedious first novel , the story of junk certainly this novel could n't be more timely after all , stories about middleclass heroin use have become a regular feature on television news magazines , heroin chic has become the fashion world s newest craze and rent , a musical about life among the users , transvestites and wouldbe artists of the lower east side , has become a hit , as has trainspotting , a highspirited movie about scottish heroin addicts directed in the style of richard lester s beatles films as for the story of junk , its gritty portrait of heroin addiction stands in sharp contrast to the technicolor effusions of trainspotting and rent there are alarming stories about friends passing out from overdoses , buying methadone that other addicts have spit into bottles and dying of aids there are gruesome descriptions of addicts covered with sores and bruises , trolling the mean streets of alphabet city looking for a fix , and equally gruesome descriptions of what it feels like to go cold turkey even ms yablonsky s more upbeat stories have a way of depressing the reader endless days and nights spent in cold apartments and hot restaurants , listening to people with great haircuts and shiny suits talk about their habits and say things like i think death must be bliss while other drugs work to alleviate pain , excite the mind or otherwise trick the senses , her narrator says , heroin plays with the soul or whatever it is makes a person uniquely appealing and distinguishable like an enveloping shadow dissolving day into night , it sneaks across your vision and tries to put it out , whatever that joy is by which you live , it creeps inside and pushes you down , making you smaller and smaller , a tiny flame burning down framed by the unnamed narrator s arrest and interrogation by a narcotics officer , junk jumps back and forth in time to tell the story of how she reached this point we learn that she is an aspiring writer and sometime restaurant cook who was attracted to the bohemian world of new york , so different from the middleclass world of her youth we learn that her dabbling in heroin led to a habit and that that habit , in turn , led to dealing we also learn that her regular customers are chippers and partyheads , overachievers , friends , in other words , the artists , musicians and poets she hangs out with in soho and the village a junkbond boom on wall street is flooding the underground economy with a steady flow of disposable cash , the narrator of junk says of the 1980 s 'discretionary income , ' they call it , and some of it trickles down here the world seems made of junk junk money , junk food , junk stores , junk powder i got into junk at just the right time writing in edgy , serviceable prose , ms yablonsky gives the reader some evocative snapshots of the worlds her characters frequent a village restaurant hung with paintings and other works of art by the betterknown clientele and equipped with a huge walkin fridge that also serves as a drug parlor avenue b , where there are bodies slinking in and out of guarded doorways , diving through holes punched in concrete walls , wiggling into gaps in the sidewalk deep as wells , shooting up in empty lots , nodding on the hulks of abandoned cars she provides some voyeuristic glimpses of their lives being checked for track marks by suspicious dealers taking valium , codeine and darvon to overcome the pain of withdrawal , and yards and yards of stoned conversation none of this talk is terribly interesting , as the narrator , who has become privy to her clients' secrets , observes i'm hearing the same things too many times i do n't want to hear them anymore i do n't want to know who steals what to get money for their drugs i do n't want to know who they lie to or why i do n't want to know who s dying or who s getting famous this , in the end , is the problem with this novel though ms yablonsky proves she can be a vivid storyteller when she has an real story to relate \( like her narrator s smuggling trip to thailand \) , and demonstrates an anthropological flair for recording the mores of the downtown drug scene , her narrative often devolves into a weary recitation of drug buys , drug busts , drug parties the deadening routines that frame an addict s life as for the characters \( the narrator s lover , kit the narrator s former lover rico the narrator s drug source angelo even the narrator herself \) , they , too , tend to blur into one another , all of them obsessed with junk where to get it , how to ingest it and occasionally how to kick it as ms yablonsky , herself , writes everyone s got a story to tell , and most of those stories will change in some way , every time they 're told not this one , not the story of junk this one s always the same photo linda yablonsky \( nan goldin farrar , straus giroux \)
quite some time ago , an artist called roberto sebastian matta echaurren , born and reared in chile , became just about as ubiquitous as a painter can be a free spirit of no fixed address , he has been almost everywhere after graduating from catholic university in his native santiago , he trained as an architect , went to paris in 1933 and went on to take the pulse of life in germany and austria from 1935 to 1937 he worked as a draftsman in the studio of le corbusier , a swiss genius with whom he could not be said to have had much in common matta \( as he is generally known \) was made for wilder fancies , and in 1936 , when on a visit to an aunt in madrid , he met federico garcia lorca the contact was immediate lorca s gift for sumptuous metaphors set matta free from the disciplines of architectural draftsmanship the unconscious took over , with its henchman , automatic drawing or painting through lorca , matta met the young salvador dali he began to draw in ways that endeared him to andre breton , the leader of the international surrealist group his work was shown in uptotheminute company and found consecration in the surrealist magazine minotaure at 27 , he was included in the international exhibition of surrealism in paris , and in the fall of 1939 he had the good sense to head for new york , where he was to remain until 1948 he came with the best credentials but he also had powers of personal seduction that would in themselves have made him welcome in no time at all his work was shown by julian levy , and later by pierre matisse a mesmerizing talker , he was a welcome contributor to the comedy of ideas as it was played out in new york during world war ii not only did he position himself adroitly in relation to breton and marcel duchamp , but he was also accepted by many among the new generation of new york artists as an invaluable stimulant anyone who wonders why he got on quite so well has only to go to the current exhibition of matta s paintings and drawings at the andre emmerich gallery consistently and without apparent effort , matta set himself up in new york as someone who could not put pencil or crayon to a large sheet of paper without creating a world of his own it was a world peopled with ambiguous anatomies that made free with one another in ways that were often very peculiar the emmerich show includes several of these , and they have lost none of their power to disconcert some of those early watercolors were as much drawn as painted the figures skittered , insectlike , across a tumbledown , nonperspectival space but when he began to paint in oils , in 1938 , at the suggestion of the english painter gordon onslow ford , he would take a palette knife , load it with small quantities of bright colors and apply the colors to the canvas in the approved automatic manner of surrealism it is suggested in the catalogue to the present show that this initial phase might take only a few minutes thereafter , and sometimes for as much as three months , matta would bring the image together as a satisfactory whole , without losing the vivid and nonobjective thrust of the first application of the paint what might have been a labored and inconclusive activity was powered by matta s natural vivacity matta the irrepressible new boy in the big city developed in time into matta the international star he could go anywhere england , italy , the united states and settle down for as long as he felt like it at 85 , he still has that status , with his personal magic intact the recent work may sometimes look more like a performance than a new statement that demanded to be made but the original notion of the biomorphic form was that of an everchanging shape that could stand in for every imaginable variant of human , vegetable , mineral or animal form it was a notion that recurred throughout the 20th century and till lately had the label modern attached to it in the 1930 s , in particular , it was a part of the lingua franca of modernism , and only rarely was a voice raised against it it is to matta s credit that during the years covered in this show roughly from 1937 to 1957 he did not simply use his biomorphic forms in ones and twos he aimed rather at symphonic visions in which the conventions of heroic landscape were blended with the tumult of the biomorphs where initially he had virtually discarded perspective in favor of images that looked like pages torn from a sketchbook , he turned , in the early 1950 s , to what were more like 17thcentury battle paintings there was a foreground and a background there was a lurid sky that set the tone for the rumblings and tumblings below confusion and tumult made sense in terms of opposing forces that were out to gut one another and vegetation that looked as if it were made of tensile steel no longer in any sense the member of a group , with all that had implied in the way of shared ideas and collective maneuvering , he lived for six years \( 1948 to 1954 \) in rome , and then for 15 years \( 1954 to 1969 \) in paris but it was characteristic of him that he never really left anywhere he never lost his foothold in new york or chicago , thanks to regular exhibitions in 1956 he left his distinctive mark on the new unesco building in paris in the form of a large decoration in 1957 william rubin organized a matta show at the museum of modern art in new york in 1966 , matta taught in an art school in minneapolis it was not that he was a citizen of the world , but rather that he was a citizen of his own imagination and did not care to be pinned down to any one country or any one place but it is clear from the emmerich gallery show that it was in new york , 50 and some years ago , that he first declared his full self matta s paintings and drawings remain at the andre emmerich gallery , 41 east 57th street , manhattan , through march 22 photo an untitled drawing from 1938 by matta , at the emmerich gallery \( andre

greg maddux has a lot more in common with sandy koufax than that their last names have six letters , two syllables and an x at the end there s one word that links them , said fred claire , the los angeles dodgers' general manager they are not just pitchers , but also perfectionists just as koufax was the most dominating pitcher of his time , maddux is the most dominating of his in between , no pitcher has been as dominating for as long a continuous stretch as koufax and maddux in my time sandy was the best pitcher , tommy lasorda said , meaning his time as a pitcher with the dodgers if you wanted to win a game today , if you had your choice of any pitcher , who would you take \? maddux , of course maddux is in the sixth season of a period in which he has become the no 1 pitcher in the major leagues no one else today has had such a sixyear run no one since koufax has from 1961 through '66 , koufax was unparalleled in his consistent dominance , compiling a winning percentage of 733 with a 12947 record to go with a 219 earned run average with the sixth season not yet complete , maddux has a 709 percentage on a 10543 record plus a 215 era koufax won three cy young awards , all when only one award was given each year maddux has won four is a leading contender for a fifth of the other leading players who pitched with or followed koufax , none had a sixseason run that can match koufax s or maddux s most of the rest of the best in the past 35 years had at least one off year in any string of six seasons jim palmer , for example , had a 712 record in 1974 tom seaver had an 1111 record the same season koufax and maddux , of course , reached their exalted states with different styles of pitching sandy was the consummate power pitcher with the greatest curve i ever saw , said jeff torborg , who served as a catcher for koufax and has seen maddux often , though not from as close as 60 feet 6 inches his curveball went straight down it was so great i could hear the seams on the ball speaking of maddux , claire said it s almost like a guy lining up a 60foot6inch putt he establishes which way he wants the break to go , and he is just so disciplined , so repetitive in his pitches claire , who watched koufax as a baseball writer , said the two pitchers had a number of common traits one thing , he said , is they had a tremendous understanding of the art of pitching even though sandy did have such a dominating fastball and curveball , he truly had to develop into a pitcher and he understood the technique of pitching maddux s understanding is on the phi beta kappa level , and his technique soars to an even higher plane maddux does things i do n't see anyone else do , torborg said he said maddux can throw a pitch so that it appears it will be a ball , prompting a batter to quit on it , then have it break back over the plate for a strike , and maddux can execute that trick starting the ball inside or outside pitchers often can do it one way but not both when i was catching and trying to hit , i never saw anyone do it , torborg said his pitching technique is so important to maddux that yesterday , he would n't let the atlanta catcher wear fox s miniature camera for its telecast , so opponents could not pick up something about his mechanics maddux s ability to put the ball where he wants it and to change speeds makes up for the koufaxtype speed that he does not have sandy was just so dominant that he overpowered people , claire said with maddux , he gets great results but he gets them in a different way it looks like he s hardly working up a sweat , but his command is so great he s just become a master but lasorda , the longtime dodger manager , noted that koufax , who struggled with his control early in his career , did not win simply with explosive speed in his last few years , lasorda said , he could throw the ball through a teacup randy johnson has developed in a similar way , and he , rather than maddux , is the pitcher whose style should be compared with koufax s but as dominating as he has become , johnson has yet to put together two dominant seasons in a row maddux just keeps going and going he epitomized his dominance in a game last month against the chicago cubs , dispatching them with a mere 78 pitches , only 15 of them called balls from a selfish standpoint , i'm glad maddux is dominating the game , said tommy john , whose pitching career spanned koufax s and maddux s i 've got a 19yearold sophomore at furman who throws the ball about as hard as maddux does he throws strikes , changes speeds , throws on both sides of the plate baseball has said he does n't throw the ball hard enough they want someone who throws 94 , 95 , 96 the more maddux wins , the more it makes scouts with their radar guns look bad what he is doing proves you do n't have to throw the ball 95 to win you can win if you throw strikes , change speeds and have good location maddux s location right now is on that same plateau koufax reached 30 years ago a costly trade
tokyo japan s new tokyo international forum is such a perfectly realized building that you may actually find yourself hoping that a flaw will turn up everything about this complex of theaters and convention halls has been thought through with precision the only thing it can be faulted for is a pursuit of excellence so unyielding that it seems to not quite deserve a place in our world of scintillating compromise designed by the new york architect rafael vinoly , the 15 billion forum opened on friday his design was selected in 1989 from among 395 entries in japan s first international competition the architect may be best known in the united states for the sports center at lehman college in the bronx \( his most important new york project to date \) a current project is the design for a new sports stadium for princeton university to replace palmer stadium vinoly s design for the monumental forum flies in the face of architectural history , or at least runs against the current preoccupations of many leading contemporary architects it is lucid , whole and completely straightforward , qualities that have not enjoyed wide favor in architecture for some time a text is not needed to comprehend it it does not speak in codes some will call it modern , but it is a tribute to this building s strength that one wants to protect it from standard appellations of style and taste in a lecture , vinoly once said that architecture is an art of dealing with heaviness , and that is what you get here a feat of creativity in which floors , ceilings and walls have been made to soar the forum occupies a privileged site in the heart of tokyo , steps away from the city s main train station and a fiveminute walk from the imperial palace gardens though built with private money , the forum is a civic , indeed a national , symbol , a monument to japan s global economic power it is a hybrid building a place where concerts and other performing arts events will take place amid trade fairs and conventions lincoln center crossed with the javits center , in effect americans can be discomforted by the mixing of culture and commerce , but in japan , the most progressive art is typically displayed in department stores there s nothing contrary about a building that brings kabuki , beethoven and cars together under the same roof and what a roof ! hagia sophia , the guggenheim museum and grand central terminal have a new cousin by day a glittering crystal , at night a glowing lantern , the forum s glass hall joins the ranks of the world s great spaces like some lighterthanair vessel , the hall s shipshape roofing slices through the tokyo cityscape the atrium roof of metal and glass was designed in collaboration with the structural engineer kunio watanabe it is wonderful to see that even in a builtup contemporary city , a strong horizontal arc can become a landmark as emphatically as a skyscraper as you approach , the forum divides itself into two structures joined by a public plaza the glass hall rises on one side , tapering to a bladesharp corner at both ends on the other side , the forum s four main meeting halls occupy a graduated row of gray concrete cubes the plaza is actually more like a twoblocklong pedestrian promenade beautifully landscaped and furnished with seating , the plaza is meant to be an oasis for office workers in the financial district nearby the visual effect of this outdoor space is of a manmade ravine , a portage between rippling glass reflections and a cliff of faceted gray stone you will want to go into the glass hall immediately , but first you ought to look at the fire stairs set between the concrete cubes these are the rolex of fire stairs , immaculately engineered cascades of openmesh steel that rise without a crude or wasted motion if you climb a flight or two of them , you will get the key to the whole building it s almost unheard of for architects today to devote themselves to this level of detail we pretend not to mind , because if we did we 'd go crazy we accept that architects develop concepts , sketches , drawings and models , and then hand the project over to an associated firm to create the physical object in space here we 're dealing with a radically different economy of mind the bolt beneath our feet emerged from the same esthetic intelligence that conceived the space around it an architect is making architecture , and we almost ca n't stand it it is dizzying to realize that excellence is a polite term for obsession and these are just the back stairs officially , people arriving to attend functions at the forum will enter from the opposite side , facing the street once inside , you grasp that vinoly has chosen to celebrate japan s power with a lavish display of the country s scarcest commodity space there has n't been a spatial sweep like this since the paris opera house wide lobbies with floors of white glass illuminated from below lead to escalator banks of such glamour that you may have to squelch the impulse to ride them twice or give into it at the top of the escalators are mezzanines with glass walls that look out to the plaza and back down to the entrance lobbies the play of reflections infinitely expands the interior s already sizable three dimensions
at the san francisco offices of mother jones , past winner of three national magazine awards and nominated for another this year , the pachydermshaped ellie sculptures given out at the annual ceremony are used as doorstops that lowly placement is indicative of the ambivalence that surrounds the awards , the most highly coveted honors in the prizestrewn magazine business , but also , so parochial as to sometimes seem superfluous this year s awards will be handed out at a luncheon on wednesday at the waldorfastoria in manhattan and if tradition holds , editors will crave them , the general public will barely take note and advertisers will dismiss the ellies as white elephants curios with minimal market value the point of the prizes , administered by the american society of magazine editors , is to encourage quality in reporting , design and other areas , and many in the field say that is accomplished but certain questions about the relevance of the 31yearold awards are likely to linger well after the last jubilant winner has gone home unlike other major media prizes the oscars , say , or the grammys the national magazine awards yield remarkably few benefits , commercial or otherwise while editors say an award might briefly help a struggling startup attract writers , or confirm a highbrow quarterly s stature , there seems to be negligible impact on circulation and readership and hence no benefit to advertisers , the lifeblood of a magazine in fact , the biggest upturn in advertising may be the fullpage ads in newspapers and in their own publications that finalists and winners take out on behalf of themselves in the weeks before and after the awards ceremony it s a wonderful thing for editors and ad salespeople to talk about , said ellen levine , the editor in chief of good housekeeping , who is an asme board member and a former president of the society but i 've seen editors accept awards and then get fired the next month and i have yet to meet an advertiser who buys a page because you won an award tina brown , editor of the new yorker , which has won 19 awards , more than any other publication , acknowledged that the prizes are mainly about peer recognition advertisers obviously hear of it , and it ca n't hurt , ms brown said but it does not necessarily help , either while the new yorker took home two ellies last year , ad pages fell 44 percent , according to the publishers information bureau the problem with the awards may lie in the clubby way in which the categories and winners are chosen the entries must pass a group of screeners , chosen from the asme membership and assigned to each category , who are more or less sequestered for a few days in february in rooms in the millennium hotel while they read and decide which will become finalists the head screener goes on to be a judge in that category , joined by editors , journalism professors and others in the field deep secrecy shrinkwraps the process these days , partly to prevent a leak of the winners as apparently happened two years ago , when the new york observer published a supposedly speculative winners list that turned out to be almost completely accurate but the secrecy is also meant to reinforce an impression of objectivity and professionalism that some say is almost impossible in the small circles in which magazine professionals move in which career paths frequently cross and egos often collide , and where memories of perceived slights can be truly elephantine advertisers are well aware of all of this we have to remember it s the magazine community , not the readers , who are voting , said ellen oppenheim , vice president and media director at foote , cone belding as much as we might want to believe there s a carryover effect with the reader , we have to marry the winning of the award with other indicators of reader appreciation as this year s list of finalists makes clear , a few publications tend to dominate the competition of 1 , 183 entries from 281 magazines , 76 were named finalists of those , six came from the new yorker in reporting , feature writing , fiction \( two separate finalists \) , essays and criticism , and singletopic issue and six more from gq sports illustrated is a finalist in four categories , and fortune , outside magazine , a monthly paean to cuttingedge outdoor activity , and saveur , a relative newcomer to the gourmetmagazine group , are finalists in three categories apiece in other words onethird of the shots at a prize go to just 2 percent of the magazines entered it s an embarrassment i can live with , ms brown said of the new yorker s clout one frequent complaint is that the contest too often compares dissimilar species the women s magazines with the generalinterest magazines , the small , specialized titles with the broaderbased ones in the special interests category , for example , this year s finalists are outdoor life \( circulation 13 million \) , outside \( 515 , 000 \) , saveur \( 250 , 000 \) , smithsonian \( 209 million \) and sports illustrated \( 31 million \) aside from alliteration , there s not much in common there only for the general excellence prize , which

like computers worldwide , many of westchester county s computers could have major problems after dec 31 , 1999 , because their clocks are not programmed for the turn of the century the worstcase scenario goes like this it is 2000 , and prisoners are being released before their time , the needy are not getting any assistance , taxpayer checks are going out to vendors who delivered no recent service , pension records have been destroyed , traffic lights are going crazy and the elderly are being notified they are in need of their preschool inoculations whether all these things happen or worse things or none at all depends on whether the westchester county government , as well as governments at all levels , can get their computers to understand that 2000 is not 1900 that is because , except for the latest computers , all have been programmed to put a 19 in front of the last two digits of a year to some extent , we do n't know what the potential impact could be , said susan s egginton , who as administrator of the county s general services department oversees westchester s 2 mainframe computers \( 8 and 10 years old , respectively \) , about 9 midsize computers and about 4 , 000 personal computers this is a very real problem and not a scare people are creating as a goof , said camaron j thomas , director of gov george e pataki s task force on information resource management , which is coordinating actions on the state level to upgrade the computers nor , ms egginton said , is there a magic solution a software program , for example , that can simply be inserted into a computer to make all the important date changes everything we have is written in different languages , she explained therefore , computer programs have to be examined line by line to see where they have to be changed the cost of doing so is tremendous in both time and money it is estimated that the federal government will spend about 6 billion to 8 billion to make their computers 2000compatible , while new york state will spend 100 million ms egginton said the county government would spend millions concidentally , it was to save money that computers were developed with a system that used only two digits , instead of four , to describe a date for example 97 instead of 1997 twenty to 25 years ago , it made sense to save magnetic storage space by using just two characters , said john leonard , manager of information systems for the county government it saved a lot of money as a result , when the millennium comes , computers will not know the century has turned the date 2000 will be read as 00 and interpreted to mean 1900 also , because of the way calculations are done , ages become confused peter de jager , a canadian considered one of the top experts in the field , explained i was born in 1955 if i ask the computer to calculate how old i am today , it subtracts 55 from 97 and announces that i'm 42 so far , so good but what happens in the year 2000 \? the computer will subtract 55 from 00 and will state that i am minus 55 years old it is only in the last few years that owners of computers governments , businesses and individuals have learned of the potential of problems for computers , especially those that do calculations , in 2000 the need for raising awareness and information has led to a number of web pages , one of the most significant being the year 2000 information center \( www year2000 com \) , where mr de jager has a countdown to the year 2000 in years , days , hours , minutes and seconds when it needed to learn about the 2000 problem , the state government turned to mr de jager , ms thomas said it also created its own web page , so that local governments as well as state departments know what is going on \( www irm state ny us \) the county has turned to the gartner group , an informational technology think tank in stamford for its expertise , mr leonard said at this point , the state is one giant step ahead of the county in making its computers 2000compatible it has already done its assessment of the state s computer systems and prioritized those 40 systems that must be updated first , ms thomas said health and safety issues , including those affecting release of prisoners and payments of welfare and pension benefits , have been given priority , she said we 're simply not going to get the whole thing done , she said on the county level , such an assessment is now under way , ms egginton said , with the help of a subsidiary of international business machines , which was hired last year to run the county s information services when the assessment is completed , the county will issue a request for proposals from contractors who can correct the problem it hopes to have a vendor hired by october and corrective steps begun , she said she stressed that the county had already taken steps to insure that prison records are given priority so that there is no chance that prisoners are wrongly released westchester county legislator katherine s carsky , a republican from yonkers , is afraid the county s response has been too slow we 're a little late in approaching this , she said she said she thought that the competition for experts to correct the computer software would not only drive costs up but also make it harder to find anyone available it was mainly for that reason , she said , that she supported awarding privatization of the county s information services to ibm she said it was her hope that this will in some way give the county government a greater chance of getting the 2000compatible services it needs from ibm an ibm spokesman , ken neale , referred all questions to the county government ms thomas said the state is also aware of the need to get vendors hired quickly the people to do the work are not available many , she said , have gone to more lucrative private sector work drawing \( felipe galindo \)
hong kong , may 29 hong kong s latest fastbuck scheme reached the market today and climbed like a rocket as the shares of one of china s celebrated redchip companies went public and more than tripled in price just a few weeks before hong kong is to revert to chinese control on july 1 , a phenomenon known as tulip mania is sweeping the british crown colony tulip mania has history elsewhere more than 350 years ago in holland , tulip bulbs almost magically assumed staggering value when it became clear that tulips were just tulips , the realization wreaked havoc across much of the dutch economy now , the early stages of tulip mania are spreading over hong kong last week , frenzied investors emptied bank accounts and lined up for hours for a chance to buy stock in a company owned by the beijing city government never mind that beijing s former mayor is under house arrest for corruption and the deputy mayor was found in a gutter last year , slain ganglandstyle with a bullet in his head and forget that the company , a mishmash of businesses and property , is not viewed as much of a money maker red chips , as chinese companies are known , are hong kong s latest tulip the red chips have recorded staggering gains for a year an index of 41 such mainland companies is up 127 percent since june 1996 , the overall market 30 percent serpentine lines entwined the bank of china and other financial houses as at least 400 , 000 hong kong residents , one in 16 , lined up to apply for share allotments in the beijing company , beijing enterprises ltd the price of the stock fixed at 1248 \( hong kong \) a share , or 161 \( united states \) rose steadily on the gray market , touching 41 \( hong kong \) , or 530 , at one point the hong kong stock exchange joined the surge , reaching record highs day after day today , on the first official day of trading on the exchange , the graymarket price of beijing enterprises was essentially confirmed as its shares closed at 4020 \( hong kong \) , or 520 \( united states \) ominously , perhaps , the hang seng index , the hong kong market s benchmark , posted its biggest oneday drop in seven weeks all told , nearly 26 billion had been put up by hopeful investors , more than all the cash in hong kong , leaving banks parched for cash and while very few individual investors received stock the unsuccessful ones will get their money back the beijing company accumulated a tidy profit of its own , estimated at 26 million just from holding on to that money for a couple of weeks more than 1 , 000 people who failed to get shares lined up today outside the china resources building and waited for their refunds karen wu , 43 , rued her failure to receive stock it s money to be picked up off the street , she said after july 1 , mainlanders will be in charge of course the company will do well there is great potential she added you should buy it , too it 'll definitely go up trust me so frenetic was the demand for shares that when all the forms were totaled , the sums added and the apportioning figured , it was announced that for each share there had been 1 , 300 applications , the highest oversubscription rate in hong kong s history all of which meant that hong kong residents , and substantial institutional investors including pension funds and insurance companies , were willing to pay a lot of money for shares in a company with no track record and , in the view of many hardheaded analysts , fairly uncertain prospects and because the company was only incorporated in february , scant financial information was provided to investors the company projects pro forma profits from all its subsidiaries this year of 45 million \( united states \) none of this seemed to matter much , though anything chinese has become tinged with gold a year and a half ago , said john m mulcahy , a managing director of the securities firm w i carr , you would n't have been able to sell any of these things the mood has shifted it s not going to stay this way indefinitely people are rushing to do these deals next year , when the company s financial performance is announced , it is likely to come as a sizable splash of cold water , he said when the results are produced in the first quarter of 1998 , mr mulcahy added , people will start to wonder why they paid these prices while brokers and analysts at hong kong s financial houses immersed themselves in the 365page prospectus on the new beijing company , dr john jinpang leung , a psychologist at the chinese university of hong kong , sees the frenzy of buying as typical of hong kong people in hong kong , i would say , are very businesslike , very moneyoriented mainly in the past , he said , most people living in hong kong did n't treat this as their permanent home there is always this opportunistic orientation to grab what you can and the transition adds to this people may slightly worry about whether things will stay the same as a result , dr leung said , hong kong is a place where crowd psychology is particularly apparent a few weeks ago , when the last stamps bearing the portrait of queen elizabeth ii were distributed , lines more than half a mile long snaked away from the central post office a lot of the hong kong people have also heard about this kind of thing , he said they tried to join the kind of frantic buying behavior you have seen even at peregrine capital ltd , the investment bank that was one of the lead underwriters for beijing enterprises , there was wonder over the passions aroused by the stock issue obviously we feel it s a good company , said tom grimmer , director of communications at peregrine but in terms of public response , we do n't know why everyone has hit on this one to go bananas over other than to say it s an alignment of the planets , or the movement of spirits we do n't understand it it is particularly hard to understand , in the view of some people , because the company s selfproclaimed strengths are not highly profitable businesses or superb management the principal strength , in the company s own words , is its unique and close relationship with the beijing municipal government so investors are banking on the company s connections to succeed , not the potential of its subsidiaries , which include a brewery , a department store , the toll road between beijing airport and the city , a hotel and tourism rights for a bit of the great wall investors feel that after july 1 , a banker from bzw asia ltd said , the red chips will have much more influence over the hong kong economy , that they will get the sweetest deals from the chinese government but mr mulcahy said that the craze for redchip stocks , and their currently unrestrained price spiral , could not last it s a momentum thing , he said as long as there is enough liquidity chasing these things , the prices will only go higher but like all parties , this one will end photo in hong kong , too , institutions seek new shares and the little investor can be left out yesterday , those who did n't get beijing enterprises stock lined up , with heads hanging or cellular phones , to reclaim their money \( kees metsalaar for the new

maybe somebody like him will come along , but evander holyfield might be boxing s last gladiator , the last one who seems to enjoy the fight for the fight as a kid , the boxing public s heavyweight champion was saying , i always wanted to be good at something , to touch people s lives it s not about the money it s a skill thing this is what i do best in a time when too many heavyweights act more as if they were wrestlers , what holyfield does best is what none of the others want to do at all be a real gladiator what he also does best is understand what it is to be a real world champion \( to wear all the jeweled championship belts in a business that too often is too fragmented \) and understand why he 'll always be remembered as mike tyson s conqueror i'm a thinker and i'm a doer , he said , and i give praise to the lord i can beat anybody i put my mind to although his right ear has healed , a chunk is missing where tyson bit it tyson has yet to apologize personally i think he will in his own time , holyfield said at some point in time , he 'll come up to me and say , 'i'm sorry , man i should n't have done that' i truly believe that he likes me he ca n't be mad with me because he really likes me he doubted he would fight tyson again , if tyson is reinstated next summer by the nevada athletic commission me fighting tyson is not important at all , he said i do n't see any reason for it the only way , if he got a belt before i unify the title that s what i want to accomplish , for the game , to unify the title for the game when was the last time you heard a boxer talk about wanting to do something for the game \? most boxers want to do something only for the money as proof of holyfield s intentions to unify the title , he insisted he would n't be interested in fighting tyson no matter how much money would be involved , maybe as much as 50 million money wo n't be a factor , said the 34yearold boxer whose earnings are approaching 150 million i 've made enough money now for my money to make me money doing something for the game is why holyfield might be the last gladiator standing , the last boxer who enjoys the fight for the fight as muhammad ali and joe frazier did , as marvelous marvin hagler did , as roberto duran did before he mumbled no mas , as larry holmes did before he went on his farewell tour that has yet to end none of today s other heavyweights have ever had the soul of a real gladiator mike tyson was always more of a thug , riddick bowe more of a glutton , lennox lewis more of an english accent , andrew golota more of a barroom brawler michael moorer was always more of a reluctant dragon even when he took holyfield s two title belts with a 12round decision in 1994 , he had to be prodded into punching by his trainer at the time , teddy atlas now , as tyson s twotime conqueror , holyfield , the world boxing association champion , will be trying to take moorer s international boxing federation title on nov 8 in las vegas , nev if he wins , he would then fight the winner of the oct 4 bout in atlantic city between lewis , the world boxing council champion , and golota the best man is the man who has all the belts , who beat everybody in his era , holyfield was saying at yesterday s news conference in the rainbow room ali s greatness is based on the fighters he fought , joe frazier even though i beat george foreman and larry holmes , they were on a slipping level when i beat 'em when they 're considered the best and i beat 'em , that s when it counts that s why he wanted to fight moorer again the first time , he said , i kept injuring my shoulder in training i did n't want to pull out because i thought i could beat him anyway but i did n't put pressure on him i beat myself by having a lazy attitude , by trying to get something for nothing he has heard roy jones jr , a cruiserweight as he once was , talk about wanting to fight him for the title but if a person ai n't willing to fight everybody to be a champion , he do n't belong in there , holyfield said roy jones wants to fight me , but not tyson that s not right that s not a real gladiator photo evander holyfield \( don hogan charles \)
hong kong , friday , jan 24 in the face of international and local criticism over china s intention to roll back laws protecting a range of civil rights in hong kong , the man who will rule the territory under chinese sovereignty has declared his support for repeal of the laws local legislators , lawyers and the territory s rambunctious press expressed alarm over the recommendation by a beijingappointed body that a series of recently adopted laws , including core provisions of hong kong s bill of rights , should not stand when hong kong reverts to chinese rule on july 1 but it was not until thursday that tung cheehwa , a former shipping tycoon chosen by beijing to be chief executive of hong kong when britain hands over the colony , declared his support for china s intentions , which include reinstating colonial legislation restricting protests and requiring official approval to set up political organizations the key question here for the community to debate is what is more important to the community social order , inconvenience caused to the public at large or individual rights , mr tung said at a dinner organized by two leading newspapers , sing tao and the hong kong standard i believe it is important to get the right balance between individual rights and social order for the good of the entire community mr tung has repeatedly stressed the need to subjugate individual rights , whether expressed in the form of protest or through democratic institutions , to the good of the public at large china s move to return to authoritarian colonial legislation that had been repealed by hong kong s elected legislature in recent years has drawn vigorous protests from london and washington on wednesday the chinese ambassador to britain , jiang enzhu , was summoned to the foreign office to be told of london s unhappiness over beijing s intentions in washington the state department spokesman , nicholas burns , said that the administration was deeply concerned over any attempts to weaken civil liberties and basic freedoms in hong kong martin c m lee , the chairman of the democratic party , hong kong s largest party , said today that he was dismayed by mr tung s capitulation to beijing s injunctions i express regret that mr tung does n't seem to understand that what he s been talking about are entirely human rights matters , and they are also legal matters , mr lee said in a telephone interview it has everything to do with human rights many of the laws china plans to revoke were passed after 1984 , when britain and china signed an agreement to return hong kong to china and london promised not to significantly change the colony s laws or electoral system since then , however , the british authorities have moved to a fully elected legislature and have adopted numerous guarantees of civil and democratic rights many local newspapers attacked beijing s intentions this is an obvious attempt to emasculate hong kong people s freedom to demonstrate and collect petitions , sing tao said hong kong people should keep on protesting against the reinstatement of the ordinances concernedthe hong kong economic times , which often supports beijing , said , before amending or abolishing hong kong law , the preparatory committee legal panel should first consider the desires and needs of hong kong people the panel is the beijingappointed body that made the proposals but mr tung is having none of it the issue is not about the freedom of expression and freedom of assembly , mr tung said the issue is not about human rights if people want to demonstrate or lie in the middle of the road , in my view , they 're welcome they should be allowed to do so but they must do so without causing inconvenience and harm to the community at large and they must do so within the law this is not a human rights issue , he insisted some people in this community like you to believe this is a step backward on democracy and a step backward on human rights this is not true
wimbledon , england , july 2 wimbledon lost its defending champion today , but nobody except richard krajicek seemed sorry to see richard krajicek flounder in the round of 16 that is because the david who sent this particular goliath packing was tim henman , the cowlick kid whose quest to become britain s first male champion since 1936 has an entire nation galvanized wimbledon gained a stunning semifinal debutante in anna kournikova , imperious beyond her 16 years and just one of a record four teenage quarterfinalists who performed here today kournikova defeated the 19yearold french open champion , iva majoli , 76 \( 71 \) , 64 , a development that advanced the precocious russian into a semifinal showdown thursday with the even more precocious martina hingis , no 1 in the world although the swiss teenager became the australian open s youngest champion this january at 16 , today she admitted to being mirthfully miffed that kournikova , who just turned 16 , is already a wimbledon semifinalist , too fur will fly thursday , even if the cats in battle happen to still be kittens in the other women s semifinal , one that will actually be contested by grownups but is nonetheless a grudge match , two former wimbledon runnersup and estranged doubles partners , thirdseeded jana novotna and eighthseeded arantxa sanchez vicario , will fight for the other spot in the finale last , but far from least , on a busy , windy , and blessedly rainless day , wimbledon retained a threetime champion , pete sampras , after the topseeded and solitary american still afloat scrambled out of a bizarre fivesetter against 16thseeded petr korda sampras s ordeal began with a nosebleed , regressed with the loss of a twoset lead , and was ultimately resolved , 64 , 63 , 67 \( 810 \) , 67 \( 17 \) , 64 , in the favorite s favor with the help of 28 aces and 105 productive forays to the net in the quarterfinals on thursday on center court , sampras faces eighthseeded boris becker of germany , the only other active player who owns three wimbledon championships whereas sampras reigned from 199395 , the 29yearold becker earned his wimbledon triad in 19858689 becker has twice been beaten here by the 25yearold american , in the 1993 semifinals and the 1995 final , and sampras controls their overall rivalry , 107 this is what it s all about for us , for boris and i , the wimbledons and the grand slams , said sampras , who holds nine grand slam singles crowns to becker s six and is just three grand slam titles short of tying roy emerson s record of 12 i feel boris , for the rest of his career , should be seeded in the top four no matter what he s ranked because he got to the finals here seven times and he s won three times , sampras said for us to play in the quarters is tough for both of us like the 14thseeded henman s popular 76 \( 97 \) , 67 \( 79 \) , 76 \( 75 \) , 64 upset of the fourthseeded krajicek , sampras s match took two days to play unlike the defending champion , krajicek , who captured his first and only grand slam title here last year and was desperate to prove that coup was n't a fluke , sampras did n't lie awake overnight krajicek had reason to worry not only was he in a hole but he was very much persona non grata it was not easy to go to sleep , it took me a couple of hours , but in the end , you go to sleep and when you wake up , you 're ok , krajicek said if i was playing against the whole of england , i do n't know krajicek , who fell behind , two sets to one all of them tie breakers in the center court gloom on tuesday night , took just 36 minutes to fall all the way out of contention today when the match reconvened in semisunshine in light or dark , krajicek received the same chilly reception from the 14 , 000 spectators who cheered on their ferocious , but unflamboyant , hero although henman never egged his fans on , the partisan chants of tim , tim , tim did leave a lingering impression on krajicek the only thing i do know is that i'm not going to name my kid tim , because i hate that name , he said krajicek also hated the way his own game , particularly his returns and volleys , let him down in the third set on tuesday and the fourth set today the 6foot5inch dutchman dropped his serve in the fifth game today by plopping out four consecutive volley errors , three of them on the backhand side krajicek described that game as a terrible break i could n't believe that it would be worse than yesterday , but i played even worse than yesterday , and tim did n't make any mistakes , so it s a shame that somehow i could n't play my best tennis at the moment i wanted to play it , krajicek said basically to the last point today , when it was 400 and it looked pretty hopeless , i still had to believe i was going to win , but it did n't happen , and how i'm going to react to that remains to be seen how henman , who served out the match at love and next plays michael stich , the retirementbound 1991 champion , reacted to the biggest victory of his career was predictable enough composed throughout the match , he was ecstatic afterward i think any time you beat a defending champion is a boost , but this is the biggest tournament of the world , and i 've just beaten last year s champion , henman said i'm not really the sort of person who is a bundle of nerves , henman said after showing none against krajicek this whole match is , for the sustained quality of tennis , some of the best i 've ever played sampras , who squandered a pair of match points in the third set against korda , could n't make the same boast but once they delved into a fifth set , sampras broke korda immediately and kept applying the pressure until he struck his final ace at 54 , 400 i worked harder than i would have liked , sampras said none of the four winners of the women s quarterfinals had to overextend themselves kournikova took advantage of majoli s sluggish service motion , which was caused by a strained back muscle and caused her to doublefault away the opening set hingis pounded denisa chladkova , 63 , 62 novotna defeated yayuk basuki of indonesia , 63 , 63 , and sanchez vicario , the runnerup to steffi graf here in 1995 and 1996 , trounced nathalie tauziat , 62 , 75 sanchezvicario and novotna had an acrimonious relationship even before they disbanded their doubles partnership at the end of last year so when the spaniard was informed that novotna planned to exploit sanchezvicario s forehand in their semifinal , she rose to the bait she can talk after she s won a grand slam , said sanchez vicario , who already owns three of the coveted singles titles photo tim henman of britain , seeded 14th , making return at wimbledon yesterday in upset of fourthseeded richard krajicek of the netherlands , last year s winner \( agence francepresse \)
a federal immigration judge in manhattan yesterday rejected the government s effort to deport a former irish republican army bomber who had served 12 years in prison , saying that his 1975 attack on a police barracks in northern ireland was not a terrorist act in refusing to deport the man , brian desmond pearson , 45 , now a carpenter in pearl river , ny , judge phillip t williams called the attack a political offense judge williams wrote that he made the distinction after considering the nature of the political situation in northern ireland at the time , as well as the context , mode , target and purpose of the attack the attack was also not out of proportion to the political object sought nor was it of an atrocious nature , the judge wrote sufficient warnings were given to avoid personal injuries , and the target of the attack was a legitimate military target as a combatant in the conflict at least six other former ira members in the united states , including noel gaynor in bloomfield , nj , are fighting similar deportation attempts by the federal immigration authorities but judge williams emphasized that his ruling applied to mr pearson s circumstances and should not be considered a general opinion of other actions by the ira or other groups while the ruling may have political or intellectual weight , it is not binding on other immigration judges the immigration and naturalization service may appeal the ruling to the immigration board of appeals , which sets precedent for the nation s immigration judges and either side may appeal a decision by that board to the federal courts after yesterday s ruling , immigration service lawyers said they had not yet decided whether they would appeal but mr pearson s supporters wasted no time organizing a victory party at the irishamerican center in blauvelt , ny bagpipes played and people sang god bless america and irish nationalist songs mr pearson , who was convicted of acting as the getaway driver for the 1975 bombing of a royal ulster constabulary barracks , walked in to applause and gave the crowd of 150 a thumbsup sign i'm totally excited , mr pearson told the crowd we got what we wanted mr pearson , who is married to an american and has a 6yearold daughter , added the judge understood what kind of background i grew up in one of total occupation where we were fighting for basic civil rights it s been proven i'm no threat to the united states of america the british lie was exposed today today was the first step in undermining the lie but he added , i wo n't be totally relieved until the appeal is withdrawn in addition to finding that mr pearson could not be deported as a terrorist , judge williams granted him permission to remain in the united states under two provisions of federal immigration law first , mr pearson married a united states citizen , and his daughter is a citizen and second , the judge ruled that mr pearson has a legitimate claim for asylum because of fears of retaliation by loyalist paramilitary groups if he returned to ireland this court needs to look no further than to events of the past two weeks to determine that violence committed by both parties to the conflict have continued with unfortunate results , the judge wrote , citing a march 14 shooting by a loyalist paramilitary group under these circumstances , any reasonable person would fear persecution , especially where , as here , the respondent has been identified as possessing a political opinion in opposition to that held by the loyalist paramilitary groups and the royal ulster constabulary an official at the british embassy , who spoke on condition that he not be identified , said that the matter was one between mr pearson and the united states , but that none of the former ira members would have any need to fear persecution if they returned to northern ireland mr pearson s case began after he applied to remain in the united states in 1991 , based on his marriage a review of his status determined that he had served 12 years in prison for his role in the 1975 bombing he was also convicted in northern ireland of being an active member of the ira , although he denied in immigration court that he was ever sworn into the group arguing that federal immigration law required that mr pearson be deported as a terrorist and a criminal , officials of the immigration service denied his application mr pearson continued to argue his case and also applied for asylum mr pearson s case drew vocal support from local residents and members of congress according to a supporter , representative peter t king , 62 members of congress signed a letter urging president clinton to grant mr pearson asylum and drop the deportation matter mr pearson also became part of a group of former ira members who moved to the united states and have sought to remain here rather than face return to ireland , northern ireland or britain mr pearson s lawyer , martin galvin , said judge williams s decision was an application of a succession of rulings that distinguished legitimate political struggles from criminal acts he asserted that the judge s ruling should be applied to similar cases i am saying you have to look at these individuals , examine the morality of their actions , he said simply apply american law supporters of mr pearson said they hoped that the immigration service would let the ruling stand we are hoping that the administration will see fit not to spend any more of the taxpayers' money , said john f cawley , chairman of the brian pearson support committee brian pearson is a hardworking member of the community , a family man he is not a threat to the national security of this country or any other country in assessing whether mr pearson s action in the bombing constituted a terrorist act , judge williams gave particular emphasis to the fact that the target was a military barracks used by the royal ulster constabulary and that government property , as opposed to the indiscriminate bombing of a civilian populace , was the target of said attack this court in no way finds that all actions committed by the ira are political offenses , or should be considered legitimate political violence , judge williams wrote the preponderance of the evidence suggests that the ira has committed various acts of violence which have resulted in the unfortunate loss of life and injury to numerous unarmed , innocent civilians , and which by the definitions set forth by congress , and applied by this court , would clearly and

the sight of 500 russian children , formally dressed and primly waltzing on a sunday morning , is one of the endearing moments of the annual ballroom competition of the imperial society of teachers of dancing the imperial s fourday event , which began thursday , traditionally draws russian families from four dance schools in brooklyn and one in clifton last year s competition , in a large ballroom at bally s park place casino hotel , also drew 1 , 500 other dancers from as far away as california , canada and florida lorraine hahn , president of the society , said it was so successful because it was in atlantic city we started having our competitions in atlantic city long before the casinos were there , she said i remember going out on the boardwalk after a competition and feeling that blast of ocean air it was the best thing about being there this year , though , the competition has moved 60 miles west of the boardwalk to the cherry hill hilton why \? not enough of the dancers were gambling they had a slot tournament on the weekend of our competition , and they wanted to use the big ballroom , mrs hahn said our people did n't gamble enough to make tying up the space worthwhile cornelius larkin said mrs hahn s difficulty with the casino is not unique the entire casino industry is discouraging weekend meetings and conventions , said mr larkin , an executive with the new jersey chapter of the american trial lawyers association and a board member of the new jersey society for association executives he said a good number of relatively small groups like mrs hahn s are not getting their contracts renewed , or told to change the date to midweek this becomes a problem if you have a group like hers , with half the people in school during the week , or like mine , whose members earn their living during the week , he said next month , mr larkin expects to release a study of atlantic city s convention business commissioned by the new jersey society of association executives , a group of meeting planners based in belle mead preliminary findings are mixed , he said getting rooms on a weekend is easier , he said but rollbacks in regulatory requirements have permitted casinos to convert meeting space to gambling areas in the last three years , the casinos have converted 150 , 000 square feet of meeting space to gambling , and none of it has been replaced , mr larkin said what is left is being used for what the casinos call player events to bring in gamblers he said the convention and visitors bureau wants to help , but what leverage do they have \? the offer of space in the new convention center , due to open may 1 , does not help because the smallest spaces they offer in the new center are too big for some of these groups , and you have to rent that space , he said so your costs are higher , and the convention center hotel is nowhere near the boardwalk when you have a meeting in a casino hotel , you 're on the boardwalk and you get the cost of the meeting space included sharon pearce , a spokeswoman for bally s park place , said that the casino was not discouraging weekend meetings and that its decision not to renew the dance society s contract had nothing to do with the casino s slot tournament or how much the dancers gambled bally s lost approximately 49 , 000 in room , food and beverage revenue over the period of two years when this group failed to live up to their contractual commitment , she said she added that bally s had 270 meetings scheduled for 1997 , a significant number of them on weekends , including an arthur murray dance competition in december mrs hahn acknowledged that her dancers did not use all the rooms allotted they could n't get them , she said the contract required that rooms we reserved that were n't booked a month before the competition went back to the casino anyone who wanted a room after that was told that the hotel was sold out she said her group would not return to atlantic city we 're soured on the town photo ballroom enthusiasts in the imperial society of teachers of dancing contest at bally s park place last year they wo n't be back this year \( noah greenberg \)
wagenia , congo this fishing village is authentic it has been here so long that the wagenias boast that they were the first africans to know how to swim but because its nets extend into the famous stanley falls and because it is right next to congo s thirdlargest city , kisangani , it is also something of a national monument there s a decaying arch at the village entrance commemorating visits by mobutu sese seko , the former president , and the elaborate nets that the villagers hang in the falls were once featured on the national currency these days , though , any visitor here , watching a sixinch fish struggling to wriggle out of a 10foot trap while a wagenia villager reaches a long arm in after it , knows exactly how the fish feels congo has just fought a civil war , and tourists are few and far between and it has been a long time since fishing was enough to pay the village s bills by itself so when a couple of outoftowners appeared in the village one recent day , interrupting a lateafternoon soccer game , 20 young men broke off from the crowd to walk with them the day s catch , it was apparent , had arrived stanley falls better known here as the chutes des wagenia have none of the drama of niagara falls in new york or victoria falls in zimbabwe they are really a series of rapids with drops of eight feet or so their historical importance is that they made the river congo impassable , so the town of stanleyville had to be built as a terminus for a short railroad that carries passengers and freight around the cataracts to the upstream boats and barges in recent weeks , it has carried hutu refugees out of the forest under their legendary chief , lowao , the wagenia built villages on both sides of the falls and the small islands in between they are considered a separate tribe , and they say their name either means nomads or derives from the local word for speaking and means people who talk too much they fish by building log scaffoldings over the falls and suspending rows of coneshaped nets from them everything , including the ropes , is made of jungle vines and trees but like the impossibly ordered cuteness of some restored new england whaling town , the painful authenticity here seems a bit fishy , since african villagers are usually remarkable at recycling 20thcentury castoffs old cans into toys , old tires into sandals nylon rope would last longer and , in fact , young boys who are not putting on a show for the tourists weave their hand nets out of nylon thread and weight them with bits of lead that they strip off underwater electric cables but the authentic nets produce income from more than one source the men want to know would you like to see how they fish \? asked jeff ngazi n sila lissa , a villager who says he divides his time between tending his family s net and studying sociology at the university of kisangani they will show you , if you will give them something even though fetching scenes were unfolding free at the water s edge a man climbing out of his net with his catch stuck deep in his mouth , a woman washing her clothes , children dangerously deep in the rapids with hand nets the men seemed quite insistent in the prewar days , when the local government was organized enough to staff the booth near the arch , money would be collected there and used , at least in part , for the general good of the village but now that booth is a tiny store , its shelves stocked with detergent and matches so the villagers have to fend for themselves mr ngazi said the official entrance price used to be 20 for a small camera and 30 for a big camera although that seemed high for a country where the average income is 150 a year , it was agreed to , and a dozen men eased themselves out over the torrent on the wet logs to demonstrate nethoisting while mr ngazi answered questions a few villagers slip each year and are dashed to death on the rocks , he said only old men fish at night because the river is stalked by phantoms who have the heads of men and the bodies of crocodiles and eat young people there are many kinds of fish , but the two prize catches are hydroxon goliathe and captain for a large captain , you can get even 200 in the market and buy clothes and food and pay school fees for the children , mr ngazi said beside him on the riverbank , a boy built a tiny fire on a rock , wrapped a few wet fingerlings in a leaf , squeezed on peppers and lime , and plunged the leaf purse into the flames to cook despite the river s bounty , times got steadily worse in wagenia in the 32 years of mr mobutu s rule as inflation rose and tourism disappeared the whole village is ecstatic that the rebels led by laurent kabila ousted mr mobutu , and hopes that good times are just around the river bend now we shall eat bread , like americans , mr ngazi said we shall have one goat for one person even one cow for one person , like america ! we shall be very full like mike tyson ! but as the demonstration ended in a pink sunset over the falls , it became clear that uncertain times mean other problems for a small village with the new national government still getting organized , there is no legal chief the kind of authority figure who could take 30 and distribute it evenly so a shouting match developed on the riverbank over whose hand would accept the money in the end , mr ngazi did , and quickly pocketed 20 of it , escalating shouting into shoving the walk back was a long gauntlet of outstretched palms and whispered demands , and the car departed in a light shower of local blessings if the catch had been better , they would have been fish guts photos at stanley falls in congo , the visitors are few and far between these days , and those who venture there are prey to the local fishermen two young girls used a veil as a net while fishing in the falls \( stephen crowley the new york times \) map showing the location of wagenia , congo fishing these days falls short of paying the bills in wagenia
atlanta , jan 17 although evidence and common sense point to an abortion clinic as the target of the first bomb blast at a suburban atlanta office complex on thursday , there is little doubt among investigators that a second blast , an hour later and 100 feet away , was aimed at rescue workers and lawenforcement officers who responded to the first explosion two cars parked near the location of the second bomb , beside a large trash bin at one corner of the adjoining parking lot , absorbed much of the force of that second explosion and shielded the people in the crowded parking lot including police officers , firefighters , reporters and agents from the federal bureau of investigation and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms from greater harm these were two very powerful bombs , said kent b alexander , the united states attorney here to me , the most remarkable thing about this case so far is no one was killed six people were hurt in that second blast outside the sandy springs professional building north of atlanta , but no one was seriously injured and only one an fbi agent who received a bruise at the base of his brain was still hospitalized on friday but at least one person , standing near the site of the second bomb , might have died if the cars including one belonging to the fulton county police department had not been parked there , beside the bin , investigators said the bomb went off between the bin and the cars , knocking several people to the ground and cutting at least two people with flying shrapnel it was sheer fortuity , mr alexander said of one car , which had been moved from another parking space and placed , by pure chance , in the path of the blast , apparently just minutes before but for that car absorbing this blast , i think people would have died investigators today combed the area around the blast site , finding pieces of shrapnel blocks away and some metal pieces of the roof of a sevenstory office building nearby mr alexander , acting as a spokesman for the combined agencies , said investigators would be cautious about releasing information about the makeup of the bomb and other details in the inquiry because it might hinder prosecution no one has taken responsibility for the attack , which is unusual in abortion clinic bombings mr alexander said investigators have received a myriad of leads , much of what you 'd expect , ranging from antiabortion to militia so far , he said , we 've received over 200 calls from those calls , a number of good leads are developing he said investigators are not assuming that the clinic was the target of the first blast at the office building , which also houses dentists , lawyers and other professionals the first bomb exploded without warning at 9 30 am , just outside the the firstfloor atlanta northside family planning services clinic , where abortions , among other services , are provided the blast wrecked the operating room and waiting room , and gouged out a section of the outside wall then , as investigators and television news crews filled the parking lot , the second blast sent them running apparently no one checked the area beside the trash bin if we were expecting a second bomb , we would n't have been there , said louis graham , the fulton county police chief like others , he said he believed the second bomb was intended for investigators it tells me that they really are not all that concerned with innocent victims , said j angelo corlett , an assistant professor of philosophy at georgia state university and an expert on political terrorism , referring to the bombers no patients were scheduled at the clinic that day only two people were inside neither was hurt mr alexander and other investigators said there was no reason to think there was a second bomb nearby , which explains why the parking area was filled with people but two bombs , placed in the same general area and strategically timed to hurt rescuers and lawenforcement people , are a common tactic of terrorists overseas , experts on terrorism say antiterrorist groups call them sucker bombs the bomber draws a crowd with one device , purely to detonate a second , often more powerful device in their midst that was apparently the plan of the bomber at the office complex , no matter whether the bomb was aimed at the abortion clinic , federal agents or someone else , the experts said as bombings go , this one seemed particularly coldblooded , investigators said they are n't taking credit for it , said mr corlett , the professor at georgia state they are not explaining why it happened there was no forewarning , so no one knows how many innocent people could have been harmed by that i think they would say that none of these people in america , none of these people who are n't in our group , is innocent such bombs also leave a more vivid image , he said you not only see the destruction after the fact of a first bomb , but in a few seconds you experience it , if the cameras actually catch it as they did yesterday , he said mr alexander said investigators would know soon whether this bomb was similar in makeup to the one used in the still unsolved bombing in centennial olympic park last summer because of that blast , people in atlanta were particularly sensitive to this attack some employees in and around the building said they were frightened to go back to work and mayor bill campbell asked police officials to send officers to guard atlanta abortion clinics the feminist majority foundation reported on thursday that a survey of 312 clinics around the country showed that 30 percent reported acts of violence last year , a decrease from 39 percent in 1995 but while the numbers of incidents has slightly declined , the degree of violence has not , said eleanor smeal , the foundation s president i have noticed a general trend of escalation in antiabortion commentary , she said , that has turned into tragic fact the first shooting of a doctor was just of the doctor then they said if you are assisting the doctor , then you are a problem , too the next time , they shot the doctor and his escort then they started talking about a war zone anybody in the war zone could be shot , she said , and anybody protecting the war zone photo two cars , destroyed by the second bomb on thursday at an atlanta office complex ,

london , may 21 viewed in isolation , genista mcintosh s resignation as chief executive of the royal opera house at covent garden last week hardly merited much public attention she was hardly a household name , she had been in the post only four months and she was promptly replaced by an experienced arts administrator , mary allen yet in the process of stepping down , mrs mcintosh , 51 , won more than her designated few minutes of fame she said she was leaving because of ill health , but the time is long past when pronouncements by the royal opera house were taken at face value smelling intrigue and eager to trace a plot , british newspapers insisted she had been ousted and demanded to know why the timing of the shakeup could not have been worse on july 14 , the mid19thcentury theater will close for two and a half years for a 350 million expansion and modernization , leaving 280 of its 800 permanent employees out of work and its two companies , the royal opera and the royal ballet , wandering london through december 1999 further , with morale in the house plummeting , stagehands are threatening to strike this month for the first time since 1991 failure to settle the dispute over payments during tours would lead to cancellation of many productions , deepening the theater s budget problems a strike would threaten the very future of the house , lord chadlington , chairman of the royal opera house , said in an interview but none of this would have caused much stir were it not part of a continuing melodrama that has repeatedly thrust covent garden into the headlines over the last four years its travails in the 199394 season were even captured in a sixpart bbc television documentary , the royal opera house , being broadcast in the united states by pbs on thursdays through june 12 \( channel 13 broadcasts the program at 10 pm in the new york city area \) there has always been simmering resentment that taxpayers' money a 30 million annual grant from the arts council of england is used to subsidize the lyrical amusement of an elite minority but this bubbled to the surface only in 1995 when covent garden won a 125 million grant from the profits of a new national lottery to help pay for its refurbishment suddenly london tabloids began comparing the needs of opera toffs and hardpressed charities , and the royal opera house was thrown on the defensive , struggling to justify itself by saying it received less public money than any other opera house in europe and by promising to lower its seat prices to become more accessible the bbc documentary put the royal opera house even more in the public s eye covent garden was courageous or foolhardy in allowing a bbc crew full access to its corridors , offices and stage for a year , and the programs showed management squabbles , power struggles and divas' tiffs in an almost victorian setting still more problems lay ahead despite covent garden s success in winning money for its redevelopment \( it has also raised about 60 percent of its goal of 160 million in donations \) , it had the headache of finding somewhere for the royal opera and the royal ballet to perform for seasons whether through misfortune or mismanagement , repeated attempts to find a new home for the companies fell through by the time mrs mcintosh took over from jeremy isaacs as the house s chief executive on jan 1 this year , with construction well under way and barely six months to go before the theater was to be torn apart , the companies had nowhere to go lord gowrie , the chairman of the arts council , called the situation a shambles mr isaacs sniped back that the arts council s failure to protect public financing of the arts was not a pretty sight but mrs mcintosh was able to present the complex wanderings of the royal opera and the royal ballet over the next two seasons as a triumph for democracy the companies will appear in less exclusive districts of london and offer quality culture at reduced prices it is a powerful opportunity to challenge preconceptions , extend boundaries and make new friends , she said , announcing the program for the 199798 season , the royal opera will present full opera productions at the barbican theater , the shaftesbury theater and royal albert hall and concert versions at royal festival hall , barbican hall and again albert hall the royal ballet will be more settled in the labatt s apollo in hammersmith and festival hall for the 199899 season , most productions should be concentrated in the newly refurbished sadler s wells theater keith cooper , covent garden s director of corporate affairs , said the house had begun discussing how programming would evolve after the royal opera reopens the house with verdi s falstaff and the royal ballet reopens with the nutcracker suite as for future pricing , he said officials were looking at how to reconcile public funding , donations , sponsors , accessibility etc then , out of the blue , mrs mcintosh announced her resignation on may 13 it was quite a shock , mr cooper said , conceding that he had seen no signs that the departing chief executive was unwell soon the rumor mill was working overtime many newspapers favored the version that she had fallen out with either lord chadlington or vivien duffield , the no less powerful chairman of the royal opera house trust , which is responsible for fundraising there was also speculation that she had been given the title but not the power to run the house , that she was overwhelmed by the complexity of running two companies and that she wanted to return to her former post as general manager at the royal national theater royal opera officials closed ranks in a letter to the times of london , mrs mcintosh said the official statement tells all there is to tell lord chadlington called mrs mcintosh an absolutely fabulous manager and said her departure was a huge loss to covent garden lord gowrie praised the choice of mary allen , until now secretary general of the arts council , as the chief executive mrs duffield said she was saddened that mrs mcintosh was unwell and expressed amazement at what she had read of the case in the press despite everything , she said , fundraising for the new covent garden was going well i am raising money on the basis of what is on stage and not of what is written about us , most of which is untrue , she said in a telephone interview indeed , in all the heated political debate about the royal opera house , little heed is paid to the fact that ballet and opera productions remain at the highest level , as if this could be taken for granted for british newspapers , however , it is the soap opera taking place inside the house that provides the most entertainment under the headline covent garden stages its own plot of rivalry and revenge , the times of london commented in an editorial that after the house reopened , there might be a surprise finale if the present cast showed any sign of being able to run a professional opera house as easily as they can arrange a royal gala performance or a fracas in a crush bar photo mary allen , former secretary general of the arts council of england , is the new chief executive of the royal opera \( robert h smith \)
betrayal trauma the logic of forgetting childhood abuse by jennifer j freyd 232 pp cambridge , mass harvard university press 2495 everyone prefers to avoid painful emotions failure , bereavement , fatal illness we may first simply refuse to believe these things could happen to us life itself eventually forces acceptance but suppose our pain comes from betrayal by someone dear to us , and suppose the betrayer \( and everyone else \) behaves as if nothing untoward has happened \? what would stop us from blotting the hateful experience from our minds , at least until some stimulus forced us to confront it \? one might think , therefore , that if adults sometimes claim to have retrieved buried memories of childhood sex abuse , the claims should be fairly uncontroversial far from it for several years a storm has raged around recovered memories , and the author of betrayal trauma the logic of forgetting childhood abuse jennifer j freyd , a professor of psychology at the university of oregon finds herself at the eye of it in many quarters , assertions that the mind can erase yet subsequently recapture horrific memories are greeted with skepticism , even indignation in ms freyd s case , the issue is complicated by personal factors in 1991 she herself recovered memories of abuse , only to have them vehemently and publicly denied by her own mother her parents and others went on to found an organization \( the false memory syndrome foundation \) that seeks to brand most recovered memories as fabrications the recoveredmemory controversy is fueled in part by the high stakes if genuine memories are rejected , perpetrators get off scotfree and victims are doubly victimized if fabricated memories are accepted , the lives and reputations of the innocent are blighted since it s easier to see oneself as wronged innocent than skulking perpetrator , males tend to empathize more with the second situation \( one thinks , if falsely accused , how could i defend myself , given the absolute privacy surrounding such acts \? \) but another source of skepticism comes , ironically enough , from selfinduced blindness to unacceptable fact the same force that buries memories of abuse for many decades , anthropologists unanimously endorsed the existence of an incest taboo formulated and obeyed in all cultures sociobiologists pounced with delight on an apparent textbook case , a part of culture clearly designed to avoid the maladaptive consequences of interbreeding none remarked on the oddity of prohibiting something that nobody practiced as one sexologist has noted , the only incest taboo is the taboo against talking about it ms freyd s book needs and deserves to be placed in this wider context given her personal involvement , one could have excused her for taking a polemical approach to her great credit , she does not betrayal trauma is a thoughtful , judicious and thorough scholarly analysis of a subject that has hitherto generated more heat than light anyone who tackles it has to answer two questions , why \? and how \? why should memories of incestuous abuse be suppressed when many traumatic memories experiences of vietnam veterans , for example recur incessantly , in harrowing detail , waking and sleeping \? ms freyd s answer is logical and convincing abuse of a child by a beloved parent or caregiver constitutes a breach of trust , and no betrayal is more emotionally painful but the child , wholly dependent on the abuser s care and protection , cannot escape one way of coping is simply to suppress the fact , a way made all the easier by the conspiracy of silence that surrounds incest even children who complain to the nonabusing parent all too often meet with denial the second oftenasked question is , how could the mind destroy information and then miraculously recover it \? as ms freyd points out , there are lots of ways to forget , and lots of ways to remember cases of memory loss range from vague memories reinterpreted as nonabusive through many varieties of partial loss to the complete blankingout of whole sections of the victim s life although the mechanisms involved are far from fully understood , ms freyd marshalls the psychological , neurological and cognitivescience literature with impressive skill to suggest several plausible possibilities her work serves as a salutary reminder that if treated as serious science rather than media hoopla the recoveredmemory debate could provide a significant window on mindbrain relationships anyone interested in the latter will find much stimulating material here some neurological studies not mentioned \( for instance , michael gazzaniga s work on splitbrain patients \) also support ms freyd s contention that the mindbrain can simultaneously not know and know , and that appropriate prompting can retrieve lost memories ms freyd accepts that some claims of recovered memory may be fabricated , and insists that each claim be examined case by case she could , perhaps , have looked a little closer at possible fabrication mechanisms she suggests false memories might be due to therapists causing or implanting them in clients , implying therapeutic bad faith as a necessary precondition but consider the following scenario an honest therapist takes on a sincere client whose symptoms could be caused by childhood sex abuse the therapist is paid to find a cure , the client desperate to discover one for the first time in history , child sex abuse has a high public profile and memory , as ms freyd well knows , is not a fixed photographic record but a continuing , collaborative , socially driven process it hardly strains the imagination to envisage a folie a deux in which client and therapist become trapped in a vortex of selffulfilling suspicions ms freyd might also have discussed factors that could lead guilty parents to dismiss recovered memories as fabrications among them , mechanisms of denial similar to those that erase memories in victims' minds but , perhaps wisely , she limits her scope to how and why memories can be lost and recovered she has a complex enough case to argue she argues it fairly and with virtuoso skill , blending vivid anecdote with statistical evidence , firstperson accounts with research reports , in a highly literate and engaging style partisan passions , alas , are seldom quenched by reason but unblinkered readers will surely agree that ms freyd s book places recovered memories squarely on the cognitivescience agenda her diagnosis of their source may well turn out to be correct
it was a bitter cold morning , and a fitful wind howled through already cacophonous hell s kitchen crumpled paper and shreds of plastic skittered up and down the street business was drowsy at the market diner over on 11th avenue three cops , in a nononsense mood , slid into the booth behind him charles durning gave a quick look and said nothing a couple of guys in raggedy clothes were eyeing him from the stools one wore a lupine smile and was fishing for something in his pocket mr durning rubbed his chin what was he going to do \? he was going to order an omelet rye toast black coffee inconceivable as it seems , not every scene in the actor charles durning s life is for the purpose of entertaining an audience sometimes he is simply eating sometimes he is simply being charles durning it is easy to believe that he never has time for that extolled as the king of character actors , mr durning has by his tabulation performed in more than 200 plays , 60 movies and a preposterous number of television shows restless as an alley cat , he begrudges every idle moment the only vacation he will consider is a part in national lampoon s summer vacation iii he looks the way he always has , like the corner butcher , the gas man , the fellow who demonstrates vacuums but he can play anybody he has been a detective , an affectionate father , the mayor of a small town , a clown , a mafia don , a plantation owner , a comic nazi , a governor , a former pimp , a monsignor , a drug dealer , a cranky old man , the president , and pope john xxiii there was never a picture built around me , he said of his characteractor lot every time i thought it was built around me , the leading lady had that part steve mcqueen told me once , 'you 're going to break through' that was 20 years ago i'm not saying that bitterly i'm not bitter i 've had a great career i have plenty of work he won a tony award in 1990 for his performance as big daddy on broadway in cat on a hot tin roof , and his habit has been to do at least one play a year somewhere now he is in town to costar with julie harris in the national actors theater revival of the gin game , directed by charles nelson reilly and opening tonight at the lyceum theater on broadway the twocharacter play by d l coburn , which won a pulitzer prize in 1978 , dwells on a pair of lonely yet combative inhabitants of a seedy retirement home and their collision of wills over lopsided hands of gin rummy he s just the best , ms harris said of mr durning when i first saw charlie , it was in central park , i think in 'the tempest' i thought , i'm seeing a man in the 20th century , but it s as if it s the 17th century he s a true shakespearean clown how is it possible \? that s part of charlie s nature he s the perfect clown then he has this serious , sensitive side the play requires him to teach ms harris gin and then to lose constantly and insufferably to her it s a little hard to take , for mr durning is sharp at cards he is an adept poker player he is a regular at a weekly game held at the hollywood home of the former sports agent norby walters at any given time the competition might consist of rod steiger , sid caesar , ed asner , george segal or angie dickinson each week there s a different legend sitting in front of you stealing your money , said dylan mcdermott , who stars in the television series the practice and was invited into the games by mr durning after they became friends while filming home for the holidays charlie is the best at bluffing , mr mcdermott said you never know what he s going to do one thing mr durning never plans to do is retire , though at 74 he finds his particular niche under siege for a long time , i figured i had a lock , he said i was a character man there was nobody on the horizon about five years ago , i realized that guys like jack lemmon , who were the stars , are getting older and are taking character roles and so i drop down a notch gene hackman is doing it too the only guy who seems safe is bobby duvall jason robards is doing character roles i would hire jason robards over charles durning anytime would n't you \? mr durning can be garrulous about his career , which has taken enough detours that he necessarily becomes profoundly discursive i have a convoluted life that i ca n't even figure out sometimes , he said part of the drill for acting aspirants is to hold one menial job or another no one except charles durning , however , has held every menial job he is a native of highland falls , ny , near the united states military academy at west point his father was in the army , and his mother washed cadet uniforms at the west point laundry his father was born in ireland and hated the english yet when world war i broke out , he joined the canadian army so he could serve with the english his family asked him why , and he said he did n't know the action prompted the united states to renounce his citizenship , which did n't much bother him he lost a leg in the war and was exposed to mustard gas he was never able to work again and he died from the effects of the gas when his son was 12 death called far too often on the durning household the actor was one of 10 children five sisters died of scarlet fever and smallpox three succumbed in the space of two weeks
when the state sent 100 , 000 welfare recipients a letter in spanish that greeted them , in a south american colloquialism for passive partners in gay sex , heriberto sanchez soto was dismayed but not surprised i did n't think the letter made sense in english , said mr sanchez soto , a director of the hispanic directors association , a coalition of some 25 hispanic community groups the welfare department s letter , which saluted its readers as receptor receptora instead of the proper senor senora , highlights a problem that municipal and state governments face daily how englishonly officials communicate with new jersey s 1 million foreignborn residents , newcomers who speak only spanish , polish , italian , arabic or any of dozens of other languages how do they let residents know the days recyclables are collected , or the circumstances under which welfare checks will be cut off \? the answer , as old as new jersey s history of immigration , is that they bumble along today s government officials communicate with latinos and arabs the way their turnofthecentury predecessors did with italians and german jews they pull employees who know foreign languages from their tasks to translate conversations or notices they call on unofficial leaders of ethnic groups fluent in two tongues they ask immigrants to bring a friend or relative who speaks english naturally , some bloopers and confused messages are exchanged along with information it s never a neat , smooth process , said james w hughes , dean of the edward j bloustein school of planning and public policy at rutgers university it s always messy and erratic immigrants gravitate to local stores , where networks of information develop , he said those that are here for a while tell others when garbage is being collected the state department of human services employs three spanish translators to work on letters and notices , said john mckeegan , a spokesman all written messages from human services are sent in english and spanish william waldman , human services commissioner , apologized for the badly spelled , blooperfilled letter sent out this month the mistakes occurred when too many people fiddled with the words but none took charge enlisting the help of fluent employees or asking a client to bring an englishspeaking friend or relative is haphazard and occasionally dangerous , mr sanchez soto said it can result in errors and is indicative of the state government s indifference to hispanic immigrants the welfare letter exhibited a lack of multicultural competency , he said they ask a receptionist hired to answer the phone in english to translate spanish they need to hire people at the highest levels of decisionmaking literal translation is easy , he added but to make sense of the message , you need to know more than the language important messages require expert translation and knowledge of the field the errorriddled letter , for instance , was trying to explain new welfare regulations , including categories of people being cut from the rolls and time limits on receiving checks but municipal officials say informal , catchascatchcan translating work not only succeeds but can also foster a deeper level of communication friendship between immigrants and natives that goes beyond the relaying of information passaic county , long the first home of immigrants from around the world , is typical the clifton department of health counts on workers fluent in spanish and arabic to deal with its most populous ethnic groups its handbook and video on foodsafety regulations for restaurant workers has been translated into mandarin the town saved money by finding a local chineselanguage student to translate free , as a class project paterson , with residents of 53 different ethnic backgrounds , has always had to communicate in dozens of languages it happens every day , said mayor marty barnes by necessity , the municipal government uses established longtime residents , informal leaders in various ethnic groups public notices are printed in english , spanish and arabic latinos and arabs in city hall translate as part of their duties speakers of turkish and lebanese are told to bring back somebody who knows english when gangs of dominican and arabic boys were battling at paterson high schools in september , a task force of immigrant parents was appointed the crisis is over , but the task force still meets , translating messages to and from parents , teachers and school administrators , said joy a friedman , a spokeswoman for the school they 're finding out what the needs are , what s being said on the streets , she said two volunteer translators are nijmeh jaber and walid rabah , editors of the 20 , 000circulation arab voice newspaper , who are the parents of seven boys and one baby girl we speak with them arabic , said mrs rabah , explaining how she moves between arabic parents and teachers and school officials we do it to help our sons tomorrow they will be our life neighborly translating is one of the beauties of small municipal governments , said william g dressel , executive director of the new jersey league of municipalities the municipalities know these folks , he said they know who speaks for this particular ethnic group they do n't need state mandates or bureaucratic red tape to force them to communicate with nonenglishspeaking residents that leads to another question as old as immigration to new jersey just who does need the government s red tape \? and can anybody make a cogent translation of an inherently confusing governmental message \? mr hughes , the rutgers dean , can answer with scholarly authority government does n't communicate well in any case , he said it does n't communicate well in english therefore a letter in spanish that lists welfarebenefit cuts to young parents and rapists the state s version of parole violators is just carrying on the tradition photo nijmeh jaber and walid rabah , editors of the newspaper arab voice , who serve as volunteer translators in paterson \( don hogan charles the new york times \)

paris , may 23 president jacques chirac called the election on sunday for a new parliament in a gamble on the french voter the french leader wanted a mandate to keep trimming the welfare state and cutting deficits so that france would meet the requirements for a common european currency in 1999 but as the voting nears , leaders of the conservative parties in the government and of the socialist opposition agree that while most voters want the new currency , the euro , they do not want to endure more economic pain to get it in their campaigns , the left , led by lionel jospin of the socialist party , and the right , led by prime minister alain juppe , have softpedaled the idea of sacrifice instead , they have been promising to use the euro and other economic tools to stimulate the growth that is needed to lift france out of its chronic doubledigit unemployment , now at 128 percent as a result , almost no matter who wins , mr chirac may have an even harder time making further cutbacks in the welfare state after the elections than before , if more cuts turn out to be necessary to meet the criteria the quandary , hardly unique to france , has broad implications for the future of the 15nation european union , whose centerpiece over the next five years is the common currency project germany , with 112 percent unemployment , has started a national debate before its own elections next year about what to do about the high costs of the welfare state , which contribute to its economic woes germans , with memories of ruinous inflation in the 1920 s that contributed to the rise of the nazis , view a strong currency as the cornerstone of their prosperity since after world war ii at german insistence , france and all the rest of its european partners except britain agreed in the treaty of european union in 1992 to make the euro as sound as the german mark , which would disappear in 2002 along with the franc and the currencies of other countries that take part so germans and other europeans are closely watching the french elections , which conclude with a secondround runoff on june 1 , for signs of backpedaling on the rigor and discipline that all european leaders agree are necessary to get the euro off to a strong and sound start , one that will not cause a return of the high inflation of the 1970 s and early 1980 s here when europe was synonymous with economic growth and prosperity , people were enthusiastic and everybody wanted to join , mr jospin told a group of students in the mediterranean university city of montpellier a few days ago , after one of them asked him what he would do to make the european ideal vibrant again for the last 10 or 15 years , there has been only a narrow accountants' vision of europe , and a too narrow concentration on the monetary issue , he said it was an echo of criticisms he made , in an interview with le monde , of concessions on monetary rigor that france had made to germany , or certain german milieux mr juppe , who has been made enormously unpopular by budgetcutting policies to trim france s deficit down to the limit of 3 percent of gross national product spelled out in the european union treaty , had this to say the same day we must affirm that europe , like other great economic zones of the world , has a vocation for strong growth one of the ways of doing this is to make the euro an instrument for growth that may have fallen short of a promise to end austerity policies , but , mr juppe said we cannot leave everything up to the european central bank there should be an economic government for europe , as we have been asking for months and have now begun to obtain the opposition , and many voters , find fault not with the euro , whose coming they accept fatalistically , but with increased taxes and spending freezes mr juppe and mr chirac chose to cut the deficit to the level required for france to take part in it it s the problems of daily life that count in this election , and we blame this government for those , said gerard boussemart , a voter in the northern french town of bauvin the euro is n't the issue , he said with both the euro and most of the benefits of the french welfare state almost sacrosanct , other issues have come to the fore in the campaign they include corruption scandals affecting all the major parties , conservative plans to cut back on business taxes and payroll charges to pay for the welfare state , socialist promises to use government powers to create jobs and reduce working hours while maintaining benefits but many voters are skeptical about promises by the parties that have governed them for the last four decades the farright national front party , whose leader , jeanmarie le pen , opposes surrendering french sovereignty to europe , is expected to win a protest vote of around 15 percent of total ballots cast on sunday in the first round , candidates have to win at least 50 percent of the vote to get a seat in each of the 577 constituencies runoffs among leading votegetters will be held in districts where no one got a majority , and then the main question will be whether mr chirac s conservatives or the

bruce d kenyon is president and chief executive officer of the northeast nuclear energy company , which puts him in charge of all northeast utilities nuclear activities he was brought in from the south carolina electric and gas company last year to help get the company s four connecticut nuclear plants back in operation in the early 1980 s , northeast was considered one of the top nuclear plant operators in the country but because of safety and operating issues at the plants , the united states nuclear regulatory commission has taken the unusual step of not only placing them on a problem plant list , but also ordering that the plants not be restarted until the commission can be assured they will operate safely that means that more than half of the generating power in connecticut more than 3 , 200 megawatts at the three plants in waterford and one in haddam is unavailable , until as late as 1998 by some estimates and one of those plants , the connecticut yankee in haddam , is being taken out of service permanently because the cost to restart it would be too high last week , a report by rc brown associates for the state department of public utilities control concluded the problems at northeast utilities began a decade ago , are the result of poor management and that 1997 may be nu s last chance to arrest and reverse the clear decline in its performance richard j gallager , a northeast spokesman , said that while his company does not agree with the entire report , the conclusions are not a surprise because many come from internal assessments prior to current management s largescale changes we 're working very aggressively to address our management deficiencies , and part of that involved bringing in bruce kenyon , mr gallager said mr kenyon is a native of ohio who served five years in the navy , including a tour on a nuclear submarine and at the navy s nuclear power school he was at the millstone nuclear plants in waterford from 1970 to 1976 in various positions before moving to senior vice president for the nuclear division at pennsylvania power and light , then to south carolina he is a member of the electric power research institute and has been recognized by the american nuclear society for helping to develop methods to measure nuclear plant performance in 1986 he was the sole united states nuclear industry representative at the international atomic energy conference in vienna to review the chernobyl accident mr kenyon answered questions about the problems facing northeast utilities' nuclear operations during a recent interview at his office overlooking the millstone plants following are some excerpts from that discussion q if you had to write a 50word essay on what caused the nuclear problems at northeast , how would it go \? a i could say it in one word leadership leadership was n't doing its job there are a few obvious examples one is in not having set the right standards to run nuclear well , you have to strive for standards of excellence the situation here defaulted to regulatory minimums , simply trying to comply with regulations when you do that , you 're aiming at the bottom , and you 're going to fall low the organizational philosophy championed a highly centralized concept one of the consequences was that accountabilities were often very unclear large organizations , things get shuffled all over the place a third issue was , because they really were n't identifying the real root of the problem leadership they frequently endeavored not to prevent a problem but to control it the various processes , work processes and so forth that are part of any large complex organization , in particular a nuclear station , became more and more complex as you layer on these controls a problem happened , more controls another problem , another layer of controls and so on to the point where the processes became very difficult to use , very inefficient , and you developed an organization trying to get work done through processes that would not support things getting done in a reasonable fashion , and work built up that should have been done and could n't get done employees were frustrated because they saw things that were n't right , but they could n't deal with it q is there any single period you can say , this is where the problem started \? a since i left northeast 20 years ago , i followed its fortunes and from a distance , i could recognize performance starting to deteriorate , visavis the rest of the industry , as far back as the late 1980 s i'm not saying the problems did n't start sooner , but i could see a performance gap back that far , and as time went by the gap got wider and wider q a state audit has estimated the cost to fix the nuclear problems at 1 billion or more how does that compare with your own estimates \? a people are throwing around all kinds of numbers , and i do n't know what the right number is , and i'm frankly not really focused on that i'm focused on , what does it take to get this organization into a new and an appropriate way of doing business \? what does it take to improve the standards , the processes , to do the design reviews and upgrade the procedures \?
for months now , the federal reserve has been poised to raise interest rates , but has held off why \? the answer lies mainly in what the fed s chairman , alan greenspan , describes as a powerful recent force in the american economy job insecurity in his testimony to congress yesterday , he clearly elevated this insecurity to major status in central bank policy workers have been too worried about keeping their jobs to push for higher wages , he said , and this has been sufficient to hold down inflation without the added restraint of higher interest rates for more than a year now , mr greenspan has been gradually building his case that downsizing and job insecurity have altered the normal workings of the american economy , and yesterday he spelled out this view more pointedly and in more detail than before other factors have contributed to the softness in compensation growth despite a low unemployment rate , he said , but i would be surprised if they were nearly as important as job insecurity job insecurity , in mr greenspan s hands , is a rather complex monetary indicator that workers are fearful of losing their jobs is not in itself a sufficient explanation for their failure to push for significant wage increases the sense of job insecurity has to be rising that is , getting worse once it levels off , and workers become accustomed to their new level of uncertainty , their confidence may revive and the upward pressure on wages resume that is particularly true when the unemployment rate is quite low , as it is today , suggesting labor shortages that will foster greater competition for skilled workers inflation eventually rises as employers raise prices to pay for the higher labor costs job insecurity is notoriously difficult to measure and a lot of people think mr greenspan may be tilting at windmills some labor economists , like henry farber at princeton university , say , there is no direct evidence that job insecurity is higher than it was many traders in the bond market , who always seem braced for the next outburst of inflation , are impatient with the fed s focus on job insecurity the whole concept has never sat well with wall street , said david jones , chief economist at aubrey g lanston it just seemed like a rationalization to explain why wages had not yet accelerated in response to full employment others are convinced that american workers , whatever their past fears , have now moved beyond them referring to small recent increases in one or two wage measures , stephen s roach , chief economist at morgan stanley company , insisted that american workers were already giving off a classic signal of wage inflation to the extent the fed remains in denial on this point , he wrote in a newsletter mailed to clients this week , the greater the ultimate risks to inflation and interest rates the fed , however , persists in trying to measure job insecurity as a major , if transitional , factor in the inflation process the halfdozen or so polls and bits of information that mr greenspan and some other fed policy makers describe as indicators of job insecurity rose until recently , and now might be leveling off mr greenspan acknowledged this possibility yesterday , by saying that the transitional period may be drawing to a close even if it is , wages might not begin to rise immediately , says laurence h meyer , a fed governor once workers find themselves feeling no more insecure about their jobs from month to month , they might then need time to grow accustomed to the new , higher level of insecurity , taking weeks , perhaps , to feel sufficiently confident to push for wage increases again we do n't know whether job insecurity is still rising or not , mr meyer said yesterday , and if it no longer is , we do n't know whether the effects of the earlier rise are still playing out although he has never said so , mr greenspan may be attempting to use job insecurity to recalculate the flash point at which wage pressures tend to kick in until 1995 , most economists and fed policy makers thought that when the unemployment rate fell below 6 percent , labor shortages would start to embolden workers to press for higher wages , and higher wages would lead in turn to rising prices and higher inflation but the unemployment rate fell below 6 percent in late 1994 and below 55 percent early last year , and nothing happened to wages or inflation in either case encouraging mr greenspan and others at the fed to offer job insecurity as the principal explanation the unemployment rate , now 54 percent , has ranged between 52 and 54 percent over the last seven months , with little rise in wages mr greenspan , in speeches and congressional testimony , has emerged as the point man at the federal reserve in building the job insecurity thesis some other policy makers mr meyer , for example , and robert t parry , president of the federal reserve bank of san francisco have publicly echoed his views one or two others have described themselves as agnostics none of the fed s governors or the presidents of its regional banks the group that meets every six weeks or so to rule on interest rates have publicly opposed the greenspan concept , however doubtful some may be in trying to measure job insecurity , the indicators mr greenspan and other fed officials refer to most often are public opinion polls the decline in union strike activity job security provisions in new labor union contracts labor department data showing that downsizing had not eased off through 1995 , despite five years of economic expansion , and the reluctance of workers , reflected in labor department data , to risk quitting their jobs some people have offered changing technology as a reason for job insecurity , the story being that a lot of workers have not kept up with the new skills required by the new technology , said rob valletta , an economist at the san francisco federal reserve bank and there may be an erosion of trust between workers and firms mr greenspan , who subscribes to the technology argument , cited in his testimony yesterday a survey of workers at large corporations carried out by a polling company , international survey research corporation in chicago the survey , like others , shows a sharp rise in the level of job insecurity starting in 1990 , and a leveling off evident last year the company s polling included the employees of more than 400 big corporations in the united states that hired international survey to measure employee attitudes international survey then weighted and adjusted the figures in an attempt to make them representative of national feelings between 1979 and 1990 , no more than 24 percent of those polled ever answered yes to the question i am frequently concerned about being laid off then in the 1990 s , the number shot up , hitting 46 percent in 1995 and 1996 if this leveling off continues for all of 1997 , said john r stanek , president of international survey , then i am going to begin to take seriously that job insecurity has plateaued , but at a level much higher than in the 1980 s graph layoff worries tracks the percent of workers who agree with the statement i am frequently concerned about being laid off the findings were based on a survey of workers at 444 large companies that are clients of international survey

it sounds like an oldfashioned hollywood movie a dedicated couple start a boarding school for autistic children in a faded mansion in rural delaware struggling to make ends meet , they pool their personal resources to buy a racehorse named silk stockings the filly not only wins thousands but also makes harnessracing history , all for the sake of the children that is the way the story of the au clair school was told in the mid1970 s , in heartwarming television features and news articles across the country even 20 years later , the lingering glow of that kind of publicity did not hurt when the company showed up in washington and lobbied for what seemed like a tiny change in federal law but a closer look at au clair reveals a deeply troubled history , and a closer look at the littlenoticed change engineered by its founder , kenneth m mazik , shows that it sharply alters government policy on care for the poorest children the change has opened the way for forprofit orphanages to compete for the billions of dollars that the government spends each year to support poor children who are taken away from homes judged unfit it comes at a time when many experts predict that welfare changes will push thousands of children from their homes and into the care of the state historically , only foster families or nonprofit institutions , mostly charitybased , were eligible for this money it is now the last unlimited pool available for poor children the change was made without debate , unlike other measures in the sweeping welfare legislation signed into law last year through the efforts of the company , a single word nonprofit was deleted from an obscure paragraph of the 400page bill that dismantled six decades of poverty policy that small alteration is swelling the wave of business interest in the poor that has swept national corporations traded on wall street as they move deeper into sectors traditionally left to religious and philanthropic groups , public agencies and momandpop operations the companies that stand to benefit from the oneword change include managed mental health care giants , like the 1 billion magellan health services , and youthcare chains like the 2 , 500bed youth services international , started five years ago by the founder of the quick oilchange franchise jiffy lube , who grew up in an orphanage himself most were built on other government money , including medicaid and state foster care dollars mr mazik and other supporters of the change portray it as a minor adjustment that levels the playing field between nonprofit and forprofit institutions competing for the same children companies like his have always been able to get other kinds of federal money , but not to tap into the increasingly important child welfare pot the profit status of an institution makes little difference , they argue there are institutions with troubled childcare histories in both camps , they note , and even childwelfare advocates complain that taxexempt status is often just an accounting device but many child welfare experts say there are good reasons to fear the impact of forprofits on an already badly regulated child welfare system they say that forprofits have a financial duty to place the interests of their shareholders ahead of what is best for children , and that states are ill prepared to hold such companies accountable it s the fox guarding the chicken coop , said mark e courtney , a university of wisconsin scholar at the institute for research on poverty who has analyzed the impact of welfare policy on foster care the public agencies do n't have their act together well enough to hand over a huge chunk of the money to people who have an incentive to maximize profits at the expense of the children in care , mr courtney said an examination of au clair s rise based on a review of public records , internal company documents and more than 20 interviews with current and former employees and state regulators illustrates some of the perils a more profitdriven child welfare system is likely to face it shows how a company s push for profit can compromise care for children it shows that the chronic weaknesses in state regulation can be worsened when a company with rich resources lobbies for loopholes and influence and it shows how a change one that many now see as a vast shift in national policy could be quietly engineered by one man , without scrutiny over the years , mr mazik has been accused of mistreating children in his care and of evading meaningful government oversight , even as his company expanded to care for 130 disturbed children from 24 states at sites in bear and middleton , del , and mount dora , fla at yearly rates of more than 140 , 000 for each child mr mazik himself , in the late 1970 s , acknowledged beating a mentally retarded boy with a riding crop in front of several staff members that was one of the incidents at bear that he defended as therapeutic after staff members complained to the delaware authorities and the local newspaper that he was abusing children in his care
phnom penh , cambodia , july 24 in the days leading up to the cambodian coup earlier this month , khmer rouge guerrillas seemed to be provoking hun sen , the militarily powerful second prime minister , by dallying with his political rival and by taunting him in radio broadcasts from their jungle stronghold their machinations may have been just the impetus he needed after months of infighting and growing tensions , mr hun sen turned his armed forces on those of his rival coalition partner , prince norodom ranariddh , and seized sole power but whatever game the khmer rouge were playing , they appear in the end to have lost the coup has left them weaker and more isolated than ever any chance they may have had of negotiating an amnesty seems to have faded , and any alliance they may form with prince ranariddh s defeated soldiers will pose little threat to mr hun sen s government that much now seems clear what is less clear is just what was going on in the khmer rouge headquarters in anlong veng , and why five weeks after the prince began to offer a series of sensational accounts about turmoil in the khmer rouge leadership , none of his reports have been confirmed mr hun sen has described the entire episode as a magic trick masterminded by the evil genius of pol pot , the khmer rouge leader a number of foreign experts on the khmer rouge agree but there is no way to know whether pol pot himself was involved , or even whether he is still alive the 69yearold guerrilla has not been seen by foreigners since 1981 the answers may never be known this is a country where politics is played in the shadows , where illusion and disinformation are as much a part of politics as speeches and parliaments for the moment , mr hun sen holds the power in cambodia but his coup was only the most recent twist in a tangled history of alliances and rivalries that may not be laid to rest for years the latest chapter in the cambodia drama began nearly a year ago when several khmer rouge commands broke with pol pot s hardline leadership and defected to the government both mr hun sen and prince ranariddh coprime ministers with rival armies began lobbying vigorously for their allegiance in recent months , the stakes rose , with both sides reportedly sending representatives to talk with members of pol pot s inner circle at their northern headquarters in anlong veng in these negotiations , the prince had an advantage over his rival his royalist forces had been allies with the khmer rouge during a long civil war in the 1980 s against the vietnambacked communist government of mr hun sen that government had been installed in 1979 after a vietnamese invasion put an end to the fouryear rule of the khmer rouge during which more than a million people died mr hun sen had himself been a khmer rouge cadre until he broke with pol pot in 1977 and fled to vietnam in the three weeks leading up to the coup , the prince increased the pressure on mr hun sen with a series of startling reports about events in anlong veng he announced that the clandestine khmer rouge radio station was about to brodacast a pledge of allegiance to the government the prince s first report came on june 13 , when he announced that pol pot had killed his longtime friend , the former khmer rouge defense minister , son sen , and run over his body with a truck political analysts here said they believed that mr son sen had been the figure with whom mr hun sen had been negotiating the prince s reports continued pol pot had fled into the jungle , sick and swinging in a hammock pol pot had taken some of his supporters hostage , including another close aide , khieu samphan pol pot had been captured by his own men and would soon be turned over for trial for crimes against humanity none of these reports were confirmed indeed , their only apparent corroboration came in khmer rouge radio broadcasts these broadcasts were clearly aimed at provoking mr hun sen , whom they reviled as a puppet of vietnam it was a khmer rouge game through and through , said christophe peschoux , a scholar of cambodian history , in describing the prince s negotiations at first , mr hun sen was silent as the prince s reports emerged then he began to complain that the prince was transporting tough khmer rouge fighters into the capital in preparation for military action then he attacked on july 5 , mr hun sen s troops began what one of his aides called a moppingup action , targeting the strongholds of the prince s royalist troops on the outskirts of the city lost in the din of the big guns that morning was the promised khmer rouge broadcast pledging allegiance to the government too late to affect the course of events in a white paper issued three days later , mr hun sen s party said its armed attack came in response to what it called a strategy of provocation by the prince among several actions , these were said to include both the negotiations with the khmer rouge and an infiltration of guerrillas into phnom penh the military buildup and the alliance with the khmer rouge was virtually a declaration of war , the white paper said the importance of the militarization of the khmer rouge and their introduction to phnom penh by prince ranariddh s military advisers cannot be minimized , it said for the first time since 1978 , armed khmer rouge soldiers were present in the streets of phnom penh western diplomats have similarly suggested that the prince may have embarked on a tactic of provoking mr hun sen and mr hun sen had reason to be concerned about an emerging political alliance that could include the royalists , the khmer rouge and other smaller opposition groups a revival of the civilwar alliance of the 1980 s but little evidence has emerged to support mr hun sen s claim that the prince had brought khmer rouge fighters into the capital indeed , western experts who have analyzed the fighting on july 5 and 6 say there is stronger evidence to show that mr hun sen s forces included at least one unit of khmer rouge , commanded by gen keo pong , who defected with several hundred men in early 1996 if the khmer rouge meant to provoke an open split between prince ranariddh and mr hun sen , it seems to have succeeded but if the guerrillas were hoping to be embraced in a new alliance , they may be out of step with history it was the geopolitics of the cold war that provided the former alliance with its antivietnamese and antisoviet support from the west and china as well as its sanctuary in thailand the guerrillas' economic base an illegal gem trade disappeared last august with the largescale defections of their western commands and in phnom penh , the man in full control now is their enemy , mr hun sen he is less likely than prince ranariddh to negotiate safe passage for the remaining hardline leaders in anlong veng even if they were to hand over pol pot for trial they are more marginalized than ever , said david chandler , who has written widely about the movement they 've got nobody to deal with in phnom penh their foreign patronage is all gone they are n't going to get any deals from hun sen he does n't have to they are

one february night two years ago , a helicopter carrying ramzi ahmed yousef , the man accused of masterminding the world trade center bombing , sped along the east river on the last leg of mr yousef s journey from pakistan , where he had recently been captured , to detention and trial in the united states as the helicopter flew over midmanhattan , william a gavin , a senior official in the federal bureau of investigation s new york office , pushed up his captive s blindfold mr yousef squinted as his eyes adjusted to the light then mr gavin pointed at the trade center towers below , their lights glowing in the clear , cold night look down there , mr gavin said he told mr yousef they 're still standing mr yousef replied , they would n't be , if i had had enough money and explosives , recalled mr gavin , who has since retired mr yousef may have boasted of his role in the trade center blast , which killed six people and injured more than 1 , 000 on feb 26 , 1993 but as his trial begins in federal court in manhattan today , important questions remain about this figure and the extent of his participation in what at the time was the worst terrorist attack on american soil for example , did any country , group or person beyond mr yousef sponsor the trade center blast \? evidence in previous trials showed that the bombing cost less than 20 , 000 to carry out , but it is uncertain where the money came from there have been recent reports that three years before the blast , mr yousef lived in a house in pakistan paid for by osama bin laden , a wealthy saudi who has been accused of supporting middle eastern extremists , and who is currently under investigation by a federal grand jury in manhattan is there any connection between mr yousef s trial and the incident last week in brooklyn in which two men were arrested , accused of plotting suicidebomb attacks in new york city \? the judge in mr yousef s case , kevin t duffy , has agreed to ask the jurors individually this morning whether they would be prejudiced by the events in brooklyn or by last week s deadly suicide bombing in jerusalem in mr yousef s trial , which is likely to last three to four months , prosecutors are expected to focus not on the larger mysteries surrounding the defendant but on proving his guilt in the trade center blast a second defendant , eyad ismoil , is also on trial , accused of conspiracy there is certainly a legitimate public curiosity to the question of , was there a great force behind this , and if there was , who was it \? said henry j depippo , a former federal prosecutor who tried the first world trade center case , in 1993 and 1994 but you 're not likely to get the answers to questions in the context of a criminal trial because the prosecution is much more limited mr yousef fled the country on the night of the trade center bombing and was not present at the first trial , which ended with the convictions of four lowerlevel defendants after mr yousef s arrest in islamabad , pakistan , he was tried last year in federal court in manhattan and convicted of a second conspiracy a plot in manila , not carried out , to blow up 12 american passenger airliners for planning that crime what prosecutors called 48 hours of terror in the sky he faces a mandatory life prison term in both trials , prosecutors depicted mr yousef as a kind of evil genius , cunning and elusive and now , for the first time , he will stand trial directly for his role in the trade center blast the government is expected to present a streamlined version of its forensic and other evidence in the first case , as well as new evidence detailing mr yousef s role , including further statements mr yousef himself made to investigators about how he carried out the plot but beyond the court case , government officials seem no closer to answering whether he was a lone operator with a grudge against the united states , part of a loose band of international terrorists , motivated by religion or ideology , or a soldier for a national leader like saddam hussein of iraq in mr yousef s trial last year , in the manila bombing plot , a federal prosecutor called him the trainer , the bomb designer , the chief recruiter the architect of the whole scheme it s not one hundred percent certain who ramzi yousef is , said bruce hoffman , director of the center for the study of terrorism and political violence at st andrews university in fife , scotland i would say it s the trial of the impresario , mr hoffman said of the case beginning today he put everything together he recruited his team he had the technical expertise but it s hard to imagine that he did this , pulled it off and then popped off to manila , and then set in motion even more ambitious and egregious plans , all on his own last week , during pretrial hearings , mr yousef sat beside his lawyer , at times smiling , or talking with him but it seems unlikely that mr yousef will take the stand in his own defense and explain his activities last year , in the manila conspiracy trial , mr yousef was not only the defendant but also acted as his own lawyer he did not testify but the jury got a revealing look as investigators described six hours of interviews with him during the flight from islamabad after his capture according to the agents' testimony , mr yousef discussed his background and boasted about his manila and world trade center plots at one point , testified charles b stern , a special agent with the fbi , mr yousef drew a diagram which was said to have shown the placement of the van that exploded in the trade center garage but mr yousef apparently had second thoughts , mr stern said mr yousef tore out a significant piece of the diagram and ate it in the first world trade center trial , during which mr yousef was a fugitive , prosecutors seemed to keep their case deliberately narrow , said robert e precht , a defense lawyer in that trial it s as if the government basically used a zoom lens to focus on a very small part of the conspiracy , mr precht said , and i really had the profound feeling after the case that none of us had a full picture of what was really going on photo ramzi ahmed yousef was a fugitive during the first trial in the world trade center bombing case he and another defendant go on trial today

frankfurt , april 8 workers in what used to be east germany have endured wrenching changes since the berlin wall fell in 1989 , from the collapse of shipyards and chemical plants to soaring unemployment but today the financial pain of german reunification spread to what had been one of the few bright sections of the eastern economy agriculture when germany s highest court ruled that farmers have to pay back 6 billion in debt that the old collective farms ran up during the communist era the debts are likely to weigh on about 2 , 000 former collective farms , which were converted after reunification in 1990 into forprofit companies , for at least the next 10 years the ruling further angers the farmers because the german government has already forgiven billions of marks in debt owed by bankrupt stateowned factories and has pumped billions more into trying to rebuild them from the ground up because east germany s farms were built out of the big cooperatives favored by communist planners , they are bigger and more efficient than many west german familyowned farms if , after reunification , the old collective farms had been considered stateowned enterprises instead of just statecontrolled , their debt would have been forgiven years ago but because the cooperative farms were considered to be owned by their members , the new owners are being held responsible for both the debt and the rising amount of back interest the very least you can say is that this creates uncertainty , said eugen roth , managing director of agrar gmbh tottelstadt , a big farming company in the state of thuringen the decision does not recognize that the economic situation has changed completely since reunification the companies that borrowed money before are now at a disadvantage mr roth said the the court ruling should not bankrupt any farms , because a provision of the german unity treaty prohibits a bank from collecting payments unless a farm is profitable and limits the repayments to no more than 20 percent of a farm s annual profit nevertheless , the eastern german farming industry contends it is being unfairly treated in comparison with industries where billions of marks were written off since reunification , the german government has pumped more than 1 billion into the modernization of two big shipyards , only to see them collapse into bankruptcy anyway last week , the privatization agency that has supervised the sale of old state companies offered to sell the shipyards for one mark , about 60 cents , each the government has also pumped about 20 billion into the old stateowned chemical industry , including the forgiveness of billions in old debts mr roth and others also argue that owners of the privatized farms were being punished for decisions over which they had no control under the communist system , he said , farms were frequently required by government officials to borrow money in order to underwrite public projects of different sorts none of those arguments convinced the frankfurtbased dg bank , which took over the old eastern german agricultural bank , or the german constitutional court bank officials said today that the unification treaty had been been intended to hold the farms responsible for their debts frank steinmeyer , a spokesman for dg bank here , said german lawmakers had decided as a general matter that debts held by all private companies should be treated as valid after reunification the reason , in part , was that private companies and individuals had been allowed to change their nearly worthless east german marks for valued west german marks on a 2for1 basis that gave the eastern companies a big windfall of hard currency for years now , german courts have been wrangling over the question whether the old cooperative farms should be treated as stateowned or private dg bank and the bonn government , which would have been responsible for the debts if the companies were considered stateowned , argued that the farms were private and their owners , therefore responsible today , germany s highest court rejected arguments by a farm in the eastern state of saxonyanhalt that the unusual debt burden violated the farms' property rights the cooperative farms' duty to repay their old debts does not have any such effect , the court ruled eastern politicians warned that the decision would endanger the future of many farms and was likely to force at least some to be sold to rich western german corporations money will flow from east to west , said reinhard hoppner , the governor of saxonyanhalt , in an interview on german radio today this cannot be a healthy structure mr steinmeyer of dg bank , which has assets of 194 billion , said that farmers had been protected by the prohibition against demanding repayment from unprofitable enterprises we are presuming that about onethird of the debt has a strong chance of being repaid , he said another third may or may not ever be repaid , and we are presuming that about onethird will almost certainly not be repaid
thirty years ago , when herman badillo , as bronx borough president , first dreamed of opening a college in the economically depressed south bronx , he wanted a college in which spanishspeaking students could receive degrees as quickly as possible , learning english while taking other courses taught in spanish thus was born eugenio maria de hostos community college of the city university of new york , a rare experiment in bilingual higher education in america today the success of that experiment is in question city university s trustees , mr badillo among them , accused hostos last month of giving diplomas to students who do not know english , and voted that all university students must pass an english writing test to receive a degree if you ca n't express yourself in english , you should n't graduate , said mr badillo , who proposed the writing test requirement as vice chairman of the university s board of trustees and is hostos s leading critic bilingual means two languages , english and spanish you have to be fluent in english to have a career no one would ever have approved hostos if they thought it meant monolingual while bilingual education is widely used in elementary and secondary schools , few colleges have picked it up in florida , texas and california , for example , all of which have large immigrant populations , college courses taught in english are the rule we want students who are proficient in english , said david spence , executive vice chancellor for the state university system of florida , who said college bilingual education was not a big issue in his state and at boricua college in upper manhattan , which describes itself as the only fouryear , bilingual liberal arts college in the united states , all classes are in english , although faculty members and administrators are required to be bilingual so they can help students with language problems we do n't believe we should give students the option of taking a degree in the united states of spanish courses , because we do n't believe it would be helpful to them , roland marrero , a student services official at the college , said at hostos , which straddles the grand concourse in the bronx just a mile from yankee stadium , and where more than threequarters of the nearly 5 , 000 students are hispanic , college officials defend their approach and say they are achieving their mission the bilingual model has been effective in providing access to large numbers of students , the president of hostos , isaura santiago santiago , said in a recent interview in her office they 've left here skilled our career programs are nationally recognized in a variety of fields and we 've been particularly effective in giving access to minorities we should build on what people know , and teach them english , she added about 22 percent of the college s classes , mostly introductory subjects , are taught in spanish , and many students spend term after term taking englishasasecondlanguage courses some of the college s departments , like its highly respected health science programs , require that their students be proficient in english to enter despite hostos s success in areas like nursing and dental hygiene , where virtually all of its graduates pass state and national certification exams , english and passing the city university writing exam remains a stumbling block for many students although students at other city university colleges have similar difficulties , none of the other colleges have seen such large portions of its students repeatedly fail the university writing test when the university offered the test to prospective hostos graduates earlier this month , only 13 of the 125 who took it passed it hostos is a tough place to run any education experiment not only do many students enter speaking little english , but many are poor and poorly educated on the writing placement examination given to all city university entering freshmen , fewer than 15 percent of hostos s students passed last fall , a rate lower than at any other university college teaching english to adults is not easy young children pick up new languages fairly naturally adults rarely , if ever , gain the proficiency that children do language experts have also found that adults who are more literate in their native language do better learning a second language than less educated adults that s what makes this so complex , said henry m levin , a stanford university professor and expert in remedial education who is a visiting scholar at the russell sage foundation in new york it s the dirty little secret it s more a literacy problem many immigrants who enter city university with limited english do quite well , passing the university writing test , excelling in their studies , sometimes graduating at the top of their classes and going on to elite graduate schools as immigrant students have flooded their campuses , city university professors say , their methods of teaching english to nonnative speakers have improved one approach that is winning increasing attention involves placing students in courses like biology or history as quickly as possible and pairing those courses with englishasasecondlanguage classes as in the bilingual approach , this pairing allows students to accumulate college credits at the same time they master english vocabulary and grammar drills are keyed to the paired course , and in some cases the textbook in the paired course may be used as an english reading text teachers who have used this approach say students learn english more rapidly because the readings cover topics they want to learn in yet another approach , city university has begun to introduce language immersion centers some applaud them as programs that allow students who know little english to concentrate in an englishonly environment for five hours a day , 25 hours a week , before formally starting college but others say the typical city university student knows at least some english and does not need the immersion , and that the immersion does not allow students to improve their english in an academic context at hostos , students offer mixed views about the bilingual approach maria r bosora , a 22yearold public administration major who grew up in the dominican republic , said she might be better off taking fewer courses in spanish this is the problem , she said i little speak english my problem is i do n't practice at home i speak spanish all my family speaks spanish i think i would be better off if i took all english for practice but julio alcantara , a 43yearold hostos student who came to new york from the dominican republic 10 years ago , said the college should not change the bilingual system is supposed to work , said mr alcantara , who is presidentelect of hostos s student government for now , hostos and its bilingual approach remain an option at city university , although the university s chairwoman , anne a paolucci , has set up a task force headed by mr badillo to study the college mr badillo , for one , is still not ready to give up on the notion of a bilingual college , and says it can work better than it has just because people have corrupted the process , does n't mean it ca n't be done well , he said this does n't mean we should throw this baby out with the bath water
moscow , may 14 russia reluctantly agreed today to the clinton administration s push to expand the nato military alliance to include moscow s former satellites in central europe the accord between nato and russia sets the terms under which the alliance is expected to admit poland , the czech republic , hungary and perhaps other central and eastern european nations left behind the iron curtain after the 1945 yalta pact the agreement , which came after months of pointed debate and private wrangling , sought to balance seemingly incompatible goals protecting the rights of the alliance s prospective new members while preserving the west s cooperative relationship with the new , democratic russia the accord was announced here today by nato s secretary general , javier solana , and foreign minister yevgeny primakov of russia and is to be be signed in paris on may 27 under the accord , nato agreed to establish a new natorussian council to discuss security issues and agreed that its pledge not to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new members also covered nuclear storage sites nato , which has previously said it had no intention of stationing substantial numbers of troops in newly admitted nations , rebuffed russia s demands for a specific , numerical ceiling russia has vociferously protested the expansion of nato as needless and provocative , but when the western alliance made it clear it would expand with or without moscow s assent , the russians negotiated the best deal they could it is a big victory for the world community and it is a big victory for russia , mr primakov said today in washington , president clinton warmly welcomed the announcement , saying , today in moscow we have taken an historic step closer to a peaceful , undivided , democratic europe at the white house , mr clinton s aides seized on the agreement as evidence that the president was achieving the central goals of his second term expanding nato , they said , has been the president s top foreign policy priority , just as a balanced budget agreement has been his top domestic one we 've reached those agreements in the first 120 days , said rahm emanuel , mr clinton s senior adviser the final talks turned on the political procedures for involving russia in deliberations over european security as well as sensitive military issues even the name of the accord the founding act was the product of intensive negotiations american officials said the agreement protected the vital character of the nato alliance its ability to carry out military planning and make decisions without moscow s blessing while providing assurances that the threat to russia would not be increased but the accord is sure to be scrutinized by western critics who fear it has given moscow too much say over nato decisionmaking in russia , it has already ignited a dispute over whether president boris n yeltsin has done enough to protect russia s security over the last several months , the alliance , and its foremost member , the united states , has undertaken a significant effort to assuage russian concerns and take the sting out of the decision for the yeltsin government first , secretary of state madeleine k albright offered to freeze nato military forces near russia s european periphery then nato informed moscow that it had no intention of permanently stationing substantial foreign forces on the territory of new members to further soothe russian anxieties , nato said that it had no current intention , no plans and no need to deploy nuclear weapons on the soil of new members those western moves essentially codified the military plans of nato nations , whose forces have shrunk because of declining budgets and an evaporating russian military threat but they also offered moscow an assurance , though something less than a legal guaranty , that an enlarged nato would not try to take advantage of russia during its period of weakness by mounting a new military challenge at first , none of this was quite good enough for the yeltsin government , which was afraid of appearing softer than its communist and nationalist rivals on nato s expansion but russia , as president yeltsin acknowledged in a television interview tonight , was playing a weak hand seeking to limit the domestic political fallout , the yeltsin government began pressing for a natorussia agreement it could advertise at home to show that it had defended russian interests we stated and still state that russia is against the expansion of nato , but considering some historical and world realities , the menace of the expansion of the bloc to our country must be brought to a minimum or excluded altogether , mr yeltsin said mr yeltsin stoutly denied russian press reports that he was more eager for an accord with nato than his foreign minister and in an effort to blunt hardline criticism at home , mr yeltsin has also emphasized his plan to strengthen ties with former soviet republics on may 23 , he plans to sign an agreement on greater russian integration with belarus a week later he intends to make a trip to ukraine that has often been postponed

bayonne , nj , march 5 a young man with a knife walked into bayonne high school as students were settling into their homerooms this morning , stabbed a student to death and wounded another in a lockerlined hallway , then slipped away as his victims lay bleeding , the authorities said officials said the youth who died was apparently not the prime target , but was killed when he tried to come to the aid of his wounded friend the motive for the attack was not clear , but prosecutors said the assailant may have been nursing a grudge from some earlier dispute he was still being sought tonight the attack stunned students , parents and school officials in this workingclass port city of 62 , 000 people where oil tanks and modest but stable neighborhoods coexist its high school , which has 2 , 100 students , is generally well regarded , and school officials said it had been largely free of the sort of violence that has invaded some urban public schools but some students said security was too lax at the centuryold school , which has no security guards or metal detectors , and most of its 40 entrances are unlocked during the day entering the school about 8 40 am , the attacker found akim garland , 17 , in the secondfloor hallway , said edward defazio , an assistant prosecutor for hudson county the two argued briefly , and then the assailant stabbed him in the stomach aubrey taylor , 18 , was stabbed in the heart as he tried to help his friend , mr defazio said the head football coach and a school nurse tried to resuscitate mr taylor , but he was pronounced dead on arrival at bayonne hospital mr garland is in stable condition at the hospital , after surgery to remove his spleen the attacker apparently came to the high school to exact revenge on mr garland , mr defazio said it would appear there was some sort of grudge , he said we are investigating a number of possible motives the authorities did not identify the assailant , although they said they knew who he was several students said the attacker was a teenager from hoboken who thought mr garland had stolen a pair of fog lights from his car others said that mr garland , whose nickname is peanut , had fought with some teenagers from another school during a dance last weekend perhaps over the stolen fog lights and that one of them had come after him investigators said they were examining both rumors and interviewing a handful of students who witnessed the crimes one thing seemed clear mr taylor , whom shaken classmates described as kind and eventempered , was not the target of the attack it appears he came on the scene to aid his friend , mr defazio said students , many of whom left school early and huddled on the sidewalk across from the school , said mr garland and mr taylor , both seniors , were best friends who lived in the same housing project and played basketball every weekend they described mr garland as a swashbuckler who often got into fistfights but who was funny and popular mr taylor was quiet and spent most of his time with his girlfriend , they said he was the sweetest guy you could ever know , said andrea coon , who added that mr taylor had transferred to bayonne from marist high school , a nearby parochial school , two years ago he was always trying to help the cops out he just wanted to keep his grades up cheri miller , a sophomore who had a picture of the two victims tucked into her sleeve , said that when mr garland and mr taylor were not playing basketball , they were going with other friends to movies at newport centre mall in jersey city or to the music factory , a dance club in east rutherford she said mr garland would often run into trouble because he could not ignore insults or threats if someone disrespected him or said something about his family , he would fight them back , she said he would n't back out of it the school principal , dr michael a wanko , said he kept school in session after the incident so that students could seek counseling , and also because a dangerous suspect remained at large but many parents , frightened by the incident , picked up their children early ann lametta , who whisked her 16yearold daughter away from the school around noon , said she had panicked when she heard news of the stabbings i heard rumors there might be fights after school , and i had to get her out of here , she said i do n't want my daughter in the middle of it other students left on their own , saying they were too upset to remain in class several expressed anger that the school had stayed open as soon as it was cleaned up , they should have let us go , said kaniesha hallenbeck , a junior everyone was walking around lightheaded , in shock how do they think we can sit in class all day \? other students said they did not feel safe in the school , which takes up three blocks , and wondered why school officials did not monitor who came and went dr wanko , who said there had never been such a serious crime in the school , said teachers patrol the halls with walkietalkies , and police officers stand outside before and after school the bayonne police department also has a juvenile aid bureau inside the high school , to maintain contact with troubled students but students said none of these things was enough i 've walked in here at 6 30 at night and the doors are still unlocked , miss miller said nobody s watching out for us dr wanko said the school had offered counseling in the library today , and on thursday , counselors would talk to students in every class that mr taylor and mr garland had attended a team of teachers and administrators would decide whether the school needed to tighten security , he said , but he suggested that it would not have helped in this case no matter what protection you have , i do n't think you can ever prevent something like this , he said photos aubrey taylor , left , and his friend , akim garland yesterday , the two students , both 18 , were stabbed in bayonne , nj mr taylor died yvette cintron , crying , came to bayonne high school yesterday to pick up her three daughters after two students were stabbed despite resuscitation efforts , one died the attacker was still being sought last night \( ruby washington the new york times \) \( pg b4 \) map of new jersey showing location of bayonne bayonne is a workingclass port city of 62 , 000 people \( pg b4 \)

lexington , ky , april 12 there was a threat of rain there was nervousness over a recent loss in florida it was a new race over a new track , and there were several new shooters trying to knock him off but none of pulpit s potential problems materialized it was as if divine intervention was bestowed upon the colt , who resurrected his standing among the nation s leading 3yearolds with an emphatic victory today in the blue grass stakes at keeneland race course pulpit romped to a 3 1 2length victory over acceptable to set up a dramatic rematch with his archrival , captain bodgit , in the kentucky derby three weeks from today captain bodgit and pulpit split two meetings in florida this winter , then went their separate ways today one hour before pulpit s victory , captain bodgit took the wood memorial at aqueduct in new york now we 'll find out who s best , said pulpit s trainer , frank brothers pulpit was at his best today he was making his first start since his first career loss , which came when he ran second to captain bodgit in last month s florida derby he was running for the first time anywhere other than gulfstream park two colts from california , stolen gold and king crimson , were flown here to offer a fresh challenge and overnight rain left the track muddy for the day s first race but the combination of blustery winds and lateafternoon sunshine dried out the track it was fast , and so was pulpit pulpit stalked the early pacesetter , jules , through comfortable fractions of 233 5 seconds , 48 and 1 122 5 for the first six furlongs of the mile and oneeighth race he was sitting second on the outside and was going strongly under his jockey , shane sellers he broke sharp , sellers said he was his old self as the field came around the far turn , pulpit put more pressure on jules and after turning into the stretch , pulpit quickly powered clear of his rivals he s not a great horse around the turn , but after we got in the straightaway , he hit another gear and i knew he was home , sellers said pulpit was never threatened again sellers struck him three times with the whip as he drew away he was timed in 1 494 5 , a good time considering the track was fast , yet dull acceptable rallied for second and finished a halflength better than stolen gold celtic warrior was fourth and was followed , in order , by jules , wrightwood and king crimson pulpit , the heavy favorite at odds of 25 , paid 280 for a 2 bet to win and took home a first prize of 434 , 000 for his owner and breeder , the hancock family s claiborne farm pulpit was sired by a p indy , the 1992 horse of the year , and he is out of the mr prospector mare preach pulpit has now won four of five starts and 683 , 200 all of that has been accomplished in three months pulpit did not make his first start until jan 11 a minor fracture in a rear leg prevented him from racing last year it s pretty amazing , brothers said this horse was a maiden on jan 1 to come this far this quick takes a special horse , a talented horse to win the kentucky derby , however , pulpit will have to be a onceinacentury horse not since apollo in 1882 has a horse won the kentucky derby without first racing as a 2yearold pulpit was treated with the legal medication lasix for the first time today because he bled slightly in his trachea after a workout at churchill downs on march 31 he just had a touch of blood after that work , brothers said he said the bleeding was discovered after an endoscopic examination on a scale of 1 to 10 , it was a 1 , brothers added i'm a big believer in lasix i thought it would be a good idea to give him a little to run on if they show something , maybe down the line they will show a little more this way we can maybe get ahead , cover our bases pulpit had been training for the past three weeks about 75 miles west of here at churchill downs , site of the kentucky derby it has been my experience that horses run well when they just ship over to keeneland , brothers said this was a homecoming for pulpit the colt was born just north of here in paris , ky , at claiborne farm claiborne keeps a few of its home breds to race each year , and pulpit was one of the promising runners who made the cut claiborne s only kentucky derby victory came with swale in 1984 that illfated colt collapsed suddenly and died just six weeks after the derby , and one week after he captured the belmont stakes
the police department has created a task force to search for two young suspects who are believed to be responsible for a recent string of 10 pellet attacks on subway riders across the city , investigators announced yesterday the suspects , described as boys between the ages of 12 and 16 , used a slingshot or bb gun to fire pellets at subway riders as they exited trains at stations in manhattan , brooklyn and queens , said inspector robert abraham , the commanding officer of the police transit bureau in brooklyn victims variously reported being stuck by pellets in the face , forehead and back , but none of the injuries were serious and none of the victims required hospitalization , inspector abraham said at a news conference last night at police headquarters the first attack occurred shortly after 9 pm on march 4 , when a male passenger was struck by a pellet as he left a northbound no 6 train at the astor place station in greenwich village another male passenger was struck by a pellet as he left the same train at union square , the next stop on the lexington avenue line police stopped the train when it arrived at grand central station a few minutes later several officers swarmed across the platform with guns drawn and boarded the train , but no suspects were arrested on march 17 , passengers were hit by pellets at three subway stations on the m line in brooklyn the shootings occurred shortly after 11 30 am at the avenue u , fort hamilton and eighth avenue stations the next night a passenger was struck by a pellet at the broadway and lafayette stop on the f line in manhattan at 8 45 am thursday , there was a shooting at the 50th street station in manhattan on the b line , and later thursday five passengers were hit by pellets at the hunts point and courthouse square stops on the irt no 7 line in queens in all , there were 10 victims , inspector abraham said several reported hearing laughter after they were shot inspector abraham said investigators believed the same suspects to be responsible for all of the attacks this is their way of fun , unfortunately , he said
like many evangelists , bill mccartney has a passel of stories to tell , stories about individuals who have turned to god and been rewarded and because he won fame as the successful head football coach at the university of colorado , he also has football stories , about men bonding in common cause , infusing their team with a power greater than their individual selves and marching to unlikely victory these stories of uplift are standards of the evangelical genre , and mccartney , who left coaching three years ago to run promise keepers , the burgeoning christian ministry for men that he founded in 1990 , makes ample use of them you ai n't going in the end zone without the holy spirit , he told an audience of some two dozen drug addicts yesterday at the bowery mission transitional center on manhattan s lower east side but mccartney s best story , his most effective story , has none of those cliches it is about a hispanic vietnam veteran named ivan , who mccartney said now lives in denver , his life in ruins because of something that happened 30 years ago ivan s squad had befriended vietnamese village children who would visit the men daily to peddle them candy , mccartney said and ivan had become friendly , more than friendly paternal with a 7yearold girl named kim he held her on his lap , told her he loved her then one day kim was used by the vietcong as a kamikaze she showed up alone at the soldiers' camp , wired with explosives , but before she got too close , she unbuttoned her blouse to show the soldiers the bomb and what she was saying was 'take me out now , ' mccartney said , 'because if i get any closer i'm going to take out all of you' ivan was one of the men who shot her , he said , and to this day , this guy is in pure torment it is an agonizing story all on its own , but mccartney s finish was unexpected he ca n't receive what kim offered , mccartney said his life she gave her life so he could live he paused of course that parallels what jesus did he gave his life because he fell in love with you the story was delivered with a fervor that might be practiced but seemed nonetheless heartfelt and if it did not make the men in the room want to leap up immediately to block and tackle for the lord , the story and others clearly had an effect the vietnam story was very touching , said duane bell , 33 , who came to the mission three years ago as a hapless drug addict and is now on the mission staff i got a little teary the whole brotherhood thing , one in christ it really hit home the mission center , three years old , houses 80 men according to its executive director , robert j polito , it runs a program that combines faith , drug therapy , education and job training for many , it is a place of last resort , the kind of place where faith may be all that someone has left easy pickings , perhaps , for the evangelically minded , but mccartney , because of his football background , was able to strike a note , serve as the kind of role model , that some others cannot promise keepers is best known for its weekend conferences and stadium rallies , but mccartney spends a great deal of his time in smaller settings like this i'm not a real spiritual person , said vernon kinsler , 44 , who had been living on the street when he came to the mission center just a week ago but kinsler , who described himself as an alcoholic and a heroin addict i use and i use all the time explained he came to the mission center because i 've tried so many other ways , without spirituality you always do something different when all else fails he said he heard mccartney s message of faith and brotherhood precisely because of who he was he related sports to religion , kinsler said and i appreciated that also , i have a lot of respect for him i remember when colorado was a nothing team indeed , mccartney s career path has few others like it when he walked away from coaching to run promise keepers , a nonprofit organization , he left a 350 , 000 annual salary package for a job that does not pay him but this is more rewarding than coaching football , he said in an interview after his 40minute talk i believe i have a calling mccartney , who earns a living as a motivational speaker and author , also noted that his former and current roles have a lot in common you get me in a setting like that and i feel comfortable , he said , acknowledging that the cafeteria where the meeting was held was not unlike a locker room i like to be around guys , to exhort them , challenge them that s what i do this was seconded by lee rouson , a former colorado running back who went on to play for the giants now an evangelical worker himself , rouson was the lead singer yesterday for the electric gospel band that played for the addicts before mccartney spoke the comparison between mccartney as coach and mccartney as preacher is simple , rouson said coach mac is intensity he s always been that way he s that way now in your face all the time
the issue of whether public school children have received instruction beside urinals suddenly became a shrill point of contention this week in the mayoral campaign but for years , overcrowded districts throughout the city have used some of the bathrooms in their schools as classrooms and as offices for teachers and guidance counselors jill levy , who worked as the special education supervisor at public school 46 in bayside , queens , recalled turning the anteroom of a staff bathroom into an office there nine years ago and last fall , the teachers' union newspaper published a photograph of a class being taught in a boys' bathroom at midwood high school in brooklyn its urinals within arm s length of students seated at a table yesterday , the deputy schools chancellor for operations , lewis h spence , acknowledged that gyms , locker rooms and bathrooms have been converted into classrooms a converted bathroom he said , has blackboards and it has appropriate furniture and all those kind of things that go with being a classroom none , he said , had urinals mr spence said he did not know how many schools have used bathrooms for instruction in the past or how many will continue to be used this year but i do n't think that suggests anything about the quality of instruction , he said , or has any relationship to the image in the messinger ad mr spence was referring to a campaign advertisement for ruth w messinger , the leading democratic candidate for mayor , that began being broadcast this week it depicts a halfdozen youngsters and a teacher crammed in front of three urinals in an unidentified school the ad , which was staged , recounts cuts to education spending made by the giuliani adminstration it elicited a feisty and prompt response from schools chancellor rudy crew , who accused her of sordid duplicity officials of the united federation of teachers , the teachers' union , said yesterday that they were aware of converted bathrooms from which fixtures had been removed or covered with plywood they said classes have also been held in bathrooms that were not used as bathrooms but still had their fixtures intact there is no question that classes are held in inappropriate places , including closets and converted bathrooms , said a union spokeswoman , susan amlung but we ca n't recall any instance of a class being held in an operational bathroom asked about a photograph published in the daily news last fall , in which a handful of students were pictured doing classwork in a bathroom at ps 114 in canarsie , brooklyn , mr spence said the space had only been used temporarily for a small reading group that space was used illadvisedly for a period of less than eight weeks , he said obviously , we want to make sure that does n't happen photo at public school 175 in forest hills , queens , christine bregman taught her kindergarten class last year in what had been a boys' shower room \( andrea mohin the new york times \)
storrs , conn , feb 20 their undefeated college basketball team may be the best in the nation and , since television loves a novelty , their sport s professional league may be all the visual vogue just now but , for nykesha sales and rita williams , the star treatment stops right here at watson hall , where a blue dumpster serves as a doorman and a spare sweatsock keeps the door from slamming so hard that the windowpanes rattle like teeth dinner is n't served , it s selfserve the other night it was takeout on styrofoam cartons cribbed from a postpractice spread of chicken , mashed potatoes and neon yellow corn rinsed down by snapple straight from the bottle sales and williams do not even own a looking glass , much less a drinking glass sure , the two students scored a cubicle on the penthouse floor of this highrise brick pile , but theirs may be the only penthouse where 16 women are forced to share a bathroom , and 16 stereos howl to their own musical agendas for the sake of morning civility , said sales , everybody sticks to different schedules to avoid tussling over the shower stall like a jump ball for the sake of evening civility , said williams , stereos must be muzzled like barking dogs as for special privileges , there are none no getting cut any extra slack , sales said a lot of guys who are good at ball do n't think about the school part of being at college , but we 're into the whole package i'm not about letting athletic ability or fame take me the wrong way the two juniors are roommates because they are connecticut huskies , members of a team that is turning into a dynasty in women s college basketball connecticut is ranked no 1 in the nation and has rarely been challenged while rolling to a 250 record this season three weeks before the start of the national championship tournament , uconn is a solid favorite to win its second title in three seasons sales and williams were drawn to the school by the presence of the legends whose reeboks , standard issue from coach geno auriemma , pounded these boards before them rebecca lobo and jennifer rizzotti now they are being asked to help the huskies forget the absence of lobo and rizzotti that is a tall order , especially when they factor in that lobo and rizzotti occasionally added a 40 grade point average to the basketball stats that made them national champions in 1995 taller still when they factor in sales s natural instinct to blend in rather than stand out she is so teamoriented , auriemma said , that it hurts and williams s natural instinct to take a shrinking violet approach to unnerving situations williams , after all , nearly wasted away from homesickness during her recruiting visit and home was just an hour away , in norwalk , conn so the 6foot sales and the 5foot7inch williams are helping each other cope with inherent pressure and incipient stardom they room together under the watchful eye of posters of bob marley , spike lee and , in deference to the sport that has provided their meal ticket at uconn and hopefully beyond , michael jordan most afternoons , they huddle together and watch guiding light , their favorite soap , to absorb some vicarious thrills college athletes do n't have much of an outside life , explained sales , who is averaging 166 points a game , which is the secondbest average on the team you do n't even have time for a boyfriend it s basketball and schoolwork so i guess that s why you watch soaps to see that side of life , all the things we are n't doing they often eat dinner together at the dorm next door , and , when they are feeling lazy , they take the bus together to practice at the gym , which looms like a synthetic mushroom cap three blocks from their dorm room going to practice daily , even on game days , can be hard as well , thanks to auriemma s perfectionist bent for him , practice does not make perfect , practice must be perfect last year he left williams home from a road trip because he felt she was not working up to her ability last week he made sales leave the practice court and do penance on a stationary bike because he felt she was not hustling enough one minute he s comparing you to michael jordan , the next minute you 're on the bike , sales lamented that the players have clicked off the court as well as on it , where their combined hectoring of the opposition helped sales play the pickpocket with 107 steals through 25 games , has made auriemma s life a bit easier he can goad them that much more mercilessly during games and practices because he knows they will have each other s shoulders to moan on later and goad he must sales was the nation s most voraciously recruited high school senior three years ago , and auriemma insists the bloomfield \( conn \) high school product is the most talented player he has coached but not the best not yet if she was a guy , she 'd be offered 10 million to play next year , he said this year auriemma warned sales , the big east s preseason player of the year , that he could not wait any longer for her to decide to be great he told her he was going to push her into it and he told williams , the player he considers his most impressive makeover project , that she had inherited rizzotti s job as point guard sort of
men in black opened across the country last wednesday about six weeks after bootleg videos of the film went on sale on the streets of new york batman and robin opened june 20 it was available the same day at a harlem market for 5 and a week before disney s animated film hercules opened , a bootleg version was on sale \( adding insult to injury , it was camcorded from the balcony of walt disney company s own new amsterdam theater in new york \) video piracy is thriving in america , and nowhere more so than in new york the growing sophistication of technology and the cachet of seeing something first are combining to intensify a persistent problem , despite raids on copying labs and occasional personal intervention by film figures like the director spike lee in effect , bootlegged films are like a nagging cold for the movie industry , a pesky problem that could undermine studios' financial health and in some places , like new york , threatens to turn into pneumonia it is almost impossible to know how much such bootleg competition costs hollywood studios though studio spokesmen quote guesstimates of lost revenues running to hundreds of millions of dollars annually but whatever the financial losses , the studios fear they will escalate some day with the introduction of dvd , digital video disks , which will enable pirates to make perfect copies of films many bootleg videos are surreptitiously copied with camcorders smuggled into advance screenings but some come from inside the industry work copies of films from editing houses , special effects houses and early test screenings work prints get stolen all the time , said tom sherak , the chairman of the 20th century fox domestic film group , part of the news corporation now that we edit on avid , you can pull it right off we try to watch it as closely as we can , but you ca n't watch everything avid is a computer editing technology widely used in film and television using a 500 videocamera and a tripod and occasionally making use of the theaters' audio jacks for the hearing impaired , a bootlegger can go to the movies once a week and make 1 , 000 or more , said bill shannon , the head of the motion picture association of america s new york antipiracy office if he makes 30 copies , and sells them for 100 apiece , that s 3 , 000 and that s tax free the association , which investigates and prosecutes piracy cases for the studios , estimates that the bootlegging of films costs the industry more than 250 million in potential domestic revenues but the organization s figures for the economic impact of bootlegging presume that a person buying bootleg films would have spent 4 to 8 to see the movie in a theater a risky assumption in neighborhoods where there are no firstrun theaters still , no one quarrels with the association s assertion that new york is the capital of american bootlegging new york is the center for this problem , and particularly for illegal labs and distribution networks , said edmund j pistey , the director of united states antipiracy operations for the association that s why we 're focusing with the highest amount of intensity there one problem is that blase new yorkers tend to see bootlegging , like counterfeiting rolex watches , as a victimless crime i do n't know what s wrong with the africanamerican consumer in some urban areas , spike lee said they want to buy an inferior product and get something for a bargain when mr lee s film malcolm x came out in 1992 , he took some of his friends , muscle , he calls them , to 125th street with baseball bats to clean the bootleg copies off the street few vendors of bootleg tapes set up shop in highly visible areas of manhattan , instead selling them along hudson , canal and duane streets in lower manhattan and out of vans parked on the upper west side they are also found in busy shopping areas around fordham road , at the grand concourse plaza in the bronx , and on fulton street in brooklyn the sale of bootlegs used to be widespread on 125th street in harlem now it is endemic at the malcolm shabazz harlem market , at 116th and lenox , where the videos mentioned in this article were purchased over the last four months in new york , as in other cities , the structure of bootlegging operations is simple scores of individuals obtain prints of the film this network feeds into a highly organized group of duplication labs , which make copies in bulk and most of the profits shrinkwrapped copies are then distributed through groups of street vendors often recent immigrants some legitimate video stores also sell bootleg tapes two weeks ago , police raided 10 video stores in suffolk county in the final analysis , it s outandout theft , and ca n't be tolerated , said mr pistey of the association you 're stealing the works of people that s what intellectual property rights are all about the motion picture association has recently focused its attention on duplication labs in new york last week , the organization , working with the queens district attorney s office , cooperated in a raid on a bootleg video lab in queens that had 100 machines copying movies more than 10 , 000 counterfeit videotapes were seized , the district attorney s office said
new york city , a town long wedded to the bagel , is having a wild fling these days with the doughnut krispy kreme , the legendary doughnut maker that has dominated the south for decades , opened a store in chelsea in june and another in harlem in january , bringing a flood of accolades roy blount jr , the humorist , gushed in an essay in the new york times magazine that when krispy kremes are hot , they are to other doughnuts what angels are to people nora ephron , the screenwriter and director , who was not a doughnut fan until she encountered krispy kreme s original glazed , summed up the ardor in the new yorker , saying the krispy kreme store had become a shrine , complete with pilgrims , fanatics , converts , and proselytizers rosie o 'donnell even had a krispy kreme conveyor belt installed on the set of her talk show but the doughnut mecca founded in winstonsalem , nc , 60 years ago is not getting all the attention the hoopla has also brought out devotees of georgie s , a longtime harlem bakery whose handmade glazed doughnuts are deemed superior to krispy kremes by , among others , the likes of ed levine , author of the encyclopedic guide new york eats \( st martin s press \) and a restaurant critic for the daily news in a recent taste test for the second edition of his book , mr levine bought a box of georgie s at 50 west 125th street and , for comparison , scurried three blocks west to the new krispy kreme store , also on 125th street krispy kreme s glazed doughnuts , he decreed , were too sweet and too perfect in shape i liked georgie s nooks and crannies , he said fondly and so new yorkers the famous and not so , the epicures and omnivores have been lining up and taking sides in a schoolyardlike tiff whose battle cry is simple mydoughnutisbetterthanyourdoughnut no one in this skirmish is dismissing dunkin' donuts either its caketype doughnut , ideal for \( what else \? \) dunking , may not inspire the same sort of rhapsodizing as krispy kreme s , but with 115 franchise outlets in the five boroughs , and hundreds more in the region , the doughnut giant s reach is formidable i think we make a superior product so we welcome the competition , said john rader , a local dunkin' donuts franchisee let the cream come to the top for its part , krispy kreme is playing the wellmannered newcomer i do n't want to bother dunkin' donuts , said howard lev , one of five partners in harem foods , which owns the krispy kreme franchise rights for much of new york and new jersey i'm happy to be no 2 but harem foods plans to open 50 more stores in new york and new jersey in the next 10 years by summer , the upper east side , the upper west side , greenwich village and pennsylvania station will each have a new krispy kreme store , and harem officials say they are negotiating leases in bergen county , nj , and nassau county on long island the success of krispy kreme s chelsea store , at 265 west 23d street off eighth avenue , has been phenomenal , with 14 , 400 doughnuts sold a day , or 52 million a year the harlem store , at 280 west 125th street , is selling about half that amount by contrast , twin donut , which has 29 stores in new york city , sells a maximum of 2 , 400 doughnuts a day per store , while georgie s , a single bakery , sells 1 , 600 to 1 , 800 doughnuts a day \( dunkin' donuts does not break out numbers by city \) yes , krispy kreme has mastered doughnuts it has also mastered marketing in the brightly lighted chelsea store , one wall is cluttered with black and white photos from the 1950 s depicting krispy kreme stores in the south , while the other is a showcase for framed feature articles on the cult of krispy kreme behind the counter , a conveyor belt whisks the light , yeastraised doughnuts from a smoky vat of hot oil through a liquid curtain of sugar glaze when they hit the display cases , workers flick on a red and green neon sign in the window , announcing hot doughnuts now and the shop swells with customers rob walsh , a 28yearold props scout for movies , spotted the sign recently and , as usual , could n't help himself i tell my wife i come once a week , but i really come two or three times a week , said the brooklyn resident , who eats four doughnuts per visit if they are warm , two if they 're not it s sad food industry analysts say krispy kreme has chosen its new market wisely new york is underdeveloped because you really only have the one major player , dunkin' donuts , said ron paul , president of technomic inc , a foodservice consulting firm in chicago in most other food categories , there s a second and third player but no one has done a run at the doughnut category , and krispy kreme is a welldeveloped brand none of this appears to spell doom for the bagel nationwide , bagel consumption has soared in recent years , and while no statistics exist specifically for new york , the city appears to be riding right along with the trend the taste for bagels is so strong that dunkin' donuts introduced them last year after months of research and development

certain sense , we have proceeded like someone who cleans out a room only to sweep the dirt beneath the carpet of another , says antonio paolucci , the city s superintendent of fine arts and the former culture minister of italy the city responded splendidly to the disaster of 1966 yet the arno was and remains a wicked , treacherous waterway if we truly want to say our mea culpa , we should do so for not having found a way to tame it the arno has always been a capricious and wanton river historical accounts tell of 56 alluvial events in florence since 1177 although it is usually calm , the river that dante alighieri called the cursed and unlucky ditch is transformed during the rainy season from october to december the arno has many tributaries , and its limestone and granite basin allows for little absorption or runoff florence , with its narrow river boulevards and its many bridges , represents a critical point for this river , says simone staccioli , director of the florentine division of public works , which monitors rain and water levels along the river s basin on the fateful november morning of the flood , the arno submerged florence s city center under 18 billion gallons of water , mud and filth when the waters receded the next day , the city lay in waste thirtynine people were killed , 10 , 000 cars destroyed and 20 , 000 residents left homeless the damage to the city s monuments and artworks was almost unfathomable some 1 , 500 pieces had been disfigured or destroyed , including 320 panel paintings , 629 canvas paintings , 495 sculptures and 124 frescoes the murky waters soaked nearly 15 million volumes at the biblioteca nazionale the city s many cloisters and refectories some were decorated with murals by artists like andrea del castagno , taddeo gaddi and filippo lippi were steeped for hours in a messy mix of water , mud and gasoline an event like the 1966 flood can only be compared to a war , says cristina acidini , deputy superintendent for fine arts in florence in florence , they were able to move the entire collection of the uffizi into deposits before the bombardments began in world war ii but there was no warning given for the 1966 flood and that one night was enough to create an enormous disaster from which we are still trying to recover florence may have been caught unaware by the flood , but the city and its restorers responded splendidly a climatized reanimation room was set up in a greenhouse at the boboli gardens to provide a safe , controlled environment to slowly dry the hundreds of soaked panel paintings in the 12 months that followed , florentine restorers removed 27 , 000 square feet of wet and stained frescoes from their supporting walls , thereby preserving a significant part of florence s patrimony of wall paintings volunteers , including richard burton and senator edward m kennedy , came from around the world to help save the city s treasures dressed in rubber boots , working 10 to 14 hours a day , these volunteers came to be known as the angeli del fango , the angels of the mud the government eventually provided money to raise the flood barriers near the uffizi to 26 feet and to dredge the river bottom under the ponte vecchio but these measures were hardly sufficient to handle a volume of water like that of november 1966 only in 1989 was the problem of the arno river declared of pressing national interest with the formation of the arno basin authority , local , regional and national authorities began to search in earnest for ways to assure florence s safety a river is a very complex and demanding organism , says costanza pera , director general of the institute for the safeguarding of italian terrain at the ministry of the interior you cannot resolve the problems of the arno at florence by simply altering the waterway at florence , she says you have to intervene at various points along the river and in italy , where we have a high density of population , much of which lives near or on our rivers , each of these choices means modifying the life of thousands of people current plans to domesticate the arno center on building a series of reservoirs upstream to handle excess volumes of water during heavy rains ms pera expects the 15year arno basin plan to cost 23 billion yet given italy s perpetual fiscal travails , there is no guarantee that these funds will be forthcoming of the 180 million needed to begin work this year , the government is unlikely to provide more than half the memory of the 1966 flood is still vivid in the minds of florentines each fall , when the rains begin , inhabitants pack the city s bridges and river banks , wringing their hands beneath their umbrellas as they watch the rising waters with a mix of fear and fascination should monitors upstream from florence sound the alarm , florentines would have only six hours to put their homes , museums , churches and monuments in order before the waters arrived however , some permanent precautions have been taken none of the city s museums store perishable artworks in street level or underground quarters each of the city s museums has an emergency plan , a sort of red envelope to be opened in the event of a disaster regular evacuation drills and protection drills are conducted the latest exercise , held in santa croce on the 30th anniversary of the flood , involved more than 1 , 000 people including soldiers , police officers , firefighters and volunteers panel and canvas paintings were lifted to safety tens of thousands of volumes were packed into fruit crates and transported to the upper floors of the biblioteca nazionale taddeo gaddi s arbor vitae fresco on the rear wall of the santa croce refectory was covered with a customfitted waterrepellent cloth while the santa croce drill was conducted flawlessly , there is no guarantee that the exercise would function as smoothly under actual emergency conditions with the roads clogged by inhabitants fleeing the city center , it would be difficult for volunteers to reach their posts in time and not every quarter is as well organized or farsighted as santa croce i think that we 've done everything within our power to keep the damage to a minimum in the event of another flood , says mr paolucci but what we really need to do is make sure that there will be no other

during the eastern conference finals of the stanley cup playoffs , big , tough and talented eric lindros of the philadelphia flyers grew displeased with the rangers when luc robitaille held him against the boards early in game 1 and esa tikkanen later collided with him at full speed in the middle of the ice grabbing robitaille in one fist and tikkanen with the other , lindros climbed to the top of the empire state building and flung them both toward the statue of liberty , knocking off her crown with robitaille and her torch with tikkanen at least it seemed that way careful review of videotape , however , showed that lindros merely fell on robitaille in a deliberate way that drove robitaille s face into the ice and left him dazed and bleeding as for tikkanen , he simply bounced off lindros and crashed to the ice despite intense defensive attention , lindros scored five goals in five games against the rangers and has 11 goals in 15 tournament games against three opponents having won the hart trophy as most valuable player in the national hockey league in 1995 , this brawny and combative 24yearold superstar is on the verge of engraving his name onto another cherished award if the flyers beat the detroit red wings in the finals , which begin saturday night in philadelphia , their names will be listed on the silver side of the stanley cup lindros might also contend for the conn smythe trophy as most valuable player in the postseason after five seasons of erratic spurts of success , injuries and controversy , lindros seems poised to join superstars like mario lemieux , wayne gretzky and mark messier as captains of championship teams there is a sense this spring that the hockey world is witnessing the passing of a torch and the inheritance of a crown there were times , i would n't say you doubt yourself , but things look a little foggy , lindros said , referring to the flyers' season we 've got things cleared up now , and here we are and there he is lemieux , almost as big as lindros and possessing similar shooting and passing skills , retired after the flyers eliminated the pittsburgh penguins in the eastern conference quarterfinals in the handshake line , he told lindros it was now his time messier , who plays with a lindroslike mean streak , told lindros go get it after the flyers eliminated the rangers although lindros modeled his style after messier s , he is 12 years younger at 6foot4 and 236 pounds , lindros is 3 inches taller and 31 pounds heavier than messier and more than any player , lindros hits opponents with the force and aggression of a football player while moving the puck with the delicacy of a golf pro no one can play with his size , which he combines with great skill , messier said it separates him from anybody who played this game other attributes separate him as well traditionally canadian in many of his hockey attitudes , lindros refused twice , at a young age , to conform to the business practices of his sport and culture when drafted as a teenager and told to move hundreds of miles from his suburban toronto home to play for a junior team in northern ontario , lindros and his parents refused , forcing his trade to a team closer to them when drafted as a professional and told to play for the nordiques , a team in a small city in the frenchspeaking province of quebec , lindros and his parents refused he waited one season and forced a trade to the flyers , who had to win a contentious arbitration against the rangers for his rights some branded the lindros family selfish for this approach but events in the last couple years put some of this into perspective in canada , junior hockey was rocked by a scandal in which one coach was imprisoned for sexually abusing his teenage players in a larger sense , the affair brought into question the wisdom of an amateur system in which parents send sons into virtual servitude under virtual strangers the influence of carl and bonnie lindros , although less visible , is still noticeable it is common to see one or both near the dressing room door after their son s games in various cities although such parental presence is n't unique in hockey , carl also acts as eric s agent i'm very proud i'm proud of a number of things , carl lindros said i'm almost relieved , from eric s perspective , that he has had a chance to blossom was he worried that his son would crack or break under the strain \? i'm not sure we ever thought he would crack or break , carl lindros said i think we could see life is much more complicated than what it first appeared and that there were limits to how much weight a single person could put on their shoulders even at age 24 , with his hairline beginning to recede , lindros still comes across as hockey s dark manchild unlike the glib messier , the calculating gretzky and even the taciturn lemieux , lindros seems to lack confidence when speaking in public , particularly before large groups , such as the reporters who questioned him yesterday after the flyers practiced in voorhees , nj formally polite , he seemed nervous , his feet fidgeting , his voice wavering , his arms crossed over his chest did he expect the flyers to play the red wings in the finals \? i was envisioning one side , he said i did n't know i did n't care who was going to be on the other side asked about retaliation to cheap shots , lindros replied everyone has made a big deal about retaliation i do n't think there has been any retaliating or stuff like that throughout the playoffs , it s not a big issue with me it is a sign of his increased maturity that lindros no longer responds to every provocation with the kind of reaction that results in a penalty that takes him off the ice and weakens his team but resisting the temptation is always a big challenge more than most players , lindros plays as if he enjoys giving and taking punishment opponents whack him with their sticks and he hacks back elbows are exchanged , and sometimes punches because he is so tall and skates so fast , defensemen like to bend low to hipcheck him at the legs , sometimes causing spectacular crashlandings and injuries it wo n't be too much of a stretch for some canadians to cast lindros as a single combat warrior against the red wings , who used to be canada s most bitter hockey rival detroit features a group called the russian five , which includes a rugged defenseman named vladimir konstantinov the lindroskonstantinov matchup is the sort of thing that sharp television directors will isolate with their cameras he wants to get under anybody s skin , lindros said of konstantinov he wants to take your head off he wants to be in your face in a game this season when they collided along the boards , it was konstantinov who left the game on shaky legs asked whether he worries about his son s safety , carl lindros said you just have to assume certain risks you sort of keep your fingers crossed often in his young career , lindros has been surrounded by hostility and menace , some of it his own creation five years ago , in his first game in quebec city after rejecting the nordiques , the rookie lindros played before an angry crowd that threw diapers and pacifiers at him while chanting obscenities in frenchaccented english despite a nordiques victory , lindros scored two goals , had an apparent goal overruled and hit the post on another shot this is the sort of athlete who creates pressure for himself and thrives on it but none of his challenges have had the pressure , attention and prize of this next round the entire hockey world will closely watch big 88 even his numerals are huge to see if his moment of ultimate triumph is at hand photo we 've got things cleared up now , and here we are , the flyers' eric lindros said of his team s place in the finals \( associated press \)
christian dior the man who made the world look new by mariefrance pochna translated by joanna savill illustrated 314 pp new york arcade publishing 2595 yves saint laurent a biography by alice rawsthorn illustrated 405 pp new york nan a talese doubleday 2750 these two biographies represent consecutive chapters of the same story , which might be titled the history of high fashion in the 20th century in 1947 , christian dior singlehandedly restores french fashion to its former glory by articulating postwar longings for stability and opulence in an hourglass style that comes to be known as the new look over the course of the next 10 years , dior ascends to fashion s throne and builds an empire on a scale that had never been seen before in 1955 , dior hires a shy 19yearold by the name of yves mathieusaintlaurent to work in his design studio two years later , dior dies at the age of 52 yves saint laurent \( as he is called by the press \) is appointed the house of dior s chief designer , and his first collection is a triumph the king is dead , long live the king like most monarchies , however , this one seems to have outlived its usefulness , and to the extent that saint laurent still occupies the throne , it is primarily thanks to the indulgence of his subjects and to an abiding respect for his past achievements on the part of his peers his swaggering pants suits , worn with high heels , epitomized the newly liberated woman in collections dedicated to diaghilev s ballets russes and the splendor of czarist russia , in clothes that paid homage to mondrian , picasso , matisse , braque and van gogh , he extended fashion s range of expression in 1983 , at the height of his influence , the metropolitan museum of art staged a retrospective of his work an honor that has yet to be accorded any other designer in his own lifetime but for several years now , saint laurent has seemed at a loss for ideas , out of step with every new development in fashion including the recent revival of the 70 s , his heyday meanwhile , it is dior that is in the news , with the appointment of john galliano as the house s new designer , the celebration of its 50th anniversary , the dior retrospective currently on view at the metropolitan museum of art and , at the movies , madonna in the role of eva peron , dressed in dior and now this book judging from christian dior the man who made the world look new , by mariefrance pochna , which was published three years ago in france and arrives here in a serviceable translation by joanna savill , the new look was the culmination of a life that seems otherwise to have been fairly uneventful an impression confirmed by christian dior and i , his memoir published in 1957 , on which ms pochna heavily relies growing up in normandy and paris , enrolling at the faculty of political science to appease his parents , carousing every evening with artists and writers at le boeuf sur le toit , managing an art gallery , doing agricultural work in the french army during world war ii , selling fashion sketches to robert piguet and lucien lelong all this is mere prologue to that one earthshattering collection , the first under his own name , in 1947 ms pochna s account , like dior s , zooms in on the unveiling of the new look , the circumstances of which are set down at great length and in minute detail and then it s all downhill , even though dior proceeds to win awards and to open boutiques at the outposts of his empire the author of biographies of gianni agnelli and nina ricci , ms pochna brings to her subject a reporter s doggedness and a mechanic s knack for assembling a whole from dozens of parts the wisdom she has to offer is mostly received , including the notion that the new look found its inspiration in dior s memories of his mother and the clothes she wore when he was a child during the belle epoque dior himself defined the style as a return to the art of pleasing it was also a return to certain obsolete dressmaking techniques , which the seamstresses in his atelier were obliged to learn all over again i wanted to 'construct' my dresses , dior said , molding them on the curves of the female body and stylizing its contours , emphasizing the waist and the width of the hips , highlighting the bust to give my dresses greater body , i lined virtually everything with cambric or taffeta , harking back to a tradition of couture that had long since been abandoned though the new look was billed as a revolution , suzanne luling , dior s childhood friend who supervised his public relations , assures us that dior was anything but a revolutionary indeed , the cultural context in which he moved and worked might more accurately be characterized as reactionary as a young man , dior allied himself with the handful of artists among them max jacob , the painter and writer , and rene crevel , the poet whose work was in defiance of the modernist creed journalists christened them the neoromantics they referred to themselves as the club and met at a bar called tip toes , on the rue tronchet among other things , they had their homosexuality in common

' with the hair flying and the bright eyes in fact , isabel arrives on the scene with twin cones of frizz in her hair and an expression as blank and vulnerable as a clean canvas she is bound in a confining dark dress , and during the shooting , the restraints were to go from snug to sore we got the corset down to 19 inches one day , ms kidman said , and i would be in pain and have bruises and stuff on my body when i took it off but it was a psychological thing , a thing where i wanted to be restricted really , really tight so that the more repressed i was , the i more i felt it what ms campion and ms kidman were after was not the period heroine who , in the actress s words , is divine , snide , bitchy , and every man s in love with her but someone who participates in her fate and then loses control of it isabel becomes strange and quite plain , ms kidman said doubts about whether the vivacious ms kidman could capture this elusive character occurred to ms campion during the preparation of the movie , and provoked what ms kidman described as the most difficult thing i have ever been through the two women first met in 1981 when ms campion saw ms kidman perform at the phillip street theater in sydney and cast her in her graduation film for the australian film , televison and radio school but the headmistress of the allgirl north sydney high school would n't give the 14yearold time off the daughter of australian parents , ms kidman was born in hawaii at a time when her father , a biochemist , was studying there , but she was reared in sydney from the age of 3 so effective is her command of american and british accents on screen that it is startling to hear how very aussie she sounds in life so ms kidman did n't get the part , but she did come away with a postcard from ms campion i would like to direct you in something classical , it said it was a piece of correspondence that ms kidman treasured but put little stock in and the main thing i remember her saying was that you have to protect your talent , which i did n't understand at all i just thought , 'well , how am i going to protect it \? ' i have just got to get out there and work which was my attitude now i understand what she was saying
houston , aug 3 the mets had every right to feel ok about their 11game , twoweek road trip as they flew back to new york tonight they scraped out five victories against four teams that were playing well , this in spite of the mets' offensive swoon and the lingering physical problems of three starting pitchers but the bizarre manner in which they lost today s game to houston , 32 , probably eradicated any possible satisfaction with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth , two out , score tied and the count no balls and two strikes , mets reliever greg mcmichael hit luis gonzalez in the right thigh with a fastball todd hundley , the mets catcher , rose to his feet while craig biggio jogged across home plate with the winning run hundley gazed around the astrodome in total disbelief , looking like someone whose car had been swiped off the curbside in broad daylight this is a tough one to take , said juan acevedo , the reliever who allowed a tworun , gametying homer to biggio in the seventh inning to finish the road trip off like this does n't leave a very good taste in your mouth the mets maintained a rock climber s fingerhold to their place in the wildcard race , a couple of games behind the florida marlins thirtytwo of their final 53 games will be at shea stadium , a schedule , as mcmichael said , that is favorable but they are a vulnerable team , as they were in april , as they were in late june the starting rotation is fragile bobby jones is scheduled to have his sore back examined on monday , mark clark has been scratched from his start on tuesday because of a cut on his finger , and armando reynoso seems no closer to returning than bill pulsipher or paul wilson the mets are getting by , with brian bohanon and pete harnisch making up twofifths of their rotation for the time being dave mlicki and rick reed are their most reliable pitchers these days the bullpen is in poor condition , with the mets unable to acquire a reliever before the trade deadline and mcmichael slumping his nine losses are the most on the team , none of the defeats more brutal than today s the mets had control of this game , in a style typical for them this season bohanon shut out houston for five innings , the benefactor of a crazy play in the fifth inning sean berry blasted a long drive to left field , apparently an easy home run until it bounced off a set of overhanging speakers and fell into play , a freak occurrence that saved the mets a run it was only the second time in astrodome history that a player had hit a speaker in fair play , the first being philadelphia s mike schmidt , on june 10 , 1974 acevedo relieved bohanon with one out in the sixth and pitched through trouble that inning but he gave up a double to bill spiers in the seventh , on an 02 fastball pinchhitter jr phillips then grounded to first , and acevedo covered the base he seemed to pull up lame after stepping off the bag , his limp drawing manager bobby valentine onto the field with the pitching coach bob apodaca and the trainer fred hina acevedo waved them off , indicating he was fine , then threw a hanging curve with his next pitch biggio bashed it over the centerfield wall it was the fifth blown save in six opportunities for the mets' bullpen what killed me , acevedo said , was the 02 pitch to spiers mcmichael took over in the eighth he held off the astros that inning and retired the first two batters in the ninth before biggio singled biggio stole second , and mcmichael walked pinchhitter thomas howard , with several of the pitches close to being strikes he then pitched around jeff bagwell , loading the bases again , all of this happened with two out mcmichael threw a good fastball for the first strike against gonzalez , then got him to chase a changeup away with his second pitch no balls , two strikes , and gonzalez admitted later that he was in serious trouble so far down in the count to mcmichael i was feeling pretty good there , mcmichael said hundley called for an inside fastball mcmichael complied , trying to start the ball off the plate and run it back over the corner except this one stayed inside gonzalez never moved , and it hit his right thigh i'm not going to jump out of the way with the bases loaded and two outs , gonzalez said believe me , that was the last place i thought he was going to throw that pitch amen inside pitch pete harnisch learned sunday that he will start tuesday against st louis , in place of mark clark , who has a cut on the middle finger of his pitching hand harnisch has not appeared in a major league game since opening day , five days before he was placed on the disabled list with depression i'm not going to treat it like a world series , harnisch said , but i have n't been pitching

rome , jan 13 pressured by boeing s plan to acquire mcdonnell douglas , the four partners in the european airbus industrie consortium said today that they had agreed to make airbus an independent corporation the restructuring should help airbus reduce its manufacturing costs and make international alliances easier while paving the way for outside financial participation , including over the long term the possible public sale of its shares , airbus said in a statement issued at its headquarters in toulouse , france , airbus said the agreement represented an important initial step in the consolidation of the aerospace industry within europe today s agreement underscores the growing competition airbus sees if the proposed merger of its two principal rivals in the commercial aircraft market goes ahead discussions to change the shape of airbus , which had been dragging on for most of last year , were galvanized by the announcement in december of boeing s proposed takeover of mcdonnell douglas airbus aircraft are manufactured under a consortium composed of france s aerospatiale and germany s daimlerbenz aerospace , each with 379 percent of the business british aerospace , with 20 percent , and spain s construcciones aeronauticas , with 42 percent the airbus consortium , which sold its first jet in 1974 , has grown to be a formidable competitor to boeing , the market leader under its present structure , the consortium entrusts airbus with direct control only of the marketing and sale of its aircraft under today s agreement , the design and procurement of components , production testing and aircraft servicing are to be controlled by the new company s management , airbus said nevertheless , today s agreement represents little more than a memorandum of understanding , with only a broad outline of the future shape of airbus as a limited liability company airbus executives , as well as industry experts , said the toughest part of transforming airbus into a single corporation lay ahead airbus said that transferring assets , such as design facilities and manufacturing plants , to the new company hinged on both a judgment of how far the assets are essential for the construction of airbus jetliners and on a detailed valuation of the assets airbus said it expected to have the study completed by the end of this year although none of the partners disclose separate profit and loss figures for their airbus activities , analysts generally assume that only british aerospace , which has undergone aggressive cost cutting in recent years , is profitable in any significant way today s announcement said that the partners' future shareholdings would be in line with present shares yves michot , the aerospatiale chairman , in an interview with the paris daily le monde , said that the restructuring , which will be complete before the end of 1999 , would have to take place with shareholding strictly the same as now but analysts in london said it would be difficult to bring in the four companies' assets without altering their individual shares , or compensating stronger partners , like british aerospace , through cash payments initially , work on airbus jetliners was split among the partners according to their share in the consortium but in recent years airbus partners have bid for project stakes thus , on the airbus 185seat a321 a larger share of construction was awarded british aerospace , the most efficient and profitable of the partners jean pierson , the french chairman of airbus , has insisted that even more outside contracting is necessary to keep airbus competitive with boeing indeed , airbus has recently been holding talks with korean air and samsung aerospace industries of south korea about a possible risksharing partnership to develop a 550seat jumbo jetliner to compete with boeing s 747 mr michot , in his interview , said that the italian aircraft manufacturer alenia was in line to join the consortium partners to develop the jumbo aircraft , as well as a 100seat aircraft that airbus plans today s agreement empowers airbus to eventually raise outside cash for financing new aircraft an airbus official said , however , that the eventual sale of shares to the public would not be in the near future
last summer , months before juliette binoche won her academy award and years after william hurt won his , i saw them in a quirky new film with much wry charm in a couch in new york , she is a dancer fleeing a romantic mess in paris and he is a harried manhattan psychoanalyst they trade apartments she cures his patients , and eventually their love lines cross the film s charm was a major shock , because a couch in new york was having its premiere on a plane and i expected it would make me want to jump out the window the film s sad reputation had preceded it an unlikely romantic comedy by the avantgarde belgian director chantal akerman , this film had not found anyone willing to release it in american theaters it was one of those pathetic orphans headed straight to video a couch in new york is , in fact , coming to home video in june without having landed in theaters \( a television screening on showtime in the wee hours , and a few screenings at the american museum of the moving image in queens and a san francisco theater hardly count \) and its situation is not unusual these days video stores and catalogues are loaded with films that never made it to a cineplex some movies actually do this on purpose honey we shrunk ourselves , the new bestselling sequel in the honey series , is the first liveaction feature disney has made especially for video rick moranis is the same unintentionally mad scientist and bumbling dad he played in honey i shrunk the kids and honey i blew up the kids , which did well in theaters in honey we shrunk ourselves , dad shrinks himself and three other grownups to microscopic size , and an aging film series makes a seamless transition from theaters to video disney latched onto a booming builtin audience several years ago when it made its aladdin sequels especially for video kiddie videos make economic sense they 're faster and cheaper to produce than movies for theaters they sell for about 20 and children watch each one about 4 million times \( or maybe it just seems that way \) movies for grownups go directly to video for more complicated reasons some , like two stunning compilations that pay homage to the lumiere brothers and their invention of an early movie camera , are simply too esoteric to have a large commercial life others , like a couch in new york , have bad luck , bad timing or both \( the film was locked into a video release date before ms binoche won her oscar for the english patient , which might have helped push couch into theaters \) and , let s face it , most straighttovideo movies are just plain bad most films intended for home video are genre pieces , cheaply made and ready for the compost heap they are loaded with killers , evil spirits and an amazing number of lethally vengeful scorned lovers directtovideo is where fading stars go to pay the mortgage and avoid total oblivion it s where you can keep up with the career of mickey rourke things do n't have to stay that way like cable television , video has not begun to fulfill its potential as an outlet for daring work meanwhile , there are a few hidden treasures to be found at the video store when video browsing , it helps to remember two harsh but realistic rules first , never trust the advertising on the jacket stanley tucci was brilliant as an actor , a director and a writer of big night do not go near his straighttovideo sex and the other man , a painfully bad satire in which he is held hostage by a couple with an impotence problem \( the husband is ron eldard of men behaving badly do n't let him sway you either \) second \( and in spite of rule no 1 \) , we all know that expectations diminish when you watch a film at home you can work with this think of it as the airplane principle if the movie does not make you want to jump out the window , you 're ahead of the game here are the best of some recent films that have gone straight to video \( or have taken the tiniest theatrical detour \) kiddie tapes in august , disney will release pooh s grand adventure , the first fulllength winnie the pooh movie in 20 years and toy story ii will be made as a directtovideo film , with tom hanks and tim allen returning as the voices of woody and buzz if the two aladdin sequels suggest anything , it is that the animation is not as dazzling as the disney originals , but is much better than most directtovideo movies and there is no end in sight from disney or anyone else honey we shrunk ourselves like the earlier films in the series , this is a quiet family comedy with efficient computer effects , a good old reliable movie rather than a dazzling one here , the children are left alone to party while a particlesize mom and dad and aunt and uncle struggle to get big in a funny set piece , the tiny adults take a wild ride in a hot wheels car they are also dumped down a laundry chute as threatening as the grand canyon , and dwarfed by a daddy long legs this installment loses some of its childappeal by making grownups the center of attention , but watching your parents feel small has satisfactions of its own
the accidental , yet monumental , meeting between the greatest living yankee and the newest yankee occurred outside the yankee clubhouse yesterday as hideki irabu was walking toward the bullpen in left field and joe dimaggio was strolling up the dugout runway on his way to george steinbrenner s private box it was a priceless three minutes during oldtimers' day the memorable meeting of the yankee past and the yankee present began with a long handshake and continued with a smiling dimaggio congratulating irabu on his initial victory irabu , whose passion for the yankees is supposedly the reason he only wanted to play in new york , glowed as he talked through his interpreter with the man he described as one of his idols dimaggio is renowned for protecting his privacy and never visits the cramped , and bustling , clubhouse with the other older yankees because he does not want to be hounded the hall of fame center fielder even turned down the current center fielder bernie williams s request for an autograph last year yet dimaggio seemed genuinely intrigued about meeting irabu they walked 200 feet together underneath yankee stadium before stopping near the visiting clubhouse as their conversation subsided dimaggio asked irabu about a japanese person he knew and irabu smiled , nodded and said he knew the man finally , dimaggio turned to kota ishijima , the interpreter , and said , tell him i said good luck even before meeting dimaggio , irabu was the player several old yankees were raving about during their annual visit to the bronx they praised irabu for his powerful pitches and his amazing poise during a 103 victory over the tigers before 51 , 901 last thursday that was the toughest thing i 've ever seen anyone go through , said whitey ford , the hall of famer picture me going to tokyo and 400 people with cameras chasing me i would have hid somewhere steinbrenner complimented irabu friday by saying no yankee in his 25 years as an owner has ever endured as much pressure as the 28yearold did on thursday not reggie jackson or catfish hunter , two expensive free agents who arrived with huge expectations no one the old yankees agreed with steinbrenner none of us were in his shoes , jackson said he had never pitched in this arena to be successful and do what he did , he needs to be commended reggie was established and catfish was established , sparky lyle said all they had to do was maintain what they had done before here , you have got a kid who was in the big leagues for the first time he made believers out of everyone irabu s face brightened friday when he was asked about visiting monument park and about how he first became a yankee fan he said that he read a book about babe ruth as a boy and decided that he eventually wanted to play for the yankees there is n't any other place to play , said lyle , who listened to irabu s debut on radio this is the place he wanted to play how many players today say that \? both lyle and ford were envious of irabu s repertory , which includes a 99mileperhour fastball and a nasty splitfinger pitch that dives and darts and still travels 91 mph ninety miles per hour \? lyle said that was my fastball with a little extra hump ford added we used to call a splitter a spitter in my day you could get thrown out of baseball for throwing it now everyone throws it even though irabu has expressed appreciation for yankee history , he sat near his locker reading while the oldtimers played a threeinning game and was lucky to bump into dimaggio ishijima said irabu is not the type to display emotion in a setting like yesterday s until irabu met dimaggio , that is photo yanks' hideki irabu meeting joe dimaggio beneath stands at stadium after oldtimers' ceremonies yesterday \( jose r lopez the new york times \)

in just one day last week three stories were reported that told of the stunning successes the chinese politburo has achieved in manipulating america and diminishing it as a credible political player in the far east americans can find similar stories almost every day in their press but american journalism , like american diplomacy and politics , has failed to show the clear line that connects the stories and historically meaning from tomorrow deep into the next century that failure can be the politburo s biggest triumph of all one story dealt with china s plan to influence the american presidential race and how president clinton insisted that the agent of beijing s chief overseas economic commercial partner be given a role in the campaign this agent , john huang , received regular cia briefings if the white house does not understand that anything interesting the cia told him found its way through his indonesian masters to their beijing partners , it would be obscene selfdelusion amounting to dereliction of duty another story was about the growing worry in congress that us intelligence has not kept track of how china s increasing military and political power affect america the house has called for a report within a year it appropriated 5 million to hire academics to help our multibilliondollar intelligence machinery the third story told of how the dissident movement has been crushed in china the communists got a free hand when the clinton administration dropped human rights as a goal of its foreign policy the communists then had no worry about economic penalty for the torture and murder of chinese guilty of trying to express themselves so they set to work just another human rights story but the connecting line among all the successes of china is human rights the line begins with president clinton s decision in 1994 to renege on promises he had made to use economic pressure to help imprisoned chinese and tibetan dissidents human rights for chinese the right to speak , write and worship as they choose should be important in themselves to americans they should make us cherish and protect our own , inspire us to give a hand to those who have none the apologists for china sneer at all that what are we , missionaries \? they say americans supporting human rights thirst for enemies after the soviet breakup and select china for the role this is a knowing falsehood the opposite is true like other policestate rulers , chinese communists live in fear of their people s desire for liberties they see american democracy as the danger to the communist party , the inevitable enemy they search out other dictatorships for help in damaging america that is why china sells nuclear technology to the likes of iran to weaken america that is the connecting line in politburo policy for mr clinton , the decision to betray chinese human rights was the beginning of the line to the other accommodations and appeasements that flowed from it could he have brought into his campaign a man useful only because of his links with china , direct or indirect , if he were still standing up to what the communists were doing to dissidents \? the president s men , and women , walk the line with him for career reasons , they pretended to believe his cynical fantasy that deserting human rights would somehow make the communists improve human rights they said straightfaced that it would also persuade the politburo to safeguard america s security interests no more sales of cruise missiles and nuclear technology to the irans of the world so when american intelligence did report those sales , the administration whined a bit but accepted beijing s insulting answer that it knew nothing about the sales they expected americans to believe even pistols could be exported from china without beijing s approval only one thing prevents beijing from fully relishing its double victory over chinese human rights and america s claims to international moral leadership beijing has not yet stamped out one human rights struggle the passion for freedom of worship yesterday the us again acknowledged the persecution of christians in china america s government will try to remain detached america s people may not

asked robert troutwine , an industrial psychologist in kansas city who does behavioral testing for five nfl teams , including the new york jets tests of basic math and other skills are common for bluecollar jobs , and executives may be put through the paces in comprehensive tests of communications skills or leadership traits but unlike corporate america , which increasingly uses tests that put people in specific worklike situations , football teams are focusing on behavioral or psychological testing among the things they look for are whether a player will be a good citizen off the field , how he will behave on the field and whether he is a good fit with the organization before this weekend s draft at madison square garden \( the top pick last year , keyshawn johnson , received a 65 million signing bonus and a sixyear contract worth 15 million to 17 million \) , the majority of the draft choices underwent the league s 50question , 12minute basic intelligence test it was given at the annual scouting combine , held in february in indianapolis at the combine , prospective draft picks are timed , measured and interviewed by representatives of the 30 nfl teams in what is a veritable stress test in itself athletes take physicals , sweat through a series of 40yard dashes and lift a barbell laden with 225 pounds as many times as possible then they are herded toward a hotel suite and barraged with questions the league s general intelligence test was developed for football players by wonderlic personnel test inc , a libertyville , ill , company that tailors exams for 175 occupations , from stock broker to chemist to police officer the basic test , which wonderlic says is used by fortune 500 companies , is supposed to measure cognitive ability , or aptitude for learning , as well as the ability to apply something learned to a new situation in addition , many teams sweep players into their suites to take personality and behavior tests administered by their own psychologists the new york giants , for example , give a 460question psychological test to more than 150 prospective draft picks each year players answer true or false to statements like these i think i would like the work of a dress designer sometimes i feel like smashing things women should not be allowed in cocktail bars by itself , each question may be meaningless but taken in clusters , the questions and answers provide a glimpse at how athletes communicate and process information and how they view women , authority and life the character of your player has always been just as important as how high he can jump and how fast he can run , said george young , the giants' general manager we can see guys run and jump we 're trying to see what kind of person he is and if there are any red flags there were plenty of red flags in the background of defensive tackle christian peter , whose abusive behavior toward women while he was at the university of nebraska was widely reported peter was initially drafted by the new england patriots , but the team waived him a few weeks later , citing those incidents as the primary reason peter , who did not play football last year , is now with the giants dr joel goldberg , a licensed therapist who operates career consultants of union , nj , and runs the giants' employee assistance program , assuaged the team s concerns after testing and interviewing the player the guy was willing to do so much , dr goldberg said he sat out of football all of last year and really got involved with his selfhelp program dr goldberg does preemployment screening , using all types of tests , for clients including marcal paper , modell s and the new jersey sports authority of the test he developed for the giants , he said the real value of the test is to sort through the extremes an asset used too much becomes a liability for example , a player who is too aggressive may be a player who is uncontrollable , he said most nfl teams have begun using psychological tests as behaviorial indicators only recently the new york giants and the san francisco 49ers the two teams that probably do the most thorough mental screening have been looking at the minds of draft choices for more than a decade

tribeca s sure changing , said my guest , looking uneasily around city wine and cigar company we 're the only people here not wearing suits i followed his gaze through the beautiful room , past what appeared to be starchy stockbrokers and young investment bankers i took in the elegant french couple at the next table and the japanese men behind them he was right this crowd would have fit right in on the upper east side when drew nieporent opened montrachet 12 years ago , it seemed like a crazy idea the people living in the area were mostly artists who preferred cozy pubs like riverrun cafe but mr nieporent proved that tribeca could support destination \( as opposed to neighborhood \) dining other upscale establishments followed , easily attracting an affluent clientele from all over the city meanwhile , different restaurants were devoting themselves to feeding the growing local population characterized by good food and a casual attitude , there was not one , from the odeon to spartina , where you would feel uncomfortable in jeans now an entirely new sort of tribeca restaurant has come along originally conceived as a club for people who like to smoke cigars and drink wine , city wine and cigar company is neither a destination restaurant nor a casual one it is , above all , a sign of the transformation of tribeca the sprawling rooms are handsome and slightly selfconscious , as if they were primping for a spread in an architectural magazine walking from the large open bar past the spartan dining room for nonsmokers and through the cigar bar creates a kaleidoscope of impressions the tobaccocolored main dining room is all comfort and richness , coppertopped tables glowing in the soft light , a glasswalled wine cellar stretching into the distance with the thoughtfully orchestrated service , it is a 21 for the late 90 s the menu also breaks new ground the chef , patricia williams , has thrown out all the conventional notions of cooking for smokers this is not a red meat and potatoes menu but a carefully constructed group of dishes that stand up to cigar smoke and big wine through the sheer power of flavor ms williams s food is light , aggressive and very tasty she depends primarily on spice and texture her foie gras with fiery leeks and tamarind , for instance , is a surprise who would think that the rich subtlety of foie gras could support the sweetness of tamarind and the chiliheat of spiced leeks \?

purchase , ny but was it all a mistake \? eleven years ago , pepsico inc completed the restaurantbuying spree that made taco bell , pizza hut and kfc the unruly siblings of its booming beverage and snackfood businesses pepsico had a great run with the restaurants , but in the 1990 s ran out of good ideas at roughly the same time pricecutting and competition joined a public perception that the chains' formulas were tired now , pepsico is trying to get the underperforming units off its books still , while it was almost certainly not a mistake to buy the restaurants originally , the question is whether they can do any better out from under the pepsico umbrella and the nearly bottomless pit of cheap capital the corporation once brought to them paradoxically , that problem will have to be solved by the very architect of the initial strategy to buy the chains andrall e pearson , pepsico s president from 1971 to 1984 mr pearson , who is 72 years old , is the chairman of the spinoff , which will soon be a publicly traded fastfood empire with revenues second only to the mcdonald s corporation and with an awkward moniker more suggestive of an iron foundry tricon global restaurants inc the restaurants were the growth engine of pepsico , mr pearson said in an interview in his office overlooking pepsico s sculpturerich corporate park i'm not presiding over their departure i'm presiding over their rebirth joining mr pearson as a midwife of the new venture is david c novak , 44 , an 11year pepsico executive who is mr pearson s understudy and heir apparent their plans for the new company sprucing up kfc , expanding at home and abroad hardly seem revolutionary but , mr novak said , the essential change would be the focus he and his fellow managers could bring to operations for the first time in the history of these brands , they 'll be run by a restaurant company , by people who know and love the restaurant business , said mr novak , who now heads both kfc and pizza hut north america at tricon , you wo n't have marketing people dreaming up products that ca n't be prepared for the customer the two men will have their work cut out for them the fastfood industry in the united states has been in the doldrums of late , with even the market leader , mcdonald s , finding that old formulas no longer exert the magic they once did moreover , even as fastfood chains battle one another to the last happy meal , they are coming under siege on new fronts , from pricecutting casualdining chains and upscale takeout restaurants like boston market to supermarket delicatessen counters the most formidable operational challenge facing tricon \( pronounced trycon \) is to turn around pizza hut , which accounts for nearly 50 percent of the group s profits , according to andrew j conway , an analyst at morgan stanley company sales at domestic pizza hut stores were down 41 percent from 1995 to 1996 , while those at kfc were up 54 percent and those for taco bell rose 1 percent though strong for years , pizza hut began to have difficulty positioning itself between the delivery chains like domino s pizza inc and the local momandpops in every market area and in the mid1990 s , its pattern was volatility , with results tied almost completely to the success of newproduct offerings such as stuffed crust pizza analysts predict that mr novak will try to turn around pizza hut using methods that worked at kfc after he took over there in 1994 at kfc , he perked up the decor , instituted intensive training programs to improve service , pushed new products like chicken pot pies and took on boston market , a unit of boston chicken inc , directly by selling mixandmatch buckets of tender roast chicken parts to consumers who did n't want to buy a whole chicken or even half of one mr novak has already instituted a 50 million revamping of pizza hut s entire menu , service and ambiance in addition , at kfc , he has quelled a rebellion among longtime franchisees angered at encroachment on their territory from new kfc outlets and has adopted a generally cooperative attitude toward them , in contrast to pepsico s old imperious ways he is likely to do the same with franchisees for tricon s other chains david novak is a super leader , and i made the best profit last year that i 've ever had , said pete harman , an owner of 265 kfc outlets in four western states and a former plaintiff in a nowresolved franchisees' lawsuit mr harman predicted that there will be a whole new attitude toward us in the new company as operating manager of his own business , analysts said , mr novak will be able to execute changes more rapidly than under pepsico if a new product like stuffed crust pizza works , mr novak might quickly pile on more marketing money to make it a success but if a new initiative bombs , like taco bell s border lights a lowfat line of mexican food it can be yanked without the multilayered approval process necessary at pepsico there is just no way that a 33 billion company can devote the same attention to the restaurants that david and i can , mr pearson said of pepsico
andre agassi , that soothing vision in pink , was n't in the pink last night at the united states open unseeded and , he hoped , underrated , the 66thranked agassi was praying to come down with an incurable case of deja vu and reprise his impossible journey to the open s 1994 championship , the grand slam he won despite being unseeded but last night agassi , who had not yet faced a seeded player , much less one sporting a samurai s topknot , ran into trouble in the form of 13thseeded patrick rafter of australia although agassi strutted into last night s round of 16 match with a 41 record against the netminded australian , and with a 20 lead in their grand slam meetings , it was rafter who dictated the pace and the proceedings and made certain this match was no crowdpleaser he swiftly served himself into possession of the opening set , saved two set points before claiming the second , gave agassi a nostalgia set in the third , but ultimately departed arthur ashe stadium having given a 63 , 76 \( 74 \) , 46 , 63 wakeup call to the bald one if agassi has serious designs on a comeback , he ca n't count on getting by on a game that s an imperfect throwback it s time to do to his errors what he s done to his hair shave them away genuine serveandvolley players like rafter , a dying but difficult breed , never used to bother agassi much when he was in his heyday he used them for target practice for his passing shots , which invariably lived up to their name but agassi does n't pack the same punch he used to , and while he s been off on his various sabbaticals , the rest of the tennis crowd , rafter included , has started packing a harder punch agassi s downtheline backhand passes fooled rafter some of the time , but not often enough and rafter s smooth servevolley formula did more than keep the former no 1 on his toes , it kept him guessing after saving two set points at 56 with a volley winner and a clean ace , rafter took a 43 lead in the tie breaker and stayed in front for the duration an unchased volley gave him a set point , and a service winner that glanced off agassi s racquet frame gave him a twosetstonone lead but something kooky happened in the third set just when agassi , down by 41 and apparently too pooped to participate , seemed to be well on his way to a straightset disappearing act , he changed his act after holding onto his serve for 42 , he used a forehand pass to break for 43 , held for 44 , and broke rafter again in the ninth game the double fault rafter served at break point was all the tonic agassi needed to serve out the set and stir up the crowd even rafter felt the mood of the match take a dangerous swing when he won that third set , i thought he was going to come back , rafter said after reaching his first open quarterfinal , where he will face sweden s magnus larsson rafter cranked out a final backhand volley winner in the witching hour mist i did n't start off sharp , said agassi , who began 1997 ranked 12th in the world , dropped to 74th and could dip as low as 100 due to his inability to match the semifinal finish he had here last year from two sets to love down it s pretty tough to come back , and he did what he needed to do whether agassi will be back next year for his favorite slam remains to be seen if he does n't , he , and his shirt , will be missed photo patrick rafter defeating andre agassi , 63 , 76 \( 74 \) , 46 , 63 \( michelle v agins the new york times \)
boston , april 21 while the 101st running of the boston marathon lacked speed and passion today , at least the top racers in the women s wheelchair division were willing to attack jean driscoll of champaign , ill , and louise sauvage of australia played a game of cat and mouse for 22 miles until the unthinkable happened driscoll , who was attempting to become the first athlete to win boston eight times , wheeled into the groove of a trolley track , flipped her wheelchair and rolled on her back helped up , she continued the final four miles of the 262mile race on a flat tire and still finished second , providing most of the drama on an afternoon when all the familiar champions were swept aside by such deflating circumstances as a stiff head wind , malaria , bronchitis and stress fractures this is the race i plan my life around , said the 30yearold driscoll , who finished in 2 hours 1 minute 15 seconds , while sauvage took first in 1 54 29 i was n't just going to lay on the ground a kenyan won the men s open race for the seventh consecutive year as lameck aguta used his sprint training to break a mexican challenge in the final one and a half miles , taking first place in 2 10 34 fatuma roba of ethiopia became the first african woman to win the boston marathon as she crossed the tape in 2 26 23 she also became the first reigning olympic champion male or female to win boston in the following year roba , 26 , toyed with elana meyer \( 2 27 09 \) and colleen de reuck \( 2 28 03 \) , both of south africa , before easing away in the final two miles first place for roba and aguta was worth 75 , 000 apiece none of the other defending boston champions was able to make a recovery as stirring as driscoll s uta pippig of germany , who was attempting to become the first woman to win four consecutive boston marathons , had not been able to train sufficiently since suffering stress fractures in her right foot and leg at the 1996 summer olympics she dropped off at 16 miles and finished fourth in 2 28 51 moses tanui of kenya , the defending men s champion , contracted bronchitis a week ago , which made breathing difficult today he hung on gamely beyond 24 miles before slipping to fifth place in 2 11 38 at least he fared better than his countryman cosmas ndeti , who won boston in 1993 , 1994 and 1995 , but caught malaria last february not completely fit , ndeti finished a distant 27th in 2 22 56 , far off his course record of 2 07 15 with the exception of roba , who has now won the world s two most prestigious marathons in the olympics and boston , today might have been more significant for the running demise of pippig and ndeti than for the ascent of any new stars the winning times were disappointing , considering that men s champions had posted times under 2 08 at london and rotterdam , the netherlands , in the last eight days , and that tegla loroupe of kenya won the women s race in rotterdam on sunday in 2 22 07 the men s race shaped up as expected as a battle between kenyan and mexican runners , but a 12mileanhour head wind and tentativeness kept the pace to a crawl only 3 of the first 13 miles were run under five minutes , and a pack of about 25 runners went through the halfway point in 1 06 11 , before aguta came home it was a psychological problem for all the guys , said aguta , who is 25 when they saw all the guys were there , no one wanted to work i thought i was jogging the slow pace played right into his hands in three previous appearances at boston , none higher than fourth place , aguta had been impatient , starting too quickly and running out of gas today , he bided his time for the final sprint in the women s race , roba was content to stay with meyer and de reuck , even letting them lead on the famous series of hills called heartbreak between 17 and 21 miles but there was no question who would win roba ran mile 24 in 5 27 , then drew away before mile 25 roba s victory was not as fast as the 2 26 05 she ran at the olympics , but it authenticated her international credentials she was a big surprise in the olympics , meyer said of roba today , she proved she can do it on a consistent basis no one had been more consistent at boston than driscoll , who had won the women s wheelchair race the previous seven years billy demar won the men s open race seven times between 1911 and 1930 , but no one had won eight times driscoll , who holds the world wheelchair marathon record in 1 34 22 , seemed a sure bet but she had lost by a second to sauvage in the los angeles marathon last month today , every second mattered while driscoll led on the hills , sauvage caught her on the flats at 223 miles , driscoll tried to make an inside move on sauvage as they headed into a turn , only to catch her right wheel in a trolley track and roll her wheelchair it did n't seem fair , sauvage said the question was whether driscoll could recover for second place born with spina bifida , driscoll had spent a year in a body cast after a bicycle accident in high school before last year s race , she had fractured the femur in her left leg while tubing on a river still , she had won today , she gave no thought to quitting a volunteer or a police officer helped to right driscoll , who was strapped into her wheelchair the accident had pulled the right tire from its rim , and driscoll had to let the air out to refit the tire pressured by an oncoming competitor , she wheeled the rest of the way on a flat tire and held on to second place this is more important than the olympics , where there is an exhibition wheelchair track event for women , driscoll said it s disappointing not to win my eighth , but i'm as human as anyone else that s racing finish lines the top american finishers were kim

paris europe s progress toward political and economic unity , glacial though it may be , is opening the continent to a level of worldwide competition that is unprecedented in its traditionally insular markets radical change is shaking some of europe s biggest industries , leading to widespread job losses philippe martinez , head of one of france s leading leftist unions , is having none of it seated in an office under a poster with the words to privatize is to destroy , mr martinez typified the anger displayed by those who think that greater european unity and global competition will destroy jobs , income and a sense of security that huge , governmentowned employers and cosseted industries have provided to generations of his countrymen the government s acting like a greedy investor , he said the united states , of course , went through a similar upheaval in recent years as corporations cut tens of thousands of jobs to increase productivity and stay competitive but in europe , with rigid social structures and traditionally strong labor movements , the tension is even greater in germany , coal miners from the industrial ruhr basin stormed into bonn recently to protest cuts in coal price subsidies , a move they say will destroy thousands of jobs and in berlin , construction workers demonstrated to protest the hiring of cheap labor from ireland , england and portugal in france , truck drivers demanding more pay used their vehicles in february to block highways and ports more recently , auto workers in france and belgium took to the streets to protest renault s plans to close a factory near brussels , cutting 3 , 000 jobs , and to lay off 3 , 000 more workers in france indeed , nowhere is the tension more apparent than in france while european leaders forge ahead with plans for a single market , much remains to be done in france , and the prospect of restructuring and layoffs is spawning a fierce conflict that pits french values against the harsh realities of international competition there is a clear contradiction between our traditions and our recent political decisions , said eric barthalon , chief economist at paribas , the french financial services company the absence of public debate about that contradiction is what troubles france , he said , more than our rigidity the conflict is vividly clear at renault , france s largest auto maker , which is trying to return to profitability after a 924 million loss in 1996 because of an unfortunate combination of poor organization , manufacturing inefficiencies and a reluctance to venture too far from france , the company has become an alsoran in the world market a planned marriage with volvo fell through a few years ago , and now renault faces the toil of getting into fighting trim to take on an expected invasion of japanese cars louis schweitzer , the chairman and chief executive of renault , readily admits that much of its difficulty lies in the poor organization of its factories , where low output and a multiplicity of models built under one roof prevent the economies of scale required to stay competitive what mr schweitzer is slower to acknowledge is the effect of bad management decisions , often made under government pressure to save jobs in french factories , overseas investment was neglected in 1987 , renault , whose full name is regie nationale des usines renault , pulled out of north america , selling a 46 percent share in american motors to chrysler in the 1990 s , a deal to build trucks with volvo collapsed when it became clear that the biggest changes , and most job losses , would come not at volvo s plants in sweden but at renault s inefficient factories in france some experts even question the government s wisdom when , in 1990 , it appointed mr schweitzer , a former government official described by one industry executive as a very intelligent , thoughtful civil servant , yet not an automobile man with gasoline in his blood not that renault has been standing still to cut costs , mr schweitzer has slashed 30 , 000 factory jobs , roughly a quarter of the total , since 1990 and renault has consistently turned out exciting new models , from the bright little twingo subcompact to the more recent megane scenic , a sleek van that european motor magazines named 1997 car of the year yet renault s factories remain bloated and costly , and in december mr schweitzer reshuffled top management , hiring carlos ghosn , a hardnosed turnaround artist , and giving him key management duties the average size of our factories is 125 , 000 cars a year , while all our competitors are at 200 , 000 , and our plants are more complex than theirs , mr schweitzer said in an interview while most car makers seek to concentrate on one model at each plant , renault s compact clio , for instance , is assembled at five of its nine european sites moreover , while volkswagen and fiat have built factories in latin america , asia and eastern europe , renault remains stubbornly local , with 85 percent of its sales in europe the french government has for years been gradually selling off control of more than a score of huge enterprises like banks , insurance companies , industrial companies and even renault itself last year , the government sold stakes in 10 of the largest nationalized industries , and in may shares worth 88 billion in france telecom , europe s secondlargest telecommunications group after germany s national company , will go on the block
redford , tex , june 26 it was an encounter between four camouflageclad united states marines and a young man herding his family s goats on a rocky , desolate bluff of desert above the rio grande it ended when one marine fired his m16 rifle and hit the teenager , esequiel hernandez jr , who bled to death on a windswept hill overlooking his adobe home and the cemetery where he was buried a few days later as the controversy deepens over just what happened here on the mexican border on one evening late last month , the incident has also raised a wider question , one being asked angrily by people in this tiny village in the big bend of west texas and one being debated in congress should the marines have been here \? the marines , from camp pendleton , calif , were on a drugsurveillance mission , part of a military presence that has grown along the border since a decade ago , when the reagan administration secured a historic loosening of 19thcentury laws barring the use of military forces in domestic law enforcement with mexico now the prime gateway for cocaine and other illegal narcotics coming into the united states , many in congress say the military s role in the nation s war on drugs should be vastly expanded but critics of the policy say the death of mr hernandez , who had no criminal record and is not described by anyone as any kind of suspect in the drug trade , is a chilling example of the misunderstandings and the tragedies that they say will inevitably occur with the militarization of the border or any other patch of american soil days after the incident , which occurred on may 20 , the deputy commander of military operations along the border stepped forward to defend the marines , saying they had acted in strict compliance with the rules of engagement that proposition itself is sharply debated by texas officials , who say they have found numerous inconsistencies in the marines' account of acting in selfdefense after mr hernandez pointed his world war iera rifle at them as the residents of redford , who said they had never been told that armed forces were in their area on patrol , continue to mourn the death of a young man widely described as polite and bashful , they find the military s defense and the terminology it used deeply disturbing what are these 'rules of engagement \? ' asked diana valenzuela , a neighbor of the hernandez family , whose trailer is just down the hill from the spot where mr hernandez died , six days after his 18th birthday we had no idea we were being engaged in the first place i was amazed when i heard that the military was walking around the hills in our backyard leonel ceniceros , a schoolteacher , said it seems crazy to me now that they were even here when you think about it , these are young marines brought in here from out of state they 've probably been told there are drug dealers all over the place , you 're in enemy territory , protect yourself but the result is , this good young man is dead maureen bossch , a spokeswoman for joint task force 6 , the el pasobased military unit that conducts the border operations , said the military forces were extra eyes and ears for domestic federal agents and typically act as camouflaged observers though not allowed to make arrests , they have carried out hundreds of observation sorties along the border , passing on information to the united states border patrol and drugenforcement agents there is no question that drugs come into the united states all along the 2 , 000mile border and that armed bandits pose a major threat to federal lawenforcement agents but in povertyplagued redford , population 90 , where people struggle to grow alfalfa and onions or ranch on the harsh land , residents say no one here is getting rich off the drug trade they seem to worry most that officials in washington , in declaring a war on drugs , have turned their home into a war zone moreover , they say , it is not always easy to tell who the good guys are one of the county s biggest drug dealers ever is the former sheriff , rick thompson , sentenced five years ago to a life term for conspiracy to smuggle more than 2 , 000 pounds of cocaine ms bossch said any contact between armed marines and mr hernandez would have been highly unusual they 're certainly not looking for confrontation with anyone , she said , whether civilians or drug traffickers the killing itself , the first of an american civilian by troops since the armed forces were stationed along the border eight years ago , is shrouded in extraordinary legal contention albert valadez , the district attorney for a sixcounty area here , plans to bring all the evidence before a grand jury next month , holding out the possibility that one or more of the marines could be indicted for murder according to the military s account , provided at a news conference in marfa in late may by col thomas r kelly of the marines , the deputy commander of the military s antidrug task force , the marines were at the end of a threeday observation mission in the hills above the rio grande when mr hernandez fired two shots in their direction with the 22caliber rifle he had inherited from his grandfather they crouched in selfdefense , colonel kelly said , and one of them fired only when the young man threatened them with another shot , the colonel said

and bumper pool mom and dad drink martinis sounds like a place you 'd like to visit , does n't it \? but first , you 'll have to find it , which is n't easy because sammy s has no sign \( the ultimate snobbism \) you 'll know you 're getting warm , however , when the number of range rovers on the road starts to thicken sammy s may be the only former speakeasy in new jersey with mostly mercedesbenz station wagons parked beside it the crowd is equally homogeneous inside , where the uniform seems to be ralph lauren backpacks and a tan \( even especially in february \) if you 're pale and lugging a jansport , here s a guide to being inconspicuous at sammy s step one do not , repeat , do not ask for a menu a list of the relevant offerings hangs discreetly behind the maitre d'hotel stand , without prices for those to whom they matter , the appetizer of spaghetti with red sauce is 3 , and all the other appetizers range from 8 to 20 \( for shrimp scampi \) the entrees go from 28 to 38 \( for

children with quarters , time flies money , too an amstel lite is 425 martinis are 450 , and do n't expect to get your fur coat back from the checkroom unless you present your ticket \( scout s honor

slumming sammy s origins are authentically humble sam fornaro , who came to new jersey from italy via ellis island \( see his certificate upstairs \) , opened sammy s in 1933 mr fornaro was such an authority on steaks and people that by the time he died in 1972 , sammy s had evolved from a speakeasy into an institution it s now owned by his grandchildren samuel , philip and maryann the bartender says your name , none too loudly the signal that dinner is ready en route to the dining room , you notice on the counter a turning leaf cabernet sauvignon , an extremely reasonable red wine it s one of 70 reds on the list , which features more expensive selections , like a 1983 chateau lafite rothschild \( 210 \) , as well as 20 whites , including 11 chardonnays for the masses the decor is also oblivious to popular taste , which is what makes it so absolutely righton the floors are covered with linoleum , and the windows are unceremoniously shaded by wooden venetian blinds other homey touches include the wooden phone booth and the aroma of apple pies emerging from the oven mario buatta could n't have come up with a more authentic setting the food is famously unpretentious , which seems to be a prerequisite for steakhouses in a certain price range sammy s does n't serve anything as primitive as the salad of raw onion and tomato at peter luger in brooklyn , for example , but its first course its goodbad salad , as one customer calls it comes close the iceberg lettuce is pleasantly crunchy , and the vinaigrette , however harsh , is made with real red wine vinegar rather than nouveau balsamic order a side of roasted peppers and garlic , which improves the quality considerably two pastas you should also try are the penne with vodka sauce , one of the few in which you can actually taste the vodka , and the spaghetti with oil and so many crunchy slivers of garlic that it not only looks like a bowl of rice krispies but also speaks like one \( snap , crackle , pop and pow from all this garlic \) the batterfried scampi appetizer is also garlicky \( by now you 're beyond mints \) but worth the indigestion you know you 'll experience , not to mention the 20 certainly it s more spirited than the lobster appetizer , ruined by too much ketchup skip the two lobsters served as an entree , too , because steak is the highlight of any visit to sammy s the 16ounce new york strip \( 28 \) is more tender than the 32ounce tbone \( 38 \) , but the tbone has more fat , and therefore more flavor the two giant veal chops would be even more appealing if they were garnished with less lemon and a more interesting assortment of mushrooms desserts are strictly palm beach bath and tennis , says my friend deirdre , which , i think , means they 're like hospital food you 're not

for generations , the consolidation of new york city in 1897 was known in brooklyn as the great mistake by a margin of just 277 votes \( some say ballot boxes were stuffed \) , brooklyn , the nation s fourthlargest city , had voted to give up its proud and independent history foes of the merger predicted that forever after , brooklynites would live in the cursed shadow of manhattan while none of those doomsayers are still around , some of their descendants have kept the tradition alive each new blow or slight need we mention the dodgers' former owner walter o'malley \?

los angeles , jan 19 the newly released sketch of a man suspected of killing ennis cosby brought numerous tips to the los angeles police today , giving detectives a new batch of leads in a case that has already had its share saying they had lots of leads , lots of directions to investigate , the police late saturday released the sketch based on information provided by a woman who told investigators that she saw the killing the police artists also produced a sketch of a potential male witness who is wanted for questioning about thursday s shooting , which took the life of bill cosby s son ennis cosby was buried today in a private ceremony on his family s estate in shelburne , in western massachusetts the sketch released by the police here shows a rather grimfaced white male , wearing a lightcolored knit cap in a flier circulated with the sketch , he is described as being average in height and weight and 25 to 32 years old no further identifying information was provided on the man , who the woman said accosted mr cosby shortly after 1 am on thursday after he had pulled his mercedesbenz convertible to the side of interstate 405 on the west side of los angeles to change a flat tire , the police said the woman reportedly arrived on the scene just as the shooting took place she is said to have been previously summoned by cellular phone by mr cosby , a 27yearold graduate student in new york , who told her that he needed help in changing the flat there have also been news reports , which the police refuse to address , that at one point the assailant approached her car and she fled , only to return a short while later to find mr cosby fatally shot although the sketch was accompanied by few descriptive details , comdr tim mcbride of the los angeles police department announced on saturday night at a news conference that investigators were not by any stretch desperate for leads he said that besides questioning the woman , whom commander mcbride described as badly shaken , detectives were pressing to find the potential witness , a man detectives have been told was seen driving in the area where mr cosby was shot the commander said leads and information on the slaying , as well as information about other possible witnesses , were being gleaned from many 911 calls we have lots of leads , lots of directions to go in , he said there were numerous 911 calls , and we hope to get important information from them the sketch of the potential witness shows a white male , in his late 20 s to early 30 s , with dark hair , a mustache and a goatee he is wearing a beret , described as possibly purple , and has what appears to be a small mole on his left cheek investigators said he was at or near the scene when mr cosby was shot but the police said they did not know whether he had seen the shooting they indicated that another person , at a more distant point from the scene , had seen the man driving a blue hatchback in the area and , on the whim of a suspicion , had made a quick note of a hazy license number , then had reported the information to police headquarters the license was said to be possibly out of state , and its number was given as grh 921 police artists also produced a sketch of the car it has two doors and a noticeably large hatchback window robbery remains the most likely motive , commander mcbride said , but none of mr cosby s possessions appear to be missing he said detectives were inspecting the flat tire to see whether it had been tampered with , a reference to unconfirmed rumors that mr cosby s assailant may have planned the attack the most probable motive , at this time , appears to be robbery , the commander said there may have been other motives nothing obvious was gone but what you had out there was a 100 , 000plus vehicle and someone changing a tire in the middle of the night photo the police sketch of a suspect in the killing of ennis cosby \( reuters \)
beijing , march 8 on north xidan street , the crowds of shoppers were as thick as ever today , and the talk of the afternoon was the bomb that ripped through a public bus here on friday evening the police said the explosion was caused by a homemade bomb , and was not accidental , state television said today at least 10 people were reported seriously injured in the blast many shoppers and salespeople in the area expressed surprise that terrorism seems to have arrived in beijing , long considered one of the world s safest capitals , and several said they found it hard to accept that something that seemed to be a foreign phenomenon was now a domestic reality not that many seemed to cut back on what has become the city s favorite saturday afternoon pastime shopping i sit on that bus every day , said qiu hong , 26 , who was looking at leather shoes in the xidan shopping center with a friend i do n't want to have to worry about it every time i go home at night then , addressing her friend and gesturing at a pair of brown shoes with a tan bow over the toe , she said in a more serious tone these , what do you think of these \? ms qiu s reluctance to accept a new sense of danger , and her preoccupation with shopping , reflected the mood in beijing today about the explosion if the threat of political violence is now real no one has yet claimed responsibility for the bombing the possibility of sustained terrorism still seems remote it was not a very big explosion , said liu jinmen , a beeper saleswoman whose store is across the street from the bus stop where the explosion occurred there was a lot of glass on the street , but now you ca n't tell where it happened the beijing daily reported today that 10 people were injured by the explosion , and none killed a police spokeswoman insisted today that no one had died , though reuters news agency reported that two people were killed in the blast beijing television reported that an investigation showed the explosive was planted beside the lefthand seats three and four rows from the front of the bus although public disturbances in china have usually been left out of the official media in the past , today beijing television not only reported the news , but also said a reward had been offered for any information that leads to the arrest of the bombers witnesses reported seeing a momentary flash inside the no 22 bus before window glass shattered outward and victims poured off the bus , many of them burned one witness said she saw about two dozen people injured and taken for medical treatment even though robbery and other crimes have become more prevalent in recent years , many beijing residents consider their city relatively safe , particularly in contrast with cities in the united states , because it is still difficult to obtain weapons here , and because penalties for being caught are severe few law enforcement officials are permitted to carry a gun , and virtually no private citizens are one exception is for members of china s armed forces , and incidents of military officials brandishing a weapon in public to avoid paying a restaurant or a taxi bill are not uncommon yet explosions like the one friday evening at xidan are extremely rare because the blast resembled three similar explosions on public buses that occurred on feb 25 in urumuqi , the capital of the muslimdominated region of xinjiang in western china , there is wide suspicion that this explosion is similarly the work of advocates of independence for that region beijing was already under heightened security because the national people s congress , china s legislature , is in the middle of its twoweeklong annual session today , uniformed police officers were posted throughout the xidan area , and also at many bus stops as well asked if public buses were under tighter security checks , a bus driver who paused to pick up passengers near xidan simply shook her head to decline comment salespeople who work in the area every day seemed more concerned about it i never thought there could be a bomb in a public place like that , said a yogurt and fruit seller whose outdoor stall is a few dozen yards down the street from where the explosion occurred we 're standing here every day who says another bomb wo n't explode right here \? wu weidong , a shirt salesman in a nearby department store , said society is not so stable anymore , so there are going to be problems but i never thought we 'd have a bomb right outside the store
bridgetown , barbados according to the map and the tourist brochures , this is the easternmost country in the caribbean but when bill clinton and his staff arrive here on may 9 for two days of meetings with the prime ministers of the englishspeaking caribbean , they will be landing in a place that is not really interested in providing the easygoing , funinthesun atmosphere for which the region is known little england is the nickname that this small island nation 1600 miles southeast of miami wears with pride , and not just because most people attend the anglican church and play cricket , or because the harbor police wear uniforms that date from lord nelson s time in a region that has made a virtual religion of relaxation , barbados stands out as an island of primness and propriety letting their hair down is the very last thing ever on the agenda in barbados , said knolly moses , a veteran trinidadian journalist who runs pan media services , an online news agency based in jamaica discipline and efficiency always come first , and so it can take a bit longer to connect with them precisely because they are so straitlaced and obedient and do n't have the same humor and joie de vivre to their neighbors , bajans , as the 260 , 000 natives of this island are known , are the black brits , a term that can be both compliment and criticism not only do they come across as more formal , reserved and inhibited than is generally the rule in the west indies , but bajans are seen as more tied to the mother country , its traditions and mores than other former colonies maybe i am just buying into stereotypes , but i felt they did have a greater connection to england , said patrine archer straw , a jamaican museum curator who grew up in britain and recently visited here for the first time there was a certain quaintness about the place , a staidness , placidity and degree of predictability that you just would n't get in jamaica despite the island s small size and the somewhat claustrophobic atmosphere that comes with a population density of more than 1 , 500 people per square mile , those characteristics , combined with a welleducated , churchgoing work force and a low crime rate , have made barbados a prosperous society that is the preferred location for businesses seeking a caribbean regional headquarters i knew this was the place for us to be , a banker here said only halfjokingly , when i looked at the national coat of arms and saw that their motto is 'pride and industry' but it may also be possible to argue that this place is really more like the singapore of the caribbean , to use the words of a european diplomat here not that this island is authoritarian on the contrary , those in opposition today have been in power in the past , and there is a press that delights in criticizing the government the point is that this is also a society that values and emphasizes orderliness , conformity and restraint , even if that means the sacrifice of a degree of personal liberty and like their counterparts in singapore , the various governments that have been in power here in the 31 years since independence have been known to dabble in social engineering at the moment , for instance , there is great concern about the incursions that cocaine and marijuana may be making among the youth of barbados so a new regulation allows students to be bodysearched for possession of drugs any time two teachers agree that such a physical inspection is warranted the government has also taken umbrage recently at the loud reggae and soca music that often blares from vehicles here its solution an edict ordering the removal of all radios from taxis and minibuses , which are the main source of public transport oh but they run such a very tight ship , those bajans , said royston hunte , a guyanese waiter who has worked in new york and toronto as well as here it seems they have a rule to fit any situation you can think of at the airport , for instance , the first communication a visitor is likely to encounter is the official notice warning against the importation of obscene or indecent articles , while at the departure lounge the farewell notice is a proclamation advising that it is an offense to open dutyfree packages before boarding aircraft in between come the exhortations to tourists about proper attire on the beach and in the streets shoes and tops , please when asked what makes their country so different from its neighbors , bajans proudly note that alone among the caribbean islands barbados has always remained under the control of the people who originally settled here the white colonists and black slaves who began arriving in 1625 that means none of the french , spanish or dutch influences visible in places like st lucia or dominica are present , only a homogeneous anglican culture barbados was also exempted from the waves of indian and chinese migration that began after slavery was abolished in the 19th century and that have made the racebased politics of nearby trinidad and guyana so contentious though nothing in the phlegmatic response here indicates it , the mere fact that mr clinton is meeting with his caribbean counterparts here is a triumph for barbados after all , it is lester bird , the prime minister of antigua and barbuda , who is president of the 15member caribbean community and who , as such , last december formally invited mr clinton to meet with the prime ministers of the englishspeaking caribbean but protocol notwithstanding , it would have been a diplomatic embarrassment for all involved to hold a firstever summit meeting there members of the bird family and government have been implicated in drug and gunrunning operations , and recent united states government documents express concern about a surge in questionable banking operations in antigua and describe its justice system as a weak link in efforts to combat drug trafficking and money laundering on the other hand , george washington actually slept here before he became president so did ronald reagan in 1982 , when he met briefly with east caribbean heads of state and followed it up with a couple of restful private days at a resort here barbados was the safest choice and therefore the logical choice for a regional summit meeting , a senior official in one caribbean government explained recently after all , we are going there to work , not to have fun
what s going on in this photograph \? two girls on the edge of puberty are wading a stream one is pensive , turned inward the other looks around and stops in midaction , spying something that frightens her in the darkness of a tunnel what a decisive moment , and how fraught with sexual symbolism ! jeff wall , the photographer , must have been poised to take the picture at the second the revelation occurred he was he staged it a funny thing happened to reality on the way to the photograph the camera , true to its calling , registered what was before it , which was real enough , if a little too perfect , but not what it seemed to be the picture comes close enough to traditional documentary photographs to look like a lucky grabshot , at least on first inspection , but is instead a performance disguised as a snapshot manufacturing a reality that has the effrontery to look real , mr wall thrusts the camera s vaunted documentary powers into the realm of fiction in the region between illusion and reality , mr wall has a lot of contemporary company right now , jeff wall , an exhibit of 30 transparencies mounted in light boxes , is at the hirshhorn museum in washington , while work by 30 more photographers who concoct edgy alliances between fact and fiction are at the aldrich museum of contemporary art in ridgefield , conn , in a show ironically titled making it real at the aldrich , toy figures perform like actors in outoffocus movies , realistic landscapes shimmer in dayglo colors , and waxworks stand still for portraits from life it s as if these photographers had decided that if everyone thinks the camera lies , they might as well prove them right actually , the crucial issue may not be the camera but a gnawing sense that the world itself , knowable only through imprecise perceptions , is a tissue of uncertainties , ambiguities , fictions masquerading as facts and facts as tenuous as clouds life today resembles a fictional paradigm more and more and sometimes even outdoes the movie version o j simpson s ride in a white bronco might well have been an improbable episode on a television cop series the televised simpson and menendez trials so convincingly melded the forms of la law , all my children and oprah that talk show and soap opera ratings fell off small wonder if photographers , who traditionally pay close attention to the world , are making story boards for an equivocal universe jeff wall decided some time ago that the idea of the document was too predominant in photography , and that cinema , where the artificial and the real coexist without either taking precedence , was a better model every picture i 've made is an experiment in the gray area between the theatrical and the real , he said recently he goes to enormous lengths to dwell in this area , hiring actors and coaching them until they 're so exhausted they underact like real folks once he spent 26 weeks waiting for the right weather and hired a helicopter to stir up wind when nature would not oblige the hirshhorn retrospective , a big show of big work one photograph , eviction struggle , measures 90 inches by 163 inches is the most comprehensive of this canadian artist s 20year career organized for the museum of contemporary art in los angeles by one of its curators , kerry brougher , the show remains on view through may 11 , then travels to los angeles and the city of mito in japan making it real , organized by independent curators , is on view in ridgefield until april 20 and then travels as it happens , photography has been dallying with fiction since its invention , when reality still knew its place nineteenthcentury photographers staged tableaux and patched together composite photographs for artistic purposes , a style that pretty much went out of favor in america when straight photography , documentary and 35millimeter candid photographs moved to the forefront in the 1930 s and after theatrics returned several decades ago , and more recently art photographers have developed a taste for performances that look like the unrehearsed course of life passing by , a newly popular form of trompe l'oeil advertisements have done something like this for ages all those grumpy men being served coffee by smiling wives and achieving nirvana but no one claimed those were documents in mr wall s case , the light box display technique is directly borrowed from advertising , hinting that for some reason it has become necessary to market the real world other art photographers imply that lives measured out with coffee spoons are , after all , constructions , a fact that might as well be acknowledged tina barney and philiplorca dicorcia , for instance ms barney s photographs look like large blowups of snapshots that calmly and subversively capture the persistent disconnections in uppercrust lives family members standing at cautious distances from one another , making no eye contact , in elegant chintzcovered rooms in mr dicorcia s domestic documents , minor , offbeat incidents assume intense and puzzling significance , as when a man stares into a refrigerator that to judge from the aggressive light it casts on him , may be staring back
washington , april 9 congressional investigators issued subpoenas today to a group of conservative taxexempt groups as part of an inquiry into whether campaign contributions were funneled from conservative donors to republican candidates in ways that may have evaded federal election laws the subpoenas represent the first efforts by congressional investigators to look at republican campaign finance practice and were issued after democratic members of the senate governmental affairs committee prevailed on senator fred thompson , the tennessee republican who is chairman of the committee , to broaden the scope of the investigation until today , democrats received more than 60 of the committee s subpoenas , while the republicans received only two , setting off bitter complaints of partisanship by democratic committee members the newly issued subpoenas went to a broad array of conservative groups that spent millions of dollars in the closing days of the 1996 race on television advertisements and direct mail solicitations in support of republican candidates the investigators are examining whether these groups created a hidden , and illegal , route for money from donors to republican candidates those receiving subpoenas included the national policy forum , a taxexempt group founded by haley barbour , the former republican national committee chairman , that received donations and loans from the national committee americans for tax reform , which is headed by grover norquist , an adviser to speaker newt gingrich , and which received 46 million from the republican party in the last days of the 1996 election others receiving subpoenas were the citizens for reform , which spent more than 2 million in the last campaign on advertisements for conservative candidates in 10 states , and citizens for the republic education fund , which is headed by lyn nofziger , a former aide to president ronald reagan , which paid for advertisements in several congressional districts that attacked democratic candidates also receiving a subpoena was the triad management services group , a washington consulting group that was hired by citizens for reform and by mr nofziger s group to design television campaign commercials , to orchestrate a direct mail campaign , to make media buys and to help with fundraising triad is headed by carolyn malenick , a former fundraiser for oliver l north s unsuccessful senate campaign ms malenick did not return telephone calls for comment another group that received a subpoena was the coalition for our children s future , which spent money on advertisements attacking liberal congressional candidates using the same media consulting group that was hired by the republican national committee and the national republican congressional campaign committee this group paid for advertisements that supported representative j c watts s oklahoma house race and attacking representative cal dooley , a california democrat mr gingrich also headed fundraising drives for the coalition other subpoenas also went to the republican and democratic national committees and to the campaigns of president clinton and his republican opponent , bob dole congressional investigators say they are just in the early stages of their inquiry the main question is whether these groups coordinated their activities with the republican party , which would violate federal laws that prohibit such joint action another major question is whether donors who had already given the maximum amount to federal candidates made contributions to these groups to get money to favored candidates in amounts that exceeded federal campaign limits investigators will also examine whether any donors received tax deductions for their contributions to these groups nonprofit groups that accept taxdeductible donations are not allowed to engage in political activities campaign finance reformists have long criticized the role of nonprofit groups in political campaigns they say the activities of some taxexempt groups have constituted a shadow campaign that enabled donors to escape disclosure and allowed candidates to receive help from hidden sources of money in the last election , money from both liberal and conservative groups , some taxexempt , poured into congressional races on top of money that was spent by the candidates themselves in socalled independent advertisements courts have said in recent rulings that such expenditures are legal so long as they are not coordinated with the party or expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate because of murky federal election laws and court rulings , legal experts say the congressional investigators face a difficult task the way the law stands now , there is great latitude for nonprofits in the political arena , said kenneth gross , a washington lawyer who is an expert on election law the activities of some of these groups do n't even make it on the radar screen mark braden , a lawyer for triad management , as well as for citizens for reform and for citizens for the republic education fund , said his clients did nothing wrong i am confident none of my clients have done anything illegal , immoral or improper , mr braden said he said he saw nothing wrong with his clients' coordinating their activities or working jointly with the republican party he added that triad was hired by both conservative groups to raise money for them and manage a media campaign on behalf of conservative candidates i sure hope that everyone on the conservative side coordinates as much as legally possible , mr braden said have these groups been a conduit for illegal contributions \? the answer is no they did coordinate with members of the party of course they did but did the rnc direct these committees' operations \? the answer is no peter flaherty , president of citizens for reform , said his group spent 2 million last year on issue advocacy advertisements , but that none of the money was from the republican party
luciano pavarotti has not been giving colleagues and listeners his full attention in recent times reports from the 61yearold tenor s recital at the metropolitan opera a few weeks ago describe a man indifferent to his material and content with the easy acquisition of good will from a host of uncritical partisans the description will be familiar to anyone who observed mr pavarotti s casual approach to the muchadvertised three tenors concert last summer at giant stadium many met listeners , moreover , had looked forward to hearing mr pavarotti for the first time in la forza del destino this january , but on thursday it was un ballo in maschera instead the singer , a prolific canceller during his mature career , announced earlier in the season that he had not the time or the will or who knows , perhaps the ability to learn a new part at this stage of his career in a triumph of boxoffice appeal over repertory , the met took the nearly unprecedented step of holding the singer to his contracted dates and substituting one verdi opera for another that mr pavarotti more or less knows it has not been quite a scandal , but it comes pretty close to it many admirers , in any case , have not been pleased mr pavarotti has been careless , but he is not a fool and as riccardo on thursday , the honest effort in his performance was palpable he cuts a comparatively trim figure these days , and the voice , though lacking the bloom of youth , retained its authority in ensembles , mr pavarotti tended to go his own way , politely allowing his fellow singers to arrive at the ends of phrases before him indeed , persistent lag time kept james levine , the evening s conductor , on his toes mr pavarotti hectored accents perhaps more than he should , and fine points of rhythm were sometimes garbled he plays a king in this opera , however , and seldom did he fail to command attention what troubles those of us who deeply admire this career is not the vocal diminishment it is the apparent inattention there is a difference between a serious artist who is well paid and someone for whom being well paid becomes the art it would be sad to think that a great musical presence is now a locus of marketing possibilities the real operatic news was deborah voigt s amelia ms voigt has lost a great deal of weight but none of her voice this is a splendid verdi soprano clear , true , musicianly and communicative the drought in singing talent worldwide looks to be over women like ms voigt , karita mattila , renee fleming , jane eaglen and ruth ann swenson are now more than promises and should provide an exciting 10 years to come if mr pavarotti was greeted on thursday with polite enthusiasm , ms voigt s amelia and juan pons s bluff , solid renato clearly excited listeners youngok shin was the agile , athletic oscar florence quivar played ulrica for all its melodrama hao jiang tian and jeffrey wells made strong conspirators and added to this feast of good voices indeed , listeners clearly had singing on their minds , and a good thing , given the inert luxuriousness of piero faggioni s sets and costumes , not to mention the distracted stage direction of catherine hazlehurst the ballroom scene exploited the met s deep stage and capacity for crowd management the rocks framing act ii s gorge soared with outsized menace the interiors displayed the voyeuristic properties of a lives of the rich and famous episode the met s sevenyearold production , by the way , reverts to verdi s original \( but discarded \) setting at the court of sweden s gustav iii opera acting is always a problem , but seldom has it so clearly crossed the line into caricature thursday s procession of offtheshelf gestures included violent shudders , frequent staggering , handwringing , wifeflinging , swordwiggling and heroinecrawling as drama , it was hard to take this ballo seriously thank god for the voices un ballo in maschera opera in three acts by giuseppe verdi , libretto by antonio somma , based on the opera gustave iii , ou le bal masque by daniel francois auber conductor , james levine production , sets , costumes and lighting by piero faggioni stage director , catherine hazlehurst at the metropolitan opera with deborah voigt \( amelia \) , youngok shin \( oscar \) , florence quivar \( ulrica \) , luciano pavarotti \( king gustav \) , juan pons \( anckarstrom \) , christopher schaldenbrand \( christiano \) , hao jiang tian \( count de horn \) , jeffrey wells \( count ribbing \) , bernard fitch \( chief justice \) and charles anthony \( amelia s servant \) photo deborah voigt and luciano pavarotti performing in the met s ballo in maschera \( sara krulwich the new york times \)
washington , april 7 as the first major trial in a sexabuse case at the army s aberdeen proving ground in maryland is about to begin this week , the defendant , a former drill sergeant , today pleaded guilty to 11 counts of having sex with female trainees the defendant , staff sgt delmar g simpson , admitted under close questioning by a military judge that in a little less than two years he had had intercourse with 11 trainees on the couch in his office at the base in northern maryland in addition , sergeant simpson pleaded guilty to five instances of sexual harassment , including ordering a young private to report to his office in her gym outfit , but without underwear in a colloquy with the judge , col paul johnston , sergeant simpson gave detailed answers about the time and place of each sexual encounter and instance of harassment but sergeant simpson , 32 , whose trial on dozens of other violations of the uniform code of military justice may start as early as friday , insisted that all the sex was consensual , and he denied having raped any women under his command his trial will be the first in the current investigation at aberdeen in which a noncommissioned officer will be tried for rape sergeant simpson is charged with having raped 21 women , including 5 of those with whom , he said today , he had had consensual sex military law makes it a crime to have sexual relations , even consensual , with subordinates sergeant simpson could face a dishonorable discharge , as well as up to five years in a military prison , for each charge to which he pleaded guilty today if he is convicted on even one rape charge , he could receive a life term none of the reported rapes involved pure physical force or restraint the charges were based on the principle that coercion occurred because of the relationship between a drill sergeant and a trainee , said paul j marone , a former military lawyer who is a consultant at aberdeen according to the army , sergeant simpson appears to face the most allegations of rape of the more than 10 drill sergeants and 1 captain at the base who have been charged some sergeants have resigned as part of plea bargains , and others have pleaded to charges less severe than rape still others are awaiting courtsmartial since the investigation was announced last november , at least 50 women have made official complaints of sexual abuse at aberdeen , with many involving rape , and the inquiry has led to similar investigations at other army bases at fort leonard wood , mo , 28 instructors are under investigation involving sexual misconduct , and in november , two drill sergeants there were given prison terms for illegal sex with nine female recruits although the army is becoming smaller , women are playing a larger role in it six years ago , women made up 10 percent of a total uniformed force of 706 , 000 today , women represent 14 percent of a force of 495 , 000 and their numbers are apparently likely to keep rising women make up 20 percent of the youngest soldiers , the trainees one question the trial may not answer is why so many incidents appear to have occurred over so long a period at aberdeen army lawyers have said women may have been reluctant to report instances of perceived abuse because sergeant simpson s company commander , capt derrick robertson , had also preyed on at least one trainee last month , captain robertson was ordered to serve four months in prison and dismissed from the military after he had pleaded guilty to adultery and sodomy in exchange for the plea , military prosecutors dropped more serious charges of rape and indecent assault , which could have brought a life sentence captain robertson , 31 , admitted that he had consensual sex with a private at his home in september 1996 , after she had come to him to complain of sexual harassment by her drill sergeant as the investigation progressed , five of the original women who complained held a news conference to say they had been pressured by army investigators to portray their sexual encounters as having been coerced by the sergeants on sunday , the army dropped charges against one of those privates , saying she had lied when she denied having had sex with another drill sergeant the army said the charge against the soldier , pvt toni moreland , had been dropped because it was minor and would be expensive to prove but private moreland s lawyer , stuart j robinson , said the charge was dropped because the army had acted unprofessionally in questioning her and trying to force her to exaggerate her complaint mr robinson said that if other female complainants were subject to that approach it would help the defense in other courtsmartial
london , march 21 vs pritchett , the versatile and astoundingly prolific english writer who over a sixdecade career became a master of fiction , nonfiction , biography and literary criticism , died on thursday at whittington hospital here he was 96 a man of letters in the tradition of charles lamb , edmund wilson and william hazlitt at 88 , he published his last biography , of chekhov sir victor was perhaps best known for his dozens of meticulously observed short stories , in which he chronicled the extraordinary underpinnings of ordinary lives in story after story , mr pritchett made the commonplace fascinating , capturing subtleties of mood , language , behavior and motivation with precision and sensitivity these are social stories , eudora welty wrote in the new york times book review life goes on in them without flagging the characters that fill them erratic , unsure , unsafe , devious , stubborn , restless and desirous , absurd and passionate , all peculiar unto themselves hold a claim on us that is not to be denied they demand and get our rapt attention , for in their revelation of their lives , the secrets of our own lives come into view how much the eccentric has to tell us of what is central ! victor sawdon pritchett , the son of walter and beatrice martin pritchett , was born to genteel lowermiddleclass poverty in ipswich , suffolk , in 1900 , at the tail end of the reign of queen victoria , for whom he was named there was this cocksparrow , my father , now a commercial traveler , dressy and expansive with optimism , walking in and out of jobs with the bumptiousness of a god , he wrote in a cab at the door \( 1968 \) , the first volume of his memoirs there was our sulky , moody mother , either laughing or in tears victor s micawberlike father was a boundlessly optimistic but chronically unsuccessful businessman whose myriad failed ventures necessitated frequent and sudden departures in the cab that attended at the door by the time victor was 12 , the pritchetts had moved 18 times , ricocheting between ealing , hammersmith , uxbridge , palmers green and other london districts and suburbs i did not know that almost every time we moved house , sir victor wrote , father had lost his job or was swinging dangerously between an old disaster and a new enterprise as a result , victor s education was undisciplined , haphazard and often underachieving , though he showed a precocious aptitude for languages he also began a lifelong habit of passionate , voracious reading , tearing his way at an early age through dickens , ruskin , thomas hardy , the complete works of shakespeare anything he could lay his hands on that i understood very little of what i read did not matter much to me , he wrote i was caught by the passion for print as an alcoholic is caught by the bottle he decided to become a poet , but met with opposition at home , where his father worried , sir victor wrote , that he would starve in a garret at 15 , he was forced to leave school and was packed off to a menial clerical job on a stool at a leather wholesaler the work was deadly dull , but he whiled away the time by observing his colorful coworkers and immersing himself in fiction at 20 , he moved to paris with very little money in his pocket , vowing to himself never to return a salesman in paris , a journalist in spain the trip turned out to be relatively short , just two years , but the young writer thrived in the city s culture and ambience he worked at a variety of odd jobs as a photographer s assistant on the boulevard des italiens , and as a doortodoor salesman of paint , shellac and glue , among other jobs while yearning to write i could not see that i had anything to say except that i was alive , he later related in midnight oil \( 1971 \) , the second volume of his memoirs i simply wanted to write two or three sentences , even as banal as the advertisement on a sauce bottle , and see them in print with my name beneath them he proved good at it , too , and the christian science monitor published several freelance essays before making him the paper s ireland correspondent , later sending him to spain , which was as exotic to him as china i spoke no spanish , he wrote in midnight oil the only thing i knew about spain was that it had had the inquisition and that the armada had been defeated but spain was to figure in his imagination for the rest of his life , and his impressions of it led to a book of short stories , the spanish virgin and other stories \( 1930 \) and to his first travelogue , marching spain \( 1928 \) , an account of his idiosyncratic walking trip from southern to northern spain \( when he discussed that book , sir victor was as hard on himself as any literary critic though i have tenderness for the book and think some pages rather good , he wrote , i am glad it has been out of print for 40 years \) his career as a foreign correspondent was coming to an end in my heart i despised news and was confused by opinion , he explained after a brief assignment in the united states , where he wrote about dirtpoor families in appalachia and filled notebook after notebook with dialogue , both he and the monitor had had enough my prose was at last too much for them , he said i was sacked
they are on the outside looking in , noses pressed against the glass , stamping their feet in the chill , watching the festivities within yep , that s right these are investors who did not attend the wall street revels of 1996 stocks may have soared and portfolios may have swelled , but these people have made less money than the overall market would suggest , or maybe none at all some people sent a portion of their assets overseas , and then watched them sink some , spooked by the dow s height , cashed in equities months ago , only to watch the dow keep climbing and some planned to join the market at some point in 1996 , but now the year is over and they never did not everyone huddled at the windowpane has regrets , however while some just had bad results in a banner year , others gave up their party seats on purpose , in return for peace of mind or some other good some people in the first group prove how tough it is to achieve market performance without an investing plan , or without much of one some in the second group teach an apparently contradictory lesson that a plan can mean not trying to keep up with the market neither group , however , received much attention last year despite the market nervousness both recently and in july , the talk during most of 1996 was of the amazing dow , which rose from 5 , 117 on jan 1 a number that seems quaint today to 6 , 448 at yearend that s a jump of 26 percent if the market has as much success in 1997 as it had in 1996 , it will reach 8 , 125 by next new year s eve but last year is not the biggest entry in the record books the dow industrials did much better in 1995 , gaining 335 percent , and so did the standard poor s 500 , which gained 353 percent , versus 201 percent in 1996 of course , investors seldom do as well as these market measures , anyway trading commissions and mutual fund expenses eat into their returns the average domestic stock fund , for example , was up 184 percent last year but these observations are of little solace to kopin tan as an editor of an investment newsletter , mr tan , 29 years old and single , is exposed to the power of the stock market every day while it s easy to disassociate that kind of big money from yourself , he said , he has no excuses for procrastinating on his own investing but procrastinate he did although he became eligible for his company s 401 \( k \) plan in february 1996 he can contribute up to 15 percent of his pretax pay he has yet to join he has been triply punished for that omission he has missed out on the market s extraordinary runup he has lost his employer s match of 50 cents on the dollar , up to 6 percent of pretax pay and he has sacrificed the taxdeferral benefits of 401 \( k \) s that third loss is important at mr tan s salary of 30 , 000 to 40 , 000 , he pays a marginal federal tax rate of 28 percent that means each dollar he might have contributed to the 401 \( k \) would have cost him just 72 cents in foregone spending power , after federal taxes add in the relatively high state and local taxes he pays as a manhattan resident he moved here from singapore three years ago and the 401 \( k \) contributions would have been even cheaper when i talk to older people , they are shocked i have not taken advantage of this , he said of the 401 \( k \) , which would have been his only stake in the market but mr tan is not unusual , nor are his reasons for nonparticipation although he said he could have comfortably put 100 from his weekly paycheck into a 401 \( k \) , the lure of spending everything was just too strong it s terrible because what you have is so easy to spend in new york , he said there are so many temptations to shop , eat out , go on vacations when you 're young , it s easy to put saving off irwin chusid had the opposite problem in 1996 impulsiveness when a broker from a big wall street brokerage firm told mr chusid , a music producer and consultant who lives in hoboken , nj , that he should put some money into the firm s new japan fund , mr chusid , 45 , readily agreed he had excess cash his four other mutual funds were doing well so buying more stocks made sense and why not japan \? the broker said the japanese market was undervalued but mr chusid is still waiting for a profit after putting 10 , 000 into the dean witter japan fund in april , he saw the share price drop from 995 to 801 at yearend , a loss of nearly 20 percent at first , mr chusid checked the fund s share price every day on the days it fell precipitously , i would ask myself , 'why was i so impulsive \? why was i so naive \? ' he can answer these questions himself mr chusid has been too busy with his career to learn much about money indeed , he had never been in the market until last year , when he invested a large fee he had received from warner brothers for music to be used in bugs bunny and other cartoons but knowing the answers does n't lessen the damage the 10 , 000 mr chusid put into the japan fund was about a quarter of his portfolio , and the fund s loss of 20 percent or so took a big bite out of the 20 percent gains he had received , on average , in his other mutual funds for ken milman , a chemicals trader at icc chemical in manhattan , ambivalence is at the root of his market underperformance mr milman , 32 , converted 50 percent of his portfolio into cash last spring
chicago , feb 11 the business of lending money to the millions of americans with tarnished credit ratings or none at all has always been a walk on capitalism s wild side subprime lending , as the business is known , is a volatile world of big risks , staggering profit potential and almost no barriers to entry its clients vary from swindlers with no intention of paying off their loans to hardworking immigrants and victims of personal tragedies like layoffs or debilitating illness and the hardball tactics some lenders use to encourage borrowing or to collect on loans breed both lawsuits and criticism from consumer groups until recently , though , wall street had been mesmerized by the rapid growth of the subprime sector and many investors seemed to have forgotten just how wild it could get the rude reminder has come from a sudden rash of reports of crooked accounting , bankruptcy and unexpectedly high loan losses among several of the industry s prominent players in a business where the line between exploiting risk and drowning in it is thin , some players have gone too close to the edge , said william a brandt jr , a corporate turnaround specialist , shortly after he was brought in late last month to stabilize the mercury finance company in the wake of disclosures that its earnings reports had been falsified from 1993 on the turmoil is rooted in the relentless growth in the number of americans with blemishes on their credit records , ranging from repeated late payments to outright bankruptcy , making them a market far too large to ignore now , with everyone from the biggest banks and giant credit companies like ge capital to ambitious entrepreneurs piling in , the competitive pressures are exposing the cracks caused by illconceived growth strategies , poor management of operations and outright greed there had been periodic reminders that not everyone would be successful in early 1995 , search capital group inc , a rapidly expanding dallas lender in the usedcar market , was forced to put its eight operating units into bankruptcy and the attempt that year by tfc enterprise to expand into civilian subprime auto loans from its core business of loans to soldiers generated huge losses through a mixture of ineptitude and undue optimism , according to david karsten , the chief financial officer since a new team of managers took over at tfc last year but it took the news of the padding of mercury s books to really stun wall street the company , based in the chicago suburb of lake forest , ill , is a relative giant in the 70 billion subprime auto loan sector , with some 15 billion in loans outstanding and a carefully cultivated reputation for sound , pennypinching management john brincat , the exmarine who had led the company from its creation in 1984 , once bragged that he could not buy pencils without two other employees signing a voucher that did not stop mercury from accumulating a reported 90 million in imaginary profits over a threeyear period the bogus earnings were worth millions of dollars in bonus and stock options to the executives , with mr brincat receiving the lion s share when mercury s outside auditors finally blew the whistle last month , the hasty retreat of the banks that had competed to provide mercury with shortterm loans quickly pushed it to the brink of bankruptcy and slashed about 85 percent off the price of shares in the company on monday , with both mercury and federal investigators still looking into the bookkeeping irregularities , the company said it had secured a shortterm 50 million loan from bank of america to give it more time to renegotiate agreements with its creditors it is not just mercury s fans who have been surprised i never dreamed this would happen , said matthew lindenbaum , a principal at basswood partners , a paramus , nj , money manager that concentrates on financial stocks mr lindenbaum had been one of the few analysts warning that the kind of explosive growth mercury and others had been reporting often led to problems that investors detected too late to save themselves any impulse investors had to write off mercury s woes as an aberration took a severe hit on thursday reports from the industry trenches included a bankruptcy filing by the jayhawk acceptance corporation , which finances car loans to some of the nation s riskiest buyers the delay until monday of an earnings report from first enterprise financial because of unexpected loan losses , and the downgrading of securities issued by olympic financial ltd so far , the bad news has been heavily concentrated in the volatile autolending sector , but analysts say that investors are bound to be more cautious about the entire subprime world , at least for a while it s going to have an effect on mortgages and credit cards , said jewel bickford , managing director of rothschild capital markets in new york , which helps finance companies assemble packages of auto loans , mortgages , credit card receivables and other assets that are sold as securities to investors

los angeles , jan 5 business was slow on new year s day at peter and nancy park s budget clothing stall in southcentral los angeles , the morning after a gang fight several stalls away left one brawler dead of a gunshot wound surveying piles of 10 shirts and 15 trousers in the middle of a yellow , cinder block warehouse full of other vendors , mr park described the arson that devastated his business in the 1992 riots here , and the 41 , 000 debt that prevents him from opening a business elsewhere if we could , we would go , of course , mr park said koreanamericans are continuing to move or close their small businesses in southcentral los angeles nearly five years after riots destroyed hundreds of their stores in neighborhoods mainly occupied by black and some hispanic people small furniture outlets , groceries and other shops are increasingly being opened by koreanamericans in the city s relatively prosperous northern and western neighborhoods , even as similar businesses are sold or closed in the city s blighted center and many koreanamerican business owners who have managed to rebuild riotscarred stores still express a desire to leave the area , suggesting that the exodus may continue for years to come the riots broke out on april 29 , 1992 , after a largely white jury acquitted four white police officers of assault charges in the beating of a black man , rodney g king but koreanamerican business owners bore the brunt of the looting in southcentral los angeles a white judge two weeks earlier had given probation to a korean grocer convicted of manslaughter in the shooting death of a 15yearold black girl and koreanamericans ran the bulk of the grocery and liquor stores in the area , making them vulnerable rioters burned 700 korean businesses , inflicting 150 million in damage to property , almost none of it insured of the 53 people killed in the rioting , one was korean while there are few statistics on koreanamerican businesses , community leaders and economic development experts say that the number of businesses owned by koreanamericans in southcentral los angeles has dropped by a quarter to a half since the riots , and is still falling some say that the exodus may limit future problems the blackkorean controversy has dissipated because the fuel has been removed , said ronald k wakabayashi , the executive director of the los angeles county commission on human relations , a county government agency but many community leaders remain worried that relations between blacks and the remaining koreanamericans are still poor there s just this kind of guarded relationship that i do n't think anybody can claim has improved since 1992 , said joe r hicks , a former cochairman of the los angeles blackkorean alliance , a group that broke up a few months after the 1992 riots koreanamerican business owners and economic development experts cite several reasons for the continued exodus fears of renewed violence linger the area s population and buying power are eroding as thousands of middleclass and workingclass blacks are moving out to the city s eastern suburbs or to the southeastern united states while many hispanic people are moving into southcentral los angeles , particularly the more eastern neighborhoods , they are not as numerous as the blacks who are leaving and the new hispanic residents have tended to patronize hispanic merchants uichin ho , who emigrated from seoul in 1977 and now owns four laundromats in gritty neighborhoods in southcentral los angeles , said that a drop in the area s population was a big problem pausing on new year s day while cleaning one of his laundries , several miles west of the park family s clothing stall , he gestured at a row of recently installed dryers and complained that they had not increased his business at all a lot of people , not only koreans , left here , mr ho said before the riot , when you try to occupy an apartment , they want you to bring an application now they say one or three months' free rent yet the riots do not appear to have hurt the longterm economic strength of the koreanamerican community in los angeles , which holds almost 400 , 000 of the nation s 15 million people of korean descent the neighborhood popularly known here as koreatown , which lies between southcentral los angeles and the city s more affluent northern and western neighborhoods , has recovered from looting in the riots and is now packed with twostory minimalls a profusion of business signs in both english and korean is spreading north and west from koreatown , and koreanamericans have been opening businesses in adjacent communities like hollywood many of the remaining korean americans in southcentral los angeles are trying to save money as quickly as possible so they can move elsewhere mr park even objected to a recent police crackdown on drug dealers in his area , saying that it had hurt his men s clothing business the government starts squeezing , squeezing , squeezing , and one by one they go , he said guys used to come in with bundles of 100 bills and buy everything
when media moguls or even railroad barons clash over takeovers , they seem to produce grand battles of ego and ambition now the nation s two largest savings and loan institutions have awakened from their languorous ways to fight over the third largest , the great western financial corporation , but the conflict has all the pettiness of a schoolyard brawl h f ahmanson company threw the first punch in february when it began an unsolicited bid for its los angelesarea neighbor , great western , for 58 billion in stock then in an impressive display of cliquishness , ahmanson , the nation s largest savings and loan , said it would spare its employees from the thousands of layoffs that would result from the merger only employees at great western would be sacked thumbing its nose at ahmanson , great western agreed in march to sell itself to washington mutual inc , the no 2 savings and loan , which is based in seattle , for 66 billion in stock ahmanson raised its bid slightly , and the two suitors have been hissing and spitting at each other ever since the closest top executives of both suitors have gotten to taking the high road has been in presentations across the country , in which they argue that the other guy is paying too much and will never be able to make the deal work on the low road , each company has issued a stream of releases and advertisments accusing the other of lying to the public , using phony accounting , cheating on shareholder votes , manipulating the stock market and other misdeeds the shareholders are simultaneously amused and disgusted by these displays and while arguments can be made for each offer , most great western investors would be delighted with either great western shareholders have been waiting years and years for this sort of combination , said thomas theurkauf jr , an analyst with keefe bruyette woods great western is getting an excellent deal from either party in the end , none of the posturing is likely to matter much sometime in the next two months , great western shareholders will be asked to vote on the company s signed agreement to be acquired by washington mutual if they approve , the deal is done if not , nothing is certain , though such a vote could be seen as a strong signal to management to sell to ahmanson at yesterday s closing stock prices , ahmanson s bid is worth 4890 for each great western share , while washington mutual s is worth 4742 , a difference of 3 percent great western s stock closed at 44375 , up 875 cents if the offers remain this close , both suitors concur , washington mutual should win because investors will prefer its certain and friendly deal to the uncertainty of ahmanson s offer but the greater the spread between the two offers , the more likely shareholders will be to spurn the washington mutual deal it is not easy for ahmanson to raise its bid it is already paying a huge premium moreover , giving great western holders more ahmanson shares might not solve the problem because those shares may well fall as existing ahmanson investors see the value of their shares diluted the better hope for raising ahmanson s bid is that its stock will rise in the market relative to washington mutual s yesterday , washington mutual began another round of contentious news releases , accusing ahmanson of trying to artificially inflate the value of its stock by buying shares back without proper disclosure some analysts say that ahmanson represents as much as 20 percent of the daily trading in its own stock ahmanson shot back with a statement calling its rival s release false and misleading ahmanson noted that on march 26 , it had said it intended to begin share buybacks , a key element of its overall financial strategy analysts scoffed at the whole debate it s a good thing that ahmanson is buying a significant amount of their stock , said thomas o 'donnell , an analyst with smith barney that s what investors want the most acrimonious battles have concerned a series of largely symbolic proposals , known as consent solicitations if shareholders approve any of them , it could create the appearance of momentum that might lift ahmanson s stock one of the most important of these would have forced great western to hold its regular shareholder meeting , at which ahmanson hopes to elect three directors , at the originally scheduled date , which was yesterday following the ahmanson bid , great western postponed the meeting to june 13 when ahmanson said on april 9 that this proposal had received the requisite 50 percent of shares voted , great western balked on april 24 , it issued a release headlined great western uncovers ahmanson attempt to vote millions of shares twice and it echoed the charge in a fullpage newspaper ad in fact , a big great western shareholder did vote a large block of shares twice , though both sides now agree that the move was inadvertent eventually a recount was conducted , and on monday , great western conceded that ahmanson had in fact won too late to hold the meeting yesterday great western still plans to hold its meeting on june 13 a court in delaware could interpret the vote as a call for an earlier date , but any meeting much before june 1 appears impractical even if ahmanson can get the vote moved forward and does elect its directors , it is not clear how much this will help its cause ahmanson hopes that the new members can convert the rest of great western s board to its side but they are likely to be ostracized what is most important to great western and washington mutual is the date of a special shareholder vote on their proposed merger this date cannot be set until the securities and exchange commission approves the proxy statement that is to be sent to shareholders , clearance that could come as soon as next week great western hopes to set the washington mutual merger vote before holding its regular meeting that way , ahmanson s directors , even if elected , could not cause any trouble as with the other bickering , these fights over dates are likely to be little more than noisy sideshows most likely , analysts and advisers to both suitors say , the issue will come down to

denver , june 22 president clinton today encouraged critics of the historic tobacco agreement announced on friday to regard it as a starting point , rather than as a finished product , and said he himself feared that it might hobble the government s regulation of nicotine but mr clinton said he was pleased with the reception even the critics of the proposed settlement had given it i do n't think any of us at least i hope none of us are reviewing it with the view toward either saying we 're going to embrace it or kill it , and there s no other option , he said i was impressed by some of the members of congress in both parties , that they were hoping that if they could n't completely embrace it , that at least it could be salvaged underscoring again that he would withhold final judgment on the proposed settlement until his administration completed a weekslong review , mr clinton said he was proceeding cautiously in part because the industry was acting out of selfinterest in settling he said it was partly his obligation to insure that those things which made the tobacco interests conclude that it was in their interest to make the agreement do not compromise or undermine our obligation and our opportunity to protect the public health \( excerpts , page b8 \) in a 50minute news conference capping a threeday economic summit meeting of eight nations in denver , mr clinton s remarks touched on subjects as varied as the future of the tobacco settlement , the future of bosnia , the divisions bedeviling the nato nations and a more pleasant subject for him those bedeviling the republican leadership in congress addressing a central issue in the tax fight brewing on capitol hill , mr clinton said he was not philosophically opposed to increasing the medicare deductible for the more affluent elderly , a proposal in senate legislation but he indicated that he opposed taking that step as part of the budget agreement we 've got a great budget agreement , he said he then warned that by altering it without the permission of all who had signed on to it , we risk undermining the prize that we have when we could achieve these other objectives as soon as the budget s done asked today whether the tobacco settlement went too far in restricting government efforts to regulate nicotine , mr clinton first said , i do n't know the answer to that but then he went on to acknowledge that he was troubled by a provision that would restrict the food and drug administration in regulating nicotine unless it proved that a black market would not arise in cigarettes with high levels of nicotine it concerned me , he said how could you prove there would n't be a black market \? what s the definition of a black market \? is 1 percent penetration a black market , or does it have to be 10 \? his comments came on the same day that dr david a kessler , the former food and drug commissioner who is closely advising the white house on the deal , warned that it imposed impossible burdens on his old agency asked on the cbs news program meet the press whether he would advise mr clinton or congress to accept the settlement , dr kessler said i 'd like to see a resolution , and i certainly support some of the elements but other elements have to be rewritten he said he was particularly concerned about preserving the agency s ability to regulate nicotine mr clinton seemed relaxed and even cheerful after completing a series of closeddoor meetings , working meals and staged appearances with his counterparts from other industrial nations the president deftly turned a question about division among congressional republicans into a reminder of his recent political victory over flood relief without explicitly crowing , mr clinton said it was understandable that there was lot of tension among republicans after they passed his preferred version of the legislation \( he did not point out that he had first vetoed theirs \) in the end they did the right thing , mr clinton said i think that nobody likes to go through that and have your position not prevail but he said he did not expect the republican splits to paralyze us mr clinton also said he would closely examine how the tobacco agreement restricted the industry s liability but he said he understood that the state attorneys general who negotiated it got another 20 billion or so to offset some protection from future punitive damages for the industry , driving up the total amount of the settlement can you have , in effect , an advance payment for punitive damages \? he asked and would that , he continued , be enough to kind of offset the troublesome areas \? asked whether he would encourage international regulation of tobacco , mr clinton said he hoped that other countries would examine the american example and ask themselves whether they should take some similar steps if they want to avoid very high death rates , very high disease rates and enormous social costs mr clinton also offered a new defense against republican charges that he wanted to provide tax relief to people who did not pay taxes at issue is whether a proposed 500 tax credit for people with children should be refundable that is , whether those who already pay less than 500 in taxes should nevertheless receive the full credit , getting money back from the government mr clinton insists that they should , but republicans have labeled that a form of welfare mr clinton proposed the most politically appealing example of the person he has in mind a rookie police officer with two children who makes 23 , 000 annually this police officer is paying federal taxes , a considerable federal payroll tax , he said to characterize them as welfare recipients because they would be made eligible for the same help that people making 31 , 000 a year would get to raise their children , i think is wrong photo president clinton in denver yesterday said of the tobacco deal , i do n't think any of us at least i hope none of us are reviewing it with the view toward either saying we 're going to embrace it or kill it \( associated press \) \( pg b8 \)
rye brook anyone intimidated by the best and the brightest might have felt at least vaguely uncomfortable at the rye town hilton last weekend the hotel was the site of the northeast region senior conference of inroads , an organization for highachieving black , hispanic , american indian and asian high school and college students who also have jobs at major corporations ambitious , articulate and full of youthful enthusiasm , they were living examples of how to make a good impression i hope one day to own my own business so i can actualize myself and make an impact on my community , 20yearold phara jourdan said to alice trimiew , a video and public relations consultant who was documenting the conference with a video camera i envision myself as a leader later , ms jourdan , who is majoring in cartography at salem state college in massachusetts and working at bank boston added inroads has helped me shape my future i had no idea what to expect of a corporate environment , but now inroads has helped show me the right path also speaking to ms trimiew s camera , lawrence williams , a 21yearold mechanical engineering major at boston university who lives in white plains , said , i have a vision for the future and inroads is helping me structure my goals and train for that future indeed , to these young people , it seems the sky is the limit asked about what they wanted out of life , almost all promptly replied , success either in a corporate setting or as the owner of a small business along with that they would like to be volunteers for nonprofit organizations , have spouses and children and , they conceded laughing , drive a highend car and live in a comfortable house they feel they can have it all if racial or ethnic boundaries daunted their parents , that does not seem to present a problem for these young people virtually everyone who was asked if he or she felt any discrimination at work replied , no , none we 're all about the same thing that is to remove the 'at risk' as a moniker for our kids , said janndouglass bell , inroads managing director for central new england there s a connotation to the word minority it s predetermined it pigeonholes people we , each of us as individuals , are all singularly important inroads , which was founded in 1970 , is described in its literature as a nonprofit careerdevelopment organization run like a business inroads staff members recruit high school students and run workshops to prepare them for college , and they place college students in two tofouryear internships in corporations nationwide , 912 corporations sponsored 5 , 771 college interns last year in westchester , participating companies include nynex , ibm and kraft general foods to be eligible for an inroads internship , students must meet certain academic requirements , including a grade average of 30 or better most of them major in business , finance or engineering in college and anticipate careers in those fields eight of 10 take jobs at the corporations where they have done their internships at inroads conferences and meetings , participants attend workshops , lectures and discussion groups , which familiarize them with the corporate world and they learn about working under deadline pressure , interaction with colleagues and bosses and generally fitting into the corporate scene on the job itself , they master the nuances of life in business at first , i was not afraid on my first day at work , because of my inroad experience , recalled kamau blount , a 21yearold student at suny albany who lives in brooklyn and works at chubb insurance in white plains i was psyched i felt i was at work for a reason i felt i could compete i felt i could hack it my biggest challenge , i guess , was getting used to corporate culture i came in prepared to be totally serious but people in my office are laid back they 're relaxed i thought that s great i can be relaxed , too mr blount said he has a fiveyear plan , which includes not only promotions at work but also volunteer work in the community so does jason billy , a student at suny buffalo who lives in spring valley and works for nynex i 've wanted to be in corporate life ever since i was 5 years old , mr billy said i saw my father , who was an engineer , go to work in a suit and i said to myself , wow , i want to work for a major company i guess i'm just a sucker for suits seriously , my experience with inroads has been incredibly valuable i do n't know that much about corporate america by having an internship , a job , i 've learned that while work can be fun , it is also very serious business in a sense , it is the survival of the fittest but it is also what you decide to make it you 've got to learn to develop maturity you 've got to be able to do the best job you can at all times jenice cedano , a 20yearold fordham university student from yonkers , has an internship at texaco when she started , she said , she felt unsure , like maybe i would n't be able to do what i had to do then , she explained i saw i could do whatever was asked of me i have developed so many skills and had so much practice through inroads or , as catrena bryant puts it , no one can survive corporate america totally alone ms bryant , a 30yearold from yonkers , is managing director of inroads in westchester and fairfield she came up through the inroads intern process herself , working as a system s analyst for reader s digest before she took a staff job with inroads it provides real handson training , she said you deal with so many issues of corporate life i do n't care who you are , when you 're entering the corporate world , you need a lot of support photos at rye town hilton in rye brook , members of the northeast region senior conference of inroads reflected on their goals at seminars \( photographs by chris maynard for the new york times \)
after a second full day of investigation , officials said yesterday that they had not located anyone who saw an 8yearold staten island boy enter a pool and drown monday at the runaway rapids waterpark in keansburg , nj we 'd love to have all this information , said james pigott , a deputy police chief in keansburg we 're still looking into , was he with someone \? did he go by himself \? brian burns , a spokesman for the new jersey labor department , which is also investigating the drowning , said the department s inspector , howard black , was assuming that the boy , raphael garcia , wandered away from counselors and other youngsters on an outing at the park with the staten island branch of young people s day camps , based in matawan , nj it seems strange that nobody at all saw him , mr burns said none of the four lifeguards working at the pool when raphael drowned knew how raphael got into the water , he said henry gehlhaus , coowner of the water park , said last night that the labor department had cleared the park to reopen today
president clinton has some difficult decisions to make on bosnia the peace there is frayed , the prospects for longterm stability are uncertain and the ostensible deadline for withdrawing american troops is now less than a year away in the coming weeks mr clinton must once again consider what price america is prepared to pay to help secure a lasting peace in bosnia many of mr clinton s options require the more assertive use of nato forces in bosnia , including some 8 , 000 american troops that is now warranted , provided the use is judicious , carefully planned and executed and limited to several narrowly defined roles where nato troops can make a difference in securing peace for now , we do not believe that includes a risky operation to capture radovan karadzic , the former bosnian serb president and a prominent war crimes suspect although the dayton peace agreements provide for the use of nato forces in a variety of enforcement roles , they have been used sparingly , partly to minimize the risk of casualties and partly because nato leaders have differed over the appropriate use of military force the election of tony blair as british prime minister has reduced the differences , giving mr clinton wider latitude mr clinton well knows the dangers that can come with the expanded use of peacekeeping forces an illconceived manhunt in somalia in 1993 left 18 american soldiers dead the more disciplined use of peacekeeping forces in bosnia has so far kept casualties to a minimum not a single american has been killed by hostile fire with careful management by washington , reasonable levels of risk can be maintained while making more vigorous use of the nato forces , as anticipated in dayton gen wesley clark , the new nato commander and one of the architects of the dayton accords , has already begun to do that this month nato troops have started to inspect bosnian serb special police units , part of an overdue effort to place them under international control the units , which are armed with light artillery , provide security for mr karadzic and others indicted by the war crimes tribunal in the hague general clark should give his forces an expanded role in safeguarding refugees returning to communities where they are members of an ethnic minority reconciliation in bosnia will be impossible if none of the ethnically mixed cities that existed before the war can be reconstituted bosnia urgently needs independent radio and television stations to compete with statecontrolled broadcasts polluted with nationalist propaganda , especially in serbia and republika srpska , the serbruled part of bosnia mr clinton should redouble efforts to open new stations , and guard them with nato forces , if necessary until recently nato units showed no interest in detaining suspected war criminals , even when troops encountered them on routine patrol nato soldiers should be encouraged to arrest suspects they run into in july nato leaders authorized a more aggressive campaign to catch those under indictment one bosnian serb was captured and another killed when he resisted arrest that campaign now seems to be on hold , and pressure is building to go after mr karadzic before mr clinton puts american troops in harm s way , he ought to be certain he has exhausted other ways of isolating mr karadzic no one doubts that mr karadzic s continuing political activities are in violation of the dayton agreement and the commitment of serbian and bosnian serb leaders to push him aside nor is there any question that his disruptive role impedes reconciliation in bosnia clearly , the interests of justice would be served by his capture and prosecution but those calling for mr karadzic s capture have yet to show that the benefits of seizing him outweigh the risks , including a deadly firefight with his guards and retaliatory terrorist strikes against nato troops there are less risky but still effective ways to intimidate mr karadzic mr clinton , for the moment , has a renewed commitment from slobodan milosevic , the serbian leader , to sideline mr karadzic mr clinton can force compliance this time with sustained pressure general clark s more aggressive posture and publicized movement of pentagon commando units help signal to mr karadzic that ultimately he can be seized unless he stops his political activities a more active american role can help ameliorate many of the troubles bedeviling the bosnian peace , including the reappearance of mr karadzic mr clinton , diverted by last year s election , let bosnia drift for six months he now seems reengaged how he manages american involvement will go a long way toward shaping the foreign policy legacy of his presidency
quetta , pakistan , june 20 inside a highwalled compound here , the family of mir amal kansi gathered today to grapple with events that saw american agents swoop into pakistan this week to seize mr kansi for a 1993 shooting rampage near the central intelligence agency s headquarters at langley , va meeting after friday s muslim prayers is a tradition for the male kansis , who head one of quetta s wealthiest families but the only topic today was the ordeal that they said had enveloped the family since the shootings , and the suffering that they said must have enveloped the americans whose relatives were killed and wounded for three hours , mr kansi s stepbrothers , brothersinlaw and cousins agonized over mr kansi s suspected role in opening fire with an automatic rifle on a car turning into cia headquarters , killing two cia employees and wounding three others , before returning to pakistan as a fugitive the family members said they had no idea of what might have prompted mr kansi , 33 , to carry out the attack in particular , they denied published accounts in the united states suggesting that the kansi family might have worked with the cia in the 1980 s , when quetta became a staging area for the americanled effort to channel weapons to antisoviet guerrillas in afghanistan , and that a residue of bitterness from cia links might have led mr kansi to seek revenge the cia s imprint was everywhere in this city , said hamidullah kasi , 43 , mr kansi s oldest stepbrother and head of the family , who like most family members here uses a slightly different spelling of the family s last name from the one the fbi has used for mr kansi but i can assure you that this family never had any involvement with the cia , or anything to do with the afghan war absolutely none mr kansi s motives remain unclear some officials have said he told federal agents that he bore a grudge against the united states government for some unspecified injury to his family but his relatives said they knew of nothing that could have given mr kansi a reason for the shootings some of the dozen family members present spoke as if they did not believe that mr kansi played any part in the attack but others , including hamidullah kasi , described mr kansi as a brooding , introspective and volatile youth who disclosed little about his thoughts or activities outside the quetta compound as he grew to adulthood in the 1980 s in a city awash with student radicalism , guns and political intrigue what can you expect from such an unpredictable person \? hamidullah kasi said , prompting other family members to chime in with a chorus of adjectives depicting mr kansi , in effect , as the kind of man who might have had secret , even violent passions he was a selfcentered man , said dr arbab ghulam rassool , 43 , a surgeon and one of mr kansi s cousins mir wais kasi , 34 , another stepbrother , added , he should be checked by a psychiatrist hamidullah kasi said the only hint that family members had received of a possible motive for mr kansi was what they were told on one of two visits by fbi agents to the compound during mr kansi s years as a fugitive they told us he had done the shootings because he was a sick man , or possibly because he was seeking fame , he said but one of mr kansi s cousins , meeting with a reporter away from the family compound and on a guarantee that he would not be identified , said experiences as a fellow student with mr kansi at the university of baluchistan in quetta , where mr kansi gained a master s degree in literature , suggested that he might have acted out of political motives they might have involved anger at the united states for its policies toward muslims in bosnia , chechnya or the middle east , he said alternatively , this relative said , mr kansi might have acted for personal motives , possibly because he felt denigrated by his experiences as a pakistani from a prominent family who was forced to seek menial work in a courier company in reston , va , while awaiting processing of a bid for political asylum in the united states from what i heard , he had a humiliating time in washington , the relative said he probably thought he was being discriminated against because he was a muslim , or because he was a pakistani this relative said that mr kansi had become passionately involved with a number of political groups while studying in quetta , and that while his political commitments oscillated , a fixed element was antiamericanism he said this combined with a passion for guns that mr kansi kept concealed in his room at the family compound and displaying them to close friends he 'd pull out a pistol or a kalashnikov and describe its range and its firepower , he said the relative described an occasion in 1987 when two visiting american professors were scheduled to give poetry readings on the campus , only to be forced to leave hurriedly by a student protest mr kansi , he said , waited until the two americans were moving through demonstrators outside the building , then pulled a pistol from beneath his shirt and fired two shots into the air the other students cheered him , he said others in the kansi family said the chain that led to the shootings at langley might have begun in a childhood that encouraged mr kansi to think of himself as a family outsider
lawyers for autumn jackson , the woman accused of trying to extort money from bill cosby , rested their case yesterday after a short but spirited defense that included only one witness and a dramatic appearance by mr cosby on videotape , standing beside ms jackson on a visit she made to his queens studio in 1991 the tape was made by ms jackson s grandmother and played before the federal jury in manhattan that will soon begin to consider the extortion and conspiracy charges against ms jackson and two other defendants hello there , all the people , mr cosby says in his familiar deadpan style on the tape as the tape continues , mr cosby is seen and heard talking about ms jackson , who was on her way to a private high school in florida , at which mr cosby was paying her tuition from there , he says , she will go on to college , where she will be an honor student and if she does n't , watch this , mr cosby says on the tape , throwing a pretend punch in her direction lawyers for ms jackson , 22 , introduced the tape to bolster their contention that the california woman had lived her entire life believing mr cosby was her father they have argued that she never intended to extort money from the actor rather , she believed that she was involved in a lawful negotiation over her rights as his daughter on the tape , mr cosby does not use words that clearly suggest he is addressing a daughter but ms jackson s grandmother , lois maxfield , the only witness who appeared in her behalf at the trial , testified that she and ms jackson s mother had always told ms jackson that she was the actor s daughter i told her that her father was bill cosby , ms maxfield told the jury yesterday her mother was told not to put his name on the birth certificate as long as she did n't tell anyone about it , ms maxfield added , he would take care of her mother and her , and take care of his responsibility robert m baum , a lawyer for ms jackson , said in an interview after court that the decision to present only one defense witness was based on his belief that the government s case , outlined over more than a week in tapes , documents and testimony , largely supported ms jackson s account there are no additional facts that autumn need put before the jury in order for them to reach a just verdict , mr baum said ms jackson and two codefendants , jose medina and boris sabas , are accused of trying to extort 40 million from the actor in return for ms jackson s not selling a story to a supermarket weekly saying she is mr cosby s outofwedlock daughter earlier in the day , prosecutors closed their case against the three by playing an audiotape of ms jackson s mother , shawn thompson , in which she is trying to phone her daughter and warn her not to continue with her financial demands of mr cosby ms thompson , who is unable to reach her daughter , speaks instead to mr medina autumn for some reason has painted herself into a corner , ms thompson tells mr medina , unaware that he has been part of what the government says is the illegal scheme ms thompson tells mr medina that she has received a call from mr cosby s lawyer , who has described ms jackson s demands and told ms thompson they are illegal she has tried to blackmail him , ms thompson tells mr medina it s called extortion it s a federal offense after the tape was played , judge barbara s jones told the jury that it would be allowed as evidence only against mr medina and not against ms jackson or mr sabas mr medina s lawyer , neil b checkman , has denied in interviews that his client , who had a contract with ms jackson to write her story and to receive 25 percent of the proceeds , was aware of any improper activity by ms jackson yesterday , in presenting mr medina s defense , mr checkman called one new witness , dixie dunn , an occupational therapist from ohio ms dunn testified that she hired mr medina , sent him to film classes in los angeles to get his credentials as an independent film maker and paid him more than 120 , 000 to produce a children s television program , which was going to be titled down on the farm with chocolate chip and the prairie dog club the testimony seemed to be intended to try to show the jury that mr medina was involved with ms jackson in a legitimate television venture , the children s show , that explained their presence in a burbank , calif , hotel room the government has accused them of telephoning and faxing their extortion demands from that hotel room mr checkman also introduced a copy of the proposed script and photographs of mr medina s hotel room , the temporary headquarters for the intended show , in which there were costumes and other props a lawyer for mr sabas , who was also working on the show , called several witnesses who testified to mr sabas s character and generosity he is accused of paying for mr medina and ms jackson to travel to new york as part of the plot none of the three defendants took the witness stand in their own defense their lawyers and federal prosecutors are expected to make closing arguments to the jury today before ms jackson s defense rested , her grandmother , ms maxfield , testified yesterday that mr cosby sent ms maxfield 25 , 000 in cash to cover her expenses while she accompanied ms jackson to florida there ms jackson enrolled in a private school while her mother was in a drug clinic mr cosby testified last week that even though he consistently denied being ms jackson s father , he paid her mother more than 100 , 000 to remain silent about their affair he was taking autumn away from her mother and sending her to florida , ms maxfield told the jury her mother was using drugs and he wanted her to get out of that environment on their way , the actor invited ms jackson and her grandmother to attend the taping of the cosby show they were put up in a new york hotel , ms maxfield testified , and given a front row seat ms jackson gave the actor a photograph of herself he put it on the mantle of his studio set , where the actor has testified that he hoped ms jackson would see it on television and be inspired mr cosby gave ms jackson a stuffed teddy bear on the videotape , mr cosby , his arm around ms jackson , is heard repeating the name that ms jackson has given for the bear bill famu , apparently a reference to the actor and to florida a m university according to testimony , the university was affiliated with the private school where mr cosby was sending ms jackson photo a home videotape taken by autumn jackson s grandmother , lois maxfield , and played for the federal court jury yesterday at ms jackson s extortion trial shows ms jackson and bill cosby at his queens studio in 1991 \( pg b3 \)

today is the 90th birthday of paul mellon , who in one domain after another has done as much as anyone now living to improve the quality of american life he has done it in museums and libraries , in schools and colleges , in landscapes saved from the developer , in riding and hiking trails open forever to nature lovers and , not least , in the thousands of acres acquired in 1952 in the cape hatteras national seashore though associated primarily with the major works of art that he and his wife , bunny , have given away with both hands and with the beautiful buildings that now house them , it is also for our everbeleaguered environment that he cares especially what is it that we are to leave , he once said in that context , to our children and grandchildren \? mr mellon is often associated primarily with the national gallery of art in washington this was founded in 1937 by his father , the financier andrew w mellon , who was treasury secretary from 1921 to 1931 and ambassador to great britain from 1931 to 1932 he had , as his son said recently , an astonishing flair for nascent industrial potentialities , which in due time made him one of the richest men in the united states andrew mellon made no attempt to engage his son s interest in the new national gallery , which opened in 1941 to him , paul mellon wrote in 1936 in a memorandum to himself , the gallery is just one more investment , one more tremendous mellon interest one more prop for the scaffolding which holds up his gigantic , intensive , mysterious ego this notwithstanding , paul mellon was to be for 47 years a key figure in the councils of the national gallery without him , we should not have the east building , for which the architect i m pei made such ingenious and triumphant use of an exceptionally awkward site nor should we have the yale center for british art in new haven , for which louis kahn designed some of the most beautiful museum interiors in the country , or the west wing of the virginia museum of fine arts in richmond and it is a lucky school that has anything comparable to the paul mellon arts center at choate rosemary hall in wallingford , conn not only were these exemplary buildings built and underwritten wholly or primarily by mr mellon , but they were stocked substantially \( or , in new haven , entirely \) with works of art presented by mr mellon mr mellon has also been active , through the bollingen foundation , as an idiosyncratic and invaluable publisher the complete works of carl jung , in english translation , and the complete works in nearly 30 fat volumes of coleridge , were not everyday undertakings nor was the fourvolume edition of pushkin s eugene onegin , translated and annotated at prodigious length by vladimir nabokov nor , for that matter , was the i ching , or book of changes which came out in 1950 and sold over 500 , 000 copies a longtime champion of great libraries \( among them , the pierpont morgan library in manhattan \) , mr mellon bought the papers of samuel johnson s biographer , james boswell , when they turned up in a castle in ireland , and gave them to yale when he was offered 835 volumes from the private library of the philosopher john locke catalogued , annotated and shelfnumbered in locke s own hand he bought them forthwith and before long gave them to the bodleian library in oxford never far from the surface , however , was his feeling for horses , horsebreeding and horsemanship , a passion that had english overtones by 1914 , he had spent six summers in england they gave him what he once summed up as a taste for the english countryside , for english houses , english rivers , english parks , english skies , english clouds and let s not forget english trains , which in those days were brilliantly and beautifully painted in reds , greens or blues he added , all the brass and copper which garnished the engines was highly polished , and the engines were proudly and aristocratically named from 1930 onward , as an undergraduate at clare college of cambridge university , he often went to newmarket , where horses were trained within sight of what he later called the most beautiful racecourse in the world i still hark back , he said some years ago , to those long , soft , eminently green gallops stretching to the horizon in the slanting afternoon sun , and the late october sunlight on the warm yellow stone of the old , high stands at newmarket does it sound like a privileged life \? certainly it does mr mellon may well have been the first , and quite possibly the only , american baby to have been baptized in st george s chapel in windsor castle when he was due to go to princeton and decided at a very late stage to go to yale instead , he simply sent a telegram to princeton , placed a telephone call to yale and was accepted at once but he was not at all spoiled one of the things that he remembered fondly from his years at cambridge was walking across the quadrangle in a dressing gown in the rain to take a bath when he entered st john s college in annapolis , md , at age 40 to learn classical greek , he was so distressed by his problems with euclid , a requirement for the course , that he sought advice as to his mental resources none other than jung himself wrote back to say that it was an asinine prejudice that mathematics has anything to do with the training of the mind in another life he could have aimed at high office but , as he said recently , for many reasons the idea of power has never appealed to me what has appealed to me is privacy to me , privacy is the most valuable asset that money can buy only very rarely can his abundant sense of fun be glimpsed in public but on one of his birthdays , not so long ago , there was a small dinner at the national gallery in washington toward the end of dinner , discreet sounds of classical jazz began to be heard someone who looked like a senior country doctor in his 60 s slipped into the room , at mrs mellon s secret invitation he was carrying an ancient piece of hand luggage , which when opened was seen to contain a no less ancient clarinet happening to glance in that direction , mr mellon cracked an enormous smile and said i do n't believe it ! i just ca n't believe it ! and when benny goodman led the band for dancing , mr mellon was , quite simply , the happiest man in the room photo paul mellon , patron of museums and libraries , in his office in his park avenue home \( jim wilson the new york times , 1991 \)
washington , april 15 the house committee investigating questionable campaign fundraising practices confused two people with similar asian surnames , and mistakenly subpoenaed the bank records of the wrong person earlier this month house investigators said today they were seeking information about chi ruan wang , a california donor whose name was on the check for a 5 , 000 contribution the democratic national committee is giving back instead , the chairman of the house government reform and oversight committee , dan burton , republican of indiana , mistakenly subpoenaed the bank records of chi wang , a georgetown university history professor who lives in mclean , va chi wang , 65 , who also heads the chinese section at the library of congress , told reporters today that he was shocked when he learned from a los angeles times reporter on monday that the committee was targeting him and his wife i 've been here since 1949 and have been an american citizen since the early 1960 s , professor wang said at a news conference outside the capitol i 've never done anything wrong i 've never even had a speeding ticket house democrats , who have criticized mr burton for failing to give them more influence over the inquiry , seized on the incident as evidence of what they say is a reckless , partisan investigation this investigation is out of control , and has no checks or balances , said representative john f tierney , a massachusetts democrat on the oversight committee and one of the lawmakers who organized today s news conference under committee rules , mr burton has the authority to issue subpoenas on his own after consulting with democrats most congressional committees require the concurrence of democrats and republicans or a committee vote before issuing a subpoena the oversight committee has so far issued 101 subpoenas , all targeting the clinton white house or the democratic national committee democratic aides said they discovered the error last week while reviewing mr burton s subpoenas , and the april 3 subpoena was withdrawn before the two banks , chevy chase bank and the national capital bank of washington , forwarded any information to the committee chi wang said that investigators on the senate committee examining fundraising practices contacted him four or five weeks ago to ask about his contributions to the democratic party a senate aide confirmed that account today , but said investigators were considering some followup questioning chi wang , who said he considered himself a democrat , said today that it was important for asianamericans to get involved in the political process he said he contributed to george bush s presidential campaigns in the 1980 s , and along with his wife , gave 1 , 000 each last year to bob dole s presidential race chi wang said that he also donated about 50 , 000 to the democratic party and democratic candidates in 1996 , and that none of the money has been returned he agreed to contribute 25 , 000 to attend an asianamerican fundraising dinner at the hayadams hotel in washington on feb 19 , 1996 , at the suggestion of john huang , a former top democratic fundraiser who is a central figure in the congressional investigations chi wang said he met mr huang a few weeks before the dinner , at a retirement party for senator paul simon , an illinois democrat
washington , jan 16 the congressional budget office radically reduced its estimate of future medicaid costs today , relieving pressure on president clinton and congress to cut benefits for the poor but the financial outlook for medicare , the health insurance program for the elderly , improved only slightly the estimate of total federal spending on medicaid from 1997 to 2002 dropped by 86 billion more than all the medicaid savings that republicans proposed in their long , bitter struggle with mr clinton over the budget in 1995 and 1996 with no change in current law , the budget office said , federal spending on medicaid will rise an average of 78 percent a year , to 144 billion in 2002 from 92 billion in 1996 in contrast , the agency was predicting just six months ago that medicaid would grow 97 percent a year the budget office s estimate assumes that greater use of managed care will help control medicaid costs , as it has in the last few years with permission from the clinton administration , many states are requiring the poor to join health maintenance organizations as a condition of medicaid coverage but for the elderly , hmo s are purely optional the federal government does not require any medicare beneficiaries to join the congressional budget office said today that it foresaw continued rapid growth in medicare spending and on the question of most interest to politicians , it said that medicare s hospital insurance trust fund would run out of money in 2001 if congress took no action to shore up the finances of the program that prediction coincides with a forecast offered last june by the administration the trust fund pays hospital bills for medicare beneficiaries , who are elderly or disabled , and republicans often cite it as a symbol of the need to slow medicare growth representative bill thomas , the california republican who is chairman of the house ways and means subcommittee on health , said this new report from the congressional budget office is disappointing and unfortunately dashes any hopes that medicare s financial condition was significantly improving , or that medicare would go bankrupt later than expected it underscores the need for congress and the president to forge a bipartisan agreement to save medicare , without resorting to accounting gimmicks or tax increases the budget office said medicare payments to doctors would increase more slowly than it predicted last year but the savings in that part of the program do not help the hospital insurance trust fund over all , the budget office said , medicare spending will grow 86 percent a year to 314 billion in 2002 from 191 billion in 1996 a very modest decline from the 89 percent growth that the agency predicted in august the report today increases pressure on mr clinton and congress to take action to slow the growth of medicare but it may reduce the pressure to make major changes in medicaid the white house said earlier this week that mr clinton would propose firm limits on medicaid spending as a way to help balance the federal budget by 2002 many democrats in congress contend that such limits are unnecessary and would undermine the program s ability to meet an increased need for assistance in times of economic recession the budget office s report predicted that increasing numbers of medicare beneficiaries would voluntarily join hmo s , so that enrollment in them would rise from the current level of 5 million to 98 million in 2002 and then 14 million in 2006 the budget office estimated that the proportion of medicare beneficiaries enrolled in hmo s , now about 12 percent , would rise to 25 percent in 2003 and 32 percent in 2006 , even if congress took no action to encourage such enrollment the budget office sees annual medicare payments to hmo s soaring from 26 billion this year to 73 billion in 2002 and 141 billion in 2006 the white house contends that hmo s are being overpaid , and mr clinton plans to propose cutbacks in reimbursement as part of his budget proposal , scheduled for submission to congress on feb 6 the congressional budget office sees only modest increases in the premiums that medicare beneficiaries pay for physician and outpatient services under current law , it said , the monthly premium , now 4380 , will rise to 4560 next year and to 4710 in 1999 but , it said , premiums will pay for a declining share of medicare costs , and general revenue for a growing share without waiting to hear from mr clinton , senate democrats said today that one of their top legislative priorities was to provide health insurance for the 10 million american children who have none the senate democratic leader , tom daschle of south dakota , and senator edward m kennedy , democrat of massachusetts , said they would pursue this goal as tenaciously as they fought last year to make health insurance more readily available to workers who change jobs or lose their jobs these two democrats are pursuing somewhat different approaches mr daschle said he would offer tax credits for the purchase of private insurance , while mr kennedy would offer vouchers to families to subsidize premiums mr daschle said he hoped republicans would join him and mr kennedy in supporting such proposals but senator john h chafee , a rhode island republican who has worked with much success in the last 15 years to extend medicaid coverage to more children , said , a new program is always very difficult in this atmosphere , when congress is trying to balance the budget the uninsured children who would be helped by the daschle and kennedy bills are generally not poor enough to qualify for medicaid nine of 10 uninsured children live in families with working parents , and about twothirds of such children live in twoparent families

cambridge , mass when my son celebrates his birthday later this month , he will be according to new studies on infant brain development pretty much over the hill , cognitively speaking in other words , he s turning 1 the findings , which caused such handwringing after the white house held a conference on early childhood development last month , say that most of the neural pathways that determine a person s ability to think have been established by a child s first birthday the strength of these pathways hinges chiefly on the number of linguistic interactions between care giver and child during those initial 12 months or to put it another way , not only are my son s current intellectual deficits now his for life they 're my fault to boot that , at any rate , is the cynical dismay with which many of my friends have received the news , a sort of thanksiwashopinganotherswordofdamoclescoulddangleovermyhead resignation while it s unlikely that scientists intended their studies to fuel criticism of mothers who work outside the home , women are n't exactly nuts to worry that the studies may increase the pressure and blame they already feel when it comes to motherhood , the public never seems to hesitate before leaping from scientific discovery to societal judgment nor is the blame all external i know working mothers who feel real guilt over their decision not to stay home even mothers who stay home have reacted to this news with some alarm it s a report of what they may have already , irreparably , done wrong when i offered to mail an article on the findings to my sister \( who quit her job to stay home with four children \) , she said , not entirely in jest , well , hurry up the baby s almost 6 months old yet virtually none of my peers need worry even if they were n't conscious of how many words per day they uttered to their babies in that first year , their babies in all likelihood will turn out fine as they themselves did , and their parents before them children of professional parents tend to do well in school , to be successful adults , and to provide socioeconomically privileged homes for their children that system was intact long before positron emission tomography showed us how the brain gets wired but the findings are bad news for one group the quarter of american families with children under 3 who are living in poverty in their book , meaningful differences in the everyday experience of young american children , betty hart , an emeritus professor of human development at the university of kansas , and todd risley , a psychology professor at the university of alaska , show that the number of verbal interactions between parents and young children differs radically according to income , with more privileged families having the most and families on welfare the fewest the hartrisley study suggests that the problem is poverty itself no other factor in their study sex , ethnicity , race , whether both parents work outside the home made a discernible difference the children in financially impoverished homes simply did n't receive as much verbal stimulation if the first year is crucial in brain development , then children of poverty are in real trouble , and intervention programs like head start begin too late to help as a nation , we have a purported commitment to providing equal opportunity for all we also have a long tradition of not living up to that commitment the findings on infant brain development should not amplify criticism of mothers working outside the home , but prompt a reevaluation of the way we treat families in poverty i was wrong when i said middleclass women need n't worry about the new findings we all must drawing \( kim roberson \)
if you blinked , you might have missed it last month , hartford capital appreciation briefly achieved what only a handful of broadbased stock mutual funds have done in the last decade it gained more than 100 percent during a 12month period doubling investors' money in the span of a year is no mean feat , even for a brandnew fund like this one , which began investing shareholders' cash on july 25 , 1996 \( the fund s rolling 12month return has since slipped , falling from triple digits to about 88 percent last week \) but more surprising than its stellar performance is the distance by which hartford capital appreciation outpaced a sister portfolio from which it was cloned that portfolio overseen by the same manager and with the same investment objective underlies two variable annuities also sold by the hartford life insurance companies instead of gaining about 100 percent over the past year , the variable annuities \( which are basically mutual funds with an insurance feature \) returned roughly 45 percent that , of course , is nothing to sneeze at , but it is less than half the return received by investors in the mutual fund this tale of two portfolios serves as a reminder to investors that just because an annuity has the same name as a mutual fund , that does not mean it will perform exactly like the mutual fund , for good or ill and it can be dangerous to pick either a fund or a related annuity based on the other s performance hartford makes clear in the prospectus for the capital appreciation mutual fund that it is not likely to achieve exactly the same performance as the corresponding annuity , due to , among other things , differences in expenses and cash flows between a fund and the corresponding insurance fund annuities generally have far higher expenses than mutual funds those expenses tend to drag down annuity returns by several percentage points a year but the main factor in the 55percentagepoint difference in performance was simply size , said saul pannell , who manages the capital appreciation portfolios of both the mutual fund and the variable annuities the annuity portfolio started the period with about 3 billion of assets the fund started with none many of the smallcapitalization stocks that contributed to the fund s performance were not a significant part of the annuity holdings , mr pannell said , because there would not be a prayer of getting a position big enough to contribute meaningfully to those much bigger portfolios in addition to being able to buy smaller stocks for the mutual fund , mr pannell said , he steers the two portfolios a little differently in the small fund portfolio , i ideally look for price gains in three to six months , he said the annuity portfolio s target , however , is much longer six months to two years he is adamant that he did not use a strategy that has sent several other small funds' performance into the stratosphere , at least temporarily trading initial public offerings the practice of funneling hot ipo s to a new fund has proved to be tempting for some fund companies seeking to build that fund s performance record , even though the results are shortlived and can mislead investors you could put me on a witness stand and i 'll swear that i 'd be surprised if more than 2 percent of the fund s gains came from ipo s , mr pannell said the fund has invested in some new offerings , like rambus , which licenses systems that allow computer chips to talk to each other rambus went public in may at 12 a share last week , the shares traded at about 68 we got 400 shares of the ipo , mr pannell said , an allocation so small that he actively bought the shares on the open market the first day the stock traded the stock started the day at nearly double the offering price and finished at 3025 bigger portions of the mutual fund s gains have come from investments in companies whose valuations are well below the market averages , mr pannell said in a sense , it is a value tilt , or an antimomentum tilt , he said , explaining that he prefers companies whose share prices have been knocked around after disappointing the momentum crowd , which he says often buys stocks just because their prices have been going up for example , the fund has reaped big gains from the first plus financial group , currently its largest holding , mr pannell said the company , formerly known as rac financial group , buys and resells homeimprovement loans its shares had been caught in the downdraft that followed the collapse earlier this year of the mercury finance company and other consumer credit companies similarly , mr pannell said , capital appreciation swooped in to buy depressed shares of the creative technologies corporation , which makes computer sound boards , perseptive biosystems , which makes biotechnology equipment , and emc , a maker of data storage systems one unusual feature of both portfolios is that they can invest in a wide variety of stocks , said mr pannell , who works for wellington capital management , a boston firm that hartford hired as a subcontractor to manage its portfolios we are not stuck in any one style box , he said we can buy growth stocks , or value stocks we can invest 20 percent outside the us i can focus on any sort of idea that is going to pay off in any shortterm time frame he sometimes moves onto dangerous ground for example , one of his biggest holdings has been icn pharmaceuticals , the controversial drug developer whose chairman , milan panic , was a shorttenured prime minister of yugoslavia in 1991 , icn , without admitting or denying guilt , settled with the securities and exchange commission and the food and drug administration over charges that it illegally promoted its experimental drug ribavirin mr pannell said he thought icn s regulatory troubles were a result of wishful thinking about its drug he maintains that ribavirin is still one of the most attractive parts of the company s outlook icn is working with the scheringplough corporation to test the effectiveness of the drug in combination with alpha interferon to treat hepatitis c clearly , mr pannell is not resting on the laurels of a 100 percent gain in 12 months as awareness of his performance has spread , investors have flooded the fund with cash , doubling its size since the end of june it is now at 141 million the annuities have also been growing , though at a slower pace and any investor who bought one of the annuities expecting the mutual fund s sizzling return may be in for some disappointment indeed , in an odd way the performance of the hartford capital appreciation portfolios demonstrates the dangers of a marketing strategy that is growing increasingly popular among fund companies today cloning a longestablished portfolio so you can use its track record to sell a new , untested mutual fund fund analysts say the practice has increased during the two years since the sec said it would allow fund companies to use the historical performance record of a similar portfolio in a new fund s prospectus regulators are now considering whether to allow fund companies to use these track records in advertisements in this instance , the track record understated the new fund s prospects , and its investors got a pleasant surprise but it does not have to work out that way four other stock funds hartford cloned last year have underperformed their corresponding annuity portfolios by three to five percentage points photo saul pannel , mangaer of the hartford capital appreciation funds \( ed quinn the new york times \) chart two portfolios , one goal and a big gap in returns the investments portfolios of the hartford capital appreciation mutual fund and variable annuities are managed by the same person and are aimed at the same investment objective but the portfolios and the returns they generated over the past year are vastly different , as the table shows the much larger portfolio of the variable annuities

washington , july 14 president clinton called on congress today to block insurers from holding people s genes against them by denying people coverage or increasing their premiums because of their family histories or the results of genetic tests mr clinton marveled today at advances in genetic testing , but warned that some people were not seeking to be tested because of fears of what the results might mean for their insurance americans should never have to choose between saving their health insurance and taking tests that could save their lives , the president said in an announcement in the east room in the white house used properly , he said , genetic tests could save millions of lives and revolutionize health care mr clinton acted after having received a report from dr donna e shalala , the secretary of health and human services , on the relationship between insurance and genetic testing under a measure that became law last year , the government forbids insurers to use genetic information to deny or limit coverage to people in group plans today , mr clinton endorsed bills , opposed by insurance companies , to extend that protection to people who buy their own insurance the measures , pending in both houses of congress , would also prevent insurers from setting premiums based on genetic information mr clinton is calling for further congressional action to block health plans from disclosing genetic information to health and life insurers he also wants authority for the secretary of health and human services to determine when it would be proper for health plans to pass on such information the administration is eager to avoid legislation that would obstruct useful research based on genetic testing , said chris jennings , the president s health care policy adviser you have to be very careful about the unintended consequences of being overly broad , mr jennings said the health insurance association of america supported the legislation that bans discrimination based on genetic information in group plans but it said today that extending that protection to the market in insurance for individuals was a mistake that could cause people to drop their coverage the individual market is about 10 percent the size of the group market , and health risks in it are much less broadly shared , said richard p coorsh , a spokesman for the insurance association as a result , mr coorsh said , insurers may raise rates for all people in the individual market to protect against the higher costs of those with a genetic predisposition to a disease higher rates could cause some people probably the healthiest , with least need of insurance to drop their coverage then , mr coorsh said , you might end up with another premium hike , and you end up with what you call a spiral , or a death spiral he said that none of the association s 250 members required applicants to undergo genetic testing , but that some , before underwriting insurance , looked at the results of such tests if the applicant had had them mr jennings said there was little clear evidence that insurers had been denying coverage or raising rates based on genetic histories
montreal , april 23 the devils suffered their first loss of the playoffs on tuesday night but it was n't to the montreal canadiens bill guerin arrived at this afternoon s practice at molson center on crutches and sporting a cumbersome cast after being injured in new jersey s uncharacteristic 64 freeforall victory over the canadiens in game 3 of their firstround series earlier in the day , xrays taken of guerin s right foot had revealed what general manager lou lamoriello called a slight hairline fracture of his second toe lamoriello said guerin would be out of the cast in five days and able to go on the ice immediately the cast , lamoriello said , was a safety precaution the devils took a threegamestonone lead in their fourofsevengame series with the canadiens thanks to valery zelepukin s first career hat trick with a victory thursday , new jersey can close out the series in this building , where the canadiens have yet to win a playoff game after moving out of the forum late last season it would mark only the third time in their storied history that the canadiens had been swept in a fourofsevengame playoff series and it would buy guerin a little time to get healthy before the devils find out who their opponent will be in the second round the loss of guerin , a big , speedy right wing , coupled with the ankle fracture that left wing dave andreychuk sustained on the final day of the regular season , leaves the devils two forwards down however , as rangers coach colin campbell pointed out with more than a little envy earlier this season , the devils possess an interchangeable flock of forwards and that depth has already paid off andreychuk s replacement , patrik elias , had a goal and assisted on zelepukin s gamewinner on tuesday and guerin s probable replacement , petr sykora , who usually plays center , said today that he was looking forward to the opportunity to skate in the playoffs for the first time coach jacques lemaire of the devils said he had not yet decided who would take guerin s spot in the lineup lemaire also has left wing reid simpson and center peter zezel to choose from guerin , who scored 29 goals during the regular season , and had two goals and an assist in this series , hurt his foot by blocking a shot by dave manson in the second period of tuesday s game it was a pretty heavy shot , said guerin , who finished out the game , although he played sparingly in the final period this one hurt a little more than a normal one i'm obviously disappointed i figured i 'd get a good night s sleep and ice it and the swelling would be gone but the swelling did n't go anywhere the cast , it s just a precaution , guerin said i do n't necessarily need the cast but it s preventing any more separation of the bones what it will do is separate guerin from bobby holik and doug gilmour , the two centers guerin has played the most with in this series obviously , after losing dave andreychuk at the end of the regular season , now we 've lost another top winger on this team and another top goalscorer , said holik , who scored his first goal of the series on tuesday but i 've always believed that this team is built on depth we 'll play long enough that he heals and he 'll come back that might not be long , if lamoriello s prognosis was correct if all goes well , i 'll miss a game , guerin said maybe two slap shots devils coach jacques lemaire on martin brodeur , who proved to be human on tuesday night by allowing four goals he ca n't save us all the time he was a little nervous , which is normal i know he s going to bounce back when asked if brodeur would start on thursday , lemaire shot back , he 'll get a break , hopefully , in july brodeur was asked if he thought he would be nervous again in front of his hometown crowd no , no brodeur said i think i was just more anxious to start and play and get that first game over with now , it s just going to be another playoff game coach mario tremblay of montreal was asked if he still had confidence in his goalie , jocelyn thibault , who could not hold on to three onegoal leads on tuesday , and who let in his fourth bad goal of the evening on valery zelepukin s backhanded gamewinner sure , i still have confidence in thibault , tremblay said but he did not give thibault a full vote of confidence to tell you the truth , i do n't know what i'm going to do tomorrow night yet , he said when asked who would start in goal
tucson , ariz sixteen years ago , a group of physicians here set up their own health maintenance organization two and a half years ago , they sold their practice and the hmo to a california company , getting 32 million each then , in december , they joined a union to fight the very managedcare company they helped create that last decision was unusual , to say the least the doctors were all specialists at the thomasdavis medical centers , tucson s oldest and most prestigious clinic they belonged to a profession that has always looked down its nose at collective bargaining and , of course , they were millionaires yet here they were , voting by an overwhelming 93to32 margin to join the federation of physicians and dentists , an affiliate of the american federation of state , county and municipal employees it was the first time doctors employed by a forprofit managedcare company had unionized anywhere in the united states , according to the federation their motive , it turns out , had little to do with money and almost everything to do with power we wanted to be the mayo clinic of the west , said keith shelman , a specialist in internal medicine and the union coordinator among thomasdavis doctors , referring to the famous hospital in minnesota but after the tucson clinic s owner tried to ram through costcutting measures and new rules , he said , there was no choice but to unionize it was n't a dollar issue , he said it was the issue of not being allowed to be a good doctor as managed care has swept the country , with the number of people in hmo s doubling in eight years to 64 million , everybody involved is trying to cope with the furious pace of change consumer advocates complain that profitdriven managedcare providers often deny care to the chronically ill congress is debating whether to set federal health care standards for the companies and everywhere , doctors are growing frustrated at their loss of decisionmaking powers , from gag rules that restrict what doctors can tell patients about treatment options to the practice of releasing patients hours after minor surgery instead of keeping them in the hospital overnight to escape such constraints , and to fight shrinking reimbursement rates , some doctors are turning to specialties like cosmetic surgery that are often not a part of managed care others , wagering that they can solve the problem by reporting to themselves , are setting up their own hmo s and now , a growing number are thinking the once unthinkable joining together in unions to improve their bargaining power with their new efficiencyobsessed bosses interest has increased exponentially in the last six months , barry liebowitz , director of the doctors council in new york , a union of physicians who work in public hospitals , said doctors are having gag orders and drivethrough mastectomies imposed on them they are finding themselves in an economic morass , where professional control translates into economic control at thomasdavis , the disaffection boiled up suddenly in 1981 , the doctors who owned the clinic set up an hmo , intergroup health care by the mid1990 s , intergroup health had become the state s largest hmo , with 379 , 000 members , and the doctors had sold a 40 percent stake to the public in november 1994 , a california company , the foundation health corporation , bought both the clinic and the hmo for 688 million the 133 physicianshareholders each got foundation health stock worth 32 million the working atmosphere remained relatively benign under the new owners then last july , foundation health decided to hang onto the hmo but sell thomasdavis and another physician group in sacramento , calif , to fpa medical management inc of san diego for 195 million , a deal that was to be completed by december while physicians say thomasdavis and its hmo were selfsupporting , foundation health contended that the clinic did not stand on its own and ran in the red so , in august , foundation outlined a plan to chop clinic overhead by 2 million a month with fpa s endorsement , the plan involved cutting 26 doctors , including specialists such as dermatologists increasing patient loads , and eliminating records clerks , which forced doctors to type their own charts it also imposed new bureaucratic restrictions , even denying the obstetrics department chief the freedom to order the type of rubber gloves she wanted the physicians rose in revolt not only did foundation health s plan erode their independence , it bruised their pride here they were , they fumed , the elite of tucson s medical society , and they were being treated like orderlies the move to unionize was incited by the iconoclastic figure of robert c osborne , an anesthesiologist in the tucson area dr osborne had once made 350 , 000 a year in his private practice , but his income had shrunk by a third as medical insurers curbed fees , and then plummeted when a local association of anesthesiologists expelled him in a dispute last may , he filed for personal bankruptcy , owing 91 , 000 in federal taxes
for financially stretched parents everywhere , it can signal great relief a grandmother mentions that she wants to help pay for her grandchild s education even while celebrating and expressing enormous gratitude , the parents of the fortunate young one may want to suggest a future discussion about financial choices because as welcome as money is in any form , there are ways for doting grandparents to stretch their donated dollars among the considerations of a monetary gift are investment growth potential , income taxes over the years , the child s eligibility for financial aid and the grandparents' gift and estate taxes one increasingly popular way for grandparents to help their grandchildren is through prepaid tuition plans , offered in about 20 states this year and being considered by many more , including new york and connecticut while the details of these programs vary by state , they generally lock in the cost of tuition at today s rates , providing protection against escalating college costs the money , managed by the state or its agent , is intended to grow at the same rate as tuition does barbara jennings , who heads ohio s program , says that grandparents have set up 12 percent of the accounts there and that more than half the plans contain contributions from grandparents dean moffett , 58 , a high school guidance counselor in maumee , ohio , began buying tuition credits from ohio when his first grandchild , ali haubner , was 6 months old he has since done the same for another grandchild , jacob haubner , 3 so far , he has invested a total of 4 , 000 for jacob and ali , now 5 grandparents , in particular , seem to like the prepaid plans because of their apparent safety in the past , though , a couple of the plans ran into financial trouble and that is not the only downside to prepaid tuition plans perhaps the biggest is that if the money was invested independently over the same number of years , say in an aggressivegrowth mutual fund , it could grow far larger and provide not only for little johnny s tuition , but for other expenses or postgraduate work , too along with the contributions to the ohio tuition plan for his other grandchildren , mr moffett is sending periodic gifts of money to the mother of his third grandchild , jared moffett , 2 she decided the money could be better invested elsewhere , he said another consideration is whether the money can be used for tuition at any public or private college in the country say , if ali wants to go to school in california instead of in ohio in many cases , it can be tuition credits can usually be switched to another family member without penalty , too the plans enjoy a taxexempt status , but there are still a few tax issues for example , if susie decided to bypass college altogether , the plan s donor would owe income tax on the difference between the amount refunded and the amount contributed and if susie does go to college , she will owe income tax on the plan s earnings when they are distributed finally , the amount the grandparents contributed to the prepaid tuition plans would be subject to estate tax if they died before the money was distributed so if avoiding estate tax is a paramount concern and if the grandparents are of a very advanced age , another type of gift may make more sense generally , each person can leave 600 , 000 at death without incurring estate tax additional amounts can be given away before death to shrink one s estate but a gift of more than 10 , 000 to any individual in a year means the unified gift and estate tax will apply one way to avoid the 10 , 000 limit is for a grandparent to pay some bills directly say young susie has medical bills or day care bills the grandparent could pay them if the money does not go to susie or her parents , it is not a gift the grandparent could then make a gift of 10 , 000 in the same year for susie s college fund , and the parents might match it by the amount they are saving on the medical or day care bills grandparents with children of college age might also use this approach to provide more than 10 , 000 in assistance each year jere doyle , the estate planning manager at mellon private asset management in boston , said a grandparent could pay tuition bills of any amount directly to a college and still make an annual 10 , 000 gift to the student for other expenses a lot of people assume that the 10 , 000 gift includes any amount you give a university , mr doyle said people may think that direct transfer is too good to be true , or that it holds only for medical expenses , which is the more publicized use for this kind of money however , if a student is receiving financial aid , grandparents may want to hold off paying college tuition bills directly stephen k davis of the safeharbor asset management corporation in huntington , li , cautioned that a handful of colleges recently asked students who were applying for financial aid whether they anticipated financial assistance from their grandparents none of the colleges actually asked them to list their grandparents' assets , he said still , grandparents who pay the bills directly might jeopardize financial aid grandparents might instead consider paying off a student loan taken out by the student or his parents of course , the best time to start saving is long before the grandchildren are near college age so what should grandparents consider if they have a long time frame for their investment \? for very conservative investors , mr doyle says that zerocoupon bonds are a good first step
east rutherford , nj , may 4 the metrostars got what they deserved for today s performance after failing to score in regulation , they had to settle for a shootout victory over the los angeles galaxy , and the 1 point it gave them in the major league soccer standing , before 20 , 264 fans at giants stadium we are not completely happy with today because we should have 3 points , not 1 , coach carlos alberto parreira said it is better to get 1 point than none , but we should have beaten this team because we were at home and they played a game on friday john debrito and giovanni savarese scored and tony meola made two diving stops to give the metrostars a 21 edge in the shootout but it was a game the metrostars should have won in regulation both teams had good scoring chances in the final minutes , and the best belonged to the metrostars but antony de avila missed from off the left post in the 80th minute after a nifty crossing pass from mike sorber it is nice to get a win and the point , but we obviously wanted 3 points , said meola , who made three saves for his second shutout of the season carlos said he would give us 10 games and then we have to start winning all of them the metrostars \( 34 , 7 points \) finally got their offense going in the second half after a lethargic start los angeles also found its offense in the second half even so , the teams combined for only seven shots on goal , four for the galaxy and three for the metrostars it was our worst first half of the season , parreira said of the metrostars' two shots on goal we did not have any spirit , but i told the players this at halftime and we played better in the second half if we played in the second half the way we did in the first half , the result would have been different the galaxy \( 16 , 3 points \) was supposed to be at a major disadvantage today but neither playing in its second game in three days \( los angeles lost to d c united , 20 , in washington on friday \) nor being without its two best playmakers , the allstar midfielder mauricio cienfuegos and cobi jones , appeared to be a factor for the galaxy cienfuegos , who has two goals and two assists , is with the el salvador team for world cup qualifying and jones was resting his sore right hamstring i think they did nothing wrong today , parreira said of the galaxy they were missing two very good players and they created some good chances this is still a time of experimentation for parreira , who has changed the metrostars' starting lineup six times in six games today , he did it again de avila and savarese , the metrostars' top scorers , returned after world cup qualifying with their national teams , but only de avila returned as a starter a j wood , who scored a goal last saturday starting in place of savarese , started again today savarese , who scored first for the metrostars in the shootout , replaced wood in the 59th minute
karlovy vary , czech republic while moscow was ruling eastern europe , the region s movie makers knew where they stood if they made conformist films , they were assured of government financing if they stepped out of line , their films would be banned yet , as soon as political controls were relaxed in czechoslovakia , poland and hungary at different moments of the 1960 s and 1970 s , directors of the stature of milos forman and roman polanski promptly appeared surely , then , with the collapse of communism , a new new wave of eastern european movies would not tarry so , where is it \? the last eight years have changed the region beyond recognition ancient lands have rediscovered their identities new countries have been created most have freely elected governments , and many have come to terms with the good and the greed of market economies last month , the czech republic , poland and hungary were even invited to enter nato yet , puzzlingly , in cinema , that most exportable of art forms , expectations have so far been disappointed could it be that democracy is a lesser muse than dictatorship \? certainly , freedom s unannounced arrival stunned the region s filmmakers they were no longer muzzled but , as government subsidies were slashed or canceled , they struggled to find money for even lowbudget productions new television stations , cable channels and booming video sales began stealing traditional moviegoing audiences , forcing hundreds of dilapidated governmentowned movie theaters to close surviving theaters plus a handful of new cineplexes were soon showing hollywood movies almost exclusively then there was the predicament faced by directors who for so long had been silenced or had been forced to convey their screen message through obscure codes and symbols in a kind of unspoken conspiracy with audiences when you 're not allowed to talk , you know what you want to say , explained mr forman , the czech director who made his name with such films as loves of a blonde and the firemen s ball during the prague spring of the mid1960 s and who opted for exile in the united states after the soviet invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 censorship identifies what s worth talking about but when you 're free , you have to decide what s important and that s more difficult there were other unpleasant surprises under communism , american and european audiences eagerly embraced soviet bloc movies that escaped to the west those by , say , mr forman , jiri menzel \( closely watched trains \) and jan nemec \( the report on the party and the guests \) from czechoslovakia , or mr polanski \( knife in the water \) and andrzej wajda \( ashes and diamonds \) from poland , or istvan szabo \( mephisto \) from hungary then , almost overnight , eastern european films found themselves struggling no less than other foreignlanguage productions to find distributors in the united states and western europe if once the magical aura of political dissidence had sufficed , now they had to measure up as entertainment still , if at times they have come close to despair since 1989 , filmmakers in eastern europe have not given up , above all in the czech republic , poland and hungary , countries with traditions worth reviving directors love to list the problems they face , yet films probably more than 100 a year continue to be made in the former soviet bloc some government financing is available , but for the first time , real producers exist in the past , governments determined movie budgets now independent producers must put together complex packages involving domestic and western european investors , the council of europe s eurimages fund and , above all , newly affluent television companies the great majority of the movies made in the region since 1990 have been eminently forgettable cheap pastiches of american action films , and softporn movies galore the number of films generating little public interest and at the same time lacking redeeming artistic qualities is on the increase , the czech ministry of culture noted chastisingly in a report on the czech industry in march yet there are encouraging signs across the region , serious directors have begun tackling the great untouchable subjects of the last halfcentury , from the nazi occupation and the holocaust to the tedium and oppression of the communist years some , among them krzysztof kieslowski , the polish director who gained international acclaim for blue , white and red before dying last year , have also looked at the new moral questions posed by the onslaught of primitive capitalism this very seriousness also poses a problem many moviegoers in eastern europe prefer the escapism of hollywood \( and even locally made \) action movies to the discomfort of confronting an unpleasant past and a confusing present in any event , the blockbusters are what is on offer because theater owners feel more secure showing american movies , which now account for more than 90 percent of the boxoffice take in the region further , the dramatic drop in the number of available screens \( from 3 , 081 in bulgaria in 1989 to just 209 in 1996 , for instance \) insures that thoughtful movies from eastern europe can be seen by few people , even in their countries of origin
hackensack , nj , march 18 the newborn son that two new jersey teenagers are accused of killing in delaware last november was born with a congenital brain defect , a medical examiner in delaware has disclosed and although the examiner said the defect was not a factor in the baby s death , the announcement is likely to be cited by defense lawyers who have said from the start that the baby was not healthy at birth a death certificate filed last friday said the infant suffered from a cerebral abnormality called schizencephaly the defect prevents normal development of the brain and leads to the creation of cavities that damage brain fibers critical to intellectual and motor development and function a secondary development of cystlike buildups of fluid can lead to other brain damage the finding of the defect by an assistant medical examiner , dr adrienne sekulaperlman , heartened lawyers for the two teenagers , amy s grossberg and brian c peterson , of wyckoff , nj we view the recognition it was there as a positive start , said charles j slanina , a member of ms grossberg s defense team we 're hopeful it means the me s office has taken a second look or kept an open mind about findings mr slanina said delaware s acknowledgment of the presence of schizencephaly supports defense contentions that the infant was born with brain disease and other defects he also contended that the disclosure contradicts the medical examiner s initial report , issued shortly after the baby was found dead inside a plastic bag on nov 13 , that he was born healthy and free of birth defects citing a delaware judge s order barring prosecutors and defense lawyers from discussing the case , mr slanina refused to say whether the two teenagers were aware of the infant s brain defect when ms grossberg gave birth , with mr peterson s help , in a motel in newark , del , on nov 12 he also declined to discuss the defense s trial strategies and how critical the issue of schizencephaly will become in efforts to rebut the state s contention that the teenagers murdered the baby but he pointed out that defense lawyers argued , both in and out of court , soon after the arrests that the baby suffered from birth defects and that there was an issue of the viability of the child , assuming the child was born alive dr jeffrey wisoff , director of pediatric neurosurgery at the new york university medical center in manhattan , said today that schizencephaly is a rare abnormality , occurring in fewer than 1 in 10 , 000 births victims of the defect suffer from varying degrees of abnormal mental development , including retardation , and suffer from physical weakness he said the exact cause of the defect is unknown often , he said , the abnormality begins developing during the first three months of pregnancy there are a lot of theories about why it develops , including a ministroke in the fetus in the first trimester , but none have been proven conclusively , dr wisoff said an expert on the defect who spoke on the condition of anonymity said infants could die of the defect within hours of birth , depending on the severity of the disorder and the type of medical care they receive on the death certificate , dr sekulaperlman reported that the baby was full term and born alive she listed three causes of death multiple skull fractures and hemorrhages , hypothermia and asphyxia before death , she said , the baby was shaken and suffered blunt force impact , and was put in a tied plastic bag and left in a trash bin ms grossberg and mr peterson are both free on 300 , 000 bail , pending trial , and are confined to their houses each night
in ledyard , high school students who wish to test their mettle in sports or on stage have to hit the books first the ledyard school board last year ruled that to participate in extracurricular activities , a student must maintain at least a cminus average but even those who supported the policy were surprised when firstquarter grades in november made 18 percent of the high school student body ineligible for sports , drama or other such activities the first test of the tougher academic standard precluded 187 students from participating in many school functions , whether they were already active in extracurricular activities or not the policy did force 16 ledyard football players to stop playing because their marks were too low and five starters on the varsity squad had to sit out the last two games of the season janet woodard , whose daughter graduated from ledyard last june and whose two sons currently attend the high school , said she did not agree with the policy at all last year , she said , her son brian struggled to stay eligible to play football and baseball and he is doing well this year i understand that the school board wants to raise standards and i'm not against that , mrs woodard said but they are n't thinking of the kids there are many circumstances that contribute to failure , mrs woodard said , not all of which are academic the principal of ledyard high school , william lafleur , said that most people like the new rule because it motivates students besides , he said , the high school has an appeals process that makes the cminus average requirement fairer if a student is banned from activities because of poor academic performance , he or she can appeal for a second chance to stay involved winning such an appeal requires the student to agree to improve his grades , mr lafleur said maybe a student has a course that s too much for him we do n't want to retaliate against him for that brian ambrosch , a ledyard senior active in school plays , said that of the 30 to 40 students involved in drama , none have lost privileges as a result of the new rule there were a few people who started having trouble , but we all helped out , he said if you like school , there s no argument about this i do n't think it is that bad yet some coaches say that since few high schools force athletes to raise their grades , teams that must meet higher academic standards are at a disadvantage currently all high school athletes , boys and girls , must abide by the standards imposed by the connecticut interscholastic athletic conference , which requires only that students take and pass at least four courses to play high school athletics some argue that the ciac standard is too low because it allows students to play even if they have a dminus average michael h savage , executive director of the ciac , estimates that of 174 member schools , about 35 percent , like ledyard , have tougher academic requirements than the conference s he said his organization may consider raising athletic eligibility requirements in may , when such changes are normally debated but , i have difficulty requiring athletes to have a higher average than other kids , mr savage said singling out athletes is not a reasonable approach to motivating youngsters david hodge , football coach at weaver high school in hartford , has a different view for some time , hartford has put students in sports who do n't achieve a cminus average on probation , mr hodge said the policy did n't prevent mr hodge s team from winning its division football championship this fall out of 37 on the football team , only six had f s on their report cards and only one had an average so low he lost his eligibility to play , mr hodge said he requires all his athletes to attend study halls , no matter how well they are doing in school they all realize if they made an effort they can get a cminus , he said bloomfield high school , like ledyard , forces all students to earn a minimum cminus average to participate in afterschool activities , says its football coach , jack cochran it s a yearround effort , he said , noting that he monitors athletes' grades , assigning study halls and arranging for tutors when academic performance begins to slip he said the rule would work better if it were designed to be more of a carrot and less of a stick , with a probationary period that would give a student a second chance while staying involved in school activities if kids are going home at 2 15 , that s too much down time , mr cochran said that s when teens get in the most trouble key to a successful policy , coaches and teachers agree , is keeping careful track of student grades and constantly offering academic help to those who need it mr cochran goes so far as to chart the academic progress of his athletes other school systems that are considering raising academic requirements for students , or that have considered such a move in the past , say it would be a lot easier if all schools followed the same rule reid burdick sees the issue as one of fairness i would support a cminus rule if it was supported by the ciac , said mr burdick , who is a former new

sometimes , the sports tv playland offers inyourface examples of the best and the worst it can possibly offer on the upper tier will be cbs s coverage of the final four of the ncaa men s basketball tournament tomorrow and monday whether kentucky , north carolina , arizona or minnesota wins , cbs has proved over the years that when it comes down to this event s denouement , it will do everything possible to deliver on its 17 billion tournament investment there may be factors to make cbs s broadcast stand out more than usual , even if cbs has again failed to give al mcguire a final four role yet ushers in the lessexperienced and difficulttocomprehend george raveling there will be rotating cameras mounted behind each backboard , similar to the ones nbc uses on national basketball association coverage , plus a second super slowmotion camera nonetheless , the final four is about the teams and the games , not technical toys cbs s jim nantz and billy packer like the changes caused by the departures of underclassmen to the nba , providing each team with less talent , but distributing it widely across the nation less quality , more parity who needs wooden s bruins when we 've got lute s wildcats \? of the 12 final fours i 've covered , this is the most evenly matched , nantz said usually you come in with one team being a favorite , but this time you can make a legitimate case for anyone to win added packer in this final four , any team can win two games that s unique and healthy for the game now we get to the tv dregs how can an industry that generates highquality work like cbs s final four tolerate being represented by programming like cnnfn s pathetic presentation wednesday at 6 pm of the sports emmy nominations no , it was n't the presentation of the real awardees another dreadful affair that luckily is not on tv just the nominations , as if the live listing of nominees for best live event turnaround is worthy of telecast from top to bottom , this program s mistakeriddled production mocked the achievements it purported to honor think of adam sandler hosting a tribute to jessica tandy and hume cronyn here , sean callebs hosted the affair on a level of sycophancy that would embarrass a gameshow emcee in interviews , he made larry king seem like saddam hussein the presenters found speaking a weighty chore their banter was awkward and insipid mispronunciations were rife say , do n't you enjoy tennis commentary from mary carillio of cbs \? as presenters , charles dolan , cablevision s chairman , and dave checketts , madison square garden s president , acted like two stagestruck ralph kramdens in the chef of the future bit \( no , they could n't core a apple \) why were donald trump and jojo starbuck joking about salchows \? why were they there \? we learned from another presenter , neil smith , the president of the rangers , that fox sports just wrapped up its first season of nfl coverage \( actually , fox soon enters its fourth \) there is nothing like ably written and researched material to make a program move smoothly and none of that was tolerated here not one working sportscaster was on hand to present nominations for excellence in sportscasting not even a network executive or an intern just folks like rolando blackman and rusty kanokogi , the women s judo coach throughout this , i prayed for relief chris farley and david spade , such pithy , david nivenesque presenters on monday s academy awards show , would have been welcome hey , farley mowat would have been welcome but the soured cherry on the sundae came late in the nominations anyone who attends the sports emmys dinner knows the low point comes with the orotund vocal stylings of john cannon , the president of the national academy of television arts and sciences as is his wont , cannon made an overlong tribute in 33 1 3 time to frank gifford , who will receive a lifetime achievement award , and described the thrill of getting an emmy cannon is not some bland clone from an accounting firm on hand to explain voting rules he is ted baxter3 , a man so in love with his larynx that he ca n't recognize how fatuous he is several steps better , but still very low on the tv food chain , was comedy central s what s wrong with sports \? town hall meeting earlier this month comedy central has regularly failed at sports comedy , and this one collapsed , too , by not being funny among the panelists were rebecca lobo , the women s basketball star , and andre rison , the former green bay packer yes sir , when i want my comedy , i always turn to yukmeisters like lobo and rison and hosts do n't get any funnier than pat o'brien , whose straight lines were so straight they failed to elicit funny ones what s wrong with sports \? shows likes this airwaves do n't miss abc s fine profile of ted williams , sunday from 34 pm tnt will hire keith jackson , the newly retired tight end , for its nfl studio show , but will not bring back the humorist norman chad

fresh from the failure of its attempt to merge with the new york university medical center , mount sinai medical center is set to announce today that it has agreed to affiliate its entire health care network with the saint barnabas health care system , the largest network in new jersey while the deal with nyu would have created the dominant medical center in the city in terms of patients treated , revenues , prestige and research , the agreement with st barnabas will give mount sinai an unrivaled regional presence , a reach that it hopes will strengthen its bargaining position with managed care companies that increasingly determine where people get their care mount sinai includes 25 hospitals , nearly 12 , 000 doctors working in new york city and nine surrounding counties and revenues last year of 55 billion its alliance with st barnabas which counts nine hospitals and more than 4 , 100 doctors in a network that generated 15 billion in revenues last year and mount sinai is not a merger each system will maintain medical , administrative and financial autonomy there will also be no parent corporation governing the two independent medical systems , a method of affiliation recently adopted by beth israel medical center and st luke sroosevelt hospital center in manhattan instead , executives at both health care systems said , their collaboration will allow them to maintain their independence while helping them to win better rates from managed care companies the joined systems will include so many hospitals , ambulatory care centers and doctors' practices in the metropolitan region that managed care companies will be virtually forced to include them in their list of providers often , managed care companies succeed in forcing lower rates on hospitals and doctors by threatening to exclude them from their panels of providers mount sinai and st barnabas executives said they were also considering eventually creating their own managed care plans , in which they would negotiate directly with employers and individuals to offer comprehensive health care coverage , cutting out managed care companies that now serve as middlemen between consumers and hospitals to have the biggest health system in new york partner with the biggest system in new jersey has to have an impact and will create a menu of services attractive to regional employers , said dr john w rowe , president of the mount sinai medical center analysts of the frenzied health care market said an alliance between systems was the logical next step after most hospitals in the city and the region scurried to create partnerships with one another in the first stage of their response to the growth of managed care while some of those partnerships have crossed county and state lines , none have gone as far as this agreement in creating a farflung network of hospitals , doctors' practices and outpatient clinics this is the beginning of the next phase , said howard berliner , a professor of health policy at the new school for social research first we had a move to create dominance in the city now we have a movement to create regional hegemony observers also pointed out that a lot of activity in the health care marketplace today is aimed at outflanking competitors who might be considering similar moves a deal like this clearly ups the geographic ante for other hospitals , said james r tallon jr , president of the united hospital fund , which does research and philanthropy dr rowe said that the partners would be committing several million dollars apiece to the joint effort , which is to include creating information systems and bargaining jointly for nonclinical services , like supplies , laundry and billing mount sinai also plans to use a variety of the st barnabas system s hospitals and outpatient offices as sites for training students at the mount sinai medical school ronald j del mauro , president and chief executive of the saint barnabas health care system , said that for him , a priority was to strengthen the graduate medical education programs at his institutions , which in turn would strengthen the system s position in the highly competitive health care market
perhaps the cowboys' dormitory demolition caused the distraction or maybe it was the intrigue about which kicker the jets would keep whatever the reason , it has gone virtually unnoticed that three players with some of the most spectacular statistics in national football league history are fighting for playing time or relegated to the bench altogether this season instead , the talk is all about jerry rice s continuing effort to claim every record known to receivers he is even taking on the placekickers now and about how high dan marino can raise the bar on quarterback greatness does n't anyone care that the business of recordsetting is increasingly full of obstacles for wayne chrebet , steve bono and dave krieg \? if not , perhaps they should consider no nfl receiver has ever caught as many passes as chrebet did in his first two seasons no active quarterback has a better winning percentage than bono only five quarterbacks have thrown more touchdown passes than krieg ever as usual , though , the focus is all on the glamour guys , with rice remaining the primary topic but really , have n't his accomplishments become almost mundane \? yes , he needs just one more touchdown to become the first player other than a placekicker to score 1 , 000 points in his career does anyone doubt he will do it \? the guy has scored nearly 14 touchdowns a season he should have the recordsetter by , oh , about 4 20 today and talk about predictable rice catches at least a pass a game , so naturally he is closing in on that record , too we even know exactly when he 'll break art monk s 183game streak nov 2 it is even to the point that rice is dragging his teammates into the record book with him by catching six more touchdown passes from steve young , rice will turn himself and young into the league s most productive receiverquarterback touchdown tandem \( the record is 79 by mark clayton and dan marino \) so let s acknowledge that rice is setting the standard for receivers everywhere the question is , will anyone ever surpass him \? certainly none of his contemporaries will heck , he is 18 miles ahead of henry ellard of washington in receiving yardage , and ellard is only 828 yards out of second place total receptions \? with 1 , 050 , rice is two seasons ahead of ellard \( 775 \) and buffalo s andre reed \( 766 \) no , if rice has anyone to worry about , perhaps it is chrebet the little jet caught 150 passes in his first two seasons , 15 more than rice had at that point this is a guy who already shares a collegiate record with rice \( most touchdown receptions in a game , 5 \) and how is this for karma if chrebet continues to catch 75 passes a season for the next 12 seasons , he will have exactly the number rice has now sounds like the numbers of a star , yet he is fighting for playing time with keyshawn johnson and jeff graham if any book titled just give me the damn ball comes out next year , look for a new author in fact , maybe chrebet could coauthor it with bono and krieg bono has started 40 games in the nfl and has won 70 percent of them unfortunately for him , he could n't win in the playoffs , so the kansas city chiefs dumped him this season , he will spend more time near the hot seat than on the field he is in green bay as the backup to brett favre , whose winning percentage of 649 oddly enough is second only to bono s 700 that s one of the few categories that marino does n't lead he is seventh \( 624 \) winning is n't necessarily his forte , though passing is , and he 'll get plenty of publicity for it this season with an impressive , but not incredible , 31 touchdown passes , he will become the first quarterback to throw 400 in his career but look just a few lines further down that touchdown list and you 'll find krieg he gets more publicity for his difficulties his small hands are said to have contributed to his record 150 fumbles but the bad teams he has played for are probably responsible for his being the victim of an astounding 492 sacks give krieg credit , though in a 17year career that has taken him to seattle , kansas city , detroit , arizona , chicago and now tennessee , he has averaged more than 15 touchdown passes a season to put that in perspective , the career high for the giants' dave brown is 12 krieg s perseverance has brought him to the crest of nfl immortality with 13 more touchdown passes he would move past joe montana into fourth place with 264 and not far beyond that , at 290 , is the legendary johnny unitas but krieg s view of the future is blocked by the present and the present is steve mcnair too bad expansion is n't in the works just think what krieg and chrebet could do
the last thing the 1997 mets need or want is business as usual , especially since business as usual has translated into six consecutive sub500 seasons so the team that will open its spring training complex to pitchers and catchers in port st lucie , fla , tomorrow has tried a different approach before one pitch is thrown in practice let alone any anger the team has already made it clear that the vaunted opening day assignment belongs to pete harnisch , a decision manager bobby valentine made public last month , the earliest any mets manager has named the starter in doing so , valentine passed over two other righthanders on the mets staff mark clark , the team s top winner last season , and bobby jones , the opening day starter in 1996 , who was signed to a contract yesterday along with the recently acquired greg mcmichael , as the mets completed their signings and averted arbitration this off season but it will be harnisch who gets the ball on april 1 in san diego it makes me feel good , but unusual is a good word for it , too , a perfect word because it was surprising to hear that because they do n't usually do that that early , harnisch said tuesday , speaking from his home in lake mary , fla , and still sounding impressed over being tapped for opening day so early you can play 20 years and opening day is still special every year it s a little nerveracking , but i love it and look forward to it if valentine had relied solely on victories and defeats , then clark , the surprise out of the cleveland organization , might have got the call mark was one of our most consistent guys last year , really one of the most consistent pitchers in the league , and he probably deserved it as much as anybody , harnisch said of clark , who was 1411 with a 343 earned run average for the mets , as opposed to harnisch s 812 record and 421 era still , harnisch understands valentine s method and message i think bobby probably looked at a couple of other factors , maybe that i have a little more experience in the league and that maybe i have done it a couple of times , said the 30yearold righthander , who last opened a season for the houston astros in 1994 harnisch came back last season after shoulder surgery ended his 1995 campaign but his rush back to the mound did not necessarily mean a rush back to top form it was not until midseason that harnisch began putting some impressive performances together , highlighted by a blanking of the pittsburgh pirates on july 29 , his first shutout since 1993 by aug 8 , he had won three consecutive games , allowing only four earned runs in 24 1 3 innings , including a string of 13 scoreless innings harnisch says that the return to health he began to enjoy in the second half of the season has carried over through the winter i feel fine , he said i 've been doing a lot of throwing not necessarily on the mound , yet , but a lot of long tossing and i 've done a lot of stretching , arm exercises , dumb bells , rotatorcuff exercises and my arm feels wonderful harnisch sees no reason why the goals he sets for himself annually should not be within reach i 'd just like to go out there and pitch 34 , 35 games and pitch 200some innings , stay healthy , make all my turns , then usually the rest will take care of itself , said harnisch , who has recorded three 200plus inning seasons in the majors , but none since 1993 last year , though disabled until midapril , harnisch nonetheless worked 194 2 3 innings and made 31 starts inside pitch in completing their signings yesterday , the mets gave reliever greg mcmichael a twoyear deal worth 3 , 275 , 000 and bobby jones a oneyear contract worth 1 , 925 , 000 both had arbitration hearings scheduled for next week mcmichael , a 30yearold righthander , was acquired by the mets from atlanta on nov 25 for paul byrd he was 53 with a 322 era and two saves in 73 games as the setup man for the closer mark wohlers mcmichael , who made 460 , 000 last season , gets a 200 , 000 signing bonus , 1 million this season and 28 million in 1998 new york has a 18 million option for 1999 with a 275 , 000 buyout he had asked for 155 million in arbitration , and the mets had offered 975 , 000 jones , who turned 27 monday , gets a raise from 405 , 000 to 1 , 925 , 000 , the midpoint between the 235 million he asked for and the 15 million the mets offered he was 128 with a 442 era in 31 starts last season photo the mets have already given pete harnisch the nod as the starting pitcher for opening day , and that may help cut down on spring anxiety \( g paul burnett the new york times \)

kibbutz netiv halamed he , israel with its corrugated tin milking barns , sloping avocado orchards and feathery pink almond trees , this communal farm on the lip of the jerusalem forest is a serene and simple place roosters crow at 3 o'clock in the morning , cows are milked an hour later , and each day , 9 , 000 chicken eggs are rinsed , sorted and stamped everyone works sunday through friday , lives in a modest house and eats in the dining hall nobody needs money on the kibbutz , and no one owns a car but within this routinerested , halfacenturyold enclave , an unusual experiment is unfolding , catapulted all the way from the new york city public schools fourteen new york city teenagers shaped by the harshest of urban crucibles their families torn by drugs , abuse or violence , their adolescence spent cutting school , caught up in the life of the streets have come to the kibbutz for the spring there is sharlene mcintosh , who says she was paddled with pots and highheeled shoes by her stepmother , ran away from home at 13 , and slept on the staten island ferry and the cold stoops of housing projects until child welfare authorities placed her in a group home there is abdul halim johnson , who says he once threw an iron bolt at a science teacher , was suspended because of an incident involving a gun in school , and drank so seriously that his book bag held no books , just bottles of liquor there is jason brito , convicted of selling drugs at 14 danny cedeno , 16 , whose father was stabbed to death coming home from work and dante green , 16 , whose father died of a crack overdose and who began hanging out on the streets at age 11 and was arrested for assault at 15 they and the others teenagers from harlem , the bronx and brooklyn are students at west side high school in manhattan , an alternative public school considered a last chance for those who do not make it at other schools a lot of people think it s not worth investing in these kids anymore , said ayala donchin , executive director of youthworks , the nonprofit organization that runs the israel program , which is sponsored by the new york city board of education they 're too old they 've been through on average 26 high schools before west side they are one step away from becoming statistics but we feel this is the best chance most of them will have to learn how to succeed in high school , in college , in a job , in a community in israel , the teenagers are exposed to discipline and daily responsibilities , but they also have a chance to be 5 , 000 miles away from the destructive influences that puncture their lives in the city the idea is that the concrete accomplishment of working at a job , with the sense of trust and consistency that comes from being part of a closeknit community , will help give the youths confidence and determination to stay in school , cope with ruptured families and build productive lives so far , the results are encouraging for the program , started in 1989 by a brooklyn high school teacher who spent a sabbatical on a kibbutz and thought that troubled city students might benefit from the environment that seemed to make israeli teenagers so responsible and selfconfident of 125 students who went through the program , 103 have graduated from high school as of last fall , three students were in jail and one had been murdered of the 60 students who stayed in contact with youthworks , 13 went to college , 24 had jobs and 12 were finishing high school now , youthworks , which is privately financed , hopes to be a national model that can squeeze results out of youths others have given up on los angeles has copied the program and detroit is interested , ms donchin said next year , youthworks plans to expand its new york program to three high schools and three different kibbutzim but the process is far from smooth some kids ca n't make it , said ms donchin , who said youths had been sent home from at least half the trips last year , a boy was thrown out for stealing and for videotaping girls in their underwear a girl was sent home for hurling a space heater at a boy coming close to selfdestruction this year , two teenagers were kicked out before the group left for israel one for missing pretrip classes , the other for using drugs then , in a tense , explosive encounter just two weeks after the group arrived in israel , youthworks leaders nearly sent all 14 teenagers home because 13 of them had been drinking and 4 had smoked marijuana they brought from new york only when each youth confessed did the leaders say they could stay but they imposed penalties a curfew , phone calls to tell parents about drug use , adult chaperones at the kibbutz disco , a moratorium on visits to the kibbutz canteen on the realistic side , they all have question marks over their heads , ms donchin said on the idealistic side , you 'd like to think they 'll all make it sometimes , just when things are going really well , they 'll do something to sabotage themselves still , there have already been victories , some subtle , some striking
st john s , newfoundland , june 23 canadian officials said today that they were taken by surprise when the united states suggested that their country seek the extradition of the former cambodian dictator , pol pot , and expressed doubt that their genocide law could be used as washington requested a senior official at canada s ministry of justice , who spoke on the condition that he not be identified , noted that canada has no extradition treaty with cambodia under section 7 of the canadian criminal code , charges can be brought for war crimes and crimes against humanity that are committed outside canada the suspect , however , must be present in canada in order for the law to be applied the united states has indicated it would be willing to take part militarily in bringing pol pot to canada , although it is not clear under what legal basis such an operation would be carried out \( in washington , clinton administration officials said they were discussing using american aircraft and military forces , as well as those from other nations , in the event that cambodian officials succeeded in working out a plan for the surrender of pol pot , possibly to an international tribunal \( with conflicting intelligence reports about pol pot s whereabouts , united states legal experts began discussions with denmark and the netherlands to see if their laws would allow them to seek the extradition of the khmer rouge leader \) over the weekend , secretary of state madeleine k albright raised the possibility that canada could extradite the 69year old khmer rouge leader in a conversation with her canadian counterpart , foreign minister lloyd axworthy , at the international economic summit meeting in denver according to a canadian official , they had been discussing the breakdown of talks between canada and the united states over salmon fishing rights when ms albright suggested that canada play a leading role in an international attempt to bring pol pot to trial in 1987 , canada passed a law that provides for prosecution of anyone in canada who has committed crimes against humanity in canada or elsewhere the law was part of canada s attempt to prosecute suspected nazi war criminals who had immigrated to canada after world war ii the law has been applied four times against suspected war criminals in canada none of the cases resulted in a successful prosecution , the justice official said the most recent case was against imre finta , a suspected war criminal , in ontario in a 1994 appeal of that case , the supreme court of canada upheld the constitutionality of the war crimes law we presume it s applicable in this case , the official said , referring to the planned proceedings against pol pot we 're actively reviewing it it s just too early to give a considered opinion at this point presumably , the former cambodian dictator would have to be brought to canada in order for canada to be able to bring charges against him the united states has indicated that it would be willing to participate militarily in bringing pol pot to canada , although it is not clear under what legal basis such an operation would be carried out , since there is no extradition agreement then , according to the justice official , pol pot would have to be accused under the criminal code in canada for that to happen , canada would have to be in possession of evidence collected by the cambodian government against pol pot really what it comes down to , said the justice official , is that without the active participation of cambodia , it will be impossible to prosecute all the evidence and witnesses are on cambodian soil that country is best situated to bring these charges forward catherine lappe , a spokesman for mr axworthy , said that just bringing pol pot to canada would also raise immigration issues , depending on how that was done we are consulting with other allies and working with the un and the united states , ms lappe said canada is interested in assessing what it can do and what course makes the most sense in reaching a conviction it is possible , though unlikely , that canada could put pol pot on trial in canada , as it has done with the suspected nazi war criminals our preference is to have a un mandate approach , ms lappe said however , there currently is no international tribunal with the jurisdiction to try pol pot the united nations has agreed to consider taking such actions , but it has not done so yet ms lappe said it may be possible to increase the scope of the international war crimes tribunal for bosnia , or to create a new one for cambodia ms lappe said the canadians were surprised when ms albright approached them with the idea because so many details are unknown , the canadians have not been able to lay out a firm course of action , she said

the devils used three centers instead of four against the rangers yesterday , and none of them was named messier or gretzky still , bobby holik , denis pederson and the newly acquired peter zezel held their own in a 22 tie that allowed the devils to extend their unbeaten streak to a franchiserecord 11 games after bob carpenter strained his neck in montreal on saturday night , coach jacques lemaire had virtually no option but to go with just zezel , pederson and holik and hope they did not run out of gas in fact , they did not , although the strain eventually showed our centermen got tired in the third period , lemaire said they were not the same as in the first and second period if we had four centermen , our chances would have been better the center position has been a continuing issue for lemaire this season brian rolston and steve sullivan failed miserably every time they were tried at center , and were moved to the wing petr sykora and sergei brylin play center , but each is back in the minor leagues zezel arrived from st louis last week , expecting to see limited ice time with the devils as a checking center and faceoff specialist instead , the 31yearold veteran of six national hockey league teams logged tons of ice time against the rangers i have n't seen so much ice time probably since i was with keenan , zezel said , referring to his days with coach mike keenan and the philadelphia flyers nine years ago i'm exhausted because i had n't played for three weeks until i got here , zezel added this was zezel s third game with the devils with carpenter expected to be out at least two more games , zezel is now getting a cram course in the devils' style of hockey zezel s line , with valery zelepukin on the left and john maclean on the right , went up against gretzky s line for much of the game gretzky set up both of the rangers' goals , but zezel s line got in the scoring column , too , when zelepukin scored early in the third period on a screened shot from the left faceoff circle that gave the devils a 21 lead that lasted only several minutes the devils' first goal came almost halfway through the second period when steve thomas scored his seventh goal of the season but only his first in his last 10 games with a shot that went in off the skate of the rangers' bruce driver when you 're slumping , thomas said , it takes a goal like that to get you going although the devils lost two onegoal leads , lemaire was content with the way his team played the unbeaten streak includes five ties along with six victories , but the devils , now 291710 on the season , did not seem to feel that diminished their accomplishment they were defeated by the rangers in two earlier meetings this season , outscored by 91 , so yesterday s tie restored a measure of respect from their division rivals we want to stay ahead of them in the standing , said martin brodeur , who extended his own undefeated streak to 12 games \( 804 \) brodeur will go for no 13 tomorrow night , in a rematch with the rangers at the meadowlands the three centers zezel , pederson and holik will be there , too photo peter zezel of new jersey , left , and new york s mark messier mixing it up during yesterday s game \( barton silverman the new york times \)
purchase , ny , may 15 in the most severe penalty ever imposed during the playoffs , the national basketball association suspended five knicks , including patrick ewing , and one miami heat player today for their part in a fight at the end of a game wednesday night as a result , the knicks will play without their two leading scorers , ewing and allan houston , and the reserve charlie ward in game 6 of their eastern conference semifinal series at madison square garden friday night ewing , houston , john starks and larry johnson were penalized under a league rule that prohibits players from leaving the bench area after an altercation begins ward , the fifth knick suspended , was part of the original skirmish , as was the only heat player banished , p j brown the penalties were announced by rod thorn , the league s senior vice president of basketball operations it was the league s harshest playoff ruling six players were suspended for a total of seven games in a 1994 playoff series between miami and atlanta , three players were suspended for a total of six games , also because of a brawl though none of the players who left the knicks bench threw punches , ewing merely stood at halfcourt watching the fray and at least one knick , johnson , clearly tried to act as a peacemaker , thorn followed to the letter a league rule on leaving the bench his decision was disputed tonight by officials of the national basketball players association , who said that the rule was not justified and that the union would fight it with two arbitration procedures and a court order bill hunter , executive director of the union , said in a statement that the league acted improperly in suspending those players who left the bench to act as peacemakers the union s chief lawyer , jeffrey kessler , said that he would go to court friday to seek a temporary restraining order , delaying any suspensions until the union appealed the penalties to two arbitrators he said we expect to have an order entered before the game kessler said one of the arbitration procedures would be based on the contention that the rule under which the players were suspended was not a part of the collective bargaining agreement , and that the agreement provides for arbitration he suggested that the rule had been imposed on the players without their necessary consent the penalties could help determine the outcome of the series , which the knicks lead , three games to two they also send a signal that the league is willing to deal decisively with the type of ugly brawling that stains games in the most glamorous part of the season nevertheless , the knicks' team president and general manager , ernie grunfeld , defended his players as the team worked out this evening at purchase college all of our players served as peacekeepers and the reason they came out was to protect one of their own , grunfeld said the reason they did it is the right reason the action was n't right because now unfortunately they 're going to have to be suspended but i'm proud that they stuck up for a teammate the knick players were suspended for one game each brown , a miami forward , was banished for two the nba also imposed 51 , 000 in fines , 46 , 000 as a result of the brawl and another 5 , 000 to starks for gesturing to the crowd with his middle finger as he left the court league rules state that at least nine players must be in uniform for a playoff game , so only three knicks ewing , houston and ward will miss game 6 starks and johnson can play friday night but would miss either game 7 against the heat or , if the knicks win friday night , game 1 of the next round against chicago when multiple suspensions are given out , the league goes in alphabetical order to determine who is suspended first , using the first letter of a player s last name for determination thus , ewing and houston must sit out game 6 instead of johnson and starks ward must sit out immediately because he was one of the principals in the fight and was in the game at the time it occurred ewing , a 12year veteran who has made winning a league championship his primary career goal , was stunned today when he was informed of the decision he descended a stairway to get ready for practice when he was told by a reporter , and he walked resolutely through a doorway without saying a word after practice , ewing said he did not think he did anything to deserve being suspended i got up to run out there when everything started , but buck grabbed me and told me 'no stay here , ' ewing said , referring to his teammate buck williams when everything was over , i walked back and that was it it s going to be tough i should be out there playing it s just frustrating to have our fate in somebody else s hands although the knicks still lead the series , their chances of wrapping it up at madison square garden friday night were considerably dimmed with the decision if the knicks lose , game 7 will be played in miami predictably , each team blamed the other for the severity of wednesday s incident , which lasted nearly one minute and led to a hostile situation between miami fans and several knick players ward and brown ignited the altercation wednesday night with 1 minute 53 seconds remaining and miami leading a game it would win , 9681 brown was suspended and fined 10 , 000 for lifting ward off the ground and throwing him into a row of photographers , which knicks coach jeff van gundy today called the most cowardly act he had seen in eight years ward was suspended and fined 6 , 000 for initiating the incident with brown by flagrantly trying to push him off the end of the court after a freethrow attempt the knicks team was fined 20 , 000 no heat players left the bench during the incident that was the determining factor in the league s meting out the punishment two years ago the nba toughened its rule for leaving the bench after two particularly embarrassing playoff brawls one in the miamiatlanta series and a highprofile fight between the knicks' derek harper and the bulls' jo jo english that spilled into the stands during a game in chicago in seattle , where the rockets lost to the supersonics tonight , houston s superstar forward , charles barkley , said the rule was illconceived that s a bad rule , he said they should clarify the rule and decide if a guy s going out as a peacemaker , or if he s going out to get involved it s just a normal emotion when a fight breaks out , you go help your teammate meanwhile , miami coach pat riley , the former new york coach who left the franchise under a cloud of recriminations two summers ago , fanned the series flames by blaming the knicks for the incident speaking on wqam radio in miami , riley said last night , new york could n't take their loss , and they continued right up until the last minute and a half to instigate something as a matter of fact , there were people from the knick bench that were telling the reserves to start something and of course on the free throw , charlie ward still thinks he s at florida state ward was a heisman trophywinning quarterback there van gundy said riley s assertion that ward was at fault was an absurd statement if you go back and watch the film , he said , we have our small guys in there to block out chris childs and charlie have taken six shots to the mouth each because of alonzo mourning and p j brown , he said photos patrick ewing , left , and allan houston , top right , at the knicks' practice site in purchase , ny , yesterday before learning of their suspension from

edgardo alfonzo has none of the swagger or name recognition of darryl strawberry and nowhere near his power but when alfonzo sent an alex fernandez pitch into the leftfield seats in the third inning yesterday against the marlins , he extended his hitting streak to 18 games , the longest run by any mets hitter since strawberry hit in 18 straight in 1990 that 1990 team finished at 9171 it was the last time the mets were over 500 and now alfonzo , the thirdyear third baseman from venezuela , is making himself a key part of a resurgent met team that , without any swagger or particularly big names , would like nothing better than to match that 9171 record , a mark that might even get them a wildcard slot in the playoffs when the 23yearold alfonzo went straight from class aa binghamton to the mets two seasons ago , he surprised a lot of people by immediately settling in and hitting 278 in 335 atbats but last season , he took a step back , hitting 261 after sitting on the bench , without a regular job in the infield , for much of the first half of the season so there were some questions about alfonzo coming into spring training this year not about his fielding , which dazzled everyone connected with the mets the issue was whether he would hit enough with at least a little bit of power to justify a starting role at a position where major league teams expect a good deal of offense that issue has apparently been resolved , and quite emphatically not only is alfonzo just six games shy of the record consecutivegame hitting streak by the mets 24 by hubie brooks in 1984 he is now leading the team in batting with a 325 average and has already driven in 36 runs and one of the reasons he is hitting the ball on the nose every game is because he has learned to hit inside pitches the first time , i hit the ball hard , said alfonzo , who lined out to second base in his first atbat yesterday the second time , it was a fastball inside and i hit it out that is what i have tried to do , hit the balls inside it was his only hit of the day , but alfonzo was not through in the fifth inning he made a splendid play in the field on a bunt up the third base line by edgar renteria alfonzo charged the ball , scooped it up barehanded and threw it to first just in time of course , that is the kind of play he is expected to make the home run , manager bobby valentine said , was a bonus it was alfonzo s sixth of the season in his first two seasons , he hit eight total alfonzo s a good little player , huh \? valentine said as he leaned back in his chair , still with a smile on his face from the mets' 53 victory i think he s just coming into his own this is the first time i 've had a hitting streak like this going , alfonzo said it feels really great of course , it feels really good for the mets too photo edgardo alfonzo rounding third after homering in the third inning yesterday during the mets' 53 victory over the marlins \( jose r lopez the new york times \)

the jets and the patriots , who have not spoken in eight days , will finally meet today to discuss bill parcells s future national football league commissioner paul tagliabue will preside at the hearing tagliabue will hold the hearing in manhattan , ostensibly to focus on a narrow question does parcells s obligation to new england his contract with the team prohibits him from coaching another team this season prevent him from acting as a consultant to the jets \? but the question is actually broader than that because if the jets can find a way to compensate the patriots , new england could release parcells from his contract and let him coach the jets now tagliabue has told the teams that he expects to make a decision on parcells s consulting contract within a day there have been only two telephone encounters between the teams about parcells , and none since tagliabue suggested to the teams friday that they start to work out a deal he indicated that if he were forced to make a decision , it might be something neither side would be happy with even so , that did not prompt either team to pick up the phone the only phone conversations were 11 days ago , when leon hess , the owner of the jets , told robert k kraft , the owner of the patriots , that the jets would not part with their no 1 draft choice and kraft said that he would not let parcells go for anything less , and eight days ago , when the jets called for permission to talk to parcells about the consultant job the jets signed him and his longtime alter ego , bill belichick , who was hired to serve as coach and chief of football operations in the interim the 115 jets now have a stronger coaching staff than the patriots pete carroll , the new coach of the patriots , is scrambling for assistants because parcells and belichick are bringing five coaches with them , virtually completing the jets' staff , which includes three holdovers nine of those assistants were a part of the giants' super bowl teams
our guys the glen ridge rape and the secret life of the perfect suburb by bernard lefkowitz illustrated 443 pp berkeley university of california press 2995 on june 30 , judge r benjamin cohen of the new jersey superior court sentenced three young men to prison for a sexual assault they had committed more than eight years earlier and for which , after a highly publicized fivemonth trial , they were convicted in march 1993 kevin and kyle scherzer , twin brothers who are now 26 , and christopher archer , 25 , were at last sent to jail for their actions when they and 10 other teenage boys , all popular high school athletes , persuaded a 17year old mentally retarded girl \( iq of 64 , according to the prosecution , and reading comprehension of an 8yearold \) , a neighborhood girl most of them had grown up with , to walk with them one mild spring afternoon to the scherzer boys' basement recreation room in the affluent suburb of glen ridge , nj , where they stripped , sexually humiliated , orally sodomized and finally raped her with a baseball bat and a broom handle six of the 13 boys , when they realized what was happening , left the basement \( none tried to stop the assault \) the next day , the same group , with a few new additions , tried to con the girl into a repeat performance \( they seem to have shared the fantasy of making a pornographic movie and had even solicited the help of a kid at school who had access to camera equipment \) on handing down his sentence , judge cohen declared to the three handsome young white men in business suits and their attorneys and friends this has gone on long enough there must be some finality robert d laurino , the essex county prosecutor in charge of the case , said , justice was finally done today and bear atwood , president of the new jersey chapter of the national organization for women , said , i'm glad a day of reckoning has finally arrived bernard lefkowitz s extraordinary chronicle of the events leading up to that moment , our guys the glen ridge rape and the secret life of the perfect suburb , suggests otherwise , however this book suggests that if there is a finality , it is only because the legal system has finished prosecuting these particular young men , but that similar crimes are meanwhile being committed against girls and women all across america by other athletic boys and men , our culture s thicknecked heroes , glorified by parents , educators , the news media and politicians of every stripe from the town hall to the rose garden and if justice was done , mr lefkowitz s book implies that it is the kind of justice obtainable by people like the parents of the three convicted boys , whose lawyers managed to keep the kids out of jail until they were in their mid20 s and then got them light sentences \( light even for young adult offenders \) at mediumsecurity campusstyle prisons , from which christopher archer and kevin scherzer can be released on parole in two years and kyle scherzer in 10 months our guys also provides ample evidence that in glen ridge and elsewhere , most affluent , white , suburban americans \( which nowadays means most americans who vote \) have not reckoned with the sexual violence that is inflicted regularly by their male children against their female children when the case first broke into the news , glen ridge was portrayed as an exception and the actions of these high school heroes as either weird and aberrant or else the natural result of a bunch of highspirited guys having been seducedby a sexually provocative girl \( the old devilmademedoit defense \) otherwise it would not have made the papers , let alone network television after being convicted back in 1993 , christopher archer hung his head and said , i used poor judgment he did not say he did something wrong kevin scherzer said , i was very young at the time his brother said nothing the current superintendent of glen ridge schools , judith conk , was recently quoted as saying , to paint a town or an existing group of students about judgments made eight years ago would n't be fair regarding the sexual assault itself , she said , it s really not talked about anymore so much for finality , justice and reckoning a calm , methodical , painstakingly researched book , our guys begins with a description of the author s visit to the june graduation of the class of '89 a few months after the assault , by which time the account of the rape by the victim \( the author has given her a protective pseudonym , leslie faber \) has been relayed to school authorities and the local police , and the boys involved are under serious investigation the history and socioeconomics of the town , a citadel of uppermiddleclass privilege from its 19thcentury inception , are laid out , and one by one the characters in the story are introduced leslie faber , the sweet , sadly vulnerable victim who wanted only these boys' friendly attention her parents and older sister the young , doggedly persistent local detective who would not let the case be buried , sheila byron , herself a 1981 graduate of glen ridge high and the boys who took leslie down to the scherzer basement that march day for the deliberate purpose of sexually abusing her the author also gives us detailed , vivid portraits of the loving , hardworking , mostly welloff parents of these boys , along with girlfriends , classmates , teachers , clergy and coaches
washington , june 30 president clinton laid out his plan today for divvying up 135 billion in tax cuts over the next five years , bending to republican demands for a broad reduction in taxes on investment gains but shifting money away from the wealthiest families and toward his cherished higher education programs arriving as congress prepares to grapple with precisely how to substantially cut federal taxes for the first time in 16 years , the plan was less a line in the sand than a formal statement of the president s bargaining position after this week s recess , house and senate negotiators are to hammer out a joint version of the tax cut plans that each passed last week , trying to arrive at a bill that mr clinton will sign the president sharply criticized the congressional tax cut plans today they do an inadequate job of opening the doors to college , he said at the white house this morning , before departing on a political fundraising trip to boston and new york they direct far too little relief to the middle class they include timebomb tax cuts that threaten to explode the deficit unlike the congressional plans , mr clinton s proposal would mean a tiny reduction or even an increase in capital gains taxes for the richest taxpayers , while people with capital gains and incomes under 100 , 000 would see significant savings \( page a17 \) mr clinton also accused republicans of backing away from commitments in the budget agreement to provide tax incentives to revive inner cities but he joined in the bipartisan optimism about an eventual deal , declining to say what proposals he would rule out i do n't want to get into veto now , he said although some congressional republicans suggested that he was acting a bit late , party members generally strove today for a magnanimous tone , congratulating mr clinton for adopting what they called their ideas putting some differences aside , the president deserves credit and praise for joining with republicans in endorsing our approach to tax relief , said representative bill archer , the texas republican who is chairman of the house ways and means committee mr clinton and republican congressional leaders came to terms on a broad tax and spending package in may , but they are now getting down to filling in the details on tax cuts , wide gaps still separate the white house and congressional plans for example , mr clinton said that he would support a broad reduction in the tax on capital gains , for years a republican grail but while the senate , and particularly the house , have called for deep reductions in such rates for all investors , mr clinton is offering smaller cuts , structured so that lesswealthy investors receive more of the benefits under mr clinton s plan , investors in the highest tax bracket would see their capital gains tax rates drop to only 277 percent from 28 percent , while taxpayers in lower brackets would receive far bigger cuts it may be tricky for the republicans to argue that the president is giving too little relief to the wealthiest americans still , treasury secretary robert e rubin indicated today that he would prefer not to cut capital gains rates at all , saying the predominant view among academics was that such a move was unlikely to produce much economic benefit but , mr rubin said , the administration wanted to develop a plan that recognizes the views of others in scheduling the announcement of the tax cut plan today , mr clinton s aides settled on a week when congress was out of town , so the president could dominate the news and be seen as taking the initiative further , by adopting some republican ideas , mr clinton seems above the partisan fray , one senior administration official said in his plan , mr clinton embraced the congressional proposal to offer a 500 credit to families for each child who is up to 17 years old he had previously said he did not support extending such credits when the children were older than 13 but the president would phase out the credit for families making 60 , 000 to 70 , 000 a year until 2000 , and after that for families making 80 , 000 to 90 , 000 a year both the house and senate plans would phase out the credit for couples making more than 110 , 000 with the money denied wealthier taxpayers , mr clinton would make the credit partially refundable that is , he would permit lowincome workers who have no federal tax liability to claim part or all of the credit they would be able to use the credit to offset the amount of money deducted from their paychecks for their portion but not for their employers' share of social security and medicare taxes the provision regarding payroll taxes amounted to a strategic retreat from mr clinton s earlier position , which was that the credit should be fully refundable , regardless of a worker s social security taxes republicans had attacked that as a form of welfare , providing tax relief to people who paid none the new approach should kill any notion that these are welfare payments , one senior administration official said in an illustration of how topsyturvy budget politics can be , mr clinton seized today on a proposal in the senate bill to raise taxes on cigarettes , partly to pay for children s health care he said that he supported devoting to children s health all the proceeds of the additional 20cent tax on a pack of cigarettes , to 44 cents but in may , mr clinton helped kill a bill to institute such a tax for the same purpose , fearing that republicans would insist that it violated the budget agreement at first blush , mr clinton s plan appears less likely to drive up the budget deficit , said robert greenstein , director of the center on budget and policy priorities , a liberal research institute whose statistical studies are generally respected here it looks like , at first glance , this package does n't suffer from the explosive growth after 2007 that the house and senate plans do , he said mr greenstein pointed out that , according to the administration s numbers , the wealthiest 20 percent of taxpayers would receive almost as much of mr clinton s tax cut as the bottom 60 percent that is an unusual pattern for a tax cut plan proposed by a democratic president , he said but , he added , the congressional plans were far more heavily weighted to the wealthiest fifth of the population chart at a glance how the president proposes to reduce taxes following are the major provisions of the tax cut plan proposed yesterday by president clinton child credit a perchild credit , starting at 400 in 1998 and rising to 500 the next year it would cover children under age 17 through 2002 and children under 19 after 2002 it would be phased out for families making 60 , 000 to 75 , 000 a year until 2000 , when the income limit would rise to 80 , 000 to 100 , 000 a year the credit would offset the family s federal income tax liability plus the employee s portion of social security and other payroll taxes eligible taxpayers would be able to contribute the credit plus up to an additional 500 a year to a new educational savings account the money would accumulate interest tax free and could be withdrawn tax free if used for the child s education , a firsttime home purchase or retirement the plan would benefit fewer middle to upperincome families than the congressional versions , which have higher income limits , but it would be more generous to lowerincome families its savings feature is similar to one in the senate bill cost 702 billion over 5 years , 1761 billion over 10 years college tuition a credit of up to 1 , 500 a year for the first two years of college , starting in 1998 students could receive a 100 percent credit for the first 1 , 000 in tuition and book expenses , and then a 50 percent credit for up to another 1 , 000 eligibility would be phased out for families with incomes starting at 80 , 000 the credit could be taken for expenses after accounting for federal tuition grants after 2002 , the credit would increase to a maximum of 2 , 000 the plan also includes a credit of up to 1 , 000 a year for the third and fourth years of undergraduate expenses , plus graduate school and courses taken by working people the credit would increase to 2 , 000 after 2000 the plan is more generous to students than the house and senate versions cost 345 billion over 5 years , 941 billion over 10 years capital gains taxpayers could exclude 30 percent of their longterm gains from taxation the proposal would reduce the top rate on capital gains , currently 28 percent , only fractionally , to 277 percent , for taxpayers in the highest income bracket the plan would include an exemption on gains from the sale of a primary home up to 500 , 000 for joint filers and special provisions for investment in small businesses by limiting the reduction for toprate taxpayers , the clinton plan would cost the treasury less in later years than the house and senate versions , which would reduce the top rate to 20 percent for all income groups the house version would allow investors to subtract the effects of inflation in calculating their gains cost 71 billion over 5 years , 156 billion over 10 inheritance taxes would create an exclusion from federal estate taxes of 900 , 000 for family owned businesses or farms , in addition to the current 600 , 000 exemption for a single filer on all estates the house version would raise the overall exemption to 1 million from 600 , 000 the senate version would do the same and would provide an additional 1 million exemption for family owned businesses and farms cost 23 billion over 5 years , 72 billion over 10 \( pg a16 \)

washington , april 6 the senate and house committees gearing up to investigate campaign finance abuses seem to be on a collision course as they expand their staffs of lawyers and investigators and plan for televised hearings to begin probably in late may or june , the two committees are issuing subpoenas to the same people for the same documents and intending to interrogate the same witnesses about the same circumstances the lawmakers and their counsels say that some coordination will eventually be essential but there has been none so far , and the committees' personalities and goals are so different that no one on either side has even suggested an arrangement that would be mutually satisfactory this is the first time in the age of television that the house and senate have separately conducted such highprofile investigations of a potential scandal simultaneously senate and house committees joined forces 10 years ago to conduct joint hearings into the irancontra affair a special senate committee investigated the watergate case in 1973 the next year , the house judiciary committee conducted a separate inquiry into whether president richard m nixon should be impeached this time , senators seem determined to have a methodical , bipartisan inquiry into the american campaign finance system we do n't mean this as a game of gotcha , one of the senate s investigators said last week in the house , by contrast , the republicans who control the investigation seem to be most interested in developing information that will at least be embarrassing to president clinton and possibly bring him down the democrats on the house committee are bound to fight the republicans at every turn the different tones of the committees reflect their chairmen the senate chairman , fred d thompson , is a former prosecutor and trial lawyer in tennessee who first came to washington in 1973 as the chief republican counsel for the senate watergate committee under senator howard h baker jr it was mr thompson s questioning of alexander p butterfield , a nixon aide , that led to the public disclosure of the central taping system in the nixon white house in his three years in the senate , mr thompson , who is 54 , has developed the reputation of being one of the least partisan and doctrinaire republicans he is one of only two republican senators \( john mccain of arizona is the other \) who are firmly committed to overhauling the campaign finance system he has also been mentioned as a possible republican candidate for president in 2000 , an ambition that will doubtless be furthered if the public perceives his conduct during the campaign finance hearings as responsible and judicious in his most recent speech to the senate about the investigation , mr thompson said , it is important not only that we be fair but that we are perceived to be fair as we proceed the house chairman , dan burton of indiana , who is not a lawyer , is one of the most combative republican representatives in the years when democrats controlled the house , mr burton , now in his eighth term , specialized in irritating them he questioned , for instance , the use of public money to answer mail sent to the clintons s cat , socks in the last congress , mr burton challenged the clinton administration regularly on whitewater issues long after lawenforcement authorities had decided otherwise , he continued to insist that vincent w foster jr , the clinton friend and adviser , had been murdered mr burton , 58 , also promised a fair investigation in his last floor speech on the subject before congress left for a twoweek spring break but there was an edge to his words that mr thompson did not have i want to tell my colleagues this , mr burton declared as long as i can stand on my own two legs , i am going to do my dead level best to get to the bottom of these scandals make no mistake about it the senior democrats on the two committees also have different styles senator john glenn of ohio , who is retiring at the end of this congress , has always worked well with republicans representative henry a waxman of california is aggressively partisan the staffs are a study in contrast , reflecting the men who hired them for his chief counsel , mr thompson chose michael j madigan , who was his assistant on the watergate committee and who has been involved in several congressional investigations since then mr madigan , an experienced litigator , is a partner in the washington law firm akin , gump , strauss , hauer feld , whose other partners include prominent democrats like robert s strauss , the former party chairman , and vernon e jordan jr , president clinton s close friend the dominant staff member of the house committee is its chief investigator , david n bossie he reports directly to mr burton and not through the general counsel mr bossie has spent the last several years searching for derogatory information about president clinton he was an investigator in last year s whitewater investigation conducted by senator alfonse m d'amato of new york before that , he helped start an anticlinton newsletter and worked with floyd g brown , the conservative gadfly responsible for the willie horton advertisement in the 1988 election both committees face organizational battles after congress reconvenes this week just before the spring recess , mr burton was forced to cancel a meeting of his committee the committee on government reform and oversight because he was not sure he had the votes he needed to prevail on matters like the scope of the hearings and the procedures for issuing subpoenas and releasing documents publicly mr burton wants to limit his investigation to activities of the clinton administration , and he asserts he has the authority to issue subpoenas and release documents without consulting other members democrats want to expand the investigation to include abuses in congressional fundraising , and they want a voice in dealing with subpoenas and documents mr burton will surely prevail for the most part , but he may have to make some small concessions his problem is that a few republicans on the committee want the investigation to appear less partisan than seems to be the chairman s intention his majority on the committee is so small that if the democrats stick together and two or three republicans vote against him on a particular point , he could lose the house committee has a budget of 38 million for its investigation this year and may also tap its 117 million regular budget and a reserve fund of 79 million its investigation has no deadline in the senate , the fight is over 11 subpoenas that the democrats want to issue for the records of taxexempt organizations with republican ties , including the christian coalition and the national right to life committee mr thompson , according to his spokesman , paul s clark , is reluctant to put people and organizations through the expense and inconvenience of answering subpoenas if the material sought is not directly related to the inquiry lawyers for the two parties have been negotiating during the recess , and both sides said they

purchase the seven largest cultural institutions in the county announced last week that they have formed an alliance in an effort to broaden their audiences making up what is being called the att westchester arts network are the caramoor center for music and the arts , historic hudson valley , the hudson river museum , the katonah museum of art , lyndhurst and the neuberger museum of art and the performing arts center , both at purchase college they will collaborate on a cultural calendar and a web page on the internet and will share resources ranging from market research to advertising dollars the move to transform these cultural institutions from competitors to collaborators in part reflects the recognition among their directors that there is diminishing government and corporate financial support for the arts and that pooling resources will save each organization money but as the institutions began to discuss the idea of an alliance and compared their mailing lists , they made a surprising discovery though there had always been an assumption that the groups had a large shared audience , they found that in fact the overlap was small less than 5 percent of the names were crossreferenced on the seven separate mailing lists , said howard herring , executive director of caramoor it was a real shocker , mr herring said not only did we have very little overlap in our audiences crossing over from different kinds of institutions like someone who would visit a historic site and also attend a concert but also even within each discipline there was little overlap art lovers who would go to the hudson river museum might never go to the neuberger or the katonah the same is true with music people who go to the performing arts center at purchase do n't go to caramoor at first the executive directors were mystified by the behavior of the audience they speculated that there were psychological barriers at work that sometimes cause people to overlook all cultural offerings in the county , let alone sample what each different institution is presenting i talk to people in northern westchester who drive past purchase to go hear 'orpheus' in new york city rather than here , mr herring said or they 'll drive past caramoor to get to tanglewood to hear mr previn conduct over a loudspeaker , yet at caramoor you can listen to him naturally in a lovely setting he added that within the county there are also geographic barriers westchester is notorious for its limited eastwest travel which may discourage people from traveling to more than one or two of the cultural institutions in the county but whatever factors were precluding the audience crossover , those forming the alliance began to see the situation as an opportunity there existed many untapped ticket buyers with an interest in the arts it is encouraging to know that there is a market out there that is predisposed to culture and the arts but that has n't yet explored everything the county has to offer , said burns patterson , a spokesman for historic hudson valley the organizations searched for a patron to back their alliance , and att , which has supported the arts in the county in the past , agreed to help not only with the calendar and the web site but also with advertising and promotion our long commitment to the county and to the arts creates a natural partnership in a community where many att employees live and work , said robin flowers , regional director of public relations for att the arts are vital to economic development , and this partnership promises to bring the cultural treasures of this community to a diverse audience each of the seven nonprofit organizations in the alliance attracts an audience of more than 50 , 000 people a year , but none are at capacity the alliance has set a goal to increase their cumulative attendance by 5 percent by the end of this year mr herring estimated that the organizations collectively generate at least 68 million a year in revenues for the local economy the new web site www artsnetwork org is now being designed
an 8yearold staten island boy , who had received a scholarship to attend summer camp , drowned on monday , his first day at the camp , during an outing at a water park in keansburg , nj the body of the boy , raphael garcia , was found at the bottom of a pool , about 10 feet beneath the ends of a pair of beige plastic water slides , by a 16yearold lifeguard who had entered the water to retrieve a pair of sunglasses , said john kaye , the monmouth county prosecutor mr kaye said the lifeguard , whom he declined to identify , did not notice the boy s body until he dove down to look for the sunglasses relatives who had gathered outside the boy s home described him as a really happy kid a cousin , claribel ortiz , said that he liked to do all sorts of things and that he had been able to attend the camp because he had received a scholarship from a jewish charity but relatives refused to say whether the boy knew how to swim , saying the family s lawyer had advised them not to answer and although mr kaye s office , the keansburg police and the new jersey department of labor , which inspects and certifies the safety of rides and other attractions at amusement parks , spoke to the lifeguards at the pool and counselors from the boy s camp , young people s day camps , no one knew how raphael got into the pool or where he had been before he reached the pool at the runaway rapids waterpark that s what we 're trying to track down where was he , who was he with , did a counselor see him , did other kids see him , said james pigott , a deputy police chief in keansburg it s still a very active investigation four lifeguards were on duty at the pool , which is elevated and surrounded on three sides by metal bars , but none saw raphael enter the water , the authorities said brian burns , a spokesman for the new jersey labor department , said that those using the attraction must be at least 3 feet 6 inches tall ms ortiz said raphael was 4 feet 8 inches tall deputy chief pigott said the outing was organized by the staten island branch of the day camp , which promotes itself as the largest private day camp organization in the new york metropolitan region he said the 150 youths on the trip on monday were accompanied by 30 camp counselors keansburg detectives questioned the director of the organization s staten island branch , larry marancz , and three of the counselors yesterday afternoon , deputy chief pigott said he declined to disclose any details of their statements , citing the pending investigation but he suggested that they were unable to tell detectives if the boy could swim the deputy chief said he hoped to learn that today during questioning of the boy s mother and stepfather at their home on henderson avenue on staten island the boy s mother remained inside the house today a friend of the family , susana olivieri , said that raphael s brothers called him nino and that she called him ralphie he and his two brothers were all rambunctious , she said ralphie was the oldest , and all the others followed him he was a friendly kid who always had something funny to say officials of young people s day camps refused to discuss the drowning yesterday a woman who answered the organization s telephone on staten island said the company s lawyer and insurance carrier had advised its officials not to comment the company , celebrating its 25th anniversary , has camps in all five boroughs of new york city , as well as in new jersey , southern westchester county and on long island , according to its promotional page on the internet in the advertisement , the company says it is accredited by the american camping association , provides one counselor for every 10 children , and employs statelicensed teachers and administrators to supervise activities , including swimming , arts and crafts , movies , and educational and recreational field trips tuition for the eightweek program starts at 39 a day , the ad said the staten island branch operates weekdays at a rented schoolroom at the woodrow united methodist church in the borough s huguenot beach area each morning , parents drop off their children about 8 am after a period of crafts and games , the children spend the bulk of most days on trips , including visits to amusements parks , movie theaters and bowling alleys , said ronald cullenen , a trustee at the church parents usually pick the children up after 4 pm the runaway rapids waterpark opened in keansburg last summer next to the keansburg amusement park , which has been an attraction on the shores of raritan bay , on the northern new jersey coast , since the early 1900s the water park s principal features include nine pools , each with what the company calls stateoftheart water slides emptying into depths ranging from 4 to 12 feet raphael drowned in a pool known as megabunga falls it is about 25 feet square and is situated about three and a half feet above the sidewalk the metal bars on three of its sides are three feet high the pool s unfenced end includes a pair of submerged stairways that rise to the pool s edge and lead to other stairs descending to the sidewalk between the two sets of stairs is a little waterfall that drops off into another pool the set of twin slides is at the pool s opposite end both slides are about 20 feet high , with a hump in the middle , and drop to the pool at a moderate angle , similar to the slides common at school playgrounds each slide has its own stairway one lifeguard is stationed at a platform at the top of the stairs and two others are posted at the sides of the pool another is posted near a rope swing a few feet from the slides mr kaye , the monmouth county prosecutor , said the water at the foot of the slides is sometimes mildly turbulent because of children plunging into it from the slides and water flowing down the slides into the pool mr burns of the new jersey labor department said that one of its inspectors , howard black , visited the water park yesterday and had not found anyone , including the lifeguards , who recalled seeing raphael on the slides or the rope swing mr black tested the slides by sending a childsize dummy down them and found them in good working order , mr burns said mr burns also said that some of the camp counselors told mr black that they had cautioned the children to stay away from the pool where raphael was found because of its 10foot depth henry gehlhaus , coowner of the water park with his brother william , said in an interview that none of the four lifeguards recalled seeing the youth enter the pool he declined to comment on mr kaye s statement that a lifeguard diving into the pool to retrieve the sunglasses found the youth s boy s body photo a

indianapolis the question was bound to come sooner or later lute olson sat on a podium , high above the news media , fielding questions , basking in the glow of arizona s improbable ride to the national championship game with kentucky the wildcats finished fifth in the pac10 conference , but in the national collegiate athletic association tournament , they pulled upsets over two topseeded teams kansas and north carolina and tonight have an opportunity to dethrone the national champion and claim the first title in arizona history olson talked about his 13 years at the high school level in minnesota and then california , the climb to long beach city college , then long beach state , iowa and finally arizona the seven pac10 conference championships then it came coach , what about the big one \? you 've never won the big one do you need to win the national championship to consider your career a success \? absolutely not , olson answered , perhaps a bit too quickly funny how one pointed question has a way of whittling that lofty podium down a notch , negating more than a decade s worth of triumphs the question pierces olson s stoic veneer and nicks his recessed ego while his opponent , rick pitino , is the fiery , jetage kentucky colonel and the head coach of the defending national champion , olson is cerebral , distant he wears his ego undercover olson pointed out arizona s recruiting disadvantage 500 miles from the fertile hotbeds of los angeles take a look at how many of those who have won it have won it in states other than talentrich areas , he said you could sense the boredom basketball , as one of the few areas of life with a reasonably fair method of determining good and bad , success and failure , winning and losing , leaves little to the imagination did you score enough points or did n't you \? and how many times have you won the big one \? olson said that winning a championship would not make a difference in how he looked at his coaching career what seems to irk olson is how others the news media , in particular view his career solid but missing the big trophy olson was asked whether he thought he has received proper respect as a topflight coach nerves tightened if i talk about respect , then i become a whiner , olson said then he implored the news media look at the facts , he said and now i'm not lecturing you , i'm not whining i'm just trying to give you the facts to gain the respect he craves , olson must win the national championship this team may offer the best opportunity to achieve the mission the wildcats are looser and reflect olson s best trait a willingness to conform to his talent while pitino forces players into his system , olson adjusts to the players he finds when his team was dominated by talented frontline players , arizona was known as a strong inside team when damon stoudamire and khalid reeves developed into a strong tandem , olson turned arizona into a quick backcourtoriented team this season the wildcats are quick and freewheeling mike bibby can take an illadvised shot , maybe two , without fear of olson jumping down his throat a couple of arizona s players were even spotted out and about , soaking up the final four atmosphere i want them to do the things that are part of this experience , olson said winning the championship is a major part of the experience and for olson the part that will give him the affirmation he wants , even if he will not admit it near the end of yesterday s news conference , olson was asked about a report that pointed out that of the final four teams arizona had the lowest graduation rate olson cited all sorts of mitigating factors none having to do with the university for that he cited statistics showing that all college students were taking longer to graduate he pointed out that players who go to the pros tend to hurt their chances of graduating olson should know by now that these are the pitfalls of coaching in the big time in fact , one could argue that olson , given his program s abysmal graduation rate , owes the university a championship this evening the university apparently does n't demand a 100 percent graduation rate because it realized that in the business of bigtime sports , basketball occupies a major part of the students' time the goal is to win games the least the coach could do is win the big one photo arizona coach lute olson , who has had a distinguished career , considers himself a success \( associated press \)
washington sometimes the news is in the noise and sometimes the news is in the silence if you want to understand what s wrong with nato expansion the new clinton administration s first major foreignpolicy challenge then you should listen to the silence , the silence of europeans on this subject do n't get me wrong , the west europeans support nato expansion , but it s nothing they ever seem to talk much about or debate they treat it as something america will take care of , something america will finesse with the russians and something america will pay for and that s the news the west european states are the ones supposedly most threatened by a resurgent russia , which is right next door they are the ones supposedly most in need of the east europeans' joining nato to create a buffer with russia and yet the members of the european union seem about as interested in nato expansion as they are in the super bowl why \? because the west europeans think the real threat to them is not russia , but eastern europe yes , the poles , hungarians , czechs and others clamoring to join nato are the ones who really scare the eu because the eu members know that russia is no threat to them now what threatens them right now are all those new east european freemarket democracies , whose factories and farmers want to export to western europe at prices that will undercut the west europeans and whose workers all want to flock to western europe for jobs , which would drive down wages russian missiles and russian tanks are a nebulous and distant danger to western europe but polish hams and polish workers are a clear and present danger so nato expansion is the bone eu members throw the east europeans instead of letting them into the european common market , which is what the east europeans really want and need that s what would really bolster their democracies for the west europeans nato expansion is the ideal way to block the east europeans from becoming members of the eu without feeling guilty about it as prof michael mandelbaum of johns hopkins deftly noted we are going to extend the nato nuclear umbrella to the eastern europeans , so that the western europeans wo n't have to buy their tomatoes it s like america telling mexico it can join nato but not nafta the eu assumes the us will just go along with this sham but the eu should take note of some alarm bells that have just been rung here the first came from secretary of defense william perry , who began a farewell interview by remarking to me that the russians are still not on board at all for nato expansion i believe it s going to be very difficult , said mr perry the russians , at all levels , are opposed to nato enlargement at all levels they are still nervous , suspicious and fearful of nato mr perry said he still believed in nato expansion and that the russians must persuade their public that this poses no threat to them but he also argued it was imperative that nato forge a natorussia charter that will provide a framework for involving russia in some nato decisionmaking and therefore calm moscow s concerns a nato team was in moscow monday to explore such a charter but even if it succeeds , the europeans should heed a second alarm from senator joseph biden , now the ranking democrat on the senate foreign relations committee , who says i have serious reservations about nato expansion mr biden explained that he did not object to nato enlargement in principle but he is not yet convinced it can be done without undermining us armscontrol treaties with russia or the course of reform there , and even if it can , whether the benefits to the us will be worth the price he also wonders whether nato actually is the best way to bolster democracy in east europe if we are really going to alienate the russians , he asks , what are we going to get for it \? none of this has been debated by the us public or congress , said mr biden , and until it is , anyone who assumes congress is on board for this is making a big mistake as he put it right now , if i stand up and start talking with my constituents about the price , if i tell them 'we are about to extend our nuclear umbrella to slovakia , ' i wonder how many people in dagsboro , del , are going to say , 'hey , that s a great idea'
alexander schwartz sat back on the couch of his parents' town house on riverside drive and watched as the man he refers to as the camp director guy reached into a large canvas bag and pulled out a stuffed cloth hamburger , plastic rolls , a patch bearing the insignia of camp winadu and orange and green fingernails why the fake nails as part of the sales pitch for the camp , in pittsfield , mass \? when your parents are n't around , alexander explained , you do n't have to clean or cut your nails sleepaway camps like winadu are once again big business throughout the northeast and beyond as far beyond as california , hawaii and austria their rebound , after a lull that mirrored the economic slump of the late 80 s , is fueled in large measure by new york city families seeking a more bucolic , less edgy place for kids to spend all or part of the summer the largest share of the 5 million youngsters who go to day and sleepaway camp each year nationwide are from new york city , the executive director of the national camp association , jeffrey solomon , said it s an urban phenomenon , trying to get back to the country , according to nan rothschild , an anthropology professor at barnard college , who teaches a class on contemporary new york and its neighborhoods it is a pastoral myth when people lived in the country , life was simpler and better it was simpler , too , when there were fewer singleparent households in the city and fewer families in which both parents worked so one could stay home in june , july and august and look after junior but the number of such families has soared in the last few years , as have property values on cape cod and in maine and the adirondack mountains of upstate new york , persuading more than 50 camp owners to sell their properties and walk away with big profits , according to several camping experts that nexus , helped a good deal by the social ambitions many parents harbor for their children , translates into higher tuitions , as much as 8 , 000 for an eightweek session , at many of the remaining traditional camps what does a camper get for 8 , 000 \? lessons in water polo and equestrian jumping , a personal tennis instructor and a hefty charge account at the camp store are just some highend amenities parents are driven and they 're driving their kids , said laurie edelman , the executive director of the new york section of the american camping association , a nonprofit accrediting group , comparing the phenomenon to the parental obsession with enrolling youngsters in the best private schools they think the right camp could set them up for life even the association does not seem immune from the hype one of its brochures on camp selection is entitled , the biggest decision until which college \? not all camps , though , are mini versions of resorts on the cote d'azur the number of specialty camps , including wilderness programs , those for handicapped children and those that require campers to participate in some kind of community service , is growing , mr solomon said many camps charge tuition in the threefigure range and even some of the priciest offer financial aid , especially if some wealthy former camper dies and bequeaths a scholarship fund but highend camps rarely advertise such help and many parents do n't think , or are too embarrassed , to ask for many youngsters , summer camp is an idyllic place where a best friend is discovered , the breaststroke is mastered , the first kiss experienced for others it is a hellish environment fraught with homesickness and feelings of not fitting in unless mom and dad are sadists , they try to choose the first alternative but with more than 4 , 000 camps nationwide , picking the right one can be tougher than the most competitive color war do you want your child traipsing through europe , sleeping in tents and youth hostels , and having virtually no phone contact with you all summer \? or would you rather have him or her waking up to reveille at dawn in a cabin with no electricity , deep in the maine woods \? dr harold koplewicz , a child psychiatrist and the director of the child study center at new york university medical center , warns that the most important thing to figure out is whether your child is ready for camp in the first place see how he or she reacts to spending the night at a friend s house , dr koplewicz advises sometimes a child experiences separation anxiety disorder , which is marked by the belief that something bad will happen to you when you 're apart or that something bad might happen to him while some sleepaway camps take children as young as 5 , many camp advisers recommend waiting until a youngster has finished the third grade and dr koplewicz and other child psychiatrists stress that going away to camp should be a gradual experience while some camps offer nothing shorter than an eightweek session , a stay of one or two weeks is probably more appropriate for younger campers or you may want to start them out in day camp

east rutherford , nj , aug 24 the university of wisconsin s investment in this game did not have to do with the 675 , 000 the badgers received for playing in the 15th kickoff classic the badgers felt a need to buy time , to develop an inexperienced offensive line to block for ron dayne we know we 've got a lot of stuff to do , said dayne , the most productive freshman runner in the history of college football , who had the misfortune of becoming a sophomore dayne was reduced to a nonfactor by the syracuse orangemen in their 340 victory this afternoon restricted by an aggressive syracuse defense and limited by a neck injury that caused him to temporarily lose some feeling in an arm dayne was held to 46 yards on 13 carries , barely a fourth of his average rushing game last year with more than 50 friends and relatives among the crowd of 51 , 185 at giants stadium , the secondsmallest in the game s history , dayne had to cope with the worst game of an already remarkable career and the most frustrating probably so , he said quietly i wanted to do more to help the team the game became a showcase for donovan mcnabb , the quarterback of the orangemen , and a syracuse group that began to replace the painful memories of an 02 start a year ago mcnabb , voted the game s most valuable player , completed 11 of 14 passes for 211 yards and 1 touchdown he ran for 27 more yards , including a 21yard score on an option play mcnabb s 11 completions went to seven different receivers in a dramatic change in approach , tight ends were responsible for 53 receiving yards , including kaseem sinceno s 8yard touchdown set up by mcnabb s rollout to the left mcnabb s precision , his decisionmaking ability and the constant threat of his running were too much for the badgers i could have done better , mcnabb said there were times i could have made a better read if it was a grade , maybe i 'd make it a bminus there were more generous graders in giants stadium he certainly did n't diminish my opinion of him , said barry alvarez , the wisconsin coach syracuse s margin of victory was the thirdlargest in the history of the game for the fifth consecutive year , the losing team did not score an offensive touchdown over those five games , the average margin has been 312 points the presence of dayne , a 262pound tailback from berlin , nj , was supposed to make this game more interesting but the orangemen took those two elements a player from southern new jersey and a big back and created their own advantage kevin johnson , a 5foot11inch junior from trenton , took the opening kickoff 89 yards up the left sideline for a touchdown it was perfectly set up , he said everything was perfect i did the easy part by the time johnson reached midfield , he spotted two badgers to beat but johnson s escort , kevin o'neil , eliminated both obstacles , and the orangemen had their first openingkick touchdown since kirby dar dar s 95yard return helped beat florida in 1991 rob konrad , a 255pound junior and the first fullback to wear the coveted no 44 at syracuse , was the big back who made the biggest difference he ran for 76 yards on just eight carries , including a 1yard touchdown that gave the orangemen a 240 lead with 2 minutes 23 seconds to go in the first half last year , konrad had to deal with a broken hand and mononucleosis today , at times , he was a force to be involved the way i was today , he said , it was a lot of fun was he surprised at how little dayne accomplished \? i ca n't talk for the coaches , konrad said , but i was personally shocked i thought he 'd get the ball more last year , behind a line dominated by fifthyear seniors , dayne gained 1 , 863 yards in the regular season and 2 , 109 over all , the eighthbest total in the history of the college game he averaged 1958 yards in the nine games he started he exceeded 100 yards in a quarter five times he had 52 runs longer than 10 yards today , with three redshirt freshmen playing in their first games in front of him , dayne had none this is how radical the change in the line has been i said before the game that ron dayne is not a oneman wrecking crew , alvarez said he got the maximum of what was blocked dayne said he was not troubled about the number of carries and had reminded the linemen that there were a lot of games to play i did the best i could , he said i saw my line doing the best they could some investments require patience before they offer a return i think the best thing we 've got going for us , said chris mcintosh , a sophomore left tackle and the only returning starter in the line , is we have a full season ahead when syracuse fans look at the same calendar , they see just one top 25 team between now and the seasonending game at miami on nov 29 virginia tech , which faces the orangemen at blacksburg on sept 13 , was no 25 in the espn usa today poll of coaches , though unranked in the associated press poll of reporters and broadcasters which explains the banner that appeared in the upper deck more than a week before labor day just beat miami , it read maybe this year , sinceno said , things are going to go right photos syracuse s donovan mcnabb back to throw during his 211yard passing day against wisconsin yesterday \( pg c1 \) wisconsin s ron dayne being comforted on the bench after a tough day on the field 46 yards on 13 carries \( jose r lopez the new york times \) \( pg c2 \)
a study of children with an unusual hereditary condition called turner s syndrome suggests that maybe a girl s heart really does belong to daddy scientists have found preliminary evidence of a gene or genes on the x chromosome that could , by the most speculative of interpretations , account for some of the greater social skills seen in girls compared with boys , and , by extension , for boys' higher rate of behavioral and learning disorders in a study being published today in the journal nature , dr david h skuse of the institute of child health in london and his colleagues found significant differences in social behavior between two groups of girls with turner s , which results in a child s inheriting only a single x chromosome , rather than the matched x chromosomes girls normally have the researchers determined that if a turner girl inherited her lone x chromosome from her father , she displayed far greater social skills than if her one x chromosome came from her mother girls normally get one x chromosome from each parent , and boys an x chromosome from their mother and a y chromosome from their father turner girls with the paternal x chromosome had an easier time making and keeping friends , were more aware of others' feelings , got along better with teachers and families and generally seemed happier , than those whose x chromosomes were of maternal provenance , dr skuse said among the schoolage girls in the study , 40 percent of those with a maternal x chromosome had been given statements from teachers indicating trouble at school , compared with 16 percent of those with a paternal x chromosome we 've gotten to the point where we can make a pretty good guess of where a girl s chromosome came from just by knowing about her social behavior , dr skuse said in a telephone interview by other measures , including iq and general appearance , the two groups of turner girls are indistinguishable the results suggest that somewhere on the imposing span of the x chromosome sits a gene or gene cluster that has been imprinted , chemically modified so it behaves differently , depending on whether it comes from the mother or the father scientists have found other examples of imprinted genes , but none quite this dramatic the british researchers propose that imprinting has caused a gene to be active on the paternal x chromosome but silent on the maternal chromosome they theorize that the gene somehow influences the formation of the brain s prefrontal cortex , which is in charge of social intelligence by this notion , turner girls with a paternally derived x chromosome gain the benefit of a more socially inclined cortex , while those with their mother s x chromosome get zero dr skuse insists that the findings have relevance beyond turner s syndrome because males invariably inherit a maternal x chromosome , he said , their copy of the putative socialenhancement gene is always muzzled , which could help explain why boys suffer from behavioral and learning disorders like autism and attentiondeficit disorder at two to three times the rate of girls however , he admits that he is far from being able to test the hypothesis , a feat that awaits the isolation of the gene from the thousands surrounding it on the x chromosome those familiar with the latest report were cautiously intrigued normally when we talk about sexspecific genes we think of genes that boys have and girls do n't , because of the y chromosome , said dr shirley m tilghman , who studies gene imprinting at princeton university but this is one of the first genes i 've heard of that s proposed to be active only in females dr david page of the whitehead institute for biomedical research , who has studied turner s syndrome , said that while the results on the behavioral differences between the two groups of turner girls were impressive he thought the researchers make quite an intellectual leap to talk about differences between all females and all males some researchers warned that past studies associating complex behavior with genes and chromosomes had often collapsed on closer inspection dr evan s balaban of the neurosciences institute in san diego pointed out that one of the scientists on the current report had been an author on a study in 1965 linking violent criminal behavior to a double dose of the y chromosome the association proved to be statistically spurious turner s syndrome affects about 1 in 3 , 000 girls born a year the girls are usually of normal intelligence but suffer from a variety of problems including infertility and a need to take hormones at adolescence they are often short and sometimes have an extra thickness of skin around the neck , lending them a football player s aspect dr skuse and his colleagues gauged the social skills of 55 turner girls carrying a maternal x chromosome and 23 with a paternally derived one the researchers asked parents whether their child could be characterized as , for example , very demanding of people s time , unaware of acceptable social behavior or difficult to reason with when upset they put the girls through cognitive and behavioral tests and did the same with normal males and females the reason for the evolution of a pattern of gene activity that resulted in females' being more socially graceful and responsive than males is a matter of pure speculation , scientists said ancestral females may have needed greater social intelligence to compensate for their comparative lack of muscle , while men might have done better as competitors if they were spared excessive fellowfeeling as for the notion that girls are particularly sweet in the first place , their fathers , at least , think it s true
to mo vaughn and other members of the boston red sox , the 1986 world series loss to the mets is ancient history , written by another team in another era and certainly nothing that should encumber them but it has , ever since mookie wilson s grounder rolled through bill buckner s legs and into baseball history , leading to an improbable 10thinning comeback victory in game 6 of that series , a game in which the mets had come within an out of losing it all thanks to buckner , and the cruel fates that dogged him , the error sent the mets on to game 7 and what wilson says was by then an inevitable series victory and though vaughn bravely declared that 1986 is a million years ago just before the sox and mets renewed acquaintances last night in the first interleague game for both , the powerful red sox first baseman knows it is not an 84 red sox victory , capped by vaughn s mammoth 440foot tworun home run off the bottom of the shea stadium scoreboard in the ninth , certainly provided boston some respite from its own haunting history any time you go into new york , it s a little hostile and it s fun , vaughn said i'm just glad it worked out it s a nice atmosphere to play in a few runners get on base and everyone starts chanting and talking trash if you ca n't get excited , you do n't like baseball still , not one interleague victory , not vaughn s 20th homer one of three on the night by boston could remove the stinger that has been situated in red sox hearts since 1986 the memories of wilson s quicksilver sprint to first , of buckner s blank stare as he looked for answers but found none in a deadly quiet visitor s clubhouse beneath a rocking shea stadium are still too fresh and the subsequent losses turned in by red sox teams the good , the bad and the ugly remain too numerous and prominent for the 1986 sox were not the last ball club from boston to make the postseason but as the last three division championship teams from boston can tell you , their '86 predecessors were the last to win a postseason game in october we had our chances , but we 've been swept away three times in a row , said vaughn , who turned in a most valuable player season in 1995 and helped lead the sox back to the playoffs only to see his team swept by the indians in the division series maybe when you play for this team , you just try too hard because of the history and when you walk into this stadium and look at it , you realize the last real chance we had was here if there is a route away from such predestined failure , perhaps it is players like vaughn , like john valentin , like the impressive rookie shortstop nomar garciaparra , who will ultimately turn winning , rather than losing , into an art form in boston vaughn , for one , knew it would n't happen in one victorious night of interleague play nor is it likely to happen this season not when boston is cellarbound and 17 games out but at least he can say that his sox team figured out how to win at shea and , alas , field for there were no errors last night and vaughn , toeing the same infield dirt that buckner did just before wilson s grounder eluded him , fielded his position well as vaughn picked off a matt franco grounder here , a carl everett bouncer there , one could n't help but wonder what might have been if buckner had been merely as adequate surely wilson had to wonder as he watched vaughn from his very special perch for wilson is now the mets' firstbase coach and when not waving runners around , when not coaching outfield play , wilson is thinking about 1986 like it or not , wilson has become the symbol of that mets success , not to mention the most soughtafter spokesperson on the moment so indelibly edged in the collective memories of fans in all honesty , it has become somewhat of a burden , because no one ever talks about what i 've accomplished and what i 've done in my career , wilson said before delighting the crowd of 44 , 443 by throwing out the first ball i'm beginning to doubt that i 've done anything , wilson said so as great as 1986 was , and as much as i cherish the memory , i just wish someone would come up to me once and say , 'i remember you went from second to home on a groundball out' but no one does that but just as wilson s career did n't begin and end on that fateful night , the red sox s history of losing did n't begin in 1986 , either the mets did not bring the curse of the bambino on the heads of the red sox but sox fans have to wonder if the curse of billy buck was as powerful as the the babe s the sox , miles behind the orioles and yankees , know it will take a large amount of rebuilding to come to within one out of ruling the world again when the red sox are the best team in the world , that s when they will win , vaughn said when we lost to the indians we were n't the indians , though , they had that feel about them so did the yankees last year and it s the way the orioles look right now it is probably the way the sox looked before game 6 disintegrated 11 years ago boston has n't had the same swagger since one victory at shea certainly wo n't restore it but for one night , for one red sox team , it surely had to feel good photo mo vaughn , the star of this year s red sox team , helped put some painful memories of 1986 to rest by hitting a tworun homer in boston s victory over the mets at shea stadium last night \( jose r lopez the new york times \)
mexico city , july 10 early last year , a handful of senior american officials in washington received an alarming secret intelligence report on mexico it was on its face , officials said , the sort of document that can force policy makers to change the way they think about a country or a region in a matter of just weeks , the national security agency reported , mexican drug traffickers had laundered some 6 billion in illicit profits through their country s financial system the spy agency based its conclusion on an elaborate surveillance of the contacts between drug gangs and their business associates almost immediately , state department officials delivered an angry protest to the mexican ambassador over the apparently vast breach in his country s defenses against drug trafficking then , however , american officials' outrage gave way to chagrin the agency , they realized , was asserting that mexico had taken in a flood of dollars nearly equal to its entire foreign investment that year without any discernible impact on its economy it just could n't have happened , one official said and he added , you have to ask 'which reports am i supposed to believe \? ' an examination by the new york times , based on scores of interviews and a review of classified documents , indicates that the agency s discredited assessment was by no means an isolated lapse in the annals of united states intelligence on drugs and corruption in mexico rather , as the united states weighed momentous decisions about mexico in the 1990 s from the north american free trade agreement to the 125billion bailout of the mexican economy after a currency crisis american policy makers were blindsided by some important developments , misinformed about others and inattentive to many more after insisting for years that mexican corruption was an old affliction being cured by a new generation of political leaders , senior american officials have begun to acknowledge that the growing power and influence of mexico s drug traffickers have led to a lawenforcement crisis so deep that it threatens the stability of a country that shares almost 2 , 000 miles of border with the united states yet a good deal of the information upon which that conclusion is based had languished in the files of american lawenforcement agents and intelligence officers for years , officials said only rarely did such intelligence command the time of senior policy makers even less frequently did it prompt them to take any action a lot of this information has been out there , in the bowels of the system , said donald f ferrarone , who , before his recent retirement as head of the drug enforcement administration s field office in houston , oversaw investigations that dealt closely with the political protection of mexican drug traffickers but it has been ignored , because people do n't want to believe it , the extent and degree of corruption allegations over almost two years of drugrelated corruption in the inner circle of former president carlos salinas de gortari have forced american officials to rethink the issue the governing party s loss of control of the lower house of congress in midterm elections last week now raises the possibility that mexican legislators will examine more closely than the ever the misdeeds of the ruling elite in recent weeks , senior clinton administration officials have begun to plot a wholesale reorganization of the federal government s drugintelligence apparatus officials said the overhaul will seek to pool some information that is now tightly held by different agencies , disseminate important material more quickly , and thin out a vast intelligence bureaucracy in which different offices perform similar work but many officials argued that the failures of american intelligence on mexico are even deeper and more serious than policy makers have acknowledged and the problems , by all accounts , have been as much ones of demand as of supply lawenforcement agents who worked in and on mexico while mr salinas was a prized ally of the united states said they were often discouraged by political pressure to keep the drug issue from jeopardizing improvements in the economic relationship between the two countries at crucial moments , they asserted , intelligence struggled with policy and policy won for their part , many officials in washington said they could not help but grow skeptical of the intelligence after being deluged with vague , uncorroborated informants' reports and analysis that was either so thin on evidence or so carefully hedged as to be of little use at the height of such problems , during the american debate over the freetrade accord that was approved in november , 1993 , mexico s strategic importance to the united states came into focus as never before the personal reputations and political strength of mexican leaders became central questions of american foreign policy yet in the case of mr salinas s influential elder brother , raul , american investigators did little more than file away allegations that he was not only taking kickbacks on government contracts but cutting deals with cocaine traffickers , officials familiar with the reports said drugenforcement agents said they dropped an inquiry into telephone calls by drug traffickers to the mexican president s offices after they had trouble figuring out whom the traffickers had called

robert prosser , an embryologist at columbiapresbyterian medical center in new york , guards the future children of hundreds of couples he keeps them in a locked room , frozen in tiny straws and immersed in three barrellike tanks of liquid nitrogen the tanks are connected to an elaborate alarm system that telephones mr prosser and others if it senses a slight rise in a tank s temperature a tank of liquid nitrogen , otherwise empty , is always ready in case one of the other storage tanks fails no precaution is too great for these embryos , mr prosser said we treat them as though they are viable developing babies , he said tens of thousands of embryos are steadily accumulating in tanks of liquid nitrogen across the country , an eerie consequence of the recent success of in vitro fertilization they have not been genetically engineered , and they are not clones each is the product of the union of one egg and one sperm infertile women now routinely have eggs harvested from their ovaries , fertilized in the laboratory and then implanted into their wombs many of them deliver babies and , just as routinely , many have leftover embryos , which are frozen and stored but the ranks of frozen embryos raise a host of legal , emotional and ethical questions these questions become even more complex when the people who provided the eggs and sperm for the embryos divorce , die or simply lose contact with the centers where their embryos are stored at new york hospitalcornell medical center , dr james griffo , the director of reproductive endocrinology , has thousands of frozen embryos it s a fulltime job for someone to keep track of them , he said a decade ago , a woman was delighted if in vitro fertilization , an arduous regime of hormone injections and surgical procedures , produced even a few embryos that could be transferred into her womb now , with the success of freezing , people are literally disappointed if they do not have leftover embryos that can be stored , said dr mark sauer , director of columbia s in vitro fertilization program unused embryos can be discarded , but virtually every couple wants them frozen the embryos are , in a sense , a sort of perpetual youth for the couples who own them as a woman ages , her ovaries give out and she can no longer produce eggs that are capable of being fertilized but a woman with frozen embryos can become pregnant in middle age , or even beyond they also offer a kind of immortality they can be stored indefinitely , and they can be a source of children even after a parent has died some women with cancer have stored embryos before undergoing chemotherapy and radiation , which damage the ovaries , causing sterility unlike sperm , unfertilized eggs cannot be stored by freezing them some of the women with cancer have died , and their relatives are now selecting surrogates to carry the embryos they left behind the embryos are cells at the very dawn of human development some are just a single cell a fertilized egg the largest are balls of eight cells if fertilization had taken place naturally , an eightcell embryo would barely have begun its journey down a woman s fallopian tube to her uterus couples have mixed feelings about these microscopic balls of cells when you ask couples , 'how do you feel about its status \? ' they 'll say , 'it s not really a baby' but when you talk about discarding , it becomes a fetus , dr sauer said dr robert anderson , director of the southern california center for reproductive medicine in newport beach , said one of his patients had buried her embryos rather than have dr anderson flush them away but no federal agency has responsibility for overseeing decisions about these embryos so legally , the status of such embryos is uncertain , said lori andrews , a professor at the chicagokent college of law who teaches a law course on reproductive technology one state , louisiana , says a frozen embryo is a person and cannot be discarded in illinois , the attorney general said a woman who had a frozen embryo was considered pregnant but ms andrews said , in most states , the embryo is in legal limbo meanwhile , the frozen embryos continue to accumulate nationwide at the rate of 10 , 000 a year for the past five years , ms andrews said you can quickly figure out the magnitude of the problem , dr sauer said you are the trustee for these embryos you are charged with keeping them forever the centers try to protect the frozen embryos against emergencies , but they try to limit their liability the only thing that could really give us a hard time is fire , said dr griffo , of new york hospital but he added , we have a clause in the consent form that says we ca n't be responsible for every act of god many centers ask couples to pay a yearly fee , usually about 200 to 300 , for storage but few would allow embryos to thaw if a couple did not pay the fee if they do n't pay , i do nothing , dr anderson said it s not like i can say , 'if you do n't pay , i will thaw them and throw them out' dr anderson has 10 tanks containing a total of about 3 , 000 embryos

' said josh greene , 23 , a west virginia senior and city editor of the university newspaper , the daily athenaeum or , they say every place else in the nation must be pretty pathetic for mr hardesty , the ranking was particularly stinging because it followed a swirl of new programs , especially for freshmen , that the university started as a way to improve academic achievement while job markets are growing more demanding but beyond that , many people here in morgantown say the party appellation plays to familiar old stereotypes that have bedeviled state residents for decades of west virginians as grasschompin' , slowtalkin' , barefoot hillbilly mountaineers who drink moonshine and use outhouses take it from the mountaineer himself , andy cogar , a 21yearold senior from gassaway , wva , who won the job last year to be university mascot that means he can dress up in buckskin , lead cheers at university events and appear on post cards i encounter a lot of jokes , mr cogar said you learn to harden yourself , but it does upset me when people make comments about the state i was talking to a person from virginia the other day and he asked me if we made fun of them as much as they do about us we 're the butt of countless jokes the stereotypes linger despite strong improvements around the state in a variety of issues new investment has cut west virginia s unemployment rate nearly in half over the last 10 years , to 58 percent from 98 percent , one of the largest decreases of any state nearly all of the state s public school classrooms have computers connected to the internet the rugged terrain of mountains and valleys has helped turn many areas into popular vacation spots you know , if ucla was named the top party school , people would think they were just a bunch of crazy californians , said gaston caperton , a former governor of west virginia but i think our stereotypes are dying out , and when people say things like that , it s from what they were thinking about five years ago , he said while some people at the university shrugged off the party ranking , some were outraged , and none more than rachel welsh , a graduate student from spencer , wva , who was elected student president in march in the campaign , ms welsh and her running mate emphasized that they were nondrinkers she wondered nonetheless whether that would disqualify them as true representatives of the student body , especially with several other tickets sponsoring keg parties as a way to gather support the welsh ticket won handily after the ranking was announced , ms welsh wrote to the editors of the rankings to question their judgment and to explain how an affordable state university helped her , the daughter of poor parents , receive a highquality education she invited the survey takers back to take a look at the real west virginia university it saddened me , ms welsh said in an interview some people i 've talked to were proud of the ranking until i asked them how they 'd feel if they go to a job interview and someone says , 'i guess you went to that no 1 party school , ' and laughs at your resume then they pretty much agree with me mr cogar , the mascot , said it s most harmful to bright instate students we want to keep our talents in west virginia , but people so often leave if there s any harm at all , it s to the university s efforts to retain the brightest students in the state as a former student at the university and a police officer for 25 years , mr lucci , 43 , has watched craziness come and go these days , he said , students still get arrested for alcoholrelated offenses , like destroying property and urinating in public but with the number of bars in town dwindling to a handful in recent years , the arrest rate , he said , is not alarming since hardesty has taken over , it has helped us tremendously , he said it s not the old days they just do n't party like they used to it surprises me we were no 1 photo rachel welsh , the student president at the university of west virginia , and andy cogar , who portrays the university s mascot , say the university s ranking as the country s top party school is inaccurate and damaging \( ron rittenhouse for the new york times \) map of west virginia showing the location of morgantown stereotypes linger at university of west virginia , in morgantown
vero beach , fla , march 25 howard johnson played nine years for the mets nine years of home runs and position changes and errors nine years of maximum effort and minimum headlines then he faded away , without the standing ovations or a final farewell three years later , johnson is finally making his curtain call in an attempt to win a job as a spare part on manager bobby valentine s bench johnson has 4 hits in 31 atbats for a 129 batting average , and he may very well be cut before opening day but whenever he appears , fans cheer him loudly with an open affection he will always remember , regardless of whether or not he is released on sunday in west palm beach , johnson swung at a fastball thrown by montreal righthander marc valdes and on contact knew he had just missed bashing a home run as his high fly drifted to deep right , however , fans stood and roared and johnson heard the hope in their collective voice they want johnson to succeed and sympathize with him if he does n't , and this touches him this is something i wo n't ever forget , johnson said today as he waited for batting practice to begin i was n't expecting it when i was here , i was just a player everybody just liked , and being gone for a while and out of the game , i think people can relate to that they can relate to someone taking on a challenge and trying to meet that challenge thomas mann , a k a james earl jones , said in the movie field of dreams that baseball reminds us of what was once good and what could be again johnson reminds mets fans of what was once good the dominant teams of the mid80 s and what they want to see again johnson wants to accommodate them with each atbat the only emotion i get is sometimes i get a little bit too intense , he said i want to deliver for them i want to do something good for them people are watching they 're cheering and to do something that would be acknowledgment maybe i'm trying too hard , and that s something i'm getting a little bit better at he is running out of opportunity to show he belongs , with only five exhibition games remaining he sat out the 1996 season after playing with the chicago cubs and , like other veterans around baseball , attempting comebacks , felt as if the game became a little faster while he was away you always feel like you 're a step behind everybody else , a halfstep behind , johnson said it takes time to get into the flow , because at this level everything is so much faster you have to adjust to the speed valentine said last week that johnson can still hit a fastball , there s no doubt about that but that has n't translated into hits and run production for johnson at age 36 my numbers are n't there , johnson said but if i look past the numbers , i think i'm doing ok i'm not doing that badly i'm not getting fooled as much johnson said he would go to class aaa to start the year if the mets requested it , because it would show they see good things in his swing if they do n't request it , he will probably assume some role in the organization , and cherish his last spring johnson leaves tickets for friends , and they all remark to him how he gets the biggest cheers astonished at his reception , he reports the cheers to his wife like those nice things fans yelled to him after he flew out deep to right in west palm beach on sunday way to go , hojo , they yelled almost , hojo keep trying , hojo i'm just treasuring that , johnson said inside pitch mets lefthander bill pulsipher allowed a run in six innings in a class aaa exhibition game tuesday , surrendering five hits , walking none and striking out four his mechanics , which the mets want him to change to protect his surgically repaired elbow , improved dramatically from the first inning to his last he was throwing some balls sidearm in the first inning , said the norfolk pitching coach , ray rippelmeyer , but by the end , pulsipher consistently delivered pitches on a downward plane that s the secret , rippelmeyer said that s something he s got to do i thought he had some very good twoseam fastballs , the best i 've seen him throw he had some consistency by the end rippelmeyer intends to take some videotape of pulsipher and show them to him , to demonstrate the difference in his delivery the mets bashed six homers in a 207 rout of the dodgers with carl everett hitting a grand slam you 've got the wind blowing out and that s going to happen , bobby valentine said dodger catcher mike piazza launched a homer off dave mlicki estimated in the range of 450470 feet mlicki jokingly guessed 600 , 700 feet but it was with the wind he did n't hit it that good photo howard johnson is making a curtain call with the mets this spring and fans are hoping he makes the team \( barton silverman the new york times \)
george sard was scanning the news reports on the computer in his office overlooking third avenue a month ago when a bulletin jerked him up short hilton hotels had begun a hostile 65 billion takeover bid for itt he immediately wanted in on the battle a week earlier , mr sard , one of a small cadre of specialists in financial public relations and merger work , had helped initiate banc one s friendly 7 billion acquisition of first usa in nine days , he would handle the announcement of a deal that would shake wall street , dean witter s 102 billion purchase of morgan stanley and now , before mr sard could think of whom he might call at either hilton or itt , the phone rang it was itt , asking mr sard to join a team to try to fend off hilton like many of his rivals in public relations , mr sard and his partner , paul verbinnen , are riding the trilliondollar wave of mergers and acquisitions that has inundated wall street and american industry in the last two years , though they are more often heard but not seen i'm really quite amazed at how often they show up , said fred seegal , president of the wasserstein perella group the increased level of manda work has given firms like sard a good opportunity to show their capabilities depending on the transaction , financial publicists do everything from writing press releases and coordinating conference calls for analysts to advising on strategy and the proper spin for layoffs and corporate raids they also ply reporters with information that they hope will strengthen their client s case and undermine the company on the other side mr sard s firm , sard verbinnen company , does not lead the field kekst company remains the high priest of financial public relations and crisis consulting , with the fastgrowing abernathy macgregor group taking a firm grip on no 2 but in the four years since mr sard and mr verbinnen joined forces , their firm has jumped into the no 3 spot , ahead of betterknown firms like bursonmarsteller , fleishmanhillard and robinson lerer montgomery sard verbinnen has been involved in four of the biggest deals in 1997 , with a combined value of 30 billion when crain s new york magazine last ranked the top public relations firms as measured by the number of employees , none of these boutiques showed up but their business can be more lucrative people in the industry estimate that sard verbinnen , with its 23 employees , may have billed as much as 6 million last year , more than some firms with more employees plus , retainers for a firm like sard verbinnen can run from 10 , 000 to 50 , 000 a month , while billing rates for a crisis situation or a oneshot event can rival those of the whiteshoe lawyers who charge 400 an hour plus expenses sard verbinnen , which handles a lot of work in financial services but does not show up in the big utility or railroad mergers , has its share of bluechip clients like ibm , aetna and bank of boston but mr sard has also attracted some share of controversy inside and outside his firm by representing joseph jett , the bond trader accused of creating 339 million in phony trades at kidder , peabody company , and the corporate raider bennett s lebow michael ovitz , the onceinvincible hollywood power broker , turned to mr sard in december 1996 when he was squeezed out as president of the walt disney company amid a flurry of negative publicity the two had met and become friendly in 1990 while both were advising matsushita on its acquisition of mca now , mr ovitz wanted to keep from being pilloried in the press as he left disney by mutual agreement with the chairman , michael eisner initial reports emanating from disney indicated that mr ovitz would get a severance package worth about 20 million it was mr sard who pointed out that mr ovitz s package could be worth 90 million in hollywood , high pay equals high status though it s questionable that such information helped mr ovitz s image anywhere else in america , and mr eisner was forced to endure criticism from stock analysts and shareholders for such a grandiose payoff at the time , mr sard was accused of inflating mr ovitz s golden parachute , but on tuesday he was vindicated when mr eisner finally acknowledged to shareholders that mr ovitz s hiring had been a tragic 90 million mistake mr sard said he had been merely helping out a friend , without pay a former college baseball pitcher , who at age 43 retains his love of the yankees if not his fastball , mr sard is credited by clients with an ability to understand the sore points of various constituencies in a deal in the words of one critic , he has an ability to make his clients believe that they are the most important thing in the world to him , particularly when they 're going through a big event he is cool and controlled , a quick raking of his thick saltandpepper hair with both hands the only signal of his rising concern or anger and in a curious criticism from within this particular industry , a rival publicist complains that mr sard has a way of coloring things as his selfinterest requires
less than 24 hours after dickson concepts \( international \) inc bid for barney s inc , the creditors committee for the new york retailer decided the offer was unacceptable and began a scramble for other options , people close to the situation said yesterday dickson poon , chairman of dickson concepts , a hong kong retailing company , said yesterday morning that he was prepared to offer 240 million in cash for barney s and added that he would also offer a minority stake in the retailer s licensing business outside the united states to either executives of barney s or the retailer s creditors the value of that license would rest largely on the prospect of a new store but the creditors , who had hoped that mr poon would offer much more , were displeased the creditors committee is not going to accept this deal , said a person close to the situation , who spoke on the condition of anonymity also facing a setback are vulture investors who bought trade debt for more than 80 cents on the dollar last fall a spokeswoman for barney s said yesterday that the company would not comment until it had reviewed mr poon s proposal mr poon began his initial discussions with barney s in february 1996 , a few weeks after the highend retailer filed for bankruptcy protection , and in october it appeared that he was willing to pay close to 350 million while the other interested parties , saks holdings and the neiman marcus division of harcourt general , would not comment yesterday , there was a growing sense among the creditors that both those companies believed mr poon s valuation was in line with theirs it was unclear whether mr poon would assume some of the liabilities of barney s mr poon said yesterday that his offer had components to please all the parties involved but would not offer specifics of obvious interest to the largest creditor , the isetan company , barney s former partner , is whether it would get a chunk of a minority stake in foreign licensing and what would happen to the stores containing all those armani jackets and manolo blahnik shoes isetan financed the construction of stores in new york , chicago and beverly hills , calif , for barney s and says it is owed millions of dollars in rent for them barney s says isetan s building costs were investments in exchange for an equity stake in the business it is extremely premature to judge this offer , howard kaufman , a lawyer for isetan , said we have n't seen the terms but i do n't think anyone is going to be very excited mr kaufman said , he took a dim view of the possibility that barney s could get a stake in asian ventures through a licensing deal while the creditors could be left holding uncovered claims the idea that barney s would retain that value and the creditors would retain less is n't too attractive , he said the creditors committee s first option , of course , is to wait to see if saks or neiman marcus raises the ante while mr poon s starting price does not bode well for that , the two upscale retailers' rivalry over market share could with saks furiously expanding and neiman marcus gaining on the east coast , each would like to block the other s control of barney s further , the creditors committee may want to gamble on the future value of the saks stock another option may leave out current potential investors the peter j solomon company , the retail investment bank that is advising the creditors committee , is well versed in retail deals and may have already begun pursuing alternative sources of capital as a third option , the committee is said to be mulling over an attempt to convert its claims into an equity stake , reorganize the retailer without outside investors and eventually sell it in the public markets none of this , however , can happen without the blessing of the executives of barney s , who , under law , have the exclusive right to present their own reorganization plan up to a certain time of course , it is possible that mr poon will sweeten his offer mr poon owns stores in hong kong as well as the highend london retailer harvey nichols he also has retailing rights across asia , with a number of luxury brands , and holds a controlling stake in the hong kong and chinese arm of seibu department stores , a large japanese retailer some retailing experts contended that mr poon overpaid for harvey nichols in 1991 , then a motheaten london fixture that was bleeding cash but when mr poon floated 499 percent of the company on the london stock exchange last spring , it sold for about 4 a share , giving the company a valuation of 2242 million well above the 157 million he had paid
an undercover narcotics detective testified yesterday that he had warned several highranking police commanders that his life had been endangered by an organized crime detective who leaked confidential information to drug suspects and mobsters still , the commanders did nothing , he said the undercover detective testified that an internal affairs bureau investigation into the matter was repeatedly botched because the detective accused of the leaks , john wrynn , is the son of an internal affairs inspector after internal affairs prevented the undercover detective from gathering evidence against detective wrynn on several occasions , he grew so exasperated that he wrote a letter to police commissioner howard safir last year , asking him to investigate the matter i never heard back from him , said the undercover detective , who has been identified only by his badge number , uc4126 , and is testifying in bronx state supreme court behind a screen to conceal his appearance mr safir declined to comment because the allegations are still under investigation , said deputy inspector michael collins , a police spokesman a federal grand jury is hearing evidence against detective wrynn , who once told the fbi he had given a headsup to guys in the neighborhood about police investigations , according to police department documents detective wrynn remains on the force , assigned to the property clerk s office , and his father , james wrynn , is still with internal affairs neither detective wrynn nor his father has commented on the charges the accusations about police misconduct and coverup have added an air of cloakanddagger drama to a relatively lowlevel bronx cocaine case and raised new questions about the way the police department investigates police corruption charges the man on trial , thomas tocco , is accused of selling cocaine to the undercover detective on two separate occasions in 1993 his lawyer , ron kuby , argues that mr tocco was entrapped because the police wanted to pressure him into providing information about mario and jack ferranti , two landlords who were suspected of starting a 1993 arson fire that led to the death of a fire department lieutenant both of the ferrantis were eventually convicted of arson mr tocco pleaded guilty to a conspiracy count in connection with the fire and is serving a fiveyear sentence but none of the three men had been charged in may 1993 , when the undercover detective used the street name vinnie to infiltrate the underworld in the throgs neck section of the bronx within weeks , the undercover detective heard mr tocco and his friends brag that they had a friend in the police department , detective john wrynn , who leaked them information about undercover drug and gun investigations , he testified by june of 1993 , the undercover detective said he was stunned to hear one of the drug suspects repeat a verbatim account of one his own reports the undercover detective said he offered to gather information about the suspects' dealings with detective wrynn and was invited by the suspects to socialize with the detective at least three times but an internal affairs sergeant monitoring the detective s conversations via a transmitter forbade him to go and once threatened to suspend him if he attended a meeting between detective wrynn and the suspects to make matters worse , the undercover detective testified under questioning from william zelenka , and assistant bronx district attorney , an internal affairs lieutenant complained that inspector wrynn was once seen leafing through the internal affairs investigative file into the charges against his son but the undercover detective said that when he complained to the internal affairs sergeant supervising the case , the sergeant shrugged he told me , 'do n't take it out on me i'm between a rock and a hard place , ' the undercover detective said after the suspects realized that the detective was an undercover officer , he began searching for an investigative body willing to look into the politically volatile accusations he met five times with walter mack , then the deputy commissioner of internal affairs but mr mack was dismissed before he could complete an inquiry into the charges , the detective testified he also filed a complaint with the city s department of investigation , he testified , but never received a response
a study of more than 25 , 000 norwegian women suggests that regular exercise protects against breast cancer compared with sedentary women , those who exercised at least four hours a week had a 37 percent lower risk of developing the disease , and the more women exercised , the less likely they were to get breast cancer , the investigators found the study follows more than a dozen smaller studies that found a similar effect , none of which , taken alone , was conclusive so , with the weight of other evidence pointing in the same direction , several leading researchers said they would advise women to exercise even though the latest study was not definitive this is a new , quite powerful , piece of evidence , said dr david hunter , executive director of the center for cancer prevention at harvard university , who was among those recommending exercise dr leslie bernstein , a professor of preventive medicine at the university of southern california , said , based on biology , we all thought this should be so , but it s good to see it confirmed although it is not known why exercise might affect the likelihood that a woman will develop breast cancer , one leading hypothesis advanced by dr bernstein and others is that it reduces a woman s exposure to estrogens the idea is that the more estrogen a woman is exposed to , the greater her risk for breast cancer that may be why , for example , women who begin menstruating late are at a lower risk , as are those who enter menopause early exercise , researchers have found , reduces the amount of estrogen pumped out by a woman s ovaries the study , being published today in the new england journal of medicine , comes at a time when women have become increasingly fatalistic about breast cancer with the discovery of genetic mutations in a small minority of women that confer as much as a 90 percent risk of developing the disease , many women have decided that there is little that they can do either they are destined to get breast cancer or they are not and researchers , searching for environmental or behavioral factors that may influence a woman s risk , have looked earlier and earlier in life , with some now saying that what matters is the hormonal environment before birth the exercise finding indicates that there is at least one thing women can do as adults that may substantially reduce their chance of developing breast cancer it s provocative , said dr regina g ziegler , an epidemiologist at the nutritional epidemiology branch of the national cancer institute the exciting thing is that we 're talking about a risk factor for breast cancer that can be modified during adult life nonetheless , dr ziegler and others said , the study is not ironclad proof that exercise prevents breast cancer the women were not randomly assigned to exercise or not to exercise and then followed to see if those who exercise had less cancer instead , the researchers observed that women who happened to exercise had less cancer than those who did not exercise and when they took into account other factors that could have caused the difference between the two groups , the effect remained but some factors , like the use of alcohol and smoking , were not taken into account the researchers , led by dr inger thune at the institute of community medicine of the university of tromso in norway , recruited 25 , 624 healthy women ages 20 to 54 they questioned them about their diets , weights , physical activity at work and in their leisure time , the age they began menstruating , the number of their children and the age when they had their first child the risk of breast cancer increases when women start menstruating early , or have their first child after age 30 , or when they are overweight some believe that dietary fat may also increase the cancer risk the investigators followed the women for an average of about 14 years , questioning them a second time about their diets and exercise habits halfway through the study since norway keeps a registry of all patients diagnosed with cancer , the investigators were able to determine which women in their study developed breast cancer there were 351 cases of the disease in their paper , the researchers found that exercise patterns predicted breast cancer risk independently of other factors that are known to affect a woman s chances of getting the disease those who exercised at least four hours a week during their leisure time had a 37 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer compared with those who were sedentary the effect was even stronger in women who had not reached menopause , the investigators found in that group , those who exercised for four hours a week had half the risk of breast cancer of those who were sedentary in an editorial in the journal , dr anne mctiernan of the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle said that women should exercise regularly with respect to whether exercise reduces the risk of breast cancer , however , dr mctiernan wrote , too many questions remain for women and their doctors to make informed decisions on whether , how and how much to exercise researchers emphasize that a recommendation by the federal centers for disease control and prevention that people walk for 20 minutes a day three times a week may not be nearly enough the women in the norwegian study exercised vigorously enough to raise their heart rates and break into a sweat if you 're going to walk , you have to walk until you 're out of breath , dr bernstein said a leisurely stroll is not going to do it

senior , who has received an early admissions acceptance to amherst college in massachusetts charles coleman jr is young , just 17 , justice joan b lefkowitz of state supreme court wrote he fell in love at age 16 with a young woman with whom he felt he had to speak with day and night by telephone the judge called the hackley school s punishment overkill and draconian and observed that the student s parents had reimbursed the school but the headmaster said the private school should be allowed to set standards of behavior and academic expectations that are not subject to a court s review he also defended the school s position as not overly harsh administrators had originally suggested that the student transfer to another school for his last semester and complete an accredited course of study those credits , mr johnson said , would be accepted by hackley , which would issue his diploma in the spring the young man s parents refused and took the case to court charles was then dismissed from hackley violet f coleman , the student s mother , said why would you want to summarily cut off the legs and future of a 17yearold who misused the telephone \? but mr johnson s response was the student should take responsibility for what he did the moral message he is getting is that you can litigate your way out of a problem if necessary elsa brenner
when r champlin sheridan decided to make a sizable gift to his alma mater , johns hopkins university , he wanted to do it quietly his goal , he said , was to change other people s lives i did n't want it to change mine mr sheridan , a quiet , unassuming man who made his 60 million fortune in medical publishing , added , i wanted a low profile because i almost felt embarrassed by my success the school , though , urged him to go public , and in the end mr sheridan agreed donating 20 million , fully onethird of his net worth and just like that , another anonymous donor was unmasked the overwhelming majority of americans bestow their largess in full view happy to slap their names atop buildings or work a blacktie dinner anonymous giving , always a rarity , is estimated to account for no more than 1 or 2 percent of all contributions over 1 million , and much of that is done for practical purposes , rather than for moral ones but even that silent minority is being dragged into the open charles f feeney , who made his fortune in airport dutyfree shops , is but the most visible current example over the years mr feeney has given away 610 million and has put 35 billion into a charitable foundation , and he did it all anonymously , revealing it recently only under pressure there are many reasons anonymous donors are coming out of the shadows , and they often do so under pressure from the institutions to which they give those institutions are paying more attention to fundraising than ever , and they like the publicity that attends gifts with a name attached public gifts also spark the competitive instinct when people see people they know or know of giving money , it is often just the shove they need to open their wallets , too consider , for example , how the legendary competition between the late greek shipping magnates aristotle onassis and stavros niarchos apparently extended into their philanthropic activities although mr niarchos was not a noted philanthropist during his lifetime , his will established an enormous foundation , estimated to be at least 1 billion , that seemed designed to exceed the one set up by mr onassis one contemporary of the two billionaires , recalling that their rivalry extended to ships , women and real estate , said their relationship was based on , 'i can do anything better than you' whatever the one was doing , the other was trying to outdo e burr gibson , executive chairman of marts lundy , fundraising consultants in lyndhurst , nj , said the recent numbers of big gifts had come largely because some others have been publicized he added , every large gift that carries the donor s name , somebody somewhere says to himself i could do that i could get that recognition , too institutions also urge donors to come out of the closet to avoid losing track of them if the staff members who know their identity , or the intermediaries who arrange the gifts , move on fundraisers also fear that accepting anonymous gifts sometimes lets stingy potential contributors off the hook about 1 percent of the people who give , give anonymously , said marshall rose , chairman emeritus of the new york public library it sometimes seems that all the people who do n't give claim to be in that 1 percent philanthropy has also become much more businesslike so to tap into the psychology of potential donors , fundraisers compile detailed profiles , often inches thick , of their prospects , with data on everything from their stock holdings to their hobbies to the structure of familyheld businesses there is so much more information publicly available , mr gibson said the data sometimes even chronicle who in the family gets along with whom or how much a potential donor s friends and colleagues have given even with all this pressure , a stubborn few donors vigorously avoid the limelight the reasons vary , but the overwhelming one is to keep from being hounded by other institutions , according to a 1991 study of professional fundraisers by indiana university and hound they do in 1987 , when jerry collins , an orlando , fla , multimillionaire with interests in greyhound racing , agreed to give 13 million of his 75 million fortune to oral roberts university , he flew to tulsa , okla , in mr roberts' private lear jet , check in hand after the publicity that ensued , solicitations flooded in soon forming a twofoothigh stack mr collins , then 79 , did not mind the attention but he had to hire a graduate student to help keep track of all the requests others are bashful because they want to conceal their wealth from nosy exspouses , possible kidnappers and , in some cases , their own children mr feeney , for instance , chose anonymity in part to assure his offspring a more normal childhood and some , of course , simply want to do good , with no fuss or ulterior motives but they all meet formidable resistance michael r bloomberg , the founder of his own financial and information services company , was crucial in persuading mr sheridan to come forward as mr bloomberg , the chairman of the trustees of johns hopkins and himself the recent donor of 55 million to the school , explained fundamentally , we are all followers if i can get somebody to be the leader , others will follow i can leverage that gift many times over
east rutherford , nj , april 20 the dance music thumped the beer tabs popped a farewell party of sorts was under way in the nets' locker room tonight , with many of those drifting out of the meadowlands knowing they may not be back at least the sendoff was nice who cared that the atlanta hawks left most of the game to their reserves \? the nets took it , 10892 , tying up a stressful 2656 season behind jim jackson s second tripledouble in 10 days finally , john calipari , the animated rookie coach , could sit down the hawks will move on , meeting detroit on friday in the first round of the playoffs it has been three years since the nets knew what the postseason felt like obviously , i 'd like to flipflop our record around , calipari said but i'm proud that we never gave up on this season i told the guys afterward that i appreciated the fact that they did not fold up the tent the hawks folded up for this one their starters averaged just 18 minutes in a game that was almost meaningless to them and yet atlanta coach lenny wilkens was not happy i was very upset , wilkens said i wanted our second unit to play better they were blown out by the net starters , none of whom was more productive than jackson 25 points , 12 assists and 10 rebounds it also seemed fitting for kendall gill \( 23 points \) and kerry kittles \( 23 points \) to finish strong , both having been steady hands through a season of ups and downs it has been frustrating but rewarding at the same time , said gill , who had a career season , averaging 218 points everyone knows there will be some movement with the team this summer , but i hope i'm here next year but gill , like several nets , left tonight without knowing if he would ever celebrate in new jersey again rebounds sam cassell , a freeagenttobe , is not shy about the salary he has in mind i 'd say between chris childs and kenny anderson money , said cassell , who missed the nets' last seven games with a hamstring strain i would lean more toward kenny s money childs makes 4 million a year , while anderson is close to 72 million per year kendall gill , who played 43 minutes , broke the nets' national basketball association record , set by buck williams in 1984 , for minutes played in a season gill finished with 3 , 199
push here for nothing q some crosswalks in my brooklyn neighborhood are equipped with those little buttons that supposedly change the stoplight when pressed , allowing pedestrians to cross safely but when i press the button , nothing seems to happen , and the light just changes after its regular interval do any of these things work \? a not many and soon , if all goes according to plan , none will , according to christopher r lynn , commissioner of the new york city department of transportation of the 12 , 800 intersections in the five boroughs equipped with traffic lights , only 2 , 500 feature the semiactuated pedestrian signals , as the untrustworthy little buttons are called and of these , only about 1 , 000 still work , commissioner lynn said the rest have been deactivated gradually as the city converts its byzantine grid of independent traffic signals to a timed lighting system , coordinated by computer the idea behind timed lighting is simple , mr lynn said traveling at 30 miles an hour , a motorist should be able to drive 15 or 20 blocks before stopping for a red light timed lights are set to change every 30 , 60 or 90 seconds , depending on traffic patterns , and are designed to allow an appropriate interval for pedestrians to cross at each intersection there are virtually no pedestrian pushbutton signals in manhattan , which has about 60 percent of the city s traffic lights , mr lynn said when the signals , which were first installed in the 1950 s , are deactivated , the city does not bother to remove them or put up a notice the commissioner said that very few are still necessary why not press the button and just pretend it s doing something else \? a remnant of royalty q the elaborately carved pulpit at st paul s chapel , on broadway at fulton street , is topped by a crown and an array of feathers what is the meaning of this odd symbol \? a it is believed by many to be the only surviving symbol of british rule in new york the carved , gilded crown and plumes above st paul s twotiered pulpit depict an insignia of british nobility , according to one peppercorne a popular history of the parish of trinity church , a 1982 essay by john c goodbody , a historian associated with trinity church and its parish , which includes st paul s often called the prince of wales s feathers , though more correctly known as the badge of the heir apparent , the symbol generally comprises a group of ostrich feathers that rise through a gold coronet of crosses and fleursdelis , and dates from the 14th century the feathers and crown caught the eye of others before you , according to david jette , a lay official at st paul s many in the city wanted to remove them when america declared its independence , he said they do stand out a bit st paul s chapel , manhattan s oldest surviving church and one of the city s few extant prerevolutionary buildings , was built from 1764 to 1766 , early in the reign of george iii of england it was , in fact , a small yet sophisticated copy of the church of st martininthefields in trafalgar square in london , which was designed by james gibbs , a protege of sir christopher wren the chapel tower , added in 1794 , was based on designs from a gibbs pattern book the chapel , sometimes attributed to thomas mcbean , the american architect , survived the fire of 1776 , which claimed the old trinity church george washington , no royalist , worshiped in a pew in the north aisle of st paul s after his inauguration at federal hall in 1789 pigeon feeders beware q is it really against the law to feed pigeons \? a only if you 're causing them to gather in enormous numbers we neither encourage nor discourage the feeding of pigeons , said a spokesman for the department of health , john gadd but where pigeons congregate in sufficient numbers , in an area where people live and eat , it can create a public health nuisance , he warned most complaints about pigeon feeders , mr gadd said , are made in the summer , when the health department gets up to 20 calls a week many , he said , involve people feeding pigeons from their apartment windows , which is considered unsanitary where a public health nuisance a misdemeanor under article 311 of the city s health code is found actually to exist , the health department will usually issue a warning if that warning is ignored , a feeder can receive a summons leading to a fine of up to 1 , 000 , mr gadd said i'm not aware of a large number of these fines being collected , he added daniel b schneider
jerusalem , wednesday , jan 15 meeting in the middle of the night at a military base between israel and the gaza strip , prime minister benjamin netanyahu and the palestinian leader , yasir arafat , today finally sealed the longdelayed deal on a partial israeli withdrawal from hebron after three and a half months of allnight negotiating sessions , mutual recriminations and regular declarations that agreement was either imminent or impossible , the end was announced in a brief statement at 2 45 am by dennis ross , the american mediator who cajoled and pressured the negotiators through most of the ordeal with mr netanyahu on his right and mr arafat on his left , mr ross declared , i'm very pleased to announce on behalf of the two leaders that they have reached agreement on a protocol on hebron redeployment and on a 'note of agreement' on nonhebron issues mr ross said the agreement detailing israel s withdrawal from 80 percent of hebron was indeed a fair and balanced approach to dealing with the concerns each side had he added that the accompanying note , which is formally a statement by the united states , really lays out a road map for the future taken together , he said , these two documents represent a very important building block in terms of developing relations between the two sides and in terms of laying out a pathway of greater hope and the possibility of peace in the middle east as a whole mr ross said the two leaders had placed calls to president clinton , president hosni mubarak of egypt and king hussein of jordan , all of whom had played various roles in the difficult talks shortly after the agreement was announced , president clinton said , it brings us another step closer to a lasting peace in the middle east once again , the forces of peace have prevailed over a history of divisions , the president said mr clinton praised mr netanyahu and mr arafat , and he pointedly mentioned king hussein , declaring that he deserved special recognition and gratitude for his work for peace but the president tempered his elation with acknowledgment of the problems that remain in working out final details of the accord and in reaching a lasting peace in the region in short , this is not a time to relax , he said after mr ross s statement , mr netanyahu and mr arafat stiffly shook hands for the cameras and quickly parted left behind , mr ross and the negotiators from both sides embraced and shook hands , quite obviously elated that the long and bitter process had come to a conclusion none of the officials answered any questions from the large crowd of reporters , and no texts were immediately available the silence of the two leaders , and the fact that they met in the middle of the night , reflected the complexity and sensitivity that the agreement represented to both and the bitterness of the negotiations that led to it mr ross , however , described his own feeling as euphoria , and he said later that the atmosphere in the closeddoor meeting was better than that of any previous meeting between mr netanyahu and mr arafat the spirit that pervaded this place tonight was really quite striking , he said it was truly an effort on their part to recognize that something important had been accomplished and that they have to find a way to continue this kind of working relationship having mr ross speak for both recalled a similar arrangement at the end of the summit meeting in washington in early october , when president clinton spoke for both mr netanyahu and mr arafat to prevent a news conference from turning into a rancorous public debate it was at that meeting , called in the aftermath of an eruption of palestinian rioting , that the israelis and palestinians agreed to begin urgent negotiations on concluding the longdelayed israeli withdrawal from most of hebron instead , the negotiations turned into a test of wills not only over hebron , but over the entire continuation of the process of making peace that began under the labor government in 1993 the result was the accompanying american note , which effectively listed the next steps each side is obligated to take under the oslo accords , as the peace agreements signed since 1993 are collectively known israeli officials said that in addition to the public note , the united states had provided confidential letters of assurances to both sides detailing what each expected the other to do among other things , the letters were said to stipulate that israel would undertake three further withdrawals in the west bank by mid1998 the date of those withdrawals , which were supposed to be completed by september 1997 under the oslo accords , had posed the last major obstacle to agreement it was cleared on sunday when king hussein flew to gaza and then to israel to propose the compromise date mr ross made no mention of the letters there was no clear indication why the meeting was held in the middle of the night , except that negotiations had continued through most of the day and this is the muslim holy month of ramadan , when muslims are expected to fast until sundown
pembina , nd , april 26 it has left grand forks a befouled urban swamp it has washed so inexorably over the small towns nearby that officials are proclaiming a 500year flood but here , among the stubborn inhabitants of the oldest town in north dakota , population 642 , the red river may have met its match normally about 300 feet wide here , the surging river now spans 20 miles in breadth as it crosses the canadian border near pembina , having turned thousands of acres of fields into scraggly seas it is expected to crest in the next day or two , threatening to overwhelm the town s levee and already , it has swallowed the neighboring hamlet of south pembina , drowning more than a dozen houses and trailers in roofhigh water but pembina has not flinched even , town officials said , when the united states army corps of engineers told them that it was hopeless and that they should all leave even when some county commissioners advised the same and even when they saw what happened to grand forks , where flooding was so bad that some of the 50 , 000 residents may not be able to return to their houses for a full year we 're fighting for our life that s what we 're doing , said warren hillukka , service representative for the ottertail power company mr hillukka had gone sleepless too long to know what day of the week it was , but he had no confusion about which sandbags were going to which part of the town s dike we 're not a bunch of idiots , he said , but all we wanted was a fighting chance we were worried that if the town did n't survive , would people ever come back \? beginning early last week , pembina \( pronounced pembihnah \) topped its 57foot dike with about 4 feet of plywood , hoping that would help against a predicted crest of over 58 feet and the great sandbagging began town officials figure more than half a million sandbags were used to shore up and top off vulnerable parts of pembina s concrete levee and earthen dikes although the town has officially been evacuated , so many volunteers were at work today that it was hard to tell that anyone had left backed up by small contingents of national guard , coast guard and federal relief workers , some residents continued to pack sandbags some made sandwiches others rushed to help plug a sudden hole in the dike like white corpuscles attacking an intruder none talked of quitting what in hell would we do if we abandoned the town \? asked charles h walker , a county commissioner and husband of the town s mayor , hetty walker it 'd be a ghost town he predicted that if the flood breached the dike , motor coach industries , the bus maker that is the town s main employer , would be out of business for months and might choose to move rather than rebuild and the town would be devastated just as it was about to celebrate its 200th birthday it is expected to take three weeks before the water pressure against pembina s dikes subsides , but friday brought a ray of sunny news meteorologists adjusted their estimate of the expected crest down to 56 feet from 58 feet , meaning the dike was far likelier to survive gregory nolte , a farmer of sugar beets , wheat and sunflowers , broke into a fatigued grin when he heard the news fiftysix ! he exclaimed god , we have a chance ! that s good such optimism was tarnished with caution , though north dakotans are tending to regard meteorologists' predictions with even greater skepticism than usual these days , because initial estimates of the flooding that would hit grand forks proved so tragically wrong in any case , some residents of pembina say , they have been fighting floods for 200 years and have a feel for it that weather scientists lack even if the river rises no higher , the danger remains that the dike will give way but instead of running , anxious volunteers walk the dike , patrolling for holes and plugging them immediately we 've all got houses in there , so there s a lot at stake , said greg volk , an electrician at the motor coach plant and if the dike goes \? we get in boats , said jerry bergeson , a motor coach mechanic and fellow dike walker it may seem a simple task , but if you do n't take the holes seriously , they get bigger and bigger and keep eroding , mr hillukka said he was inspecting a ring dike , a loop of sandbags built around a hole in the dike at the same level as the rest of the wall when the loop fills , the water pressure against the hole becomes no greater than that against the rest of the wall , and the leaking stops the plywood top to the earthen and concrete dams is an experiment , officials said , and the water has yet to reach it to test it out they hope it will not come to that , and concentrate on filling so many sandbags that tracy symington , 17 , said she has started to dream about them i'm throwing sandbags in my sleep , she said , as she and two dozen other volunteers attacked a great hill of sand with the white nylonplastic bags that litter the highways as the evening light waned , some of the volunteers were growing testy from exhaustion , but residents were also allowing themselves the luxury of a bit of hope almost sure now that it would not happen , mr hillukka hsaid that if the whole town had been evacuated , i would have been the one to turn out the lights and say the party s over and sheriff joe martindale , easing his utility vehicle down a highway 29 offramp so flooded that its outlines had to be delineated by yellow police tape on poles , allowed that if the flood does indeed leave pembina unscathed , it was the community that done it photos the town of pembina , nd , is determined to hold back the red river in grand forks , larry julsrud pumped water from his house yesterday \( rodney white for the new york times \) map of north dakota showing the location of pembina residents of pembina , nd , are trying to hold back the red river
springfield , ill , july 29 in an unusual courtroom appearance today , gov jim edgar of illinois testified that he knew nothing about the awarding of 7 million in contracts to a computerconsulting firm whose officials were among his biggest campaign contributors the republican governor s testimony , the first in a criminal proceeding by a sitting illinois governor in 75 years , came in a federal bribery trial in which he was the leadoff witness for the defense neither he nor any of his top aides have been accused of any wrongdoing in the case , which involves two officials of management services of illinois inc but the case has proved embarrassing for a governor who has enjoyed a relatively untarnished reputation in a state known for its raucous , patronagedriven politics and it comes at a time when national attention has been focused on campaign finance abuses , and when some here are complaining that illinois , in particular , has few safeguards to prevent scandals the defendants are charged with lavishing state officials with trips to mexico , germany and the super bowl treating them to beefandlobster packages , and handing them money to spend at an ozarks striptease club in return , federal prosecutors say , state officials renegotiated the company s contract to improperly award them an additional 7 million a former state official who now works for the company is also a defendant the governor was subpoenaed by the defense , whose lawyers questioned him about the regular intertwining of campaign finance and government business in the state the defense lawyers suggested in their questioning and in earlier remarks that the governor s testimony was intended to show that their clients were upstanding people whose behavior was not out of the ordinary in twoandahalf hours of testimony and crossexamination , the governor painted a picture of the overlapping personal , political and professional lives of the state s highest elected official governor edgar said he knew none of the details of the awarding of the computer contract and he said his administration s policy for awarding state contracts is a necessary service at the best possible price he testified in response to questions , for example , that when he attended a small fundraising dinner with the defendants in 1994 at the ritz carlton in chicago , he was aware that they ran a company , management services of illinois inc , that had a contract with the state s department of public aid before the dinner he had asked his aides if there was any problem with the company s performance if there had been , he said , he would not have attended the dinner he testified about the contributions the company and its founders had given his 1990 and 1994 campaigns for governor , totaling 270 , 000 in computer assistance and cash but he said he did not know until he read it in the newspapers that company officials were the largest donors to his 1994 campaign he testified that one of the executives , michael martin , had been part of a group that had given him a personal computer for christmas and that mr martin had visited the governor s office to set it up he said he had purchased a laptop , a computer docking station , , and software about breeding horses equipment worth more than 17 , 000 and that the company dragged its feet for a year on sending him the bill he said mr martin set up the equipment in mr edgar s log cabin retreat in southern illinois mr edgar is immensely popular in this state and is considered likely to win a third term as governor his name was floated briefly as a vice presidential running mate for senator bob dole in the 1996 elections and he is being urged by some republican leaders in washington , including senator trent lott , the majority leader , to run for the united states senate against the incumbent carol moseleybraun senator moseleybraun , the only black senator , is considered vulnerable in 1998 because she has been the subject of ethical questions this week , mr edgar got a democratic challenger in the 1998 governor s race , john schmidt , who might not be well known , but who has strong political connections as a former official at the justice department in the clinton administration and as a former chief of staff to mayor richard m daley governor edgar pointed out today , as he has in the past , that the criminal investigation began in 1995 after his press secretary received an anonymous letter about the accusations and turned it over to the authorities outside the courtroom , the governor said he was surprised he had not been called as a witness for the prosecution in his testimony , before a jury , he answered questions in a mild , lilting voice and made it clear that he was only explaining how government works and knew nothing about the accusations are you aware of any law that prohibits an edgar supporter from asking the state for business \? asked one of the defense lawyers , j steven beckett no , the governor replied they would n't be disqualified if they were an edgar supporter , would they \? the lawyer asked no , i do n't think they ought to be penalized because they are a supporter , mr edgar said is it correct to say that political consideration is something that has been taken into account in awarding contracts for the state \? mr beckett asked a little later i would not say that that has not been a factor in some cases over the years , the governor replied
washington , may 22 as house members packed their bags to leave town , the senate today voted down the last major amendment to the budget resolution as it moved toward a congressional commitment to balance the budget by 2002 with a final vote scheduled for friday , senators killed a proposal to add 116 billion for federal highway projects over the next five years , on a 51to49 vote senator john w warner , republican of virginia and author of the proposal , complained that surplus revenue from the 183centsagallon federal gasoline tax had been used for many years to keep the deficit down instead of being spent on roads the budget resolution , he said , is a broken promise with american drivers who faithfully pay gas taxes and expect to see the nation s highways and transit systems maintained but 35 republicans and 16 democrats voted to kill the proposal , while 20 republicans and 29 democrats voted for it the narrow margin was comparable to the 216to214 vote in the house , early wednesday just before house members adopted the budget resolution , not to add about 12 billion for asphalt another measure , offered by senator carol moseleybraun , democrat of illinois , would have set aside 5 billion in federal money to help rebuild crumbling schools around the country it was defeated 56 to 43 while the senate debated and voted on other amendments , none were adopted except for a handful of almost meaningless sense of the senate statements voicing hopes about the budgetary future for example , one offered by senator barbara boxer , democrat of california , expressed the will of the senate to assure that tax cuts benefit the middle class for most of the day , the house waited for the senators to finish talking , although many members , including speaker newt gingrich , left town to begin the memorial day recess representative gerald b h solomon , the new york republican who heads the rules committee , said the house would accept the senate version of the budget resolution with a few minor changes to avoid a housesenate conference that would keep members from getting out of town congressional budget resolutions do not enact specific tax and spending measures , but they establish limits on the extent to which taxes may be cut or how much spending may be increased this agreement is the fifth in a series of congressional actions that began in 1978 and pledged a balanced budget at some future date the first four of these were laws , but they were not effective the one now under discussion is only a resolution the deal includes 85 billion in net tax cuts 115 billion in reduced medicare spending , to be achieved mostly by cutting payments to providers , and 136 billion in reduced spending for medicaid there is no doubt that the house and the senate will agree after the holiday break on a final version of the budget resolution besides the highway votes , the only measure that threatened to put the two bodies on different tracks was an effort on wednesday by senators orrin g hatch , republican of utah , and edward m kennedy , democrat of massachusetts , to raise tobacco taxes to pay for health insurance for children who lack it that measure was killed with the help of president clinton today hillary rodham clinton , who led the administration s failed health care effort in 1994 , defended the president s action he had to safeguard the overall budget proposal , mrs clinton said at a luncheon he will look for ways to demand full coverage for minors' health
add the new york public library director , norman holman , to the list of librarians who find themselves yearning lately for the preinternet era , when standing up for their institution s intellectual freedom mostly meant refusing to remove art books and controversial classics like catcher in the rye from their shelves things are not so simple in these digital days responding to complaints from parents and legislators that children are using library computers to find pornography on the internet , mr holman recently reviewed several software programs designed to screen out such material and like a growing number of his colleagues across the country , he decided none of them could do the job without compromising the library s commitment to the free flow of ideas i 'd rather be defending judy blume , said mr holman , referring to the wellregarded author whose youngadult novels have been the subject of censorship campaigns but arbitrarily cutting off certain aspects of the internet as an information source , without knowing what it is you 're limiting access to , flies in the face of what libraries have traditionally stood for the existence of socalled filtering programs with names like net nanny , surfwatch and cybersitter that allow adults to control children s activities on the internet is a key point in a new clinton administration draft policy that advocates limited government regulation of the global computer network such technology is also an important part of the constitutional challenge by a coalition of freespeech advocates and technology companies against the communications decency act , a federal law that prohibits the transmission of pornography to minors over the internet led by the american library association , the plaintiffs argued that since the market supplies an effective means of protecting children , the law which a lower court has found unconstitutional is too sweeping in its restrictions on free speech the supreme court is expected to rule on that case as early as today on friday , federal judges in manhattan and atlanta ruled in separate but related cases that the states of new york and georgia could not enforce new laws intended to protect children from computernetwork pedophiles and to bar anonymous communications in cyberspace while much of the public debate so far has focused on parental responsibility in monitoring children s use of the internet , the fact remains that only about 40 percent of united states households have personal computers and an even lower percentage have pc s with modems and internet access but roughly three of every four public libraries have internet access and so , as millions of americans who have no other access to the internet turn to the institution that has traditionally provided them with informationgathering tools , librarians often walk a fine technological line between the rights of adults and those of children as the american library association convenes its annual meeting in san francisco this week , the questions of how effective filtering software is and whether it has a role in the public library have stirred disagreement among librarians who have tried them some say the filtering programs provide a useful , if inexact , way to uphold local community standards but many complain that the programs are clumsy and imprecise , blocking huge amounts of information that is not pornographic while at the same time allowing some pornography to slip through they give a false sense of security because they let objectionable stuff in , and you still end up throwing out the baby with the bath water , said bob smith , director of the medina county \( ohio \) district library just south of cleveland mr smith has declined to install filters on library computers despite protests at library board meetings most of the dozen or so companies producing filter programs use a combination of automated keyword screening and lists of sites compiled by employees to determine what to block libraries have learned that blocking by keyword can have unforeseen consequences when the public library in austin , tex , installed a filter program called cyberpatrol , made by microsystems inc , earlier this year and asked the software to block access to sex sites , it found that the program eliminated everything from information about the poet anne sexton to a site about mars exploration that has the world wide web address string www marsex but relying on more sophisticated sifting by humangenerated lists means depending on inescapably subjective notions of what constitutes pornography one program mr holman reviewed , for example , allows images of swimsuit models but draws the line at displays of lingerie another program blocked access to gay and lesbian information on the library s own web site blocking by category , rather than key words , can help refine the filtering spyglass inc s surfwatch , for instance , uses categories like violence sex drugs , alcohol and gambling but even when categories are used , most software companies will not disclose their lists of individual sites that are blocked , so librarians usually do not know with any precision what their patrons are not being allowed to see
with the summer season looming , hamptons internet web site owners can only hope traffic on the superhighway moves better than it does on montauk highway east end businesses are jumping over each other to establish web sites , spurred by claims usually made by those who design or sell the sites that the internet is a vast new source of revenue others have their doubts hamptons online and peconic online , the two local internet service providers , have both experienced startling growth , their owners said chris hall , one of the founders of peconic , said his company , now in the fifth

, radio stations , restaurants , the hampton classic horse show and the hamptons film festival his customers have learned how to make money on the net , he said , a quest that has consumed the industry of late we have people with unique products , mr hall said tennis east ships tretorn canvas sneakers all over the world sparkling pools and hot tubs makes teak and mahogany hot tubs that they sell from their site architectural details sells highend plumbing fixtures we 've had extreme success the cost of designing and maintaining a web site can run from under 1 , 500 to 10 times that amount , and those who have taken the plunge are faced with additional costs to let potential customers know they are out there rob florio , whose hamptons online has quadrupled in size over the past two years , said that not all web site owners make money , nor should they expect to take real estate agencies , mr florio said for them , it s a very efficient , practical use , but the restaurants out here have missed the whole thing restaurant sites are only useful in a comprehensive format you have to remember this is still an untested medium search engines are tools most internet users find indispensable if , for example , a family outofstate were contemplating moving to the hamptons or summering there , the first stop might well be to search the web for the hamptons a look through the five major search engines under the title yields interesting results web crawler lists 300 entries at the top of the list are wlng radio in sag harbor , the montauk chamber of commerce , george hiene realty , the east end hospice \( a charitable organization \) , and gosman s dock restaurant in montauk search companies say listings are listed at random according to a complicated formula that takes into account key words and often , visual inspections all five of those sights were created by peconic online they look for functional sites , mr hall said it s based on content we 've had success in getting favorable positioning it s a fairly democratic process , mr florio said of search engine placement but i ca n't help but think their heavy advertisers have a little extra going for them the engines would never admit that , though richard law , who runs webhampton , a 'zine database for the hamptons , said a professional web site developer knows how to push the right buttons that generate a high placement on the search lists you just do n't sell a customer a web site and walk away from him it s an ongoing process you continue to work with him to develop it , upgrade it , make it better that s all part of the package many of his sites are featured prominently on the search engines that s the difference between a good provider and a static one , he said potential customers will probably never see those sites far down on the lists and the mysterious world of browserhood yields some mystifying results among those listed under the hamptons were a retirement guide to boca raton , los alamos area businesses , about tampa bay , joanne s homepage she is a 12yearold from ontario who was given the home page for her birthday and the asia carvera archives , which had , like the others , nothing to do with the east end but did offer dozens of completely nude shots of asia her site had had over 15 million hits thus far , not surprising if you 've seen her gary assa , who also apparently has little connection with the east end , also has a site that turned up on the search engine , featuring a shirtless picture of him and his list of my 10 most hated white musicians there have only been 800 hits so far lycos , another popular search engine , had 882 sites listed under the hamptons , the first three being hamptonweb , the bridgehampton motel , and wbea radio excite

geneva many museums are reluctant to lend their prize works of art not so the barbiermueller museum in geneva for jeanpaul barbier , the swiss collector who founded the private museum 20 years ago to house his vast collection of african , indonesian , oceanic and precolumbian art , its principal purpose is not to draw visitors to its small gallery space in geneva s old town rather , it is to prepare ensembles of works to travel around the world the museum is a laboratory where we test exhibitions that we then present on a much larger scale in major museums , explained mr barbier , a tall , elegant real estate magnate as a result , with his 6 , 000piece collection better known in many european and american cities than it is in geneva , mr barbier is playing a major role in awakening new interest in what was long known as primitive or tribal art and is now increasingly accepted as art tout simple since 1980 , he has presented ensembles in more than 50 museums , including the metropolitan museum of art and the brooklyn museum of art in new york and several shows are invariably on the road at the same time african masks , recently seen in munich , is scheduled for museums in austria , luxembourg , germany and france the art of new ireland , an oceanic island \( part of papua new guinea \) , has just closed in paris power and gold , a selection of jewelry and ornaments from southeast asia that traveled the united states from 1985 to 1988 , is now in sweden a new barbiermueller museum of precolumbian art opened in may in barcelona and the art of the southern seas and shields are at the planning stage in that sense , then , mr barbier , 67 , is anything but the archetypal collector who likes to enjoy his favorite art in the privacy of his home yet for all his eagerness to share his collection , his main motive is still to please himself i buy for myself , he said in an interview in his rambling geneva home , itself large enough to serve as a deposit for part of his collection i do n't collect like a museum director who may say , 'i do n't like this piece , but it s important in order to explain another piece' i buy pieces that i like the collection keeps growing because i am a collector and i ca n't stop buying still , his collection is unusual in that it is built on the collection of his fatherinlaw , josef mueller between 1908 and 1930 , living mainly in paris , mr mueller acquired works by renoir , van gogh , cezanne , matisse , picasso , braque , gris , leger , ernst , rouault , bonnard , miro and others when the depression struck , he ran out of money and was forced to sell some oils then , looking for something he could afford , he began buying cheap african art in the flea markets of paris by the time mr barbier met his future wife , monique , mr mueller had long settled back in his native town , solothurn , surrounded by invaluable modern works and choice pieces from his everexpanding collection of african and precolumbian art as mr barbier remembers him , his fatherinlaw was also something of an eccentric he spent little money on himself , wearing the same old clothes and traveling thirdclass on trains he liked to gaze at his art , but he rarely discussed it , and he refused to lend his modern masterpieces but he continued to collect primitive art he collected to give himself pleasure , mr barbier said he collected in the way you marry a beautiful woman you do n't just marry her to show her off at nightclubs you also marry her to have her in your bed josef mueller s artworks were in his bed he was in love with art \( a tribute to mr mueller as a collector , from cezanne to 'negro art , ' which includes works by picasso , matisse , braque and leger as well as african pieces , is at the barbiermueller museum , through sept 15 \) mr barbier said he had caught the virus of collecting at an early age , focusing first on rare books but he quickly fell in love with mr mueller s primitive art mueller pointed me towards oceanic art , he recalled he said 'look , one day my collection will belong to my daughter , but it is essentially african , and there are magnificent things to be found from oceania i'm too old to start a new collection , but you should' i took his advice mr barbier s approach to collecting , however , is more scientific after mr mueller s death , in march 1977 , at the age of 90 , his soninlaw decided to clean up the african collection by separating out some 1 , 200 unimportant objects and sending them to christie s for auction with the opening of the barbiermueller museum in june 1977 , mr barbier also gave coherence to the highly eclectic collection by creating ensembles and backing them up with detailed catalogues written by top scholars in each field since then , he has added some african pieces , and he has more than doubled the number of precolumbian works , although he is proudest of the remarkable collection of oceanic and indonesian art that he has built up now , however , mr barbier is beginning to face a perennial problem what will become of his beloved collection after he dies \? none of his three sons has shown any interest in primitive art he and his wife have therefore decided to sell parts of the collection to recognized institutions as a way of preserving the ensembles intact to divide up the indonesian collection would be like cutting a piece from a gauguin landscape , he said there are five or six ensembles comprising 2 , 500 works of the 6 , 000 total , so my heirs will still have something to play with last year , he sold a minicollection of 276 works of art from nigeria , including numerous benin bronzes , to the museum of african and oceanic art in paris for around 8 million these works , along with 45 from existing french collections , are on display at the paris museum , through aug 18 , in a wellreceived show called arts of nigeria this acquisition not only fills a hole in our collection , but it is also the result of two generations of searching , said jeanhubert martin , the director of the paris museum unlike the museum curator , the collector has the privilege of taking risks , of daring to follow his intuitions , aware that he may be wrong in this way , he is also more likely to choose unique works of art in lending 150 precolumbian pieces for five years to the new barbiermueller museum in barcelona , mr barbier is also hoping that the city will exercise an option to buy them he is still looking for institutions interested in buying other ensembles , like the african masks and the indonesian stone statues yet , for all that , mr barbier continues collecting what is a collector \? he asked someone who buys 10 objects , puts them in his apartment and stops there is not a true collector he s an enlightened connoisseur , a man of great taste , but not a collector a collector is someone who has one million but spends two million , someone who is perpetually short of cash , someone for whom the most desirable work of art is the one he will discover tomorrow photos the collector jeanpaul barbier with a sculpture from an indonesian island \( humberto salgado for the new york times \) among the sculptures from benin in jeanpaul barbier s collection are a head , above , and a soldier , left this ornament is one of the african pieces in the collection among the african

denise stopped me last year near the new york board of education building in brooklyn she told me she was now certified as an elementary school teacher and reminded me that she had been in my class at new york technical college in the spring of 1990 but you 'd never remember me , she said remember her \? i could never forget her or that morning class along with denise , there were 23 women , almost all mothers , most of them from the islands denise herself came from antigua there were four men one of them , ray , complained one day that he had n't read the previous night s assignment because , he said , he 'd been hassled by the police on a subway platform and all because he was black the women had no patience with him they told him that if he had stayed home and done his schoolwork he would n't be getting into trouble no kid of theirs would come home with a story like that they 'd break his head ray was quiet you do n't talk back to 23 women from the islands denise was often late for that class and not until she wrote an autobiographical essay did i find out why i asked her to read it to the class , but she said no she 'd be ashamed to let people know she had two children whose father had left her to go back to montserrat but she would n't mind if i read it to the class if i did n't reveal who wrote it the essay described a day in her life she woke early so that she could do her jane fonda exercises while thanking jesus for giving her another day after a shower , she woke her children , an 8yearold boy and a 6yearold girl , and took them to school it was a rush , then , to get to her college classes in the afternoon , she went to her job at a bank in downtown brooklyn and from there to her mother s house her mother had already picked up the children from school without her mother s help she would n't know what to do after taking the children home , putting them to bed , getting their clothes ready for the next morning , denise got into bed , thanked jesus for another wonderful day and tried to fall asleep with his image in her head the women thought that was a wonderful story and when ray said he did n't believe in jesus they told him to shut up , what did he know \? they worked , took care of families , went to school and this was a wonderful country , and if he did n't like it he should go live somewhere else i told the women they were heroes they looked at me , puzzled you could guess what was going through their heads they were doing what they were supposed to do , so why was this teacher calling them heroes \? to illustrate i went back to another class when this school was known as new york community college in early 1968 the chairman of the english department asked me if i 'd like to teach a class of paraprofessionals i said yes , though i had no notion of what a paraprofessional was i found out the first night of class here were 36 women , african american with a few hispanics , ranging in age from early 20 s to late 50 s most were teacher aides in elementary schools they were hoping to earn associate degrees and , perhaps , continue their education so that someday they might become fully fledged teachers themselves i asked them to write a short autobiographical essay for the second class , and they gathered up their books and filed out , apprehensive , still unsure of themselves , of each other and of me when we met again , the mood was the same except that one woman sat with her head on the desk , sobbing i asked what was the matter she raised her head , tears on her cheeks i lost my books oh well , i said you 'll get another set of books just go to the english department and tell them what happened you mean i wo n't get thrown out of college \? no she smiled we all smiled now we could begin i asked for their compositions and told them i 'd read some aloud the essays were stiff , selfconscious as i read , i wrote some common misspelled words on the chalkboard , suggested changes in structure , pointed out grammatical errors i urged them to write simply and clearly it was all dry and tedious until i told the women that for their next assignment they could write on anything they liked they look stunned anything \? but we do n't have anything to write about we do n't have any adventures they had nothing to write about , nothing but the tensions in their lives , the riots that erupted around them during that time , the husbands who disappeared forever , the children they struggled to raise , their daily grind of housework , jobs , school they loved the strange ways of words one night , during a discussion on juvenile delinquency , mrs williams sang out , no kid of mine is going to be a yoot yoot \? i asked yeah , you know yoot she held up a newspaper where the headline howled , youth slays mom april came and with it the death of martin luther king jr classes were suspended for a week when we met again , i asked for the essays i had assigned the week before mrs williams was indignant and sarcastic look , mr mccourt , when they are trying to burn your house down , you are n't sitting around writing compositions june came , and bobby kennedy was killed grammar , dictionaries , compositions they hardly mattered anymore my students wondered what was happening to the world but , they agreed , you have to carry on education was the only road to sanity when they talked about their children their faces brightened , and i became irrelevant to the proceedings now that they were in college , they told one another , they stood over their kids and made sure the homework was done on the last night in june 1968 , there was a final examination , a college requirement it would be my last class until i returned to the college 22 years later now i watched those heads bent over papers , the mothers of 212 children , and i knew that , no matter what was written or not written no one would fail they finished the last paper had been handed in , but no one was leaving i asked if they had another class they shook their heads mrs williams stood up she coughed , the rest tittered ah , mr mccourt , she said i must say , i mean we must say , it was a wonderful thing to come to your class , you know , because none of us ever thought we 'd be in college and learn so much and everything she coughed again but there were no more titters and we got you this little something hoping you 'll like it and she sat down , sobbing my god , i thought , this class begins and ends in tears the gift was passed up , a bottle of shaving lotion , which , when i sniffed it , nearly knocked me over but i sniffed again with gusto and told the ladies i 'd keep the bottle forever in memory of them the women in 1990 thought this was a wonderful story , too they said the women from 1968 were real heroes because of the way they survived riots and assassinations no , they still could n't see themselves as heroes even denise , looking back from that brooklyn street last year , said she could n't have done anything without her mother , and though she was n't too sure anymore about jesus and jane fonda , that s who the hero was , her mother drawing \( francois avril \)
rye , ny , march 20 the day s work began early , with a video session to examine the sins of the night before after the replays , slowmotion playbacks and freeze frames , the rangers agreed they performed poorly defensively in wednesday night s ragged 54 loss to montreal at madison square garden they vowed to improve friday against detroit the practice that followed today s video session concluded with mildly punitive skating drills everyone participated except for wayne gretzky , who rested his sore groin , and adam graves , who visited a plastic surgeon for treatment of a 16stitch gash in the cheek afterward , the players discussed the sloppiness that has come over them in two defeats this week coach colin campbell said he might change defense pairings to freshen up partners together for too long that might mean brian leetch without jeff beukeboom and ulf samuelsson without aleksandr karpovtsev and they all tried to figure out why they remain in fifth place in the eastern conference , closer to sixthplace pittsburgh than to fourthplace florida one reason might be the play of mark messier , who was a minus2 in the plus minus ratio against montreal and a minus2 against ottawa in the previous game , a 43 defeat although the captain leads the team in goals with 34 , messier has scored just twice since feb 8 he is n't finishing forechecks with the menace that usually makes him one of hockey s most dangerous players , even at age 36 , in his 18th season his backchecking has lacked diligence always a bold skater and passer , he is sometimes taking risky chances that occasionally backfire so is there anything substantive wrong with messier , who stood by and watched brian savage score from in front of the ranger net on the first shot wednesday \? is he troubled because neil smith , the general manager , made no moves at the trade deadline to improve the cast \? is he injured again \? is his impending free agency concerning him \? none of the above , said messier , who seemed surprised to be getting negative evaluations actually , i thought i was playing pretty well up until last night , he said as for the contract bothering him , messier said not one bit i 've been around this game far too long to let outside things interfere with the task at hand do i look sick or something \? am i that bad \? messier bolted from the garden without public comment after wednesday s game he s human , said his friend gretzky he does everything from his heart his heart is on his sleeve we 're not going to let him leave any more games today , messier said that players who make the same mistakes over and over again run the risk of being taken out of uniform it does n't matter who you are , he said everybody has to be accountable you just ca n't give goals away at this time of year it s hard to get them back we have to get real stingy messier said that a coach ca n't worry about hurting feelings by making hard personnel decisions responding to a question , he said he included himself in that statement , but it is highly unlikely that campbell would bench a player of messier s stature , even for a shift campbell s players usually praise him , and he rarely yells at them , but he did when they trailed by 20 at the first intermission wednesday maybe i should yell before the game starts , campbell said i'm serious he again fretted that his job might be at risk and said , i'm not trying to be the martyr here , but the leader always feels it s his responsibility he wondered aloud whether he would be back after three seasons it s an easy change to make in the fourth year , campbell said bring in a new face and see if they 'll listen smith has frequently and recently said that campbell s job is not in jeopardy campbell suggested that losing stirs up the bees' nest of emotion and passion , and that it might have a positive result but he also conceded , the way we 've played this year , at times , it s tough for anyone to have confidence in our team
to the editor t coraghessan boyle is on the mark when he connects john barth s 1960 novel , the sotweed factor , with thomas pynchon s mason dixon \( may 18 \) but he is inaccurate when he says , mr barth invented the poet ebenezer cooke , author of 'the marylandiad' what mr barth did was salvage cooke from the dustbins of history , and then savage him cooke actually existed born in maryland and educated in england , cooke had his flirtation with fame in 1708 when he brought out an occasionally clever , frequently tedious hudibrastic poem called the sotweed factor the poem enjoyed brief popularity on both sides of the atlantic , partly for its humor , in part for its exotic descriptions of life in the new world for example , cooke describes the time he crossed a river s impetuous tides and savage borders by means of such a swimming odd invention , i scarce can give its due dimension , the indians call this watery wagon a canoe , a vessel none can brag on mr barth had a grand time satirizing the neoclassical age s visions and revisions it s a pleasure to see thomas pynchon continuing the march charlie reilly glenside , pa

the country s bestperforming stock mutual fund went on sale to the public for the first time this week , and anyone who wants to buy shares in the fund had better hurry for investors , though , the question is not just whether shares will be readily available but whether the fund can stay ahead of the pack once it loses its special status the tiny 1 million van kampen american capital growth fund , which rose 62 percent last year and gained another 10 percent in january , began offering shares to the public on monday through brokers and financial planners sales will be shut off when the fund s assets reach 100 million , a level that is likely to be reached this week , don powell , van kampen s chairman , said in an interview yesterday how did this newest van kampen fund rack up such a stellar performance record even before allowing members of the public to invest \? through a little known process called incubation an increasingly popular practice in the mutual fund business that is attracting the attention of the securities and exchange commission barry barbash , the sec s top regulator for mutual funds , said that the agency is concerned that fund companies could deceive potential investors by managing an incubating fund in ways that cannot be repeated once a fund officially opens its doors and grows larger mr powell insists that is not the case with the van kampen fund , which he says will be operated in the same manner with 100 million in assets as it was when it had less than 1 million still , investors should be aware that another , much larger van kampen fund managed by the same twoman team last year performed less than half as well as the incubating american capital growth fund incubation is the practice of starting a mutual fund with a small amount of money contributed by the fund company and its insiders , in this case , 100 , 000 contributed by van kampen , which is now owned by morgan stanley company by their very nature , small stock funds have an advantage over their larger brethren , because a single hot investment can have a much greater impact on the performance of the fund s overall portfolio of course , nearly all mutual funds are run with the intention of maximizing performance to attract more investors but the managers of an incubating fund can take greater risks because they know that the fund s record is expressly destined to be used to attract the attention of new investors and that they do not have to worry about losing existing investors if their bets do n't pay off additionally , a single hot mutual fund can draw investors not just to that fund , but to other funds in the same family thus , incubation has grown more popular as competition for the attention of fund investors has grown more fierce van kampen is certainly not the first fund company to employ the incubation strategy the fmr corporation s fidelity investments unit , the country s largest fund company , has used the strategy to great advantage over the years its largest fund , the fidelity magellan fund , was closed to anyone but fidelity employees from 1965 until 1981 though it was open to the public in its first two years of existence , from 1963 to 1965 , few investors outside the company bought shares van kampen latched onto the trend more than a year ago when it contributed 100 , 000 of seed capital to four new funds american capital growth , american companies , value and prospector this week , it brought only one of those funds to the public for sale the american capital growth fund , whose gains were more than double those of each of the other three startups \( none of the four funds are listed in the mutual fund tables in the new york times , which includes only those funds with more than 30 million in assets \) mr barbash of the sec said that the agency has been scrutinizing the use of incubation by fund companies the issue raises some concerns about performance , he said certainly there is a disclosure issue raised if a fund is managed differently when it is small than when it is large and open to the public mr powell said that the fund would continue to be managed the same way as it has been for the past year owning about 55 companies across a range of industries he said that the performance of the american capital growth fund last year was not greatly influenced by investments in initial public offerings , which can bolster a small fund s record quickly and easily mr powell also said that limiting the fund s initial assets to 100 million was intended to let the managers , jeff new and chris perras , invest without being overwhelmed the last thing we wanted to do was to open it up and trash the fund s record , he said but mr powell said that 100 million is probably not the fund s ultimate ceiling we want to get a meaningful amount of money in to get the expense ratio down , but we 're not going to leave it at 100 million forever , he said after that initial capital is fully invested , van kampen is likely to reopen the fund in further increments whether the fund s managers can repeat last year s performance is an open question they were not able to accomplish that feat last year in running another fund that also is classified as a growth fund by lipper analytical services that fund , van kampen enterprise , with assets of 16 billion , gained about 26 percent last year that is not bad far better than the average stock fund which gained 195 percent last year and above the 23 percent rise in the standard poor s 500stock index but well behind american capital growth s 62 percent gain
