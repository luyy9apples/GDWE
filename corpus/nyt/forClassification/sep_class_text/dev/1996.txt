royal city , wash washington is harvesting what is likely to be the state s largest apple crop , using advanced technology and economies of scale that may make the familyrun orchard a thing of the past here as well as in other applegrowing regions in new york and michigan the columbia river basin , in the relatively isolated central part of the state , is being converted from wheat and rowcrop agriculture to more lucrative crops like apples by corporate farmers that are reaping increased profits from huge orchards dozens of young orchards 250 acres and larger have been planted by large fruit packers since the early 1990 s in some areas of the basin , orchards have been planted 1 , 000 acres at a time the orchards can grow apples , especially the premier red delicious , better and cheaper than orchards in other areas of the state , certainly better than other areas of the country , because of the dry pestfree climate , rich volcanic soils and abundant water from the grand coulee dam washington already produces more than half of the nation s apples the united states apple association estimates that the state will produce 94 million 42pound boxes of freshly packed apples in the current harvest , which runs from late august to early november in 1994 , the state produced 92 million boxes new york , the no 2 apple state , is expected to produce 26 million boxes efficiency is the key , said karen maib , an extension agent , who is the local adviser to treefruit growers and who works for washington state university it comes through good management and economies of scale orchards make up 50 , 000 acres of the basin , ms maib said nearly all the orchards are planted to the latest red delicious strains or to varieties like fuji , braeburn and gala experts say it is difficult to gauge how much fruit is produced , because nearly all of it is sent to other regions for packing or processing about half the 350 orchards in the north basin have absentee owners orchards stretch across the rolling desert landscape in long rows of small uniform trees , many grown on wire trellises within a few years of planting , the orchards can yield more than mature orchards elsewhere absentee corporate owners send in migrant crews from the west and mexico to train , thin , pick and prune the trees with assemblyline efficiency the new orchards are in stark contrast to the generationsold 40acre familyowned orchards that prevail in other regions of the state and the nation the sweet aroma of fresh apples smashed beneath the fat wheels of a tractor still blend with the foul smell of diesel at harvest time but much else has changed the new orchards are rarely run by an owneroperator in pinstriped overalls who may serve on the local school board instead , they are controlled by a board of directors , firms of lawyers and accountants , corporate managers and field agents average is n't good enough , said brooke peterson , a former banker and extension agent who oversees several large orchards here he defines an average grower as one who is going broke a good grower , mr peterson said , can produce 50 to 60 bins an acre , well above the state average of 35 bins an acre each bin has about 1 , 000 pounds of apples if he ca n't do that , he added , he s in trouble we 're competing against ourselves and our neighbors anybody in washington can beat out everybody in new york or michigan that s almost a given people in this state have a bullish attitude decisions are made with the help of computers , satellite dishes and internet communications that connect shippers with global markets field agents like mr peterson live in their pickup trucks at harvest time , which continues into november with new late varieties like the fuji washington is expected to produce more than five million boxes of that sweet dessert apple this year just a few years ago the state had none even thirdgeneration growers like todd cowan have rushed to plant factorystyle orchards mr cowan said he could grow apples at a cost of 225 a box , compared with 4 to 5 a box in the old orchard that surrounds his home 70 miles away blue bird , the cooperative that mr peterson works for and that mr cowan owns with 300 other people , is one of the many small players in the basin , compared with giants like stemilt growers , dovex , zirkle fruit , borton and sons , washington fruit and produce and the evans fruit company , all of which have thousands of newly planted acres the orchards are beginning to produce their crops the effects that they will have on small family orchards in other regions will become clear in a few years there is n't an applegrowing region in the world that is n't affected by how things are done here , ms maib said this is a showplace for a lot of people they come here to see how it s done
washington , july 7 as international negotiations on global warming resume , united nations health and environmental agencies are warning of serious threats to public health if actions to reduce climate change come too slowly in a report to be issued during the talks that resume in geneva on monday , scientists from united nations agencies warn that warming due to air pollution could have a wide range of impacts on human health , most of which would be adverse major cities could see thousands of additional deaths each year during heat waves , and tens of millions of people could face the risk of malaria in parts of the world where the disease does not now occur , to cite but two examples from the report concerns about the possible health consequences of global warming have become increasingly widespread among those scientists who believe that the earth s climate will change rapidly in the coming century as pollution in the atmosphere traps solar radiation the socalled greenhouse effect the 262page report is one of the most thorough examinations of the issue to date , but it concedes that the predictions are fraught with uncertainty and that much more research needs to be done at the same time , it warns negotiators against taking a waitandsee approach , since the possible consequences of inaction are so dire how fast to act on global warming is the focus of the latest round of negotiations over what to do about global climate change industrial nations are already falling short of their initial goals , which they established in a 1992 treaty , for controlling pollution from carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases major industries in some countries , including the united states , are urging their governments to take a goslow approach to the problem , arguing against steps they say could cost jobs and growth before the problem is better understood eileen claussen , the assistant secretary of state for environmental affairs and a top american negotiator at the latest round of talks on carrying out the climate treaty , called the united nations' report on health problems another indication that this is an issue that has to be taken seriously and we intend to do just that in the treaty , which has been ratified by 159 nations , the industrialized countries agreed to reduce and stabilize their emissions of greenhouse gases by the year 2000 at the levels that prevailed in 1990 but almost none of them will meet that target , which , according to the current scientific consensus , would not be enough anyway to head off global warming in the united states , for example , where the clinton administration adopted a largely voluntary program of measures to reduce the pollution , greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise every year since the treaty was written in rio de janeiro in 1992 the clinton administration is expected to call for tougher steps to control pollution , but it is not expected to propose specific new measures to reverse the trend until after the november election other nations are calling for steps ranging from increased taxes on energy to global standards for fuel efficiency in a report issued in london last thursday , the world energy council , an independent research group , said that carbon dioxide emissions , largely from burning of fossil fuels , rose 12 percent between 1990 and 1995 , and said that immediate action was required to reverse the trend but representatives of major energyproducing and consuming industries , like john schlaes of the global climate coalition , say there is no rush and that steps to control emissions before further research is conducted would cause grave economic harm the time for decision is not yet now , he said at a news conference in washington on wednesday the new report on the health risks posed by global warming , being issued by the world health organization , the world meteorological organization and the united nations environment program , comes down squarely on the side of those who are calling for early action , despite the uncertainties that permeate the scientific studies it cites a copy of the report was provided an american government official who deals with environmental issues if adverse population health impacts are likely to result from climate change , we do not have the usual option of seeking definitive empirical evidence before acting , the study says a waitandsee approach would be imprudent at best and nonsensical at worst the report concedes that rapid worldwide reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases may not be politically achievable it says that paying more attention to health risks might help galvanize public opinion for taking quicker action some of the research cited in the report , including a study on the dangers of heat waves , was conducted by the united states environmental protection agency it has long been recognized that heat waves kill people , both by the direct effects of heat and by intensifying chemical reactions that form hazardous smog epa researchers studied data from china , egypt , canada and the united states many cities could have thousands of extra deaths annually , the researchers said last july , a heat wave killed 465 people in chicago alone , according to the centers for disease control in new york , where heatrelated deaths now average 320 per year , the study predicted that three to six times that many might die annualy by 2050 , depending on which climatechange scenario was examined even if people naturally became acclimatized to hotter weather , the figures could increase two or threefold , the study suggested the spread of infectious diseases could occur even sooner indeed , there is some research to suggest that it has already begun as a result of recent warming , the report said within five years , the warming of the climate could increase substantially the proportion of the world s population living in potential malaria zones , according to the report , and several other diseases spread by insects or other pests might also become more widespread the report concedes that measures to adapt to a warmer climate developing a vaccine against malaria , for example , or teaching the elderly to drink fluids and mineral supplements during heat waves could help stave off illness but it says these ideas are of limited value , especially in poorer countries , and that in light of these shortcomings governments should focus on the preventive option reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases in the first place

i took the bridge to the 21st century and ere long an antique traveler met i thereon and a glittering eye had he what bridge be this \? the old man asked , but answer i made none much had i seen in travels far and wide of weirdos , and well did i know the folly of looking a weirdo in the eye discretion too i had in measure far too great to reply to such strangers' queries as hast a match with which to light my fag \? and , in the present instance , what bridge be this \? onward i trod , silently anticipating the joy of feeling four years older once the mighty bridge had been traversed but lo ! what light was this that from yon ancient traveler shone \? glittering light it was from a glittering eye , and with his glittering eye he held me ye was asked a question , quoth he is thy rudeness wilful , or hast the cat got thy tongue \? what bridge be this \? be it the bridge that crosses the nile to samarkand \? much did i marvel at his question was he merely a boob about geography \? or was he , mayhap , a traveler from an antique land , to whom the names of gore and clinton spoke not \? was he a man who knew not that this was the bridge to the 21st century , not to samarkand , nor even to storied new jersey , great user of bridges \? so wondering , i ventured to beseech him art thou a traveler from an antique land \? wherefore beseechest thou a question like that \? quoth he long had i yearned , said i , to meet a traveler from an antique land who wouldst swear by his troth that two vast and trunkless legs did indeed , as rumored , stand in the desert aye , 'tis true , quoth he those vast and trunkless legs are all that remain of the great society of lyndon ozymandias asked what other wonders he had seen , the ancient traveler quoth , wouldst thou believe adlai stevenson talking sense to the american people \? much did i wish that he would cease to quoth , for it troubled me with thoughts of the grim and stately raven , which resided on the bust of pallas just above my chamber door and insisted on quothing nevermore , no matter what it be asked great , i wager , must be the frustration such a raven doth cause thee , quoth the ancient traveler you wot not what frustration be lest thou hast spent a presidential campaign with a raven , i vociferated to every sensible question its sole quoth was 'nevermore' when i asked it 'what in god s sweet name can a politician be thinking when he says he 'll build a bridge through time \? ' the raven s explanation was , 'nevermore' yet now , i told the old man , we were on that very bridge four years long would it be , and when it was done , if it were done well , we travelers two would step off it into the 21st century in that case , said he , we 'd better forget we once took highschool literature and talk modern demotic american like whatever , i agreed the ancient traveler was appalled to hear that the american people wanted this monstrous bridge built he had survived many politicians' catchphrases , but none had required him to look forward with delight to getting older his lumbago was already bad enough what was so hot about reaching the year twentyhundred when age would only make it worse \? we 'd get there faster if they built an airplane to the 21st century , he groused be thankful they 're not building a tunnel , i urged he was unmoved when i pointed out that a fouryear bridge trip would give the president time to wipe out lumbago before we got to the millennium i 've survived the new deal and the fair deal , he said i lived through the great crusade of eisenhower and made the scene on the new frontier i watched the great society build two vast and trunkless legs and put a trunk on them , then watched the trunk fall off when nixon tried to make it fly on his lift of a driving dream i survived morning in america and got past the new paradigm without ever finding out what a paradigm is and now i'm supposed to spend four years on this bridge praying they 'll wipe out lumbago before i get off \? this is a joke , is n't it \? these days , what is n't \?
a former president of the national academy of sciences has joined an industry lobbying group in contending that unauthorized alterations were made in a crucial chapter of a recently published united nations scientific report on climate change the chapter dealt with the detection of human impact on the climate and was the basis for the united nations scientific panel s conclusion , stated for the first time , that the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate the critics contend that by making changes in the chapter after it was accepted last november by representatives of 96 countries meeting in madrid , important members of the panel acted improperly those responsible for the report acknowledge that changes were made but they say that far from being unauthorized , the changes were made in response to comments by scientists at the madrid meeting and before then and that the chapter in question was accepted by the meeting s 177 delegates on the condition that the changes be made the critics say the revision removed several passages , including this one none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed changes to the specific cause of increases in greenhouse gases the defenders of the process say that the omitted sentences involved nuances about the degree of certainty that could be expressed and that none of them affected the report s basic conclusion about the human role in climate change the conclusion was included in a summary for governmental policy makers that was approved line by line in madrid the summary remains unchanged , as does a similar conclusion in the underlying scientific chapter but the critics say that the alterations nevertheless underplay scientific uncertainties , and they call into question the integrity of the panel i have never witnessed a more disturbing corruption of the peer review process , dr frederick seitz , who was president of the national academy of sciences in the 1960 s , wrote in an oped article addressing the deletions , which was published on wednesday in the wall street journal dr seitz , president emeritus of rockefeller university , is the chairman of the george c marshall institute , a privately financed research group based in washington that has criticized the view that humans are causing the climate to change significantly peer review is the process scientists use to test and critique one another s work the global climate coalition , a washingtonbased lobbying group that represents the fossilfuel industry , contends in a monograph that has been widely circulated in political and scientific circles that the changes constitute a scientific cleansing aimed at suppressing evidence that would support those skeptical of the greenhouse theory meanwhile , , an opposing view of dr seitz s article held that it just has n't any basis in fact at all and the lobbying group s contentions are just rubbish , said dr john houghton , a briton who is a cochairman of the working group that prepared the scientific report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change , which is being published by cambridge university press all the accusations , dr houghton said , are based on a draft , dated last oct 9 , of the report s chapter on the detection of humaninduced climate change before and during the madrid meeting in late november , he said , many comments on the draft and many suggestions for changes were received by the chapter s designated leading author , dr benjamin d santer of the lawrence livermore national laboratory in california in effect , dr houghton said that these exchanges constituted the final stage of peer review for the chapter dr santer said he had revised the chapter immediately after the madrid meeting to take account of all the comments received , and dr houghton said the final version was entirely faithful to what the group asked for both dr santer and dr houghton said they had never been approached by either dr seitz or the global climate coalition for an explanation when dr seitz was told of dr houghton s explanation for the changes in the controversial chapter , he said in an interview that he did not accept it heavens , no and said he suspected that the chapter had been arbitrarily modified for public purposes both dr seitz and the global climate coalition argue that the net effect of the changes works in the direction of blunting skepticism about global warming dr santer sharply disputes these points none of the changes were politically motivated , he said in fact , he said , he had long argued for a more extensive treatment of uncertainties in the chapter he noted that more than four pages of the revised chapter were devoted entirely to uncertainties , while other references to uncertainties pepper the rest of the chapter the purpose of the disputed chapter was to summarize and assess the state of knowledge about the detection of the role of people in climate change through an examination of the scientific literature
cleveland , june 21 the fiasco considered so probable never developed the yankees tossed a pair of raw rookies brian boehringer and ramiro mendoza to the attack dogs known as the cleveland indians , closed their eyes and prayed that they would sneak through the long day they soared through it bouncing back from a 51 deficit in the eighth inning with seven runs in the final three innings , the amazin' yankees victimized jose mesa and the indians , 87 , in 10 innings in an afternoon game at jacobs field then , emboldened by their comeback victory , they rapped 17 hits tonight and rushed to a 70 lead in a 93 victory behind mendoza s nifty pitching for a sweep of the daynight doubleheader all we were trying to do is hold our own , manager joe torre said then we broke out it was terrific but what could have been torre s most gratifying day as manager of the yankees was tinged with sorrow because he learned 25 minutes before the second game that his 69yearold brother , rocco , had died of a heart attack rocco was a retired new york police officer and drug enforcement agent from flushing , queens his death stunned the manager he watched the first game , said torre , whose eyes were watery and red he was disappointed that we were losing then we won he died after that my wife called and asked me if i was sitting down , and i immediately thought about my brother , frank , who is in the hospital in florida then it was about the other brother it was like someone hit you in the face frank torre , who at 65 is 10 years older than joe , played seven years in the majors , primarily with the milwaukee braves , from 195663 joe torre will leave the yankees on sunday to attend his brother rocco s funeral on monday , leaving the team to be handled by don zimmer , the bench coach , who last managed with the chicago cubs from 19881991 torre said he might return in time for monday night s game in minnesota he was a yankee fan now , torre said of rocco he was a fan of mine the news of his death followed perhaps the most exhilarating victory of torre s first season as yankee manager after derek jeter s twoout , basesloaded single off jim poole scored two runs in the 10th inning of the first game , it seemed doubtful that they would perform an encore but they did the first four yankees slashed singles off julian tavarez to build a 20 lead in the first inning of the second game bernie williams doubled in another run in the second and andy fox capped a fourrun third by swatting a tworun homer for a sevenrun cushion with his sinker finally sinking again , mendoza protected the lead and stifled the indians on three hits and no earned runs over five innings to win his second game after a stretch of four starts without a victory the yankees notched their seventh triumph in 10 games against the defending american league champions this season while improving to 102 at jacobs field , where they are the only opposing team with a winning record the first one is big , fox said , referring to the afternoon comeback after we got that one , we said we might as well get the second one while we 're here the yankees received a decent effort from boehringer \( four and twothirds innings , four runs \) in the first game , and thrived once starter charles nagy , cleveland s ace , was removed with two out and two on in the eighth the yankees scored three runs that inning , yielded a run to cleveland in the bottom of the eighth , tied the score with two in the ninth off mesa , broke the tie with two in the 10th , then hung on as john wetteland allowed a home run in the indians' 10th before getting the final two outs a key play was tino martinez s headfirst slide into first base that saved the yankees from defeat in the ninth jeter , who struck out with the bases loaded and none out that inning , redeemed himself with a basesloaded single in the 10th this team never gives in , said jeter , whose decisive single was his first hit in six atbats everyone thought we were going to win torre compared the events to the two seasonturning decisions in baltimore on april 30 and may 1 , when the yankees won the longest nineinning game in history and also claimed a 15inning marathon all of a sudden , things start happening and there we were , torre said it s like a snowball rolling down the hill the yankees bit into a 51 hole with three runs in the eighth , but still trailed , 64 , when mesa trotted in to handle the ninth the yankees trashed the usual script by loading the bases on two singles and a walk and chiseling the deficit to one on paul o'neill s oneout single martinez flared a ball into the hole that shortstop omar vizquel corralled and fired to carlos baerga at second for the second out if baerga s throw beat martinez at first , the game would have been over but martinez dived across first and was safe to tie the score at 66 i wanted to give the ump a better view , martinez said the view of the scoreboard improved for the yankees an inning later as joe girardi walked and pinchhitter mariano duncan squeaked a single to right poole replaced mesa , but walked wade boggs and allowed jeter s hit the day that was supposed to be a fiasco for the yankees turned out to be one for the indians this , torre said , was huge for us inside pitch scott boras , bernie williams s agent , said that the yankees have not made his client a contract offer since january they offered the center fielder a sixyear deal believed to be worth around 20 million five months ago , but it was rejected williams apparently wants a longterm contract

washington , july 17 of several hundred clinton administration officials who were screened for access to the white house in late 1993 and early 1994 , about 40 had a history of drug use that went beyond youthful experimentation , secret service agents said today the agents told a house panel that the secret service initially rejected passes to the executive mansion for an unspecified number of white house employees , fearing that their drug use would compromise white house security the employees , who were not identified , ultimately got passes after the administration set up a special drugtesting program in early 1994 several of the aides who were considered security risks including people with masters and doctorate degrees had used cocaine , crack cocaine or hallucinogenic drugs within the past five years , the agents said the employees were issued clearances after they agreed to a regimen of frequent drug tests that satisfied the secret service republicans on the house government reform and oversight committee immediately pounced on the fresh details of drug use by white house aides and appointees that went beyond an experimental puff of marijuana in college so all the people with drug histories flagged got passes \? said representative thomas m davis 3d , republican of virginia yes , replied arnold a cole , a former supervisor of the secret service s white house control operations , adding that those issues were mitigated such republican complaints about drug use are not new in 1994 , shortly before he became speaker , representative newt gingrich asserted that many white house employees had used drugs before working for the clinton administration mr gingrich , who made his remarks in an appearance on the nbc news program meet the press , said , i had a senior lawenforcement official tell me that in his judgment , up to a quarter of the white house staff , when they first came in , had used drugs in the last four or five years the new details came two days after the white house disclosed that the secret service ordered stepped up drug testing two years ago on 21 white house employees who admitted in questionnaires to more than experimental dalliances with marijuana nine of the employees , none at a senior level , still work at the white house and must undergo random testing twice a year the 12 others have left for other jobs in the past three years today s disclosures , in agents' testimony and in sworn depositions made public , appear to open another broad avenue of attack for republicans who are lambasting the white house for improperly acquiring confidential personnel files on nearly 900 people , including many prominent officials in the reagan and bush administrations the white house today sought to draw a clear distinction between the dalliances with recreational drugs many aides in their 20 s and 30 s may have had before joining the administration in 1993 , and president clinton s ironclad policies now the president is very clear , said michael d mccurry , the white house spokesman he has an absolute zerotolerance standard for drug use at the white house and that , i want to make very clear , has been maintained while he has been here new employees must submit to drug tests , and all employees are subject to random testing , and that happens with 12 percent of the white house staff each year , mr mccurry said mr mccurry said two longstanding career employees had failed the random tests and had been dismissed mr mccurry even volunteered that he had smoked marijuana from time to time in the 1970 s the point is , if i use drugs now , in any shape or form , i'm gone , i'm history , said mr mccurry , who is 41 about 1 , 700 people work at the white house , from gardeners and clerks to mr clinton s top aides none of the top aides 24 assistants to the president , 30 deputy assistants and 75 special assistants were among the 21 people involved in the steppedup drug tests , the white house said this week much of today s hearing centered on the sworn testimony that secret service agents gave to committee aides on july 10 jeff undercoffer , an agent assigned to the white house to review federal bureau of investigation background files on aides seeking permanent white house passes , recalled i have reviewed literally hundreds of background investigations i would say more than 30 , more than 40 , perhaps , had drug usage i have seen cocaine usage , mr undercoffer said i have seen hallucinogenic usages , crack usages mr undercoffer and mr cole said there were several instances of recent drug use , which mr cole defined as within the past five years photo testifying before a house panel yesterday were , at center , john libonati , director of the office of inspection and congressional affairs , and two secret service agents , jeffrey undercoffer , left , and arnold cole \( kirsten elstner for the new york times \)

very near the end of the west , an epic documentary about how the american frontier was settled and how its myths took shape , there is a brief but extraordinary piece of early film actual scenes from buffalo bill s wild west show here are glimpses of the fabulously successful entertainment that the western scout and showman buffalo bill cody staged for 30 years in the middle of an arena , indians with elaborate headdresses ride wildly after soldiers and around tepees , recreating the battle of the little big horn a cowboy shoots at several massive buffaloes as enthralled schoolchildren cheer from the bleachers buffalo bill himself , white hair flowing , rides into view carrying the american flag and takes a bow here , in film shot in 1908 , are the same images baby boomers grew up watching in fictional form , in movies and on television , half a century later that tiny bit of film is one of the first genuine westerns , its images among the most enduring in american culture today , of course , the television western is as dead as if it had been gunned down on the streets of dodge from the mid1950 s through the mid60 s , westerns like gunsmoke , wagon train and bonanza dominated television , and many of those classics can still be found on nostalgia channels on cable but among current shows , the closest any major network comes to a western is cbs s pallid dr quinn , medicine woman , with its veneer of 1990 s sensitivity troweled onto a frontier setting the myth itself is not dead it is constantly being reinvented in movies in the 1990 s , there have been redemptive westerns like dances with wolves , revisionist westerns like unforgiven , feminist westerns , africanamerican westerns , poetic westerns but none of that interest has spilled over into television , which has n't had a hit western in decades what killed the television western \? the west , a 12 1 2hour , 8part series that begins tonight at 8 on pbs and runs through tuesday , sept 24 , is fiercely and brilliantly rooted in fact but it throws some light on that curious question directed by stephen ives and produced by ken burns , the west uses a style made familiar in mr burns s civil war series history built around personal narratives , rich with archival photographs and letters in enthralling detail it explores the daytoday reality of disappointed gold rushers , stubborn cattle drivers and displaced american indians and underlying it all is a profound sense of how the old myths the gunslinging marshals and get out of dodge morality that television cherished have become inadequate , even in fiction in the popular imagination , the west used to be a wilderness of endless possibility and freedom , conquered by brave white men in the last few decades , it has become a lost eden where cowardly white men slaughtered the indians and stole their land the west demonstrates that there is truth in both those ideas by the time buffalo bill s wild west turns up in the documentary \( in the nexttolast episode , on sept 23 \) the point has been made the myth of the american west , a florid hybrid of fact and fiction , was never as simple as it once seemed the death of the traditional television western is a complicated historical matter , too there are practical causes television advertisers' desire to reach a specific audience \( younger viewers , the ones least likely to go for an aging genre like the western \) the divergent creative paths taken by movies and television series but the more philosophical and perhaps more basic reason echoes the very issue the west explores so eloquently after the social upheavals of the 1960 s , which have reached into the morally sensitive 90 s , the old myth of the west has lost its apparent simplicity and innocence unwilling to grapple with a more complicated , darker version , television has abandoned it to the movies it was during a more oblivious , less questioning period in american history that the imagery flourished on television within a twoweek period in 1955 , gunsmoke , cheyenne and the life and legend of wyatt earp had their premieres before long , the primetime schedule was cluttered with immensely popular shows like the rifleman , have gun , will travel , rawhide and maverick in the 195859 season , four of the five toprated shows were westerns gunsmoke would last for 20 years and bonanza for 14 at the start when gene autry and roy rogers were being transformed from movie cowboys to kiddytelevision stars there was such a strong link between western films and television that john wayne was asked to play matt dillon in gunsmoke it was wayne who suggested james arness for the role , and wayne who appeared on screen to introduce the series , bringing a western hero s seal of approval to television the appeal of those early shows was the same as that of western films adventure , in which the good guys beat the bad in the gunsmoke premiere , marshal dillon faces a gunslinger who is wanted for killing an unarmed man matt does n't want to shoot him , but the outlaw resists arrest and insists on a showdown in the street he s a gunman , doc , matt says he has got to be eliminated a marshal was always a moral touchstone
wilmington , del , may 8 on the cloudy and chilly eve of the mcdonald s lpga championship almost a year to the day from what has come to be known as the ben wright incident the ladies professional golf association has a clear strategy simply put , the organization wants to bury the entire issue permanently beneath a blizzard of positive news about its present , bright forecasts for its future and just the slightest hint of levity about its past hello , everybody and welcome to the anniversary , lpga commissioner jim ritts said at the dupont country club this morning , pausing for effect before adding , kelly robbins won this tournament last year for those of you who missed that ritts was n't trying to trivialize the issue , merely to redirect the focus the real occasion for his news conference , of course , was to address the state of the lpga on the anniversary of the interview by wright , the former cbs golf commentator , with valerie helmbreck , a local reporter that interview , and the spate of stories it spawned , sent shockwaves through the women s game it ultimately cost wright his job , caused the network to do some corporate soulsearching and put helmbreck through what she called a year of hell ironically , it might also have benefited the lpga , which finds itself in the midst of resurgent fan interest , growing purses , more television exposure and increasing sponsorship it is difficult to pinpoint how much of this is attributable to fallout from the wright interview in the newsjournal of wilmington in which he was quoted , in part , as saying that lesbians in the sport hurt women s golf , and that the lpga is going to a butch game and that furthers the bad image of the game ritts believes that some of it is i do n't think anybody would ever have elected for this to be a tactic , a way to create a reason for the players to circle the wagons and rediscover a sense of family , he said but one of the benefits is that , out of this , the health of the lpga had a chance , in a very elevated way , to be discussed and in its own odd way , it did turn out to be a positive , a rallying point for our players and it gave the outside world a chance to look at our tour it took something as absurd as this but something good came out of it for the lpga , the greatest good might have been the devaluing of what it euphemistically used to call the life style issue in march , an lpga player , muffin spencerdevlin , disclosed her lesbianism in a sports illustrated article the story barely caused a ripple spencerdevlin was not abandoned by any of her sponsors , and none left the lpga there was a little bit of chicken little to all of this , people saying , 'if a player comes out on the lpga , the sky s gonna fall , the sky s gonna fall , ' ritts said well , we all woke up the next morning , the sun was shining , our business was healthy , we just signed another deal and on we went the fact that there is somebody who is gay who is part of our society simply is not news anymore what is news , on the lpga tour , is that it is growing there are five more tournaments on the tour this year than there were last year purses went up 2 million , to 265 million , and projections for next year are for another 25 million in growth the tour has added the 700 , 000 seasonending itt tour championship and will announce two more new tournaments within the next two weeks promising new stars , like annika sorenstam , last year s player of the year , and robbins , the defending champion , and the 21yearold rookie sensation karrie webb , who has already won twice this year , are creating a buzz i think the fans are saying , 'just let 'em play golf and let it be , ' said robbins another positive to come out of the whole affair is that it caused wright , 63 , to seek help for a lifelong drinking problem his drinking has never been a secret , and it was believed to be a factor in his accusation in the sports illustrated article that ultimately got him fired that helmbreck is a lesbian she is not with an agenda , and that she was out to get him wright just finished a fourweek treatment at the betty ford center in rancho mirage , calif , and has returned to his home in flat rock , nc , where he was not available for comment there was some speculation that wright , who is still under contract to cbs , may ultimately return to work at the network frank chirkinian , a cbs producer , said in a published report tuesday that he would like to see wright back on the air ritts countered that he ca n't see a time when ben wright would be associated with an lpga event , and david kenin , the president of cbs sports , concurred frank s position is not the position of the company , kenin said the fact of the matter is that there are no plans at this time to do anything with ben on television helmbreck , who is still pondering legal action against cbs for defamation of character , has decidedly mixed feelings there is irritation that the lpga never contacted or supported her during the affair or afterward , but there is no lingering bitterness directed at wright i feel sorry for him , she said there is a small measure of satisfaction for the apparent closing of the incident , but no sense of bitterness or any feeling of vindication i 've never felt vindicated because i 've never needed to be vindicated , she said i knew what happened i knew it was true , i knew it was honest one year later a man has been fired and has gone through rehabilitation a woman who was castigated by a network and whose credibility was publicly attacked has been upheld a tour that was portrayed as being on shaky ground has been shown to be healthier than ever if i thought that i went through what i went through the past year and it was a bad thing for everybody , i think i 'd be really , really , really depressed , helmbreck said a guy got help for a problem he s had for a long time the lpga discussed an issue they 've been reluctant to deal with and feel good it s behind them and i feel like finally i have my reputation back photo ben wright , whose criticism on television of female pro golfers cost him his job , has been released from an alcohol rehabilitation program \( associated press \)
patrick ewing was in a playful mood sunday night and no one was spared his comedic barbs before the game against the grizzlies , he tossed green grapes across the locker room , finally nailing herb williams in the corner after the knicks had easily dispatched vancouver to finish their western road swing at 30 , he took his turn razzing teammates although ewing is often quiet and reclusive when the locker room is full of members of the news media , no one within 10 yards of him sunday could speak without him interrupting them what are you two clowns gossiping about \? to be sure , ewing s declining status as a national basketball association center at 34 years old was not the topic he averaged 246 points , 146 rebounds and 23 blocked shots in victories over the warriors , clippers and grizzlies none of the centers he faced on the trip todd fuller of the warriors , stanley roberts and kevin duckworth of the clippers and bryant reeves of the grizzles have a dream shake move in their offensive arsenal but ewing proved that he is still capable of carrying the team offensively , even with larry johnson and allan houston added to the mix i thought we accomplished what we set out to do , ewing said after the 10192 victory that improved the knicks' record to 51 the same can be said for the franchise center , who , in a new motion offense , is moving much better than many observers expected over all , he is averaging 215 points a game , 10 rebounds and 16 blocked shots no worries for houston allan houston would not characterize his fieldgoal percentage as a disappointment , but he is definitely in a slump he made only 8 of 30 shots \( 26 percent \) in three games out west spraining his left ankle in the first game against golden state and aggravating it against the clippers was partly to blame in six games , houston is shooting less than 38 percent from the field \( 28 of 74 \) for his career , he has shot nearly 45 percent he has had several strong performances , and has made 11 of 21 3pointers you do n't worry when you 're not shooting well , houston said after playing only 19 minutes against vancouver and shooting 3 for 8 you do n't want to pass up shots i always feel confident when i'm shooting calling on brooks with charlie ward bruised and sore on sunday , scott brooks showed why a competent backup point guard cannot be discounted , no matter how small in stature he may seem brooks , the 5foot11inch veteran acquired after chris childs went down with fractured right fibula in october , played 22 turnoverfree minutes against the grizzlies he hit 3 of 5 shots from the field , contributed 3 assists and even got into a verbal sparring match with the former knick greg anthony i think they know what i'm capable of , said brooks , who has played in four games and has a 105 turnovertoassist ratio this team can use a guy like me to create good chemistry i hope i do n't sound like i'm promoting myself
while reading a newspaper in the summer , the director of republic airport in farmingdale saw an article about plans for two housing developments virtually in the backyard of the airport planes have been flying over that area of huntington for 65 years , the director , hugh d jones , said it had been used for a sod farm and industrial and commercial uses that had far less sensitivity to airplane noise than do homeowners once you put houses under the flight pattern those homeowners are going to be a little annoyed , unless they are told about the planes beforehand mr jones called officials of the town of huntington and the builders to ask that they consider announcing the nearness of the airport to prospective residents one development , country pointe estates , at republic and ruland roads in melville , is one and a half miles from the airport town planning director richard machtay said airport officials had suggested that the town reconsider the developments because of plans for additional air traffic a lot of the housing has already been approved and is ready to go , mr machtay said maybe the airport should consider what we have planned and not be so aggressive since the 1920 s , he said , town plans have called for housing just north of the airport , near the price club warehouse store on route 110 in melville when the plans were updated in 1965 and in 1993 , they continued the housing designation in 1992 or '93 the town board changed the zoning of one of the oneacre residential areas to permit multifamily housing , the planning director said none of the airport officials came down to any of the hearings no one said anything about the airport the airport has two runways , and because the approach from the north was the only one without nearby houses , mr jones said , planes are directed there as much as possible to avoid problems that come with planes and people so we 're not wildly thrilled about houses going up there now , he said the airport is in the town of babylon , but the developments would be in huntington babylon has agreed to notify the airport of plans within a onemile radius of the airport huntington does not notify the airport , and mr jones said he regretted that huntington had not told him about the plans supervisor frank p petrone said huntington took its planning seriously and could not understand why the airport had questions about the housing plans the airport , he pointed out , is moving ahead with its own expansion plans without consulting the town it is the airport , mr petrone said , that should be considering environmental and public health issues in terms of fumes and noise we have never been contacted officially about their project mr jones said the airport expansion would involve making full use of its northern runway that would be possible , he said , after the airport had demolished a fivestory building at the end of the runway to make way for a shopping center levcom inc of paterson , nj , would build the stores after the building is taken down , mr jones said , we 'll be able to recover the 789 feet that we lost he said he had spoken with the federal aviation administration about buying the air rights to prevent a new building that would hamper operations the faa offered 396 million in september 1995 for the demolition and air rights and said additional money might be available if needed mr jones said the republic airport commission , a 10member panel of long islanders , had initially favored the expansion but had second thoughts residents complained that the loss of the building would mean lower taxes for the property owner , the fairchild corporation , and increase school taxes they also feared that a longer runway would turn republic into an airport for jet planes but we checked and found out that the building is coming down anyway , and that by rebuilding the area , the shopping center will add to the tax rolls , mr jones said fairchild pays 500 , 000 a year in taxes for the property , and the proposed shopping center would pay 19 million , he added in a few months officials expect the commission to issue a recommendation on the proposal and send it to state transportation commissioner john daly mr jones dismissed speculation that jets would use the airport , adding that expanding the runway was necessary for safety , and not for commercial jet traffic he noted that a plan two years ago to expand the airport also set off objections and had been stopped after the fivestory building has been demolished , the northsouth runway would be 5 , 516 feet long the northwestsoutheast runway , however , is 6 , 827 , 70 feet shy of the 7 , 000foot runways at la guardia airport ninetytwo percent of the noise complaints we receive are from those who live northwest of the airport , mr jones said so anything that makes the northsouth runway more attractive would enable us to shift traffic as the airport proprietor , we have no control over the landowner and the people who determine how it is to be used , mr jones said about the housing plans because planes fly in and out irregularly , mr jones added , people considering moving to the proposed developments might not see planes overhead when they visited that is why , he said , he suggested that the builders inform potential homebuyers about the closeness of the airport the executive vice president of reckson associates in melville , gregg rechler , said that reckson was working with beechwood associates in east williston to build country point estates and that the plan for the 193 houses and town houses on 33 acres would mention that an airport was one and a half miles away the development , which the builder hopes to start by jan 1 , is scheduled to be completed in 1999 a spokesman for avalon properties inc of wilton , conn , lee c feldman , said his company , which is planning a 154unit apartment complex adjacent to country pointe estates , was considering whether to notify tenants and with what information mr petrone said huntington had formed a fourmember group to gather information about the airport plans the town , he said , is concerned that the longer runway would allow larger planes to land and take off and that the planes would fly over melville and dix hills we have made known to them our opposition to this plan , mr petrone said but the department of transportation continues to move ahead , and we are not a part of this

the short answer , most say , is to make a point and build momentum for the next election as an independent in 1992 , mr perot captured 19 percent of the vote and forced the major party candidates to address balancing the budget from the liberty party in 1840 , which called for abolishing slavery , to the prohibition party in the early 1900 s , third parties have nurtured ideas that sometimes seemed farfetched but nevertheless sometimes took hold third parties' appeal is real and growing for example , the number of duespaying libertarian party members has nearly doubled , to 20 , 000 people , in the last three years this is an irreversible trend , mr nader said in an interview , noting that his biggest campaign applause line comes when he urges that every ballot include a noneoftheabove option people are more willing to tactically view what they want their vote to mean , including a protest vote but the thirdparty movement is still small and has many skeptics they 're political curiosities without any significant force , said john petrocik , a political scientist at the university of california at los angeles with shoestring budgets , many of this year s thirdparty hopefuls have taken to the air waves of talk radio to get their messages out mr browne , the libertarian , says he has spoken on 400 radio programs since jan 1 mr nader is piggybacking his campaign on a book tour mr hagelin spent more than 10 percent of his estimated campaign budget , or 420 , 000 , to buy a 16page color insert in an august issue of usa today mr browne , a 63yearold investment writer , is urging greater privatization of government services including eliminating the federal role in education , crime control and health care the libertarian party calls for legalizing drugs , arguing that antidrug efforts have failed we 'd ask people if they would be willing to give up their favorite government program if they never had to pay income tax again , said mr browne , who is on the ballot in all 50 states and expects to spend 3 million by election day the natural law party candidate , mr hagelin , 42 , who is on the ballot in 44 states , would phase out nuclear power , adopt a flat tax and abolish political action committees i do n't see another way to be as effective in educating the voting public as by running for president , said mr hagelin , who is the standardbearer for 700 natural law candidates nationwide as the green party nominee , mr nader may be running the most quixotic race of all adhering to his selfimposed spending limit , he eschews campaigning with other green party candidates when asked how he tracks his candidate , john bodine , a spokesman for the draft nader for president clearinghouse , said we do n't we get reports from the media and people on the street where he is mr nader , 62 , who is on the ballot in 21 states , pledges to stop corporate welfare , adopt campaign finance reform and promote a multipleparty system earlier this year , the us taxpayers party was banking on patrick j buchanan to wage his populist campaign under its banner when mr buchanan ultimately threw his support to mr dole , the party turned to mr phillips , a 55yearold founder of the conservative caucus our main constituencies are prolifers , homeschoolers and those concerned with the expansion of government , said mr phillips , who is on the ballot in about 40 states and expects to spend 2 million in his campaign we want to establish a firm enough position so that as the republican party dissolves , as i believe it will , ours will be seen as an alternative the party s platform calls for balancing the federal budget immediately , abolishing the internal revenue service and education department , and ending federal financing for the national endowment for the arts photo some thirdparty presidential candidates have unusual platforms john hagelin , of the natural law party , calls for federal financing for health programs that rely on techniques like transcendental meditation \( amy toensing for the new york times \)
london , oct 6 the hurdles that prime minister john major must clear to unite his demoralized conservative party and lead it to victory in the coming election have been raised higher at an acutely inconvenient moment the eve of the conservatives' annual conference the labor party , under its dynamic young leader , tony blair , lifted the bar last week by staging a crisply efficient conference of its own in blackpool with none of the fractious theatrics of past labor gatherings in a new gallup poll after mr blair s ardent speech to the faithful and his team s strict control over the proceedings , labor s lead lead widened from 24 to 33 points this season s disruptive political dramas seem more likely to occur in bournemouth , where the tories open their conference on tuesday , the last such meeting before a general election , which is expected in the spring the issues dominating the conservatives' agenda are a growing civil war within the party over integration with europe , and a new scandal involving members of parliament the divisions within the party over europe sharpened on saturday after mr major bolted from a meeting of european union ministers in dublin he said he had left because of a deeply offensive speech by klaus hansch , a german who is president of the european parliament , who accused the british of blackmail tactics mr major told the ministers that such attacks were unacceptable behavior and then flew back to london , leaving his place at a formal dinner in dublin castle empty actually , labor s position on the most imminent decision regarding europe , agreement to a single currency by 1999 , is remarkably similar to mr major s both favor postponing a final decision while remaining in negotiations and maintaining the option of not joining in the first wave while his defiant performance will sit well with many britons who resent pressure on their country to conform to standards set by european governments , it will also embolden the increasingly vociferous euroskeptic wing of mr major s party , which threatens party unity labor succeeded in stilling its leftist dissidents who chafed at the party s abandonment of socialist principles , but mr major faces a more formidable task in quieting his rightist detractors who want britain to declare its opposition to a single currency in recent weeks , the party s socalled grandees , like former prime minister edward heath and former foreign secretary douglas hurd , have denounced the euroskeptics as shortsighted , and mr major s outspoken chancellor of the exchequer , kenneth clarke , has derided the dissidents' argument as pathetic the skeptics , led by john redwood , the man who challenged mr major in a leadership vote last year , have scheduled forums in bournemouth where they plan to flaunt their objections their cause received a boost tonight when lord mcalpine , a former conservative party treasurer and deputy chairman and a frequent critic of mr major s leadership , announced he would leave the party to join the fledging singleissue referendum party of sir james goldsmith , which is dedicated to forcing a national vote on britain s future in europe the sleaze factor that dogged the conservatives in the early 1990 s returned to haunt the party last week with revelations that a member of parliament named neil hamilton and 20 other tories had been accepting money from a wellknown lobbyist , ian greer , supposedly for doing favors for his corporate clients mr hamilton s case stood out as a singular embarrassment because when similar charges were published by the guardian in 1994 , he enlisted the help of tory colleagues in amending a 300yearold law to permit him and mr greer to sue the newspaper in the legal discovery process , the newspaper s lawyers turned up documents last week confirming payments from mr greer to mr hamilton and showing that under questioning in 1994 , mr hamilton had said that he had no financial relationship with mr greer in addition , mr hamilton was accused of accepting free lodging from the ritz hotel in paris , free shopping vouchers at harrod s and brown envelopes stuffed with 50pound notes from mohammed alfayed , the owner of the hotel and the department store , in exchange for doing his bidding in commons mr hamilton , once a minister in mr major s government , and mr greer promptly dropped their 16 million lawsuit tonight mr greer announced he was stepping down as head of the westminster part of his lobbying business but mr hamilton reiterated his assertions that he had done nothing wrong and his determination to run for reelection the case grew worse for the conservatives today when it emerged that david willets , a minister and one of the party s most highly regarded intellects , had interceded with a parliamentary committee to persuade its tory majority to stall the investigation
memphis , sept 29 two years after tennessee voters gave republicans one of their best showings in the country with victories for governor , both senate seats and two house seats , the state has become one of the premier battlegrounds of the 1996 election president clinton has visited here twice since the democratic convention in august with nine campaign stops this weekend in nashville , chattanooga , memphis and spring hill , vice president al gore , a native son , has come home 10 times this year and 3 times since the convention bob dole , the republican challenger for president , and his running mate , jack kemp , have been here five times since the republican convention and both parties have poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into television advertising in the state s four major markets tennessee usually does n't get this much attention , said richard a pride , a political science professor at vanderbilt university in nashville but for all the barnstorming , recent polls and interviews with voters around the state suggest that neither party is likely to make major gains this year , an indication that tennessee voters have had their fill of change for the time being mr clinton , who won tennessee by five percentage points over president bush in 1992 , is leading mr dole for the state s 11 electoral votes , and none of the state s house and senate seats , now held by 7 republicans and 4 democrats , is expected to turn over still , the battle continues , fueled by the republicans' resounding gains of 1994 and the democrats' efforts to make certain they do not make further headway almost every major republican who ran won don sundquist , a former representative from memphis , defeated the mayor of nashville , philip n bredesen , for governor bill frist , a heart surgeon with no political experience , stunned senator jim sasser , who had won 94 of 95 counties in winning a third consecutive term in 1988 in a special election for the final two years of the senate seat that mr gore won in 1990 , fred thompson , a former actor , defeated jim cooper , a sixterm democratic member of the house and victories by zach wamp in the third congressional district and van hilleary in the fourth gave republicans a majority in the state s congressional delegation for the first time since 1972 , 54 worse yet for the democrats , the trend also reached down to the state level shortly after the elections , two members of the state senate switched parties to give republicans control of the chamber for the first time since reconstruction the democrats grew too out of touch with tennessee , said dave deming , 36 , a lawyer and a republican from nashville , explaining what happened two years ago despite president clinton s enduring popularity in the state , for many tennessee democrats , the republican surge was a stinging rebuke that left them dismayed and demoralized while many blamed the overall antiincumbency spirit that was sweeping the country , they also cited their own complacency and an inability to combat the republicans' success in drawing in national social issues , like abortion rights and gay personnel in the military into local races s a \( shep \) wilbun jr , a shelby county commissioner , said that the lack of interest was particularly damaging in his county , which includes memphis , the state s largest city and the area with the largest concentration of black voters he said that after three black candidates ran in the primary for shelby county mayor , splitting the vote , most black voters ignored the general election , and a republican won the low turnout among blacks , about 31 percent , also played a large role in helping mr sundquist defeat mr bredesen , mr wilbun said houston gordon , a lawyer from clarksburg who is challenging mr thompson for the senate , said another reason for the democrats' failures was the effectiveness with which republicans across the state played hotbutton cultural issues to the large bloc of independent voters , about a third of all those registered he said their support of republican candidates , combined with the low turnout among blacks and others who tend to vote democratic not only helped republicans at the top of the ticket but also many who ran in local elections mr gore s appearances in tennessee alone would suggest that party leaders at all levels are vitally interested in reversing the republican gains , not to mention helping mr clinton win a second term and raising mr gore s presidential aspirations for 2000 mr gore told reporters last week i believe that the pendulum will swing in the democratic direction this year , adding that he and mr clinton intended to match the republicans in tennessee visit for visit and commercial for commercial through the election for change to occur , however , democrats said that party leaders have to revitalize their supporters all across the state we 've got to convince people who usually vote democrat and did n't the last time that the economy is good , things are working and they have to stay with democrats to get the job finished , said evelyn stell , a retired teacher active in politics in the memphis area tennessee is enjoying boom times in many areas , particularly around nashville , the capital , where construction companies cannot hire workers fast enough for new projects last week , the state announced that unemployment had reached a low of 44 percent , well below the national average of about 55 percent but democrats say it would take more than a robust economy to hold off additional republican gains a lot of people did n't realize last time how important it was to vote , said dedrick boddie , a black 27yearold catering service worker in memphis mr boddie , a democrat who sat out the 1994 elections , said , but i think people have woken up to the things going on , and the turnout this year is going to be tremendous
for more than five years , psychiatrists , physicians , defense lawyers and prosecutors have produced a torrent of medical reports and legal documents in a dispute over whether a man who walks around greenwich village in a bathrobe is capable of being a mafia godfather yesterday , federal prosecutors presented a new expert in their campaign to show that vincent gigante , the strolling man in the bathrobe and slippers , is mentally fit to stand trial on charges that at least until may 1990 , he was the boss of the genovese crime family and that he ordered the commission of murders and other crimes in a brooklyn courtroom drama that seemed both crime thriller and farce , the prosecution presented its star witness against mr gigante salvatore gravano , the admitted former underboss of the rival gambino family the prosecutors were banking on a repeat performance by mr gravano to bring down mr gigante , just as he helped to convict and obtain a life sentence for john gotti , the gambino boss and his former patron , in 1992 mr gravano , the government s prized mafia defector , bolstered the prosecution s case by testifying that mr gigante ran the genovese family in the late 80 s and early 90 s mr gravano said he attended three highlevel mobster meetings in which mr gigante acted as the head or a top commander of the genovese family and that he showed no signs of mental distress through testimony by mr gravano and at least two other mafia defectors , the prosecution will try to prove at a hearing in federal district court in brooklyn that the 67yearold mr gigante has feigned mental illness for years by acting erratically to evade prosecution soon after mr gigante was indicted in may 1990 , his family and lawyers said he was mentally and physically ill and incapable of standing trial in the last five years , mr gigante has been hospitalized several times for treatment of mental and physical ailments and friends say he has undergone heart surgery in the longrunning court dispute over mr gigante s fitness , three psychiatrists designated by the courts and by the defense have testified or offered reports maintaining that mr gigante is a schizophrenic who says that he is haunted by voices and that god talks to him the psychiatrists found that his condition might worsen if he was compelled to stand trial but one psychiatrist said his opinion might shift if there was clear evidence that mr gigante , who has never appeared at any of the hearings , had been in control of the family and issued orders at the hearing yesterday , mr gravano , on direct questioning by andrew weissmann , an assistant united states attorney , said mr gigante once objected to the frequent meetings of top mobsters in the 1980 s to discuss the division of money from construction industry rackets he said mr gigante wanted the business meetings handled by lowerranking mobsters to decrease his risks of being detected by lawenforcement agents i 've invested many years in this crazy act , mr gravano quoted mr gigante as saying speaking in a gravelly , subdued voice , mr gravano related how mr gigante calmly discussed with him and others the mundane matters of the mob killing informers , sharing illicit profits , inducting members and deciding on whether to readmit the outcast bonanno crime family into the commission , the ruling council of new york s five mafia families mr gravano said his only commission meeting with mr gigante whom he referred to by his nickname , chin occurred in 1988 , together with mr gotti and the two leaders of the lucchese crime family he said mr gotti proudly announced that his son , john jr , had been made , or admitted into the gambino family chin said he was sorry to hear that , mr gravano testified , noting that none of mr gigante s sons were mafia members asked by mr weissmann if he would attend commission meetings with anyone he thought to be insane , mr gravano replied not if i knew somebody was crazy it was mr gravano s first courtroom appearance in 16 months , since he was sentenced to five years in prison after admitting a crime career that included participating in 19 murders and engaging in many labor racketeering , loansharking and extortion deals mr gravano , who turns 51 next tuesday , is free in the federal witness protection program and lives under an assumed name in an undisclosed part of the country in six years as mr gotti s righthand man , mr gravano , known as sammy the bull , favored darkcolored tshirts and leather jackets for his latest turn in the court spotlight , he wore a dark suit , a gleaming white shirt and a flowered red , gray and blue tie the husky , 5foot 6inch turncoat seemed more wan and hollowcheeked than in his previous appearances on the witness stand that led to the convictions of mr gotti and 11 other mobsters mr gravano was also instrumental in guilty pleas by 21 other suspected mob leaders members and federal bureau of investigation officials have characterized him as their most important antimafia witness of the century mr gravano said the 1988 commission meeting with mr gigante was dangerous because the gambino family feared that mr gigante disliked mr gotti because he had gained control of the family by engineering the murder of his predecessor , paul castellano , in december 1995 it was the first time the two bosses had met , mr gravano said , and mr gotti was puzzled that mr gigante had arranged the meeting in the greenwich village apartment of the brother of a gambino capo later , mr gravano said , mr gotti learned that mr gigante s mother lived in the same building on la guardia place and bleecker street mr gigante often stayed there , and had apparently chosen the site because his knowledge of the building might protect him from a gambino ambush he s as smart as a fox , mr gravano quoted mr gotti s referring to mr gigante , who came to the meeting in his pajamas mr gigante s chief lawyer , barry i slotnick , in crossexamination , tried to discredit mr gravano by having him acknowledge that his testimony yesterday about mr gigante was inconsistent on some points with his testimony at earlier trials the lawyer elicited from mr gravano that the genovese family had a reputation in the mafia for wrongly identifying its boss to mislead lawenforcement investigators nobody knows from this record who is the boss of the genovese family , mr slotnick said outside the courtroom if in fact there is such a person his crossexamination continues today photo vincent gigante being led out of court by two police officers in1990 , during a federal racketeering trial in manhattan \( john sotomayor the new york times \) \( pg b5 \)
washington , oct 1 entering a profound debate over the role of law and medicine at the end of life , the supreme court agreed today to decide whether the constitution gives terminally ill patients a right to a doctor s assistance in hastening death the justices accepted appeals filed by the states of new york and washington of rulings by two federal appellate courts , which ruled within a month of each other last spring that people who were mentally competent and terminally ill had a constitutional right to doctorassisted suicide the court accepted these and six other new cases today , in advance of the formal opening of its new session next monday , to give lawyers time to have the cases ready for argument in early january \( page a14 \) new york and washington are defending laws that , like the laws on the books in most other states , make it a crime for anyone , including a doctor , to help someone commit suicide both the washington and the new york laws date to the 19th century in new york , a special state task force studied the issue and recommended two years ago that the prohibition be retained the public , as well as the medical profession , appears to be deeply split on the issue in 1994 , voters in an oregon referendum approved a doctorassisted suicide law by a margin of 51 to 49 percent california and washington voters have rejected similar proposals by margins of 54 to 46 percent , california in 1992 and washington in 1991 while the american medical association took a strong position at its convention this year against the participation of doctors in suicides , doctors were the ones who brought the legal challenges that evolved into the new supreme court cases juries in michigan have refused three times to convict the most wellknown practitioner of doctorassisted suicide , dr jack kevorkian , and the county prosecutor who put dr kevorkian on trial was defeated for renomination in august by an opponent who said that further prosecutions of the retired pathologist would be fruitless in accepting the new york and washington appeals , the supreme court has placed itself squarely at the center of this intensifying controversy at a time when the justices are deeply divided over the precise issues of constitutional interpretation posed by the new cases it was only six years ago , in a case involving a braindamaged missouri woman who was being kept alive in a persistent vegetative state , that the court first recognized a constitutional right to forgo unwanted medical treatment the decision in that case , cruzan v missouri department of health , was quite tentative , acknowledging only a mild liberty interest in avoiding unwanted treatment , based on the 14th amendment s proscription against depriving any person of life , liberty , or property without due process of law extrapolating from that decision , and taking different constitutional paths to their conclusions , the two appeals courts in the assistedsuicide cases said that in the context of terminal illness , there was essentially no difference between ending medical treatment that is artificially prolonging life and taking active steps to hasten the moment of death the outcome of the cases now depends in large measure on whether a majority of the justices agree with that in the washington case , the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit , which is based in san francisco , concluded that there was a liberty interest in choosing the time and manner of one s death that outweighed the state s interest in forbidding assisted suicide writing for the 8to3 majority , judge stephen reinhardt said we see no ethical or constitutionally cognizable difference between a doctor s pulling the plug on a respirator and his prescribing drugs which will permit a terminally ill patient to end his own life in the new york case , the united states court of appeals for the second circuit based its ruling not on the due process guarantee but on another provision of the 14th amendment , the guarantee of equal protection the court said that given the right of terminally ill people to forgo unwanted treatment , new york had no rational basis for refusing to permit the terminally ill to have assistance in ending their lives the distinctions made by new york law with regard to such persons do not further any legitimate state purpose , judge roger j miner wrote writing for himself and another member of the threejudge panel , judge milton pollack , judge miner asked a series of questions , including what interest can the state possibly have in requiring the prolongation of a life that is all but ended \? and , what business is it of the state to require the continuation of agony when the result is imminent and inevitable \? he said the answer was none , and added , physicians do not fulfill the role of 'killer' by prescribing drugs to hasten death any more than they do by disconnecting lifesupport systems judge guido calabresi concurred on the more limited ground that because the basis of the ban had deeply eroded over the last 150 years , the law should be set aside to permit state lawmakers to revisit the issue in their appeals , both new york , in vacco v quill , no 951858 , and washington , in washington v glucksberg , no 96110 , are arguing that states are entitled to discern a difference between ending life support and assisting in suicide , and to base state policy on that difference in new york s appeal , attorney general dennis c vacco said the state s interests included the preservation of life and the prevention of suicide , the protection of innocent third parties from potential abuse by doctors and family members and the maintenance of medical ethics the brief cited the hippocratic oath to please no one will i prescribe a deadly drug , nor give advice which may cause his death the challenge to the new york prohibition against assisted suicide was brought in federal district court in 1994 by three physicians , drs timothy e quill , samuel c klagsbrun , and howard a grossman , and by three terminally ill patients , all of whom died in the early phases of the litigation one patient , rita barrett , was dying of thyroid cancer , and the two others , george a kingsley and william a barth , were in the final stages of aids in their lawsuit , the patients vividly described their conditions and said they wanted their doctors' aid in bringing about humane deaths by the use of prescribed medication the doctors said new york law prevented them from using their best medical judgment to relieve their terminally ill patients of chronic , intractable pain and or intolerable suffering the federal district court dismissed the case in late 1994 the washington case was similar the state law was challenged by three anonymous , terminally ill patients , four doctors and a nonprofit group , compassion in dying they prevailed in federal district court , but a threejudge panel of the ninth circuit overturned that decision a panel of 11 judges heard the case again and set aside the first decision arguments will be scheduled in january , and decisions are expected by early next summer

you might have noticed new york men walking with an extra bounce in their step yesterday , and the most likely reason was that they 'd heard the good news fresh scientific studies show that they may be proud carriers of the highest sperm counts in the country none of the researchers would explain why this was so the important thing is that , since we do n't have a causal relationship , no comment should be made , said dr harry fisch , who carried out one of the studies as director of the male infertility center at columbiapresbyterian medical center ok , we 're not going to get an official reason but there it is anyway we 're no 1 maybe it has something to do with the intensity of life here , dr ruth westheimer , the sex therapist , speculated life is complicated in new york , and that has an effect on the sperm count as well it s survival of the fittest if you can make it here , you 'll make it anywhere bragging rights to the highest sperm counts may not sound like much to some , but they provide another reason to gloat for a city that thinks of itself only in superlatives sweeter yet , the figures for new york 1315 million sperm per milliliter of semen are more than 50 percent higher than those for its archrival , los angeles , that supposed center of american glamour and fitness poor los angeles clocked in at only 727 million per milliliter can you imagine how many women are going to start sneaking into new york now \? the comedian jackie mason said in la , i think they 're wearing the wrong shorts do n't laugh , said dr francois eid , a urologist at new york hospital keeping the testes cooler insures a higher sperm count , he explained , adding that perhaps the penchant in los angeles for sitting in hot tubs and parading on the beach in tight bathing suits has had a debilitating effect on the numbers out there can a run on boxer shorts at bloomingdale s be far behind \? more seriously , word that new york was winning the sperm race came as a reassuring counterpoint to the news over the weekend that the life expectancy for men born in the city has declined for the first time in this century the aids epidemic seems to be taking its toll , the health department says as of 1990 , the average male life expectancy was 68 years , appreciably less than the 718 years nationwide so on one hand , we do n't live as long as we would like on the other , we 're a lot more vital than most while we 're around always full of paradoxes , this life to those of us who are new yorkers , the most energetic people and the most fit are those who 've chosen to stay in this city , said nicholas freudenberg , executive director of the center on aids , drugs and community health at hunter college this study tends to support that belief for the record , the mayor did not use a news conference at city hall yesterday to take credit for the latest development nor was there comment from donald trump , a paradigm of new york hightestosterone performance for so many years truth is , dr fisch said , high testosterone levels do not necessarily translate into high sperm counts so much for that angle then again , dr helen fisher , an anthropologist at rutgers university who specializes in human evolution , noted that the mating game is the most important game we play , and the one with the most sperm wins the absence of a clear explanation from the scientists about new yorkers' sperm counts left the field wide open to speculation yesterday dr westheimer said that the energy that comes from living in the most exciting city in the world could be a factor dr eid observed that people in new york are a little tenser than others , and maybe because they have higher adrenaline levels , their sperm counts are also higher as for mr freudenberg , he thought that the city s openarms policy toward immigrants might well be a factor publichealth research suggests that it s the healthiest , most energetic people who leave their own countries people who are more successful in mobilizing themselves , he said who knows \? some scientists have been warning recently that sperm counts are declining worldwide now they appear to be going up remember when butter was supposed to be bad for you \? now , researchers say it s good remaining no 1 may be trickier than new yorkers think
abraham lincoln died without one so did presidents andrew johnson , ulysses s grant and james a garfield pablo picasso , d h lawrence and howard hughes , unconventional until the end , did n't bother to leave one behind , either all went to their graves without writing wills , the granddaddy of all mistakes in estate planning in the worstcase possibilities , the lack of a will can turn potential heirs against each other as lawyers feast on diminishing assets of the deceased the need for a will has grown ever more important in american society as people live longer and become more affluent because of various retirement plans , rising real estate and stock values , experts say nevertheless , an estimated two out of three americans die without a will , or intestate in legal parlance many of these people have few worldly possessions , or they own property like bank accounts , houses and cars that pass directly to a spouse or other joint owner outside probate , a system by which an estate s debts are paid and assets distributed under court supervision life insurance and retirement fund benefits also bypass probate court for anyone with substantial assets , though , an updated , valid and properly witnessed will is essential it should designate an executor , who will administer the estate and see to it that debts are paid and assets distributed according to the wishes expressed in the will dying without a will is the biggest but not the only blunder made by people who fail to organize their finances before succumbing to infirmity and death many people who die with valid wills leave their families scrambling to find the documents a manhattan widow , for example , left her will in the freezer for safekeeping , reckoning incorrectly as it turned out that her family would want ice cubes for a drink at her wake the preparation of the will itself sometimes causes a problem when people draw up their own wills or use standard forms , some of them generated on computers , certain mistakes can make the will invalid in new york and many other states typing in provisions instead of writing them in longhand or having beneficiaries like children witness the signature because handling the affairs of a deceased family member often means dealing with complicated issues and finances at a time of emotional distress , people should conduct a frank discussion with their heirs well before the onset of illness and death but there is a reluctance on both sides of the generational divide to discuss death and personal finances when parents enjoy good health also , changes in american society have reduced opportunities for quiet exchanges of information around the dinner table divorce , remarriage and the mobility of retired parents and adult children often fracture family alliances , weaken bonds and open gaping emotional and geographic distances there is great reluctance and discomfort about bringing up unmentionable things like dying , said judy pollatsek , a clinical therapist in washington and a lecturer on death and grief both parents and children may be in denial about death and asking parents where the safe deposit key is or how much they own can create guilt about prying , an invasion of privacy second only to asking your parents what they do in bed , she said ms pollatsek speaks from experience when she asked her mother , who lives in california and has suffered several strokes , about her assets , she was cut short and told it was none of her business , she recalled there are so many things an adult child who does n't live near a parent needs to know in case of death , she added but here i was , a professional who counsels others on dealing with emotions , and i'm reduced to tears because my mother is a couple of thousand miles away and being unreasonable the fears of some parents are not baseless greed on the part of relatives anticipating an inheritance can reveal itself before and after a death i had a client who divulged her net worth to a daughter who then became very agitated and demanded part of inheritance right away , recalled vincent j russo , a lawyer in westbury , li , who specializes in wills and estates protracted court battles between family members who contest wills are growing in number , state court officials say you are dealing with people fighting over money in one of the most difficult periods of their lives , said a gail prudenti of suffolk county , one of the 63 surrogate court judges in new york state who supervise estates , trusts and contested wills in westchester county , surrogate judge albert j emanuelli agreed heirs today are much more prone to litigate than they were just a few years ago , he observed any latent hostility that existed during mom and dad s lifetime rises in full bloom the children do n't have to worry about mom and dad s feelings any more and they really take it out on each other some court fights concern emotional issues rather than money , he said disputes over relatively inexpensive heirlooms last for years and result in legal fees that add up to many times the value of the items
for a refugee from the 60 s , memories were gently stirred when school opened with 50 girls in east harlem squeezing past squadrons of uniformed guards and cameras to go to class flash back to similar commotion in places like birmingham and little rock in the old civil rights days of course , memories stretch just so far , as do comparisons no howling mob clogged the street trying to bar the schoolhouse door more important , these girls , new seventh graders in freshly pressed blue uniforms , were not on a 60 sstyle mission to integrate a school they were there on wednesday to segregate it call them pioneers of the 90 s , conscripts in a movement to solve one or two problems at this turn of the century with answers borrowed from the last one they form the first class in the first allgirls public school to grace this city in years , the young women s leadership school it occupies the top three floors of a commercial building on 106th street but its foundation is the fairly well documented premise that girls of their age , 12 and 13 , have habitually been shortchanged in coeducational classrooms , and that they learn better without boys around a revolutionary theory \? hardly grandma and grandpa drew much the same lesson in their day , when allgirls and allboys schools were seen not as fortresses of sexual oppression , but bastions of common sense the notion that boys and girls are \( gasp ! \) different and that one is not a flaming bigot for acknowledging certain distinctions later fell out of favor it has taken a long time for this old thought to become new again in the form of the leadership school ah , but we live in new york , where no change goes unchallenged and no silver lining lacks its cloud for the new school , it comes in the form of civil liberties groups that intend to go before the united states education department today to argue that the pastelcolored classrooms violate federal civil rights laws because boys are excluded \( technically , boys could apply for admission but none have thus far , and the reality is that they are not wanted \) no one questions that the civil libertarians are people of high purpose if the citadel was muddleheaded in trying to keep out shannon faulkner , they argue , then the east harlem school , with its mostly black and hispanic student body , is just as wrong in turning its back on boys a better response is to alter the objectionable behavior that has prevailed in coed classes , not hang out a no boys need apply sign the focus , norman siegel , executive director of the new york civil liberties union , said , should be on substantially improving the integrated model rather than focusing on a segregated model but as they dropped off their girls on opening day , parents asked why both could not be done improve existing classrooms and create new opportunities this school is not antiboy , they said it is progirl , taking into account the harsh truths about unequal treatment in coed situations besides , it is not as if coed public schools were about to disappear this school does not have to be for everyone , the principal , celenia chevere , said after poking in on a mathematics class yesterday there are choices to terry benson , whose daughter kara is one of the seventh graders , the rights groups are misguidedly absolutist , seeing slippery slopes toward perdition where none exist just as a new law pushing pornography shops to the peripheries of the boroughs has hardly produced book burnings in columbus circle despite warnings from some libertarians many cannot see how a few singlesex schools will lead inexorably to a segregated system these groups are extremist , taking stands to the nth degree , mr benson said the question is how we create a center where the politicians can make reasonable choices instead of being hammered by the extremes on all sides amen , said crystal glover , who lives near the school and who took her fifthgrade son to his first day of classes yesterday while they 're at it , she said , how about a special place for boys \? she did not like the fact that a brooklyn school created for black teenagers three years ago came under immediate assault and had to adopt a more inclusionary admissions policy there should be allboys schools , too , mrs glover said they can relate together , and have things in common children need to identify with a gender there need to be more boys schools , with real men teaching them

las vegas , nev , march 15 the way frank bruno s daydreams play it out , he will attack mike tyson on saturday night , cheered on by 2 , 500 roaring brits in the mgm grand crowd tyson will be flustered by this onslaught , the insecurity brought on by three years in prison will take its toll and his own dreams of revival will disappear into the desert night the oddsmakers do n't think so tyson may be the challenger for bruno s world boxing council heavyweight crown , but 81 says the title will change hands and the way the tysondon king scenario is scripted , tyson will follow it up with bouts against the world boxing association and international boxing federation rulers and unify the title but this is also tyson s first bout against a puncher someone who hits back in five years that s right , it was 1991 when he last fought a quality slugger , getting a decision over razor ruddock , before the trial and the prison term for rape in tyson s two returns , he mauled the flailing peter mcneeley in less than a minute and a half and then stopped the pawing , bearhugging buster mathis jr in the third i give bruno a clubber s chance , said lennox lewis , one of three fighters who knocked out bruno in his earlier quests for the title actually , lewis may be kinder to bruno than the record warrants bruno does have a bodybuilder s physique and an impressive 404 record he even has 38 knockouts but he has never knocked down a top fighter , certainly none in four title appearances tyson , now 29 and with a 431 mark , brings with him the mystique of an assassin it s almost as if it s besides the point to many observers that he has not demonstrated that part of his persona in his return indeed , even before he went to prison , he was not the singleminded wrecker of his youth when he recorded most of his 37 knockouts he weighs 220 pounds , which puts him at a 27pound disadvantage against bruno , who is 34 years old but is also about five inches taller these two have fought many rounds when tyson was a teenager , bruno was his sparring partner in 1989 , tyson the champion clobbered bruno the challenger with unfettered shots , yet never knocked him down while gaining a fifthround technical knockout that bout , tyson has said , was actually part of his downward spiral , when his life was beginning to spin out of control the new tyson \( only those closest to him claim to have seen him \) supposedly is also the younger tyson in boxing style that is , he will fight out of a crouch , utilizing his shorter stature he will not come in straight ahead , thinking he can beat any man in the house by the force of his will that was tyson just before he went to prison instead , he will be elusive and bobbing , using uppercuts once inside the arms of the more massive bruno but who knows \? in the only public workout tyson held , he was merely ok but he stopped the workout suddenly after four rounds his trainer and old friend , jay bright , said it was a lackluster 12 minutes yet tyson s comanager rory holloway said that every sparring partner had been knocked out , and frightened we had 13 sparring partners , and now it s down to 3 , he said they 'd pack in the middle of the night and leave they would n't even come for their money bruno , who trained in the canary islands , off africa , to simulate las vegas s temperature and climate , imported former tyson sparring partners bruno said i feel stronger , mentally and physically this is my time mike tyson had his time tyson used to be able to bully people emotionally bruno likes to think he can bully tyson physically he says he thinks of himself as the champion , and that has forged a bruno supremely confident talking , bruno is an easy winner he points out the wild left hooks tyson has thrown in his two bouts since his return he says tyson is surrounded by yes men who bolster his fragile ego tyson , alternating between humility and snarling in his few conversations out of his inner circle , said quite simply of the difference in weight and size between them , it means nothing to me
chicago here is the good news for dallas emmitt smith appears ok he flew back to dallas yesterday afternoon on the cowboys owner jerry jones s plane emmitt was up all night getting tested , so we napped most of the way back , jones said we did talk about some of the big blocks he threw he was proud of that we talked about the lack of execution in the game on our part that s the thing that concerns us all and we talked about the fact that we 're trying to do some new things on the field with this team and how we 've got to get everybody together doing it at the same time smith was injured late in the game against chicago on monday night when he took a fake handoff and dived over the line and landed hard on his shoulders and neck at first , he complained of a sharp pain running up and down his spine he was carted off the soldier field grass he spent the night at northwestern university medical center , and xrays proved negative smith is listed as doubtful when dallas plays host to the giants on sunday it is day to day , but as of yesterday , it looks as if he will play here is the bad news for dallas the 226 rout by the bears exposed for the cowboys , for one game at least , what the loss of receiver michael irvin \( suspended five games \) and tight end jay novacek \( possibly lost for the season \) meant no big plays maybe it means more not enough moxie and spirit for the cowboys without irvin this was ugly for dallas no run longer than 12 yards no completion to a receiver for more than 15 yards no touchdowns in a game for the first time since 1991 an average yards per catch of only 44 for dallas an interception of quarterback troy aikman , a fumble by aikman and one each by deion sanders and by smith two trick chicago plays \( a fake punt and pass and a receiver pass off a reverse \) resulting in 80 yards and one score two sacks for chicago , none for dallas nine cowboys penalties dallas led by 30 after one quarter that was it for the cowboys they trailed by 103 at halftime and were outscored by 223 the rest of the way a lackluster showing , any way you slice it dallas has been down this road before last season it was the failed fourthandinches call and loss at philadelphia dallas on the skids it went on to win the super bowl the cowboys will remind you that it started the season 02 in 1992 and heard all of the doom and gloom no team had ever reached the super bowl with such a start dallas did that season , though , and won it all the circumstances were different smith was out in a contract holdout the circumstances are different now they are more severe no irvin no novacek a bangedup smith a rare beating at the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball a lack , for one game , anyway , of fire , desire and discipline i think we became unraveled , said fullback darryl johnston there are a lot of reasons why a team goes out and plays like we played tonight , aikman said and this from guard nate newton it ai n't the same team new era , new time maybe the chief element on monday night was the dallas former coach factor dave wannstedt , the bears' coach , was the dallas defensive coordinator four seasons ago , and this was his first meeting against dallas norv turner , the washington redskins' coach , used to be the dallas offensive coordinator those two coaches , combined , are 30 against dallas in their last three meetings it s not the coaching , receiver kevin williams said you make turnovers like we did , they even scored a touchdown returned off one fumble , and you wo n't win what is it , then \? what was it \? for the bears , it was their biggest victory in several years maybe it is a turnaround game for the franchise end alonzo spellman said we 're going to play them all this way we 're going to turn it loose keep an eye on us this team has confidence we think we will see that team again down the road in the playoffs no question for dallas , is it a turnaround game for its franchise \? no jones explains emmitt s test results were all of the positive we needed after that showing when you 're dealing with an injury like that , you never know it s frightening we are relieved when you have the caliber of football players and people we do , we know we can build off adversity you 'd be misreading this team if you think one football game means the season that s laughable in our shoes , every team we play will make the game the beginning of their football dynasty dynasties do n't come that easily and they do not go away that easily , either dallas will struggle without irvin it will likely soar once he returns this game showed he means that much so , this is the bottom line for the next four up for dallas \( giants , colts , bills and eagles \) beat the world champion cowboys now , if you can , while you can photo emmitt smith on ground after an injury monday as bears vinson smith \( 55 \) and marty carter \( 23 \) look on \( associated press \)
his rise was so dramatic , from the 44th round of the freeagent draft to a 92 rookie record , that jason isringhausen made it easy to forget there could be nights like this there were more than enough reasons to explain the mets' 96 loss to houston last night a struggling bullpen did not help butch huskey s misplayed fly ball in right field which led to a fiverun fifth inning for the astros was the latest example of underachieving defensive play but the game , and the identity of this team , begins on the mound , and that identity appears shaken the issue now is how badly , and for how long the mets have lost twice as often as they have won our problem right now is our pitching , isringhausen said his record is 11 , his control a concern bill pulsipher is scheduled to undergo surgery today through half of an uncomfortably chilly april , the selfassurance of last year s late summer has become a memory of all the unexpected aspects at the start of this mets season the sixrunspergame pace , the uneven defense the struggle of the starting staff has been the biggest surprise isringhausen s fourandtwothirdinnings night , the secondshortest outing of his 17 major league starts , had too many of his 101 pitches too high up in the strike zone i do n't want to put everything on the pitching staff , said podd hundley , whose threerun , seventhinning home run his fifth of the season began a rally that cut a sixrun deficit to one that s not what this team is about we , as a team , as individuals , have to do what we 're capable of doing some of the young guys do n't know what they 're capable of doing eventually , the crowd of 13 , 795 was distracted by the fiverun met seventh , by the backtoback home runs by hundley and jeff kent , and by a rally that brought new york within a run but orlando miller s eighthinning home run off robert person , the first of three earned runs person allowed without getting an out , gave the astros a fourrun lead huskey was one more day removed from a spring training with nine home runs and a 402 batting average his 0for4 night extended his disappointing start to 5 for 41 , a 122 average i'm going to take that and throw it out the window , he said that would be harder to do with his fifthinning error in right field , which turned a potential third out and 20 deficit into a sixrun hole before the night was over , the pointed noise from the stands was treating huskey as a modernday don bosch he s supposed to catch the ball , said dallas green , the mets' manager but the footing is sloppy it s very tenuous out there but he s still got to catch the ball it was up in the air a long time huskey s error might not have created as serious a problem if isringhausen had been more reliable brian hunter s bouncer up the third base line , which eluded kent s backhanded reach , would have been a double had the ball not hit the thirdbase umpire , tom hallion walks to craig biggio and jeff bagwell , the fourth and fifth of the night for isringhausen , loaded the bases with none out derek bell fell behind on a twostrike count and missed a thighhigh 22 fastball a sacrifice fly to center field by rick wilkins scored hunter with houston s second run huskey then ran forward on the soft grass toward sean berry s fly ball to short right field he reached forward with his glove , lunged , but failed to make the catch i did everything i could do to get to the ball , huskey said i got to the ball i did n't catch the ball biggio and bagwell scored on huskey s error for a 40 houston lead , but isringhausen s problems were not complete derrick may s bloop single beyond the reach of shortstop rey ordonez scored berry orlando miller grounded a single to center field to score may , and finally , isringhausen s difficult night was over his only shorter appearance was a threeinning outing last aug 4 , against florida , in his first major league loss isringhausen connected his control problems to his previous outing he suggested there might be a mechanical solution i might go 182 , isringhausen said that s how i look at it photo jason isringhausen , being removed by mets manager dallas green , pitched only four and twothirds innings in last night s 96 loss to the astros \( paul burnett the new york times \)

as mr helms practices his golf putt on the office carpet , the camera moves to a suave mexican who reminds viewers that telefonos de mexico , or telmex , is a homegrown company whose network reaches to mexico s humblest towns telmex began this nonetoosubtle campaign , with its appeal to nationalism , last month in the final lap before mexico s longdistance market opens to fullscale competition next year the tone reflects the combative mood of carlos slim helu , the chairman of telmex the company , a bureaucratic behemoth mexicans loved to hate when mr slim bought it from the government in 1990 , has greatly improved its reputation but its 48year longdistance monopoly expired in august , and by january it must begin connecting calls for competing carriers in an interview in his office here , mr slim said he was confident that telmex was ready , with the technology , service and discounted rates to go head to head with the likes of att and mci communications but he had fighting words about the conditions government regulators imposed on telmex to open up the market , and he assailed his competitors as freeloaders his rivals , he said , were using telmex s network to complete longdistance calls without paying enough or investing as much as telmex has to create infrastructure and jobs the strong ads are not our way of working , mr slim said but if our competitors are going to be aggressive , we are going to get just as aggressive mr slim , listed by forbes magazine as the richest man in mexico , with a fortune estimated at 61 billion , is no stranger to stiff competition part of his fortune comes from acquisitions over the years of flagging mexican companies , including makers of tires , cigarettes , copper products and telephone cable , which he whipped into shape but long distance is a tougher proposition telmex , whose parent company s shares are among the most actively traded foreign stocks on wall street , is entering what promises to be an epic market battle during a recession , without the friendly government support mr slim long enjoyed beyond that , public suspicion abounds about the probity of past privatizations , especially that of telmex most of our competitors are way behind in their investment plans , and obviously they are going to blame that on us , mr slim said but nobody in this country will be able to say legitimately that they give better longdistance service because they will all be using our network because telmex was notoriously sluggish when it was a stateowned monopoly , there are now only 10 telephone lines for every 100 mexicans , compared with 56 in the united states but the middle class is growing quickly , and more calls are made between mexico and the united states than any other two neighboring nations analysts expect mexico s telecommunications market to swell from about 6 billion a year today to 11 billion by the end of the decade eight companies have licenses and plans to challenge telmex , and have pledged to invest at least 58 billion over five years one of the two main contenders is avantel , a partnership between mci and grupo financiero banamexaccival , which includes mexico s biggest bank the other is alestra , led by att and the alfa group , a big mexican industrial conglomerate , and includes bancomer , the no 2 bank despite its nationalist protestations , telmex also has two big foreign partners , sbc communications , the texasbased parent of southwestern bell , and france telecom each owns about 10 percent avantel leaped off the starting blocks , investing nearly 1 billion to build a 3 , 360mile fiber optic network and advertising an array of discounts but alestra , which promised to invest 1 billion by 2000 , has so far moved like an elephant in a snowbank , an american analyst said analysts predict that competitors will take at least 15 percent of telmex s longdistance business in 1997 , and perhaps much more thereafter mail ballots for mexicans to choose a new carrier or stay with telmex went out on nov 6 still , mr slim is widely credited with a remarkable makeover of the company mexicans used to say that they had to wait for someone to die before they could get a phone line now telmex has 160 , 000 local lines waiting for customers under mr slim , it invested 10 billion to modernize its network
a plan to build 17 subsidized houses in lakeview that the federal department of housing and urban development would partly finance has set off a community dispute the proponents of the proposed development , woodfield estates , say the community needs such housing to enable people to live in lakeview who would otherwise have to move from long island critics , however , say the town of hempstead did not conduct proper studies on the effects that the 17 houses would have on schools and other facets of the community the opponents say they are concerned that residents of the malverne school district will have to subsidize the property taxes of the new homes , which would have lower property taxes than their neighbors for a year groups from lakeview and neighboring malverne and lynbrook have joined to block the houses their lawyer , richard gumo of malverne , has asked state supreme court in mineola for an order to prevent the construction the case was dismissed and is being appealed the town s plan calls for the 17 houses to be built on a threeacre lot off coolidge avenue the 1 , 800squarefoot houses would have three bedrooms , one and a half bathrooms and walltowall carpeting and would sell for 115 , 000 , or 60 percent of market value because of subsidies the town owns the site , which has been vacant for six years , said the planning and economic development commissioner , robert francis north of the area is a development where highranch houses sold several years ago for 240 , 000 to 260 , 000 , mr francis said the same builder had planned to buy the three acres to continue building , mr francis said , but when the market turned down he dropped those plans he said the lot had attracted illegal dumping and vandalism the town considered uses like industry , retail and housing for the elderly , but planners agreed that onefamily housing was the most compatible use a spokeswoman for the town , marlene kastleman , said the town gave the land to the developer , the metro construction company , to keep down the costs of the houses the homeowners would not be able to sell the houses for 10 years under federal regulations , ms kastleman said , and the owners would have reduced taxes hundreds of applications participated in a lottery in february to determine purchase rights , said ms kastleman the lottery allotted seven houses to people who live in lakeview they had first priority , followed by residents of unincorporated areas of hempstead , county residents and then applicants from outside nassau the incomes have to be from 40 , 000 to 75 , 000 a year the president of the lakeview branch of the naacp , rener reed , said such housing allowed young families to buy houses and live on long island these homes will attract young professional people who want to stay here but otherwise could n't afford to , because of the high cost of living on long island , ms reed said some critics live on coolidge avenue , next to the three acres the president of the coolidge avenue civic association , betty mcallister , said the town had tried to sneak the project into lakeview , without properly notifying the residents or giving them an opportunity to offer their input mr francis said that the town had complied with all requirements for disclosure , including public hearings the civic group gained the support of groups in lynbrook and malverne after residents had learned that the new homeowners would pay lower taxes than others the taxes on the new houses would be limited to no more than 3 , 000 a year , ms mcallister said most neighboring pay 6 , 000 to 10 , 000 , she added the malverne school district , which has students from lakeview , malverne and lynbrook , spends 13 , 000 a year per student this would mean , ms mcallister said , that homeowners of our communities would have the additional burden of educating any extra students who come into the school district from these new homes taxes will go up for all of us mr francis said those statements were erroneous and illogical woodfield estates would not have a guaranteed tax cap , he said the county would assess taxes after the houses had been built , he said , and officials project that the initial taxes would be from 3 , 000 and 3 , 600 a year if the property taxes on the new homes are 3 , 000 , 60 percent , or 1 , 800 will go to school taxes , mr francis said if the average homeowner in the community pays 6 , 000 in taxes , they pay about 3 , 600 in school taxes clearly none of those homeowners pay 13 , 000 in school taxes if everyone had to pay 13 , 000 per kid the taxes would be astronomical that s why there is state aid given to every school district that supplements the local tax base mr francis added that woodfield estates would send extremely few additional students to the district , because most of the prospective homeowners with children already lived in the community when you calculate the new taxes based on construction , he said , the school district will actually make money
new haven yale always yearns to be no 1 in the ivy league , but a walkout by 1 , 100 service and maintenance workers has cemented yale s leadership in an area it would prefer not to boast about strikes when these workers began picketing in front of woolsey hall s corinthian columns on march 27 , it was the start of the second strike at yale in two months and the seventh since 1968 once again , the campus s calm was disrupted as strikers bellowed through megaphones , banged cowbells and shouted that the yale bulldog was an attack dog and that yale was out to bust the union people are really distressed and depressed about it , and baffled , too , said peter brooks , chairman of yale s humanities department the question everyone asks is why do there have to be so many strikes at yale and so much unrest in labor relations \? ' the most recent strike at columbia was a mostly painless twoday affair in 1991 princeton s last one was in 1979 and harvard has not had a strike since printers walked out in 1983 but at yale , even some administrators admit their embarrassment at the record of labor trouble a 5day strike in 1968 , a 6week strike in 1971 , a 10week strike in 1974 , a 14week strike in 1977 , another 10week strike in 1984 , and two strikes this year and that s not to mention last fall s job action by graduateschool teaching assistants who refused to turn in grades in an unsuccessful effort to be recognized as a union i do n't think any university or institution has had as many strikes as yale over the past 25 years , said gregory tarpinian , director of the new yorkbased labor research association and among private companies , only industrial giants like general motors and caterpillar , with dozens of factories , have had more , labor experts say everyone here seems to have a theory to explain the strikes , including a deepseated distrust between unions and the administration , aggressive labor leadership , sour towngown relations that have taught workers to resent yale , and an unusually effective alliance between yale s mostly white clerical workers and its mostly minority service and maintenance employees on other campuses , however , there is widespread agreement that management and labor at yale , which was first unionized in 1941 after a oneday strike , are more dug in than elsewhere the union is more macho and adversarial at yale , said a labor leader at harvard who insisted on anonymity one theory is that yale s unions are more emboldened to strike because , unlike workers at other ivy league schools , they belong to one large union , and that makes it easier to stand up to management bill jaeger , director of harvard s clerical workers' union , said that while there are labor tensions at harvard , our sister union at yale is dealing with a greater degree of hostility than we 've faced for example , after yale s clerical workers voted to form a union , it took the extremely bitter 10week strike of 1984 for them to win their first contract but harvard s clerical workers signed their first contract in 1988 without a walkout there is a vast difference between how the two schools have dealt with labor relations , said john hoerr , who is writing a book that focuses on unionization efforts at harvard yale hired a unionbusting firm that set the tone , and when you have that kind of foundation , it s hard to build a cooperative relationship yale had the elitist idea that management knows best and clerical workers were a bunch of giggling high school girls the president of princeton s library workers' union , robert margolis , also drew sharp distinctions with yale between the yale union locals and the yale corporation , he said , there s been an increasing deterioration in the basic dynamic that governs their bargaining relations that s not the case here at princeton , there s an underlying confidence that we 're moving in a common direction although we have differences over salaries and so forth , we do n't feel ours are under attack , as is the case at yale while the yale strikes of decades past were mostly about wages , the current walkout has a modern theme contracting out yale s demand to have the right to farm out any and all work has been rejected by local 34 of the federation of university employees , representing clerical , laboratory and technical workers , and local 35 , representing dininghall , service and maintenance employees after a fourweek strike to protest yale s demands , about 1 , 300 clerical and technical workers went back to work in early march now , in what union officials call a tagteam effort , the service and maintenance workers' local has begun its own walkout , shutting down the university s dining halls to many yale administrators , there is one overriding explanation for the strikes a militant union has concluded that taking to the streets is a surefire way to win at the bargaining table 'in the past , turmoil has paid off' the union has been able to survive by saying this is a horrible place to work , said peter d vallone , yale s associate vice president for administration the union realizes that if it disrupts and embarrasses yale , it s to their advantage in the past , turmoil has paid off for them , and they see no reason not to continue it mr vallone said the union s militancy has paid off so well that its members' wages are second to none in the ivy league , while their benefits , both sides agree , are the highest

washington , april 23 what had once been one of the government s bestkept secrets , the annual budget of the central intelligence agency and its sister spy agencies , would no longer be so secret under a proposal announced today by the white house the white house said that beginning this year it would ask congress to release an overall bottom line figure for the budget of american intelligence agencies , a figure now widely estimated at 24 billion to 30 billion a year in making the figure public , the white house said , it hoped to foster a new sense of openness in the intelligence community the president is persuaded that disclosure of the annual total budget for intelligence should be made public and that this can be done without any harm to intelligence activities , said a senior intelligence official , speaking with reporters on the condition of anonymity this is consistent with the emphasis on openness while maintaining absolute integrity of sources and methods the proposal is part of several management changes announced today by the white house in response to the findings of a presidential commission on the future of intelligence agencies , led by harold brown , defense secretary in the carter administration the cia is only the largest of 13 intelligencegathering agencies , and when the budget figure is made public by congress there will apparently be no breakdown of the costs by agency or activity still , the decision to release any information about the budget for american intelligence gathering would end a decadeslong tradition of secrecy in the intelligence community since the cia was created in 1947 , much of its multibilliondollar annual budget has been hidden in falseline items in the budget of the defense department , a subterfuge that has put pentagon planners into the awkward position of lying to the public , and even to each other it 'll be good to put an end to some of this charade , said a pentagon official the presidential commission on intelligence agencies was established by congress in december 1994 in the aftermath of several scandals and mishaps at the cia , including the the arrest that year of aldrich h ames , the most destructive doubleagent in the agency s history mr brown s commission recommended a series of structural changes , none of them revolutionary , intended to streamline the intelligence community and to end squabbling among intelligence agencies over money , power and turf the white house said it had adopted the panel s recommendations for the creation of special interagency committees on foreign intelligence and global crime both panels are to be directed by anthony lake , the national security adviser clinton administration officials said that while it was not formally announced today , the president had also accepted the recommendation for an enhanced role for the director of central intelligence in reviewing the nominations of senior intelligence officials at other agencies , including the defense department officials said the move had been opposed by a number of cabinet secretaries whose highranking nominees would have to be vetted by the current director , john m deutch , or his successors the president has decided that the director of central intelligence should have the right to concur in the appointments of all major elements in the intelligence community , said the senior intelligence official , adding that mr deutch strongly supported the move the president wants this to happen the white house also announced that it had approved two new senior intelligence positions , both requiring senate confirmation one overseeing the daytoday activities of the cia and the other coordinating activities of all intelligence agencies
new jersey s teachers are among the best paid in the nation , with an average salary of 45 , 000 but in recent years , they have been settling for the smallest wage increases since 1968 , when the state first allowed collective bargaining for teachers after more than a decade of contracts that provided annual raises of at least 8 percent , most teachers' unions have been accepting increases of 5 percent or less since 1993 frank belluscio , a spokesman for the new jersey school boards association , said the downward trend started in 1991 , when the recession was at its peak since then , governor whitman s tax cuts and a growing dissatisfaction with public schools have increased pressure for unions to accept more modest contracts , he said communities have been telling boards of education that they want a firmer hand at the negotiating table , mr belluscio said we 're seeing settlement rates come further down every quarter of every year for 166 school districts whose teacher contracts expired in 1995 , the average salary increase for 199596 was 452 percent , according to the school boards association that amounts to about 2 , 050 , based on an average teacher s salary of 45 , 350 for threeyear contracts , the total wage increase has ranged from 9 percent in riverside , a small burlington county district , to 173 percent in sayreville , a large middlesex county district a district s location and wealth does not seem to have much bearing on contract settlements teachers in the wealthy northern counties , whose salaries are usually higher , are generally getting the same raises as those in southern counties where the per capita income is lower teachers go to the bargaining table with a very real idea of what the economy is like , said ed gallagher , a spokesman for the new jersey education association , which represents 130 , 000 teachers , bus drivers and other school employees nobody ever went into this business to get rich but even though public school teachers are agreeing to more modest raises , they have been more successful at the bargaining table than professors at new jersey s public colleges and universities last month , unionized faculty members at nine state colleges agreed to a 625 percent wage increase over four years meanwhile , the faculty union at rutgers university is planning job actions because union leaders are so unhappy with the salaries and benefits that the administration is offering the contract for that union s 4 , 100 members expired last summer , and mediators have not helped the two sides settle their differences because school boards have adopted more rigid bargaining positions , new teacher contracts take longer to negotiate , and more local unions are calling for job actions to protest the delay , mr belluscio said in particular , he said , teachers have refused to attend afterschool events , have taken unscheduled days off and , in a few cases , have refused to grade homework or write college recommendations teachers in two districts south river in middlesex county and monroe in gloucester county went on strike for several days in 1995 , but in both cases the school board did not meet all of the union s demands along with smaller raises , teacher unions are accepting longer work days and school years , mr belluscio said in metuchen , a middlesex county district , teachers agreed this month to add one teaching day to the school year and 10 minutes of instructional time to each school day and in monroe , the gloucester county district where teachers went on strike last september , the union agreed to 20 extra minutes of class time each day mr belluscio said that none of the changes in collective bargaining were surprising , especially since new jersey s 600 school districts are preparing for a new financing system that will force them to be more efficient than ever the system , which is being developed by education commissioner leo f klagholz , is intended to meet a court order requiring that students around the state receive a thorough and efficient education , regardless of how much money their district can spend at a conference last weekend , members of the school boards assocation suggested that school districts should become even more prudent with salaries and benefits , which take up about 75 percent of the roughly 115 billion the state and local districts spend each year on education in particular , the association is recommending changes to the lifetime tenure system that was started in 1909 to discourage patronage hiring instead of granting all teachers automatic tenure after three years on the job , the association wants a system of renewable contract employment , in which teachers would be reevaluated every three to five years and districts would have the option of dismissing them mr belluscio says the time is ripe for tenure reform because a disproportionate number of teachers are preparing to retire , and they will be replaced by young teachers starting from scratch but mr gallagher said the new jersey education association would fight changes to the tenure system , because teachers already receive yearly evaluations and job protection is more important than ever if the legislature approves the new financing plan the commissioner has not yet defined what he means by efficiencies , mr gallagher said but all indications are that he equates efficient with cheap graph by the numbers trying to beat inflation shows schooldistricts with the highest and lowest threeyear salary increases \( source new jersey

to the editor unfortunately , tragically , there is much more to the indian child welfare act than presented by blood ties \( oped , july 19 \) this law is more than a protector of indian children as currently applied , it denies a fundamental right to millions of american women and undermines the adoption system in our country say a 14yearold girl in texas , the state i represent in congress , becomes pregnant by a fellow eighthgrader they , their parents and grandparents were born and reared in texas none have had any contact with any indian tribe they prepare to deal with this family crisis consistently with the laws of their state and nation the laws of the indian nations scattered around our country never cross their minds they make the heartbreaking decision that it is in the best interest of the baby to place her for adoption they work through their church and identify a local family to adopt her the adoption moves ahead until their attorney discovers that a deceased greatgreatgrandfather of the birth father was a member of the oglala sioux indian tribe in south dakota , making the baby 1 32d sioux the lawyer tells the mother that her baby is an indian child and that the tribe has veto power over her adoption if she chooses adoption , the tribe can require that her baby be adopted by a tribal member and removed to the reservation 900 miles away suddenly , the option of adoption is not very appealing to the girl , her family or the adopting couple under this law , the girl can choose abortion or keep the baby and the tribe has no say but she cannot place her child with a loving family without the approval of an indian nation that once claimed an ancestor of the father of her baby this mother is an american , with no suffix or prefix , yet this law imposes the law of the sioux nation between her and her baby recent senate testimony estimates that 15 million american citizens have sufficient indian heritage to trigger the statute this is unamerican \( rep \) pete geren washington , july 25 , 1996

puzzled dear puzzled you would n't read about the religious right either if its leaders had their way most of them consider the label pejorative , hopelessly associated with far right , radical right or extreme right they prefer the softer religious conservative movement or profamily movement or simply references to their various organizations the christian coalition , focus on the family and so on nonetheless , because of the sweeping character of some of their proposals , the intensity of their public stands and the sheer power of alliteration , the label has stuck that is doubly unfair , the leaders protest , since no one ever writes about their adversaries as the left , religious or otherwise so while their own , oftenbickering movement is given an aura of unity and extremism , their nameless opponents escape similar scrutiny oddly , some of those opponents have a mirrorimage complaint the religious right gets all the attention , they say , and the religious left none of course , they would like the attention without the label left , or even liberal jim wallis , the editor of the pacifist magazine sojourners and a tireless organizer of an alternative to the religious right , prefers the label progressive evangelical the interfaith alliance , a new challenger to the religious right backed by leaders of the national council of churches , is trying to grab everybody s favorite description , mainstream but the real reason there is so much less attention to what might qualify as the religious left is simpler politically , it barely exists unquestionably , there are devoted leaders \( see above \) whose religious convictions lead them to continue support for the welfare state , affirmative action , full employment , less inequality of income and wealth , stronger safety and environmental regulations , legal abortion , gay rights and a high wall between church and state so far they have been unable to constitute themselves as an independent agendasetting force with grassroots muscle , and not just junior partners in other people s coalitions does that help \? beliefs dear beliefs only a little you still have n't answered my question about the leftofcenter counterpart to the religious right some pundits compare the religious right s role in the republican party to the role the labor movement once had \( and hopes to reestablish \) in the democratic party religious right versus labor left \? sorry , it does n't ring true they are more like two ships passing in the night than true ideological adversaries still puzzled dear still puzzled here s a suggestion the real opposite number to the religious right is the lifestyle left the lifestyle left includes people who are religious and people who are not it includes some welfarestate liberals and some antigovernment libertarians what unites the lifestyle left is the belief that in regard to the widest possible range of basic choices about how to live , the state should refrain from exerting its influence the more basic the question , the less the role of the state an eloquent statement that the lifestyle left could adopt as a charter is found in planned parenthood v casey , the supreme court s 1992 ruling on pennsylvania s restrictions on abortion the passage refers to the constitution s protection of the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime , choices central to personal dignity and autonomy at the heart of liberty , the passage continues , is the right to define one s own concept of existence , of meaning , of the universe and of the mystery of human life this passage was highlighted last march by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit , in its decision upholding doctors' assistance in suicide clearly there is more than a vague link here to freedom of religion the religious right , however , thinks the courts , and the lifestyle left , have extended that notion to the social breaking point , where the right to define one s own concept of existence or the mystery of human life means leaving fundamental societal questions like when the lives of the unborn or the dying can be ended , or what constitutes a marriage up to individual choice rather than social consensus so who constitutes the lifestyle left \? obvious nominees the aclu , planned parenthood and most other abortion rights advocates , the hemlock society and other supporters of suicide assistance , gay rights groups endeavoring to legalize samesex marriage , numerous artists , entertainers and even advertisers dedicated to systematically pushing the envelope of socially admissible life styles , and the commentators and critics who rally to their defense in some cases , this constellation of groups is linked organizationally more generally , the groups are united by sympathy and a shared ethos they see an attack on one as an attack on all and most of them are lodged in the democratic party as deeply as the religious right is in the republican sorry if that s a bit heavy beliefs dear beliefs lifestyle left \? i see the ideological symmetry but would n't these people object to the label \? why not just lifestyle liberals \? puzzled dear puzzled why not just religious conservatives \? the point is that the concerns of the lifestyle left the renegotiation of longstanding social and legal norms on matters of life , death , family and sexuality are no less sweeping or adamantly pursued than those of the religious right beliefs dear beliefs so can i expect to read analyses of whether the lifestyle left has a lock on the democratic party or its platform \? will i see polls examining whether the lifestyle left s agenda is out of sync with traditional democratic voters \? will i learn about democrats' plans to keep the lifestyle left s profile low at their convention \? am i the only one whom this lack of symmetry leaves puzzled \? dear puzzled no
essipon , ghana , may 15 as the hundreds of liberian refugees whose 10day ordeal at sea ended on tuesday with a move to a makeshift camp on the outskirts of this small town recounted their travails , one word recurred with striking consistency terrible , said catherine cassell , who , along with two friends and several of their children had counted themselves lucky to have found a berth aboard the rusty freighter , the bulk challenge , which left monrovia , the wartorn liberian capital , on may 5 for the first two days we thought that , despite the horrible crowding , we would be fine , she said but then our troubles began , and i swear it was terrible on the third day of a trip to ghana that had been billed as a threeday journey , miss cassell and other passengers said , the aging nigerian ship began to list and then to creak and when crew members gave in to passenger demands for an explanation , they appeared , dressed in lifevests , and said the freighter was taking on water by that time , the ship was nearing san pedro , in western ivory coast , where the crew and passengers felt sure that relief was at hand however , the liberian refugees said , their troubles were only beginning , as was their lesson that life s cruelties can be inflicted as readily by their west african neighbors as by the militia leaders who have torn their country asunder in more than six years of fighting for the next six days , the 2 , 000 passengers had little food and water and so little room on the crammed deck that they were obliged to relieve themselves on the spot \( earlier estimates that there were 3 , 500 people aboard proved false \) the refugees watched as they were rebuffed by one west african government after another , all too exasperated by liberia s persistent civil war to help after half a day s wait on the leaky ship at san pedro , the refugees said , ivory coast authorities allowed the women and children to move into port warehouses , where they spent the next two days the men , however , were kept on board on the pretext that some were dangerous fighters the ivorians told us that by six o'clock on the third day we must be off of their land , miss cassell said and in the end they entered the warehouses and started beating us to get us back on the ship as the ship steamed eastward from san pedro , its crew was told not to attempt to dock at the ivory coast s economic capital , abidjan , where officials said that with 300 , 000 liberian refugees on their hands , they could not accept more by this time , many on the bulk challenge were becoming seriously ill , with fevers , vomiting and diarrhea spreading , and many passengers reduced to drinking seawater ivory coast authorities had allowed the ship to be resupplied with food , water and some medicines , but the passengers soon discovered that much of this relief was commandeered by nigerians on the ship possibly members of a west african peacekeeping force returning home from duty who sold the goods for steep prices these people were giving the relief food to nigerian women to cook and sell to us , said patrick lincoln , a liberian in his early 30 s even the little water we had , they were selling it to us for 1 for three cups in the end , at least three people are known to have died on the ship , but apparently none were victims of a shooting incident that west african authorities described as an attempt by passengers to take control of the freighter as it approached its next stop takoradi , ghana instead , the only gunfire passengers reported was that of a ghanaian naval vessel warning off the ship as it attempted to dock in takoradi after two days of hesitation and reversals , ghana finally allowed the ship to dock and provided a haven for the latest escapees from a war that has claimed more than 150 , 000 lives and turned 80 percent of the country s 25 million people into refugees we felt bad , man , it was terrible , said tony morris , 26 , who fled the fighting in monrovia people on board were dying , and there you had people forcing us out of their ports like many in the camp , mr morris said he had a close relative in the united states , testament to the ties that have bound the two countries since liberia was founded in 1847 by freed american slaves as he spoke , a small crowd gathered , newly arrived liberians who were enjoying showers and hot meals for the first time since they left their homes for many here , today was the first occasion to sort out bitter feelings about their exile and rejection along the coast and while they spared no criticism for the liberian militia leaders who have plunged their country into war , they expressed deep resentment for neighboring countries people get tired of liberia , and i can understand that , said nyanquoi kargbo , 34 , a doctor who was the only source of expert medical care on the ship but we get weary seeing the very people who are responsible for this tragedy being hosted in capitals around the region in fivestar hotels time and again while we go on suffering we are the innocents , he said when is someone going to do something for us \? photo liberian refugees , who spent 10 days at sea on a leaking , overcrowded freighter until ghana granted them entry , lined up for water yesterday at a camp in essipon on the ship , many had had to drink sea water \( robert grossman for the new york times \) map shows the location of essipon , ghana
federal officials investigating the crash of trans world airlines flight 800 are making a detailed study of several airline crashes caused by bombs , searching for clues that could help them determine whether the twa 747 was also brought down by a bomb although the officials said yesterday that they were not ready to declare the crash a criminal act , they are comparing the evidence gathered in the twa crash to the 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie , scotland , the 1989 downing of a french airliner over chad and a 1985 crash of an air india airliner that was attributed to a bomb the federal officials said they were consulting foreign investigators and examining material from those earlier crashes as a way of testing the theory that the parisbound boeing 747 was bombed we 've acknowledged from the beginning that there s a possibility that this could have been an act that would be comparable to those , said robert francis , the vice chairman of the national transportation safety board , who is heading the investigation and we 're doing what we would do in any accident investigation and that is comparing the things that have similarities officials also said yesterday that the catastrophic event that apparently broke the airplane in two whether it was caused by an explosion or by mechanical malfunction occurred near the front of the airplane joseph cantamessa jr , a special agent in charge with the federal bureau of investigation s new york office , said the bodies of victims sitting near the front of the plane showed more severe injuries , indicating they experienced the bulk of the significant event officials have said that the front part of the plane apparently separated from the rest of the plane and plunged into the atlantic ocean before the rest of the aircraft investigators have said in recent days that they were just one piece of evidence away from declaring the crash a criminal act , but that evidence continued to elude them yesterday some airplane parts pulled from the water off long island have initially tested positive for traces of explosives but officials said yesterday that more sophisticated tests at the fbi laboratory in washington failed to confirm any of the early positive tests metal from the airplane that investigators first thought bore the pockmarked pattern consistent with an explosion turned out to have been marred by the ocean s saltwater and officials also said that the final loud noise picked up by the airplane s cockpit voice recorder just before it stopped working on the night of the crash would not alone provide enough evidence for investigators to determine the nature of the cataclysmic event we 're all a little frustrated by not being able to find the cause of this occurrence , mr cantamessa said the investigators hope to find some clues in the records of the foreign crashes , which on the surface at least , bear some similarities to flight 800 both the pan am and the air india crashes involved 747 s in both cases , the cockpit voice recorder tapes ended with a fractionofasecond noise , which also happened on the twa flight and the twa airplane seemed to break in a somewhat similar pattern to the pan am flight the finding that the onboard recorders from the twa flight showed no mechanical problems before the crash echoed the report of the french transport ministry on the 1989 crash over the sahara desert the french ministry reported that the dc10 s data recorders showed that the flight proceeded in a normal manner until a total interruption , which translates as an explosion in flight it said the work of the crew was proceeding normally when the recording of words and electronic data abruptly stopped that crash , of a union de transports aeriens airliner over chad , killed all 170 people on board the air india crash off the coast of ireland killed 329 people , and the pan am explosion killed 270 authorities have linked both the pan am and the chad bombings to libyan terrorists the air india bombing was blamed on sikh separatists on july 16 , the day before the twa flight crashed , a french magistrate left libya , where he had been investigating the 1989 bombing but a senior american administration official said last night that the united states had no evidence of any connection between the twa crash and the pursuit of suspects by french authorities in the chad bombing the decision to conduct more thorough comparisons with the foreign crashes does not necessarily reveal any conclusions on the part of the investigators , but it reveals some of their thinking about the crash a steady stream of wreckage is moving from long island to the fbi headquarters , but none of the pieces have provided conclusive evidence to support the leading theory among law enforcement officials that the plane was destroyed by a bomb mr cantamessa said where it will wind up we do n't actually or cannot exactly say right now we 're expecting some more results from forensic stuff that has been sent down to the laboratory to this time , we have nothing conclusive

dallas just weeks after ross perot s unsuccessful run for the white house in 1992 , he started what he touted as a citizenfinanced , nonpartisan truth squad that would transform the way in which washington does the people s business but today , as mr perot tries to put a third party on the 1996 presidential ballot and ponders a second run for the oval office , what he envisioned as a source of feedback and advice that politicians could not afford to ignore is only a skeleton of what he set out to build mr perot and his allies are investing more of their energies , and a lot of his money these days in an effort to build a third party but the legacy of fluctuating dues and membership and factional infighting at united we stand america inc , where mr perot is chairman of the board , has raised serious doubts among former perot supporters about his selfportrait as a nononsense ceo able to successfully manage the nation s affairs in other words , if you ca n't form a rather small grassroots organization and do a better job than ross perot , can you imagine him trying to form a government and a cabinet that can lead our nation \? said david w morgan , for most of 1993 the volunteer chairman for the group in washington state united we stand america is a fragile skeleton at that most of its national staff has moved over to mr perot s nascent third party its membership apparently went into freefall after 1993 its 1993 and 1994 balance sheets show that dues revenue plummeted in 1994 the group , contrary to the texas billionaire s vision of a duesfinanced organization , had huge infusions of money and inkind services from mr perot state chapters have been riven by factional fighting in recent years , while battles between the group s dallas headquarters and its grassroots volunteers have spawned a network of disillusioned experotistas who oppose his autocratic management style and consider him unfit to run the organization , let alone the nation in las vegas last fall , they symbolically fired him two lawsuits charging sex discrimination have been filed by former uwsa state directors in vermont and wisconsin the remnants of the new york chapter are fighting with dallas over the right to use the organization s name and dissidents in ohio are charging that the national group and mr perot in violation of federal election laws diverted assets from their group to the one trying to create a third party mr perot s aides maintain that the charges are false the lawsuits without merit , and the dissension within the ranks , much overblown and they say the development of the reform party has in no way been a drain on the membership and the effectiveness of uwsa we want to be judged on our performance , not an arbitrary number , said russell verney , the national coordinator of mr perot s thirdparty efforts and now the group s volunteer executive director official washington gives the group some credit for pressing passage of a ban on gifts to legislators from lobbyists but critics say that the problems besetting mr perot s organization and its apparent failure to achieve mr perot s goals , overshadow any of its policy achievements and reflect flaws in mr perot s management abilities and his topdown , autocratic style he does not have the political base he does n't have the intellectual base , and he does n't have the character base , mr morgan said he does n't have the leadership base what caused the organization to fall short of mr perot s lofty goals remains unclear , although theories abound its predicament merely reflects the normal development of a nonprofit still in its infancy or it is the byproduct of mr perot s inattention or it is the inevitable fate of an organization that was just a betweenelections artifice for keeping mr perot s supporters unified until the kickoff of his 1996 presidential bid the growing pains process , said lois rozet , a los angeles resident and a coordinator of perot petition efforts in los angeles county in 1992 , who currently is a member of the organization there s energy and focus in a campaign that you do n't get in daytoday living former perot supporters tend to be less charitable the formation of united we stand america was just a front for his real aspirations to run for president again , said kirk mackenzie , a los altos , calif , resident and voluntary state chairman from mid1993 until mid1994 it was just a hoax mr verney dismisses critics as people who had a falling out with their peers in their states they are an infinitesimal fraction of the type of dissidents in the republican and democratic parties , he added but unlike mr perot s nascent third party , uwsa has always billed itself as a nonpartisan group committed to researching issues , sharing results with members , encouraging citizen involvement in national and local affairs , building state chapters , holding candidate forums and producing some infomercials starring mr perot
despite being 27 years old and living at the shore , mark oliver insists he has never before been accused of engaging in tumultuous behavior especially not on a surfboard i'm not sure i even know what tumultuous means , he said peter o'mara , a lawyer from red bank , frowned at the wrinkled police report mr oliver gave him the charge was made in spring lake , after mr oliver and three friends surfing off a jetty pretended not to hear the lifeguards ordering them in basically , tumultuous behavior means fighting , mr o'mara explained in court , it s what they sometimes downgrade an assault charge to the smile washed off mr oliver s face like an ebb tide assault \? he said for not coming in when they whistled \? mr oliver and about 20 other members of the jersey chapter of the national surfrider foundation were gathered around a big table last saturday afternoon at a hotel in sea girt to discuss what they believe is a campaign of harassment of surfers in new jersey , whose beaches are the most heavily regulated in the nation since the start of the season , at least seven surfers have been arrested and charged in several towns for being in the water when the surf s up mr oliver and his companions were arrested on july 13 , as a fading tropical storm whipped the sea and beach patrols ordered people out of the surf when the lifeguards called us in , we were thinking like , we just took a halfhour to paddle out here , he said besides , the waves were n't even that big summoned by the beach patrol , the coast guard soon arrived in a motorized raft and chased the surfers to land , where the police waited for them while a crowd gathered to watch the showdown we were handcuffed and taken away like criminals , mr oliver muttered but larry schmidt , 26 , another of the accused tumultmakers , said with a touch of pride , about 80 people were on the boardwalk cheering us mr oliver added hey , we 're out there surfing all year round we 're out when the water is 30 degrees and the waves are twice as big but in the summer , all these towns are concerned about is control such laments must be seen in the context of the summer of 1995 , known among jersey surfers as the best in at least 30 years , thanks to offshore storms that churned the atlantic while conditions were excellent for experienced surfers , however , 12 swimmers drowned off north jersey beaches last summer , the most in memory the year before , there were none authorities in seashore towns insist that the potential for lawsuits , far more than publicity over loss of life , is why beaches resound with lifeguards' whistles this summer and the red no swimming flags go up whenever the surf gets a little rough at the meeting last week , one of the veterans , bob sickler , said he had just returned from a 20 , 000mile surfing safari to the world s top beaches in jersey , i live a quartermile from the beach and i ca n't go surfing when it s headhigh \? i mean , it s chesthigh and they 're pulling us out of the water we 're not exactly talking waimea bay here , he said , referring to the surfing mecca on oahu where the only warning lifeguards give is to be careful of tiger sharks , which can take a chunk the size of a manhole cover out of a surfboard many veteran surfers , like ed mahon , 46 , of long branch , remember the the 1960 s , when some beach towns regarded surfers as bums and erected signs at the border with messages like drug addicts and surfers must register with police the beach boys grew up , however some of them even graduated from law school today , new jersey s surfers are organized , articulate and , they say , ready to act as a wedge to open up more public discussion about beach access and other public uses of a seashore that is being restored by the federal government at huge taxpayer expense mr o'mara , one of several lawyers among the surfers who met in sea girt , plans to challenge the arrests on constitutional grounds others want to begin a publicrelations drive to equate surfers with athletes who participate at their own risk in other potentially perilous sports like skiing and rock climbing they also plan to meet with town councils to work out compromises between their rights and governmental responsibility to protect public safety we get depicted as these crazed thrillseekers just waiting for the next disastrous hurricane , said mr mahon are you nuts ! i have a family i have seashore property still , i am like a 12yearold when it comes to surfing every day , i get out of bed around dawn and check out the waves drawing
mexico city , sept 22 the rankandfile members of mexico s governing political party surprised the country this weekend by starting a raucous revolt against the party leadership at the party s national assembly , the grassroots members of the institutional revolutionary party rejected the party s topdown decisionmaking methods and the major positions taken by their highest elected official , president ernesto zedillo instead , the members moved to assure for themselves a greater share of the political posts and power the party controls the actions would reverse a 15year trend in which technocrats with little party experience among them mr zedillo himself were favored for top government jobs the 4 , 423 delegates , gathered here for the 17th national assembly of the party , which is known by its spanish acronym , pri , also rejected a push by their leaders for reforms that would have punished party members implicated in corruption although the delegates were critical of mr zedillo s programs and style , they stopped short of opening a rift between the party and the powerful institution of the presidency the center of the party s power for nearly seven decades they chose to leave in the hands of the president the most important decision the party has to make the choice of its candidate for president , which is as good as choosing a successor the unexpected outcome of the assembly , the first national party meeting since mr zedillo took office , promises to draw the lines of contention more clearly between the pri and the opposition parties in upcoming elections it also is expected to make it more difficult for mr zedillo to carry out his liberalizing economic reforms , especially the privatization of petrochemicals and other governmentowned industries in the authoritarian oneparty system that has governed mexico since the late 1920 s , the party elected every president and the overwhelming majority of national legislators , state governors and town mayors a pragmatic party that encompasses a broad range of ideological viewpoints , the pri governed by doling out government jobs and patronage , rubberstamping the proposals of the president and creating a huge machine for winning elections or stealing them when necessary more than a party , the pri has been the political system of mexico but in the last ten years the party has faced challenges from opposition parties on the left and right , which grew from the discontent of mexicans who rejected the pri s corruption and who sought greater democratic choice since mr zedillo took office in late 1994 , his party s popularity has been battered by a severe recession and by harsh austerity measures including sharp cuts in government spending , which mr zedillo took to get the economy back on track in national legislative elections next year , opposition parties are believed to stand a chance of taking control of the congress the pri will also face the first direct election for the mayor of mexico city , the most powerful elected position after the president polls indicate that the pri currently has no more than 20 percent of the vote here mr zedillo began to shake up the party after it carried him to a surprisingly strong victory in 1994 he distanced himself from it , leaving it up to its leaders to enact reforms to punish corruption among pri officials in government and to build more internal democracy mr zedillo also pledged he would be the first modern mexican president to let the party select the candidate to succeed him rather than picking the candidate himself with the traditional dedazo or tap of his finger but mr zedillo s proposals unleashed the frustration of pri members passed over by recent presidents , who instead chose their friends and allies to be candidates for top public posts although party leaders attempted to restore calm in months of meetings around the country before the assembly , the unrest erupted in a tumultuous debate in a work session on saturday night that nearly led to blows between delegates and party leaders overruling the leadership , the rankandfile voted to require for the first time that every future pri candidate for president , senator or state governor must have already been elected to a government post from the party and must have been an active party member for ten years none of mexico s last five presidents , dating back to the late 1960 s , would have met those requirements because they all made their careers as government functionaries and had never stood for elected office we have had to suffer the whims of powerful technocrats who send their buddies to be governors and senators , and they do n't even know what our party stands for , cried antonio hernandez , a delegate from the state of puebla , who was greeted with roaring cheers a veteran party leader , senator eduardo andrade , took the microphone to defend to the position of the leadership we are going to send a mistaken message that we are breaking with the president , the natural leader of our party , mr andrade warned , drawing boos and hisses but when the chairman of the session shut off mr andrade s microphone to stop his unpopular speech , mr andrade joined in a melee , lunging with menacing gestures at a wellknown party leader and bringing the whole session to a onehour halt while angry delegates stormed the stage in other sessions , the delegates voted not to support mr zedillo s program to privatize the petrochemical industry mr zedillo had planned to sell off the petrochemical plants last year , but the effort has been stalled by legal and political setbacks the assembly adopted its first code of political ethics , requiring clean conduct of officials within the party and those in public office but they removed important clauses supported by the party leadership that would have imposed sanctions on party members found to have committed acts of corruption a platform paper circulated before the assembly by the party president , santiago onate laborde , called for the pri presidential candidate for the next presidential elections , in the year 2000 , to be chosen by the assembly at large the delegates rejected this clause and adopted an ambiguous measure that allows the mr zedillo alone , or with a small handful of party officials , to choose the candidate they opted for caution , said raciel trejo hernandez , a pri political strategist they were afraid too much choice from the bottom would lead to chaos in the party moving to reestablish unity , the delegates greeted mr zedillo with warm applause when he addressed them today the delegates' deepest wrath was focused on former president carlos salinas de gortari , who is in exile in ireland he is blamed for the bitter economic downturn of 1995 and suspected of corruption along with his brother raul motions for carlos salinas s expulsion from the party were raised repeatedly during the assembly but party leaders used parliamentary manuvers to avoid taking any action from the insistent chants of the assembly it was clear that pri members' strongest allegiance is not to mr zedillo but to the man who was

washington for two months , whenever i pressed muhamed sacirbey , bosnia s un delegate , about the presence of iranian troops in his country , he ducked the question finally he said , you know more about where the iranians are than we do now that mysterious response comes clear thanks to the hard digging of james risen and doyle mcmanus of the los angeles times , we learn why iranians are entrenched in bosnia , radicalizing local muslims the reason is that president clinton personally gave a secret green light two years ago that enabled iran to break the arms embargo that he was publicly supporting other presidents have tried to avoid congressional oversight of secret arms deals in the past , presidential findings to delay lawful notification of congress have been backdated or intelligence committees have been deceived by halftruthful testimony but to evade oversight , bill clinton came up with the best concealment device yet do n't even tell the cia scroll back to early 1994 , when serbs were slaughtering muslims , and many of us , including senator bob dole , were calling for lift and strike lift the arms embargo that kept the muslims from defending themselves , and launch nato strikes from the air at serbian supply lines that would have saved tens of thousands of lives but clinton opposed that policy because our european allies , who wanted the muslims to surrender , objected then croatia s president , franjo tudjman , asked the us secretly to ok iranian arms shipments through croatia to bosnia on air force one returning from richard nixon s funeral \( ! \) , clinton , tony lake of the nsc and strobe talbott of state persuaded one another that secretly facilitating arms shipments from iran was not breaking the embargo and was within the letter of the law , as the president s press secretary said this week when the deceit surfaced clinton , lake and talbott sent instructions of no instructions code for tell tudjman to go ahead and we will pretend not to know about it thus , at a time when clinton was telling us that to lift the embargo would be to endanger the french and british peacekeeping troops in bosnia , he was secretly encouraging the shipment of arms there from iran that means he was misinforming americans about why we should not send arms while secretary of state christopher was deceiving our allies about upholding the embargo and not endangering their troops when cia agents saw the smuggling channel in operation , they took the evidence to the director , then james woolsey , who suspected that somebody was running an unauthorized covert operation he properly went to lake , who bucked it to white house counsel , who passed the hot potato to anthony harrington , of the inhouse intelligence oversight board , who conducted a sixmonth investigation and concluded that the green light that secretly injected iran into the bosnian war was not covert action requiring notification of congress now the president insists there was absolutely nothing improper done to him , his guilty knowledge of embargobreaking was not improper deceiving our allies was not improper lying to the nation about why he would not send us arms to bosnia was not improper of course , concealing pertinent information from congress is never improper harrington , the former counsel to the clintongore campaign committee who secretly conducted the internal whitewash , tells me he is now ready to brief congress but will not turn over his confidential report or transcripts of testimony \( none under oath \) unless directed to do so by clinton here comes executive privilege again we can hope the senate intelligence chairman , arlen specter , does n't roll over white house defense will be we all wanted to arm the bosnians , so what s the big deal \? the big deal is we wanted the arms to come from the west , not from iran s islamic fundamentalists , who now have a foothold in europe subcontracting to terrorists always backfires the big deal is we thought we had a muchneeded arrangement of comity between congress and the executive on secret security affairs by his silent partnership with iran , clinton betrayed it
for most americans , the only good tax is a smaller one not only is it every american s unalienable right to speak evil of taxation , in election season it is every politician s duty most voters might be surprised to discover how little support this ingrained attitude gets from the nation s three longstanding religious traditions rabbi david wolpe , for example , came to the phone just after watching a speaker declare on cspan recently that taxation is thievery judaism s view is just the opposite , said rabbi wolpe , the assistant to the chancellor at the jewish theological seminary in new york as far back as the bible , where you owed tithes of all sorts , there has always been an obligation to contribute to the good of the whole what the rev j bryan hehir , a former official at the national conference of catholic bishops who teaches social ethics at harvard divinity school , said that roman catholics' attitudes toward paying taxes was probably true of most americans it s always news to catholics to hear that something they regard as \( a \) totally secular and \( b \) nothing but a burden , is in fact the exercise of a virtue for father hehir , the key is the catholic belief that the human person is inherently a social creature and has natural duties toward others the state , using taxes , is one vehicle , though not the only one , that fulfills those duties as for what the rev max stackhouse , the stephen colwell professor of christian ethics at princeton theological seminary , calls the classical tradition in protestantism , it has almost always taught that there is a positive duty to support the political powers only the sectarian , generally pacifist wing of protestantism has radically challenged christians' involvement with the state , he said james skillen , the director of the center for public justice , a religious research and educational group based in annapolis , md , even questioned the religious basis for bob dole s declaration that it s your money that government is spending as it wishes the center has working ties with conservative evangelicals as well as centrist denominations government , mr skillen said , has been ordained by god to carry out certain tasks of protecting the society and assuring justice what citizens owe for those tasks is not , in fact , their own money but the government s and how it is to be spent is quite properly decided by the political process and public officials the prejudice that we can start with the assumption that someone is stealing your money , he said , seems to me to be the wrong place to start none of these authorities pretend that his own religious tradition dictates a specific tax system or whether to increase the exemption for children or reduce the tax rate on capital gains and though the traditions do insist that government must be limited , they do not prescribe exactly where the limits should fall all that is the legitimate stuff of campaign debate what campaign debate often fosters , however , is less legitimate in the eyes of these traditions the attitude that taxes are nothing but an unavoidable evil , or at least as unavoidable as one s tax lawyer can make them one person who has studied these questions in detail is rabbi aaron levine , the samson and halina bitensky professor of economics at yeshiva university and the author of three books jointly published by ktav publishing house and yeshiva university press \( free enterprise and jewish law , 1980 economics and jewish law , 1987 , and economic public policy and jewish law , 1993 \) from the first century of this era , jewish sages discussed the principles of levying taxes for building a town wall , the ancient equivalent of national defense could everyone be compelled to pay \? should everyone pay equally , or should wealthy households , with more at risk , pay more \? what about those closer to the wall who would otherwise be especially vulnerable to marauders \? should the rules be different if the town abutted on enemy territory or was far from it \? needless to say , the talmudic commentators so thoroughly explored every argument that rabbi levine can easily link their reasoning to modern economic concepts of public goods , pareto optimality , free riders and intertemporal resource allocation for those not absorbed by the thrust and parry of talmudic texts , the ethical bottom line , rabbi levine said , is that taxation is not only justified for governmental responsibilities like national defense and police protection but also for a wider range of social welfare measures , including the prevention and relief of poverty and the rabbis said this taxation should be proportional prevention of poverty by generating employment has a higher priority than relief , rabbi levine argues , in keeping with maimonides s teaching that the highest form of charity is helping the needy help themselves as a rabbi , the yeshiva professor said that workfare is right on the mark but as an economist he rejected mr dole s supplyside strategy for generating growth and jobs , calling it totally repudiated by the record so what about flattening the tax rate \? all of these religious leaders thought their traditions leaned toward a progressive system in which not just the amount but also the proportion one pays increases with income but they acknowledged that this preference might be outweighed by practical considerations of economic efficiency rabbi levine said that judaism s sages had taught that the tax burden ought to be shared proportionally without ever clarifying what that meant he said he believed that the case for a progressive tax system , because it built in automatic stabilizers against economic tailspins or overheating , derived from jewish law s injunction that government maintain economic stability to the extent that the state can assure social welfare in ways the private sector cannot , americans should pay their taxes with equanimity , rabbi levine said indeed , within a minute or so of conversation , he said it again equanimity \? taxes \? americans \? there is a man who believes in the power of god
american investors expect to be told , promptly and publicly , all the important information they need to gauge the value of a company s stock but for weeks , apple computer inc s investors have been trading in the dark there had been , of course , conflicting reports over the status and terms of a rumored merger with sun microsystems inc , which day after day neither company confirmed nor denied the murkiness reached inky proportions yesterday morning , when buyers and sellers of apple s shares literally did not know who was running the company that mystery was finally cleared up last night when apple confirmed what several newspapers had reported early yesterday morning gilbert f amelio , a veteran silicon valley manager will become chairman and chief executive of the struggling computer maker , replacing both michael h spindler and a c markkula jr the apple announcement came long after the stock market had closed , and at an hour when the company said none of the executives would be made available for comment it was a puzzling end to a trying period for apple shareholders the rules that govern prompt disclosure of key information in the american stock market are not hard and fast but many corporate lawyers said yesterday that they found it surprising and worrisome that apple s shares changed hands all day in nasdaq trading without the company s confirming or denying or commenting at all on the published reports that the company s chief executive had been dismissed newspapers including the wall street journal and the san jose \( calif \) mercury news reported yesterday that apple had dismissed mr spindler , who had been given the board s public support just 10 days earlier indeed , the journal reported that the move to oust him had come after a meeting of apple s board on wednesday and a telephone conference the following day some copies of the new york times yesterday cited the journal and mercury news reports mr spindler s replacement , according to these early accounts , was to be mr amelio but throughout the day yesterday and until midevening , apple remained silent and while national semiconductor announced mr amelio s resignation shortly after 11 am more than 90 minutes after the stock market opened the company declined to indicate his subsequent job plans national semiconductor did say that the members of the office of the president would be running the company temporarily while a successor for mr amelio was sought that is much more information than apple shareholders were given all day about who might be running their company left to guesswork , investors sent apple shares up 875 cents each yesterday to close at 2925 on nasdaq volume of nearly 5 million shares meanwhile , on the new york stock exchange , national semiconductor s shares closed down 125 cents apiece , at 17625 , on volume of 2 million shares nasdaq rules require any listed company to make prompt disclosure of any material information that may affect the value of its securities or influence investors' decisions but apple did not release any clarifying information about mr spindler s status during the entire day of trading yesterday and nasdaq apparently did not press the company to do so michael w robinson , a spokesman for the market , said at midmorning that nasdaq was monitoring the situation , but was not planning to initiate a trading halt asked if nasdaq had asked apple to clarify mr spindler s status , the spokesman said market officials had been in contact with apple after the close of trading yesterday at 4 30 , eastern time , mr robinson said , we feel we have met our obligations the classic wall street response to any serious potholes in the market s life is gallows humor , and by midday , market players were circulating a joke when an apple executive goes to lunch , he tells his secretary 'if the boss calls , get his name' but such circumstances are not laughing matters for investors or regulators , noted john c coffee jr , a securities law professor at columbia university the regulators have this tradeoff , mr coffee said , between imposing a trading halt until apple makes full disclosure or else not enforcing their rules requiring timely , prompt disclosure which result in the rule being unenforceable he added no one likes a trading halt because it denies the investor liquidity but if you 're going to have rules , you 've got to occasionally enforce them mr robinson defended nasdaq s inaction , saying that the newspaper reports had put all interested shareholders on a level playing field though the reports were conflicting , and unconfirmed , he said , these reports had gotten full dissemination , so there was no need for us to do anything on the new york stock exchange , where national semiconductor shares trade , the rules require a company to release quickly any news that would affect the value of its shares people familiar with national semiconductor s decision to announce mr amelio s resignation when it did said that the announcement was initiated by the company , without prodding from the big board apple s long silence seems kind of unbelievable , said janet love , a securities lawyer with keck , mahin cate in chicago speaking before the late announcement , she speculated , maybe there is some reason not yet disclosed and they are trying to get a handle on it many who have been following apple s saga also conjecture that the company chose not to comment because it was considering a merger offer from sun microsystems state and federal court decisions have generally allowed companies to delay disclosure of important developments while a merger is pending last week , according to people familiar with the negotiations , sun presented apple s board with a merger offer that valued apple s stock at 23 a share far below its trading price then and even now since then , the shares have plunged in price , and both standard poor s and moody s investors service have downgraded apple s debt on thursday , sun raised its merger offer , these people say because apple and sun have continued to refuse to confirm or deny that such talks were being held , it remained unclear yesterday whether the negotiations were continuing if you 've got a new ceo , it is hard to see what business reason there is not to disclose it it is pretty important who the president of a company is , said victor leukow , a corporate finance lawyer at cleary , gottlieb , steen hamilton in new york his best guess , he said , was that perhaps the unsettled nature of a potential merger creates a business reason to delay disclosure on the ceo issue ms love noted that a company was more at risk legally for making an inaccurate announcement than for simply remaining silent and yet , it still seems that the more prudent thing would be to halt trading , she said
at the wadsworth atheneum in hartford , the retrospective of the work of john biggers which includes 127 drawings , prints , sculptures and paintings qualifies as a blockbuster in every way it is a big , powerful and emotionally moving show the only thing missing is celebrity status but as the show \( organized by the museum of fine arts in houston \) travels around the country , and mr biggers s work is seen and discussed by a wider audience , that omission should be taken care of for an exhibition so sprawling , its installation at the atheneum \( overseen by dierdre bibby , the museum s curator of african american art \) is surprisingly concise in telling a coherent story of an artist s progress from regionalist to visionary from the beginning , in the 1940 s , mr biggers had a very fluid graphic style that lent itself to public murals , of which he made many at the start of his career , he was a social realist , a tradition inherited from the depression era of the 1930 s and from artists like thomas hart benton , whom he often matches in terms of overflowing content but mr biggers also focused on the dignity of downtrodden individuals like a garbage man and a prostitute he was born in 1924 in rural north carolina , and in his work still alludes to his humble beginnings they are personified by the recurring image of the shotgun house , a compact dwelling with rooms one behind the other , such that a bullet would go right through without hitting either side such houses with peaked roofs transmute into shrines , and for mr biggers , symbols of the nurturing family the houses are usually accompanied by women whom he boldly affirms are carriers of life he unabashedly works out the biggest conceivable scheme the cycle of birth and death the title of his retrospective is view from the upper room , meaning from heaven , or more generally , a place of rest and renewal his vision has grown more and more celestial the major shift in his art was initiated by trips to west africa , beginning in 1957 when countries like ghana and nigeria first gained independence using conte crayon , and mostly in sepia and black , he shows exceptional skill in drawing african villagers and village life in closeup detail and with obvious empathy he immortalized tribal chieftains as well as a man being throttled in his precision he is reminiscent of artists of the northern renaissance who developed a fresh , clear way of observing the world then , in the unanticipated manner of an artist who is constantly growing , the firsthand african experience was put to use in narratives that have their full flowering beginning in the 1980 s figures become like angular west african sculptures , and the triangular roofs of shotgun houses form geometric patterns like those in west african textiles in short , there is a synthesis of the african experience and his social concerns , and the blend becomes authentically spiritual , with a surreal tinge this retrospective moves like a river , and because john biggers' art has clearly gathered force over five decades , visitors will feel genuinely moved there is progress of another sort in another major exhibition consisting of 60 paintings , most of them house paint on poster board , at the atheneum in search of ellis ruley is in part the saga of glenn smith , an art collector from california , who in 1989 found a painting of a ghostly white adam and eve , done in a primitive style , at a new england flea market familiar with the art of the selftaught or to use the current widespread term outsider art mr smith tracked down other works by the artist , whom he identified as ellis ruley , and learned his story through talking with surviving members of ruley s family with outsider artists , biography is as important , and frequently as compelling as the art itself ellis ruley was born in norwich in 1882 , and began painting probably soon after 1929 when he was disabled after being hit by a truck his disability payment allowed him to move to a forested hill in a previously allwhite neighborhood in norwich ms bibby , in the museum s press release , speculates that painting afforded a retreat because ruley was constantly harassed for being in the neighborhood and for being married to a white woman as is typical of such artists , it is impossible to speak of ruley s development none of the works in the show carry dates relative dates can be put on some works because ruley borrowed specific motifs and imagery from magazines like life and the national geographic and from movie posters he also took from wellknown paintings the influence of henri rousseau is obvious , the french academics less so shows like this one , which was organized by the san diego museum of art , have a certain fascination selftaught artists across the board have a burning need to express themselves , and are not concerned at all with their careers , an obsession with many wellschooled artists in outsider art viewers can look for the roots of artistic impulses , and ruley s drive seems to be for expressing both sides of the coin , the idyllic and malevolent aspects of life grapefruit picking time , for example , featuring six women lined up on a ladder and an abundance of fruit , expresses peacefulness if not hedonism , while southmore , taking a bath with the seneoras , also a composition with six young women , is filled with potential danger one of the women is being tossed into water by her companions like rousseau or edward hicks in this country , ruley seems to have been fascinated by animals , and he can offer up his version of a peaceable kingdom but he can easily switch to violent aspects of animals a bobcat preying upon a field of horses , or a tiger attacking a man the constant to and fro of sensation seems to this writer the most compelling feature of this mysterious artist the art of john biggers view from the upper room is at the wadsworth atheneum in hartford through july 14 in search of ellis ruley continues at the atheneum through july 28 photos grapefruit picking time , left , and southmore , taking a bath with the seneoras , above , are among the works by ellis ruley of norwich the garbage man , above , and study for view from the upper room , left , among the works by john biggers at the wadsworth atheneum in hartford
five months ago , when bob dole announced that he was resigning from the senate , he said he looked forward to facing voters without office or authority , a private citizen , a kansan , an american , just a man the construction seemed to promise a glimpse of another side of mr dole an ordinary , casual , sitaroundthetable , private side at various points since then , mr dole s campaign has tried to present him in a more intimate setting walking on the beach with his wife , chatting with old friends in russell , kan , sitting by the pool but none of these images seem to have made much impact indeed , so little has emerged of mr dole s private persona that the oneliners he injected into sunday s debate were widely described as the closest he has come to selfrevelation and now , less than four weeks before the election , even his aides acknowledge that mr dole has not provided voters with much of a picture of a life apart from politics this deficiency repeats a pattern that has vexed mr dole in his previous national campaigns each time he has run for president in 1980 , 1988 and 1996 he has faced opponents who have , quite deliberately , played up their casualness in front of the cameras and , according to mr dole himself , gained political mileage from doing so advisers to mr dole say he has difficulty presenting a more casual self to voters in part because he is a genuinely private , as opposed to a selectively private , person in part , they say , the difficulty is a result of his war injury , which makes it hard for him to engage in many everyday activities but interviews with dozens of his colleagues and associates over the last six months suggest that these explanations , while true , are also incomplete mr dole is almost always pictured engaged in politics because that is almost always what he is doing and what he enjoys doing as one longtime adviser put it , he has n't cared about anything else previous primaries opponents presented images of everyman during the 1980 republican primaries , george bush often went out jogging , a clutch of reporters panting behind him ronald reagan frequently repaired to his ranch , where he was photographed relaxing in full western attire for his part , mr dole spent most of the primary season in washington , working on windfall profit tax legislation and conscientiously showing up for almost every vote in the senate in the first primary , in new hampshire , he was trounced , receiving just 607 votes out of the more than 145 , 000 cast a few months after the primaries were over , a political scientist writing a book on the campaign asked mr dole s aides to discuss his campaign strategy would it have helped , he asked , if mr dole had done anything , like mr bush s jogging , that could have communicated a symbolic message to voters \? and was there any similar sort of thing that mr dole liked to do \? no , one aide , john crutcher , replied he diets he limits his ice cream intake he loves ice cream , but he ca n't eat as much as he likes another aide , anne mclaughlin , said the senator does n't do anything he s a senator he is a very bright man who also has a very warm heart , but he s not a golfer eight years later , mr dole once again faced mr bush in the primaries and once again , by his own account , he lost the contest at least in part because of mr bush s effectiveness at loosening up in front of voters leaving the iowa caucuses , which he had won , mr dole seemed in a strong position to beat mr bush in the new hampshire primary then , the weekend before the primary , the state was engulfed by a snowstorm most political events were canceled mr bush headed outside to toss some snowballs , wield a shovel and drive a snowplow later , mr dole listed mr bush s telegenic antics as a main cause of his defeat in new hampshire , a defeat that led to the collapse of his entire candidacy and he would suggest to one of his biographers , jake h thompson , that in a battle that turned on such images , he was , because of his injury , inevitably going to be at a disadvantage we had a big snowstorm , mr dole told mr thompson , recalling the days leading up to the 1988 new hampshire primary bush was out there shoveling snow and driving trucks , things i could n't do so he had all the news coverage we were wandering around grocery stores , shaking hands this year , mr dole faces an opponent , bill clinton , who has , perhaps more than any other presidential candidate and certainly more than any other president , exposed his casual side for public consumption over the last four years , americans have watched him jog around washington in shorts , indulge his appetite for doughnuts , even reveal his taste in underwear images of mr clinton playing golf , or the saxophone , or his favorite card game , hearts , have become such standard fare that they have come to constitute what might be called an iconography of ordinariness by contrast , mr dole s private side has been all but invisible as he has crisscrossed the country , mr dole has rarely been shown taking part in any sort of activity that would conventionally be called recreation instead he has appeared addressing rallies , making speeches and shaking hands in other words , as a political candidate efforts by campaign 'not one for stunts , ' a former aide says advisers argue that while mr dole s narrow public image is surely liability , it also reflects one of his most attractive qualities his genuineness
london , oct 6 the hurdles that prime minister john major must clear to unite his demoralized conservative party and lead it to victory in the coming election have been raised higher at an acutely inconvenient moment the eve of the conservatives' annual conference the labor party , under its dynamic young leader , tony blair , lifted the bar last week by staging a crisply efficient conference of its own in blackpool with none of the fractious theatrics of past labor gatherings in a new gallup poll after mr blair s ardent speech to the faithful and his team s strict control over the proceedings , labor s lead lead widened from 24 to 33 points this season s disruptive political dramas seem more likely to occur in bournemouth , where the tories open their conference on tuesday , the last such meeting before a general election , which is expected in the spring the issues dominating the conservatives' agenda are a growing civil war within the party over integration with europe , and a new scandal involving members of parliament the divisions within the party over europe sharpened on saturday after mr major bolted from a meeting of european union ministers in dublin he said he had left because of a deeply offensive speech by klaus hansch , a german who is president of the european parliament , who accused the british of blackmail tactics mr major told the ministers that such attacks were unacceptable behavior and then flew back to london , leaving his place at a formal dinner in dublin castle empty actually , labor s position on the most imminent decision regarding europe , agreement to a single currency by 1999 , is remarkably similar to mr major s both favor postponing a final decision while remaining in negotiations and maintaining the option of not joining in the first wave while his defiant performance will sit well with many britons who resent pressure on their country to conform to standards set by european governments , it will also embolden the increasingly vociferous euroskeptic wing of mr major s party , which threatens party unity labor succeeded in stilling its leftist dissidents who chafed at the party s abandonment of socialist principles , but mr major faces a more formidable task in quieting his rightist detractors who want britain to declare its opposition to a single currency in recent weeks , the party s socalled grandees , like former prime minister edward heath and former foreign secretary douglas hurd , have denounced the euroskeptics as shortsighted , and mr major s outspoken chancellor of the exchequer , kenneth clarke , has derided the dissidents' argument as pathetic the skeptics , led by john redwood , the man who challenged mr major in a leadership vote last year , have scheduled forums in bournemouth where they plan to flaunt their objections their cause received a boost tonight when lord mcalpine , a former conservative party treasurer and deputy chairman and a frequent critic of mr major s leadership , announced he would leave the party to join the fledging singleissue referendum party of sir james goldsmith , which is dedicated to forcing a national vote on britain s future in europe the sleaze factor that dogged the conservatives in the early 1990 s returned to haunt the party last week with revelations that a member of parliament named neil hamilton and 20 other tories had been accepting money from a wellknown lobbyist , ian greer , supposedly for doing favors for his corporate clients mr hamilton s case stood out as a singular embarrassment because when similar charges were published by the guardian in 1994 , he enlisted the help of tory colleagues in amending a 300yearold law to permit him and mr greer to sue the newspaper in the legal discovery process , the newspaper s lawyers turned up documents last week confirming payments from mr greer to mr hamilton and showing that under questioning in 1994 , mr hamilton had said that he had no financial relationship with mr greer in addition , mr hamilton was accused of accepting free lodging from the ritz hotel in paris , free shopping vouchers at harrod s and brown envelopes stuffed with 50pound notes from mohammed alfayed , the owner of the hotel and the department store , in exchange for doing his bidding in commons mr hamilton , once a minister in mr major s government , and mr greer promptly dropped their 16 million lawsuit tonight mr greer announced he was stepping down as head of the westminster part of his lobbying business but mr hamilton reiterated his assertions that he had done nothing wrong and his determination to run for reelection the case grew worse for the conservatives today when it emerged that david willets , a minister and one of the party s most highly regarded intellects , had interceded with a parliamentary committee to persuade its tory majority to stall the investigation
not out of africa how afrocentrism became an excuse to teach myth as history by mary lefkowitz 222 pp new york a new republic book basic books 24 black athena revisited edited by mary r lefkowitz and guy maclean rogers 544 pp chapel hill , nc university of north carolina press cloth , 55 paper , 1995 the classical antecedents of western civilization have long served to justify the study of ancient greece and rome philosophy , mathematics , sculpture , architecture , historiography , even democracy itself proclaimed the genius of the greeks and their heirs in rome a broader perspective would at once unsettle so confident an opinion after all , the chinese did something on their own in philosophy and science , the assyrians in astronomy , the indians in architecture as for democracy , what the greeks practiced , with the ownership of slaves and the silencing of women , could hardly be promoted as a model for today the porousness of greek culture and the parallels to its achievements in other cultures have never been a secret from joseph scaliger in the renaissance to walter burkert in the 1980 s , scholars have recognized and investigated the debts of the greeks to nongreek achievements the greeks did not emerge , like athena from the head of zeus , fully armed with their arsenal of culture , and few serious writers ever claimed that they did an expression like the greek miracle was a catchy phrase for great drama , heroic statues and the parthenon , but all this had its historical context for the greeks themselves , the context was phoenicia and egypt readers of herodotus know that he believed that cadmus , the founder of thebes , was a semite , and that many of the names of the greek gods came from egypt diodorus of sicily , writing in the second half of the first century bc , went to egypt and was prepared to attribute large segments of greek culture to that venerable land a little later on , some greek philosophers were even prepared to believe that plato had learned his philosophy from moses none of this is new , but alien influence is one thing , the arrogation of an alien culture is another the extent of the debt of greek culture to egypt has been so enlarged in some quarters recently as to leave the greeks with virtually nothing of their own in 1987 , martin bernal published the first installment of a voluminous work entitled black athena the afroasiatic roots of classical culture with a formidable array of erudition , the author , a sinologist at cornell university , explicitly set out to lessen european cultural arrogance by reassigning many of the greeks' achievements to noneuropean cultures such an objective is not intrinsically reprehensible , and no one could accuse him of taking short cuts however , his research was full of easily refuted errors and produced at times what the classicist emily t vermeule called the world turned upside down but mr bernal s mistakes should not be taken as an excuse to ignore the larger issues he raised , particularly modern ideas of the origins of western civilization as they have evolved over the last three centuries he was right to emphasize the egyptomania that led to freemasonry and the magic flute , and he was right to chronicle the demolition of egyptian cultural primacy in favor of the greeks mr bernal s attempt to accept in full the ancient traditions of greek indebtedness to phoenicia and egypt , and then to enlarge them , provoked a storm of protest unprecedented in modern classical scholarship in north america mary lefkowitz s not out of africa is now the definitive statement on the whole controversy and its implications her book illustrates why a subject that might seem academic and innocuous turns out to be so explosive america watchers in europe have found themselves bewildered by the bernal phenomenon , even though some of them have been caught up in it in his contribution to black athena revisited , a collection of papers edited by ms lefkowitz and guy maclean rogers , both classicists at wellesley college , the eminent italian archeologist mario liverani observes , with palpable impatience , 'black athena' must be the most discussed book on the ancient history of the eastern mediterranean world since the bible what ignited the fire in this debate was twofold the suggestion that modern classical studies had a covertly racist agenda in elevating greek culture over egyptian or phoenician , and the espousal of mr bernal s work by the current generation of afrocentric theorists mr bernal locates the racist program in german classical scholarship of the 19th and the early 20th centuries scholarship that indisputably dominated the study of antiquity for a century although no one would question the integrity of the great german classical scholars who constructed the greece mr bernal wants to bring down , the cultural atmosphere that encouraged their work is open to question paul oskar kristeller , a great medievalist now in his 90 s , has troubled to say in print that mr bernal was wrong about the german classical scholarship he knew as a student however , the late otto neugebauer , an equally great scholar with an unrivaled command of egyptian and ancient near eastern science , was a student in germany at roughly the same time as mr kristeller he told me that mr bernal was right for a sample of

st louis , oct 3 it was not a mammoth shot , a laser line drive or a towering home run that put the st louis cardinals one victory from their first national league championship series since 1987 no , it was a nubber off the end of tom pagnozzi s bat in the eighth inning today , a ball that floated just beyond the reach of padres pitcher trevor hoffman and gave st louis a twogamestonone lead in the threeoffivegame series that is headed to san diego it s got to be the softest gamewinning rbi i 've ever had , said pagnozzi , the cardinals' catcher i 've hit some suicide squeeze bunts harder than that harder , perhaps , but not as well placed pagnozzi s blow off hoffman s glove bounced to second baseman jody reed , who threw out pagnozzi at first as brian jordan raced home from third with what proved to be the decisive run in the cardinals' 54 victory before a record crowd of 56 , 752 at busch stadium game 3 will be saturday at jack murphy stadium the padres need a threegame sweep to advance the last thing we wanted to do was come in here and lose the first two , padres manager bruce bochy said it s really pretty simple now we lose , we go home i have all the confidence in the world that this club will come back and play good ball hoffman , a righthander with 42 saves this year , had just entered the game to pitch to pagnozzi after reliever doug bochtler walked jordan , who advanced to second on a groundout by gary gaetti , and then intentionally walked john mabry bochtler then made things worse by unleashing a wild pitch into the dirt that advanced the runners to second and third with one out to get the lead runner to third , that was a huge break to get , st louis manager tony la russa said enter hoffman , who tried to sneak a ball past the righthandedhitting pagnozzi over the outside corner i hit it like he threw it , soft , pagnozzi said that s the kind of ball pitchers miss , the soft ones anything hit hard they can grab because it s a selfdefense catch something softer is tougher for them to handle jordan was going on contact and would have been doubled up had hoffman caught the ball instead , he scored easily those are the chances you take , jordan said today it worked pagnozzi s run batted in broke a 44 tie after the cardinals had blown a 41 lead built on a threerun double by ron gant in the fifth off padres reliever dario veras dennis eckersley , who turned 42 years old today , collected his second save of the series by retiring the padres in order in the ninth reliever rick honeycutt got the victory for pitching the eighth , but the achievement award went to starter andy benes , who did not allow a hit through four innings and eventually scattered six hits and four runs in sevenplus innings benes , a former padre , struck out nine and helped with his bat benes s sacrifice bunt in the third inning set up the cardinals' first run , and he singled and scored during a threerun fifth , highlighted by gant s rocket to center field he was the real star , la russa said of benes andy has pitched so well all year and he has been one of the pitchers who has done things offensively he got a nodecision but he was outstanding the padres had their moments ken caminiti , who struck out three times in the cardinals' 31 victory tuesday and in his first time up today , crushed a home run in the fifth off benes to tie the score , 11 in the sixth , san diego cut the cardinals' 41 lead to 43 with two runs that scored on a single by tony gwynn and a throwing error by center fielder willie mcgee the padres tied it , 44 , in the eighth when the pinchhitter scott livingstone singled and scored on a groundout by steve finley livingstone and rickey henderson were moved into scoring position on a perfect sacrifice bunt by gwynn , the seventime batting champion a real baseball play , la russa said the cardinals , however , survived i'm confident we 'll play real hard and not take anything for granted , la russa said but we 've got a real good club and i feel like we should get a win inside pitch the lefthander donovan osborne , who cut his thumb on a champagne bottle during the cardinals' divisionwinning celebration last week , is fit enough to start saturday s game he will oppose the padres' joey hamilton giants fire three coaches san francisco , oct 3 \( ap \) wendell kim , bobby bonds and jim davenport will not return as coaches for the san francisco giants next season , the team announced today we felt it was best for the organization to take a different approach , general manager brian sabean said bonds , the team s batting coach since 1993 , is the father of giants outfielder barry bonds kim has been the giants' thirdbase coach for five seasons davenport , who was the team s manager in 1985 , served as firstbase coach in '96 photo ron gant clearing the bases with a fifthinning double that gave the cardinals a 41 lead in their game 2 victory over the padres yesterday \( associated press \)

rio de janeiro , april 20 a confrontation in northern brazil between families seeking land to farm and the police ended in bloodshed this week , when the police opened fire and killed 19 people the clash between rural families and the police was one of the most violent since last august , when organizations seeking land reform announced they would increase wildcat occupations of the vast unproductive estates that dominate the brazilian countryside to step up pressure on the brazilian government the most recent clash took place in the state of para on wednesday , when state police officers were sent to clear a highway the homesteaders had been occupying for two days the attack resembled a predawn raid against squatters occupying land in the western state of rondonia last august that showdown ended in the deaths of at least 11 people brazil has one of the most uneven land distributions in the world , with 45 percent of the land belonging to 1 percent of the population the leaders of the land reform movement contend that 15 million people out of brazil s population of 150 million are seeking land the government says that figure is exaggerated while the government has agreed to redistribute land , state and local governments are dominated by landowners who have resisted the moves some have hired private armies to defend their claims under brazilian law , land that is occupied and used for 10 years becomes the property of the person living on it the killings this week , which were filmed by a local television crew and shown on national television on thursday , led to outrage shame read friday s banner headline in the jornal do brasil the tapes contradicted accounts by the police that demonstrators had shot first the film showed police officers firing machine guns into the air as they arrived as the demonstrators , some throwing stones , advanced toward the police , the officers fired directly at them nineteen people were killed and some 40 wounded , including two police officers at local hospitals , doctors said there were signs that some homesteaders were executed president fernando henrique cardoso strongly criticized the police incompetence , and announced he would sent federal troops to protect the homesteaders nothing justifies police shooting people who are demonstrating their opinions , he said mr cardoso said that his government was fulfilling its pledges to grant unused land to poor families , although activists accuse the president of inflating statistics mr cardoso has vowed to settle 280 , 000 landless families and says he settled 40 , 000 last year on friday , he also pledged to speed up two bills that had been stalled in congress one would subject military police to prosecution in civil courts , and the second would speed up the legal procedures for the government appropriation and redistribution of unproductive land he appealed to the leaders or the land reform movement to drop their strategy of confrontation a step diolinda alves da silva , leader of the movement for the landless , ruled out friday whoever dies , we lose , he said but there are plenty more to continue our fight few people expect that the latest deaths will alter the collision course that both sides appear to have set upon in the last 10 years , 220 people have died in the fight over land , according to the churchbased pastoral land commission and while mr cardoso has pledged that the police will be punished for shooting down the demonstrators , none of those involved in last summer s massacre of rural workers have been brought to trial photo after the police opened fire on demonstrators demanding land in the northern brazilian state of para , the bodies of some of the 19 people who died were unloaded from a truck used to carry them to a nearby town \( associated press \)
newark although its title should be warning enough , art with conscience , at the newark museum , may still surprise viewers with its unseasonable dourness all the artists involved have political axes to grind , and some have reputations dating back to the golden age of protest in the 1960 s and 70 s nevertheless , the general usversusthem tone is set by one of the younger participants , julia scher , who began her career in video in the mid1980 s ms scher s installation , information america , which greets visitors entering the museum from the parking lot side , centers on an office desk equipped with a computer but it is dominated by monitors overhead , five of them , glaring blue and baleful while at the same time reporting the action taking place in the gallery as explained in a wall label , the artist is asking rhetorically \( and somewhat disingenuously \) what such surveillance is for , whom it benefits and so on adjoining this installation is adrian piper s , which tackles racism by way of appropriated photographs portraying groups of black men , women and children having a good time outdoors in the snow , indoors at parties the photographs are cheerful blackandwhite blowups made ominous by the phrases superimposed on them you are safe , we are around you and the like and hang inside a booth bringing home the artist s point are the pictures displayed on the booth s exterior , notably one featuring the corpse of a black man dangling from a tree all the causes , from the holocaust to aids , are spoken for , but none more vociferously than feminism mimi smith , who came out of an avantgarde movement at rutgers university in the 1960 s , contributes many assemblages , some of them reconstructions of earlier works bearing on the tyranny of fashion in the artist s words , the 1966 piece that combines a zipper with lines of stitching refers to the infamous little black dress , one of many uniforms imposed on women apropos the recent gray pinstripe suit , inventively trimmed with steel wool , ms smith remarks that women still have to be fortified for their duties in the corporate workplace annette lemieux raises the spirits by humorously bestowing the title left right left right on 30 raised fists excerpted from photographs taken during the golden age and mounted on sticks they stand in a cluster as if awaiting a new generation of marchers the caption , having described the piece as frighteningly confrontational , solemnly points out that protests pit one side against another a slap in the face for anyone who dreams of a protest that brings the two together satirical humor and burlesque are robert colescott s principal weapons in the fight against racism , and he uses them to especially good effect in a 1977 painting , cactus jack at el dorado a goofylooking white goldminer stands in a river , holding a pan of nuggets , with the word eureka written beside him coolies capering on the far side of the river follow suit with euleka , but the lone american indian has nothing to say but ugh meanwhile , in the foreground , a turbaned black woman continues to cook the miner s food over a campfire , and

lives on in the united states , is regarded by nutritionists as symptomatic of a mineral deficiency , but in the label for the work , it is identified as a tradition reflecting the woman s ethnic identity while the conclusions are not mutually exclusive , there is no doubt that in ms saar s hands the custom takes on spiritual connotations when it comes to the same artist s rosa negra , a large bust of a woman , blackened with tar and ornamented with tin cutouts of victorianstyle flowers , some viewers may choose to respond to the work s esthetic merits others may prefer to follow the caption , which invokes the fashion bogeyman by saying that the carving poignantly deals with the need for women to conform to a feminine ideal of beauty notwithstanding the presence of the brightly

in 1987 , allan bloom , then an obscure translator of plato and rousseau , touched a raw nerve when he argued in his book the closing of the american mind that the surrender of college and university administrations and faculties to the demands of student , feminist and black power movements in the 1960 s and 1970 s had fatally compromised american higher education writing with zest and hyperbole , the political philosopher compared radical feminism to the reign of terror in the french revolution , dismissed the anthropologist margaret mead as a sexual adventurer , likened the woodstock gathering to hitler s nuremberg rallies and denounced cultural relativism , which treats all cultures as equals professor bloom called this the suicide of science he also argued that efforts to include nonwestern cultures in the curriculum were displacing what he regarded as the more valuable teaching of the western canon the book appeared on the new york times bestseller list for 10 weeks , sold more than a million copies and made professor bloom , who died in 1992 , one of the most widely quoted and criticized authors while professor bloom has his followers , many liberalminded scholars are now saying he has finally met his match even before its official publication date on sept 3 , the opening of the american mind \( beacon press , 20 \) , by lawrence w levine , a longtime professor of cultural history at the university of california at berkeley , is being both hailed and denounced with unusual fervor professor levine s book is a defense of all that professor bloom held unholy the debate centers on how open or closed society should be to many cultures the enemy to professor bloom was cultural relativism and the lack of restraint that came with it professor levine , on the other hand , champions multiculturalism , which he sees as the inevitable , and praiseworthy , product of constitutional democracy multiculturalism , professor levine said in an interview , means that in order to understand the nature and complexities of american culture , it is crucial to study and comprehend the widest possible array of the contributing cultures and their interaction with one another among the major points made in his book are these conservative critics like professor bloom , who blame the fragmentation of american society on the university , do not realize that it has been endemic in the united states from the outset the college curriculum is not immutable , as professor bloom said , but has steadily evolved over the last 200 years the prospect for the future is increasing openness , greater inclusiveness , expanded choice , the study of the modern as well as of the ancient , a concentration on american , african and asian as well as european culture professor levine is also critical of higher education he calls for more courses that build on one another , minimizing jargon , better communication with colleagues in other disciplines and a renewed emphasis on teaching ability throughout the summer , as the book became available , scholars began to take sides this is the book we 've been waiting for , said stanley n katz , president of the american council of learned societies it should put an end to the 'culture war' talk lynne cheney , who served as chairwoman of the national endowment for the humanities under presidents reagan and bush , and who is criticized in the book , disagreed it s the sameold , sameold , she said it s the left deliberately misconstruing the arguments of its opponents while offering no substantive evidence for its own a macarthur fellow , professor levine is the former president of the organization of american historians after spending 32 years at berkeley , he joined the faculty of george mason university in fairfax , va , where he now teaches history what i tried to show in this book , he said , is that the genius of america has been its ability to renew its essential spirit by admitting a constant infusion of different peoples who demand that the ideals and principles embodied in the constitution be put into practice the result has been to open america to great diversity , and colleges and universities are beginning to reflect this heterogeneity it has not led to repression as bloom argued , but to the very opposite a flowering of ideas and scholarly innovation unmatched in our history professor bloom s book , he said was a reaction to this he and the people who agreed with him could not accept the expansion of interests , the less parochial world view , and the more comprehensive view of what was important to teach and to learn over the years , many authors have written intellectual sequels to professor bloom s book including william bennett , dinesh d souza , roger kimball and john searle and not a few authors also have attacked professor bloom among them michael berube , henry louis gates jr , gerald graff , francis oakley , peter n stearns and w b carnochan the battle of the books did not originate with allan bloom it can be traced back at least to 1762 when rousseau argued in emile that it was more important for students to read a commercial novel like robinson crusoe than to read aristotle
the summer i was 19 , i earned good money as a waitress and spent too much of it on bricabrac i was living on long beach island , where flea markets and craft shows proliferate in warm weather like ice cream trucks on gray mornings when sunbathing was out of the question , a group of us would comb the neighborhoods , sniffing out bargains to haul back to college and stow on a shelf our top priority was the beach haven flea market , which took place the first saturday of each month we would ride bikes equipped with hefty baskets , eager to load them with trinkets the vendors , in bicentennial park , would hawk tube socks , antique brooches and everything in between we snapped up the requisite bargains six hair clips for 1 , three tshirts for 5 but most of my acquisitions that summer were extraneous there was a flowered pillow , a cracked blue pitcher , sheet music for these foolish things at one point , my friend tina spent 15 on a ring whose stone resembled an eyeball this peculiar form of impulsebuying continued every summer until i graduated from college , starting out slow and peaking just before labor day the crowds of treasurehunters always swelled in august , when the beach grew tiresome and sun worshipers began seeking other forms of hedonism i stopped frequenting flea markets four years ago , when i got married and received a lifetime supply of tchotchkes but new jersey continues to be a mecca for people enamored of crafts , antiques and cheap tube socks this summer , craft shows , antique fairs and the like will take place in parks and fire halls , on boardwalks and beside lighthouses some will feature the work of local sculptors , potters , glass blowers and basket weavers vendors from around the country will fill the stalls at other shows , setting up shop like miniwalmarts i was pleased to discover that long beach island is home to one of the season s first craft shows from may 30 through june 9 , jane law s art studios and gallery in surf city will feature the lbi quilt show , exhibiting 60 new and antique quilts although it is primarily an exhibit , a few quilts will be for sale , with prices starting around 350 june begins with a ripple of craft and antique shows , whetting appetites for the tidal wave in july and august chester , a morris county town rife with antique shops , will hold its annual antiques show on june 1 and 2 , with more than 50 dealers peddling furniture , glassware and quilts on main street trenton s heritage days festival takes place the same weekend , with 18 artists selling ceramic jewelry , hats and native american dolls , to name a few on june 15 and 16 , more than 150 artisans will sell fine art and crafts in montclair s brookdale park the exhibitors were selected through a jury process , submitting pictures of their work and competing for a spot in the show visitors will not find folding tables strewn with merchandise in addition to their work , applicants were judged on their booth displays people ca n't just bring a table or set up racks , said howard rose of belle mead , who organizes the annual show with his wife , janet every booth has to look like a miniature gallery several dozen new jersey artists will sell pottery , clothing , wooden folk art and metal sculptures , among other things , at the montclair show prices will range from 20 to 500 , mr rose said , because it s not fair to entice people with 250 teapots when they 're on a tight budget of all the antiques shows planned for this summer , none intrigues me more than the antique motorcycle national meet , taking place june 7 , 8 and 9 in the warren county town of harmony bikers from around the metropolitan region will descend on the county fairgrounds to bid on ancient motorcycles and swap coveted parts the annual meet is a prime opportunity to find rare engines , fenders and frames , said bob courboin , an organizer some guy with a 1910 harley has nowhere else to go , he looks around our tables and maybe he gets lucky , mr courboin said the crafts season will be well under way by july , with festivals taking place in atlantic city , blairstown , lavallette and plainfield , to name a few but august is when people like me in my formative years , anyway start prowling in earnest there are families who plan their summer vacations around the antiques show and sale in bay head , which has been held on the first weekend in august since 1952 mary urban , an organizer , said inns fill up and the whole town comes out for the show , which takes place in st paul s methodist church and includes a luncheon with turkey salad sandwiches another longtime tradition is the stone harbor arts and crafts festival , aug 3 and 4 , which features 500 artisans in three circus tents ernie blair , the director , said the festival draws 70 , 000 visitors , some of whom will spend as much as 7 , 000 for a painting by august , the flea markets of long beach island will be in full swing , taking place in barnegat light , beach haven , spray beach and surf city it is a desperate attempt to cling to the season , and for me , it has worked all these years the pillow , pitcher and sheet music are with me still , moving from town to town , defining my space like artifacts , they evoke the strange , sweet rituals of summers past photo crafts shows appear all over the state , from late spring tolabor day this one , in montclair , was devoted solely to art \( sam d'amico for the new york times \)
new york s lieutenant governor says she is being persecuted by the pataki administration this is something new , even in a state where unhappy lieutenant governors are pretty much the norm none of her predecessors have claimed that highranking officials conspired to make them late for a state of the city speech but elizabeth mccaughey ross did indeed tell the times she had overheard a phone call made to a state trooper who was taking her to mayor rudolph giuliani s address in new york city , ordering the driver not to make it there on time it was , she said , part of a pattern of petty political persecution intended to discredit her the saga of ms mccaughey ross has provided a welcome diversion for those who find the current administration a little bland after the pyrotechnics of mario cuomo a turning point came when she remained standing throughout gov george pataki s state of the state speech ms mccaughey ross says she simply forgot to sit down mr pataki s aides suspect her of trying to steal the spotlight the only state of the state speech that has lingered so long in albany memory was the one in which mr cuomo called the legislators monkeys ms mccaughey ross complains about leaks of negative stories about her , of being denied a spot on the state delegation to the republican convention , and a lengthy period when her state police security was canceled , allegedly because she was using troopers as personal chauffeurs surely never before has an administration announced , or at least confirmed publicly , that an official was being deprived of police protection the troopers declined to identify her accuser , and ms mccaughey ross called it tantamount to mccarthyism ms mccaughey ross has been an energetic lieutenant governor , traipsing around the state to discuss medicaid reform or , this season , public education she sees herself as a loyal soldier who has taken only a few , principled stands that made the state republican party unhappy mainly on the matter of abortion and ballot access her opponents within the administration feel she is a selfpromoter whose inability to work with others is demonstrated by the fact that she has gone through three different chiefs of staff in 18 months neither albany nor the state republican party is an easy place for women to thrive in a good year the state senate , the republicans' longterm power base , has one female republican senator some years there are none until recently there have been few women in power in either party the lieutenant governor , with a very small staff and surrounded by a hostile administration , might feel very lonely indeed but other women in albany say ms mccaughey ross has made little effort to reach out to them and mr pataki has appointed other women to key positions the governor s top staff is at least 50 percent women , all of them strongwilled and very opinionated , says zenia mucha , his strongwilled and very opinionated communications director many politicians feel ms mccaughey ross should simply be grateful to have a job , having been plucked from obscurity with no political base of her own a selfdescribed policy wonk \( she says her alltime favorite book is the federalist papers \) , she was a senior fellow at a conservative think tank whose sole claim to fame was a muchdiscussed magazine article on the clinton healthcare plan there was nothing in her history that suggested she had traditional political skills , like the ability to get others to work for a common goal , or the intuition about when to take a public stand and when to hold back rather than balance their ticket with a woman who had held local office , served in the assembly or even worked as a party official , gop leaders chose ms mccaughey ross because she seemed a glamorous figure who would draw the media s attention to the fact that the party had put a woman on the ticket even if the worst behindthescenes complaints about ms mccaughey ross are true , the republicans have no one to blame but themselves gail collins

thundered and in a hotel downtown that night the couple , their families and friends danced , drank from an open bar and watched as a parasol of fireworks rose from the harbor and lit the sky in celebration it was a short euphoria the priest could not by episcopal liturgy or maryland law pronounce them married although the rector of the parish had approved and the vestry and bishop were aware

tell me what politician would you trust to judge our love \?
london , feb 15 the results of a threeyear investigation into a scandal over britain s sale of military equipment to iraq in the late 1980 s were made public here today , and deepened the pall over the embattled government of prime minister john major the investigation concluded that several former government officials and two current cabinet ministers deliberately misled parliament in 1989 and 1990 about the government s policy on the sale of machine tools to iraq , although it did not find their actions constituted a coverup the inquiry also found that former officials in the ministry of defense and the board of trade and industry knew they were approving the export of equipment that was being used by the iraqis to develop and manufacture sophisticated weapons systems the failure of the government to be forthcoming in its public statements about its export policy to iraq precluded a public debate on this important issue taking place on an informed basis , the report concluded parliament and the public were designedly led to believe that a stricter policy toward nonlethal defense exports to iraq had not changed , although it had in fact been altered the conservative party , which is hanging onto power with a slim fourseat majority in parliament , hailed the report as a victory there could hardly be a more serious set of charges leveled against ministers of the crown , and they are now shown to be completely unfounded , said ian lang , who heads the board of trade and industry and gave the government s response to the report but others regarded the report , which was compiled by sir richard scott , a high court judge with a reputation for independent thinking , as a serious blow to the government s already tarnished credibility some said it might even lead to an extended debate over the responsibilities of cabinet ministers to inform the public an awful lot of people are going to remember the scott report , said anthony king , a professor of government at the university of essex i think sir richard scott is going to be looking over the shoulders of every minister and every civil servant for a very long time to come similar accusations were made that aides to president bush secretly armed iraq and covered up their activities after iran invaded kuwait in 1990 but a report commissioned by the clinton administration and made public in january 1995 concluded that there was no evidence to support the accusations mr major himself set off the scott investigation in 1993 after executives of matrix churchill , a nowdefunct british industrial company , were tried for violating a government policy barring the sale to iraq of arms or equipment that could be used to make sophisticated weaponry the trial collapsed after the government was forced to release documents showing that it not only knew about matrix churchill s sales of sophisticated lathes , but also had encouraged them in hopes that the executives would gain valuable intelligence about iraq s weapons development plans the investigation looked into whether government ministers deliberately misled parliament by failing to disclose that the policy against selling military equipment to iraq had been relaxed it also examined whether the government urged ministers to sign public interest immunity certificates in an effort to withhold documents that would exonerate the matrix churchill executives and reveal the change in its arms policy in the rowdy house of commons session that followed the report s release , the opposition labor party called for the resignation of william waldegrave and sir nicholas lyell , two cabinet ministers faulted by sir richard for trying to prevent members of parliament and the public from learning that the government had loosened its strict sales policy robin cook , who gave the labor party s response to the report , declared , are you really going to ask the house to accept a report that over five volumes demonstrates how this government misjudged saddam hussein , misled mp s and misdirected the prosecution , and then tell us that none of them is going to accept responsibility for getting it wrong \? aides to mr major said he was determined to stand by mr waldegrave , who is the chief secretary to the treasury , and sir nicholas , the attorney general to do otherwise would place the conservative party , which suffered a series of embarrassing defections over the last year , into an even more precarious position mr major is expected to go so far as to threaten to hold a general election ahead of schedule should some conservative mp s begin to rebel if pressure for the government to fall on its sword increases political experts are keeping an eye on two conservative mp s with a reputation for occasionally flouting the dictates of party leaders , richard shepherd and rupert allason if i were the party whip , i 'd be sitting in their offices holding their hands very tightly , said john barnes , a lecturer on government at the london school of economics mr waldegrave and sir nicholas , who had more than a week to examine the report , issued multiplepage statements declaring that the investigation had exonerated them but at a news conference and in his report , sir richard gave the officials a less than ringing endorsement speaking of mr waldegrave s representations to various members of parliament that the government s policy on iraq had not changed , sir richard said , some of the answers he gave and some of the letters he wrote were , in respect to his ministerial responsibilities , misleading in his report , sir richard criticized sir nicholas for advising ministers that it was their duty to sign a public interest immunity certificate , saying such advice constituted a fundamental misconception of the laws governing those certificates
a breast cancer gene , which geneticists had considered rare , now turns out to occur in 1 percent of jewish women of eastern and central european origin taken together with a different breast cancer gene , independently found last year to be present in 1 percent of the same population , it means that about one out of 50 ashkenazi jewish women may have a gene that can lead to breast or ovarian cancer and some researchers are taken aback they say the finding raises troubling questions about genetic testing and about what women should do if they find that they have one of the cancercausing genes already , laboratories are advertising that they will test for the first breast cancer gene , called brca1 , in jewish women , and no one would be surprised if commercial tests for the other gene , called brca2 , quickly follow ninety percent of american jews are of central or eastern european origin one in 50 for a frequency of a genetic disease that s pretty impressive , said dr kenneth offit , who is chief of the clinical genetic service at memorial sloankettering cancer center in new york dr offit added that he could not think of another such genetic disease that was so prevalent dr francis collins , director of the center for human genome research at the national institutes of health , said that two genes , taken together , were so common that they might be there for a reason maybe in some far away time there was an advantage to having these genes , he said the new finding involves brca2 it is , like brca1 , a normal gene that can cause cancer when mutated the brca1 mutation and the brca2 mutation found in ashkenazi jewish women involve deletions , or missing sections , in the genes themselves that render their protein products unable to function properly in papers published today in the journal nature genetics , two independent groups of investigators concluded that a particular brca2 mutation occurs in 1 percent of ashkenazi jews one group , led by dr c sue richards and her colleagues at baylor college of medicine in houston , looked at stored blood from 3 , 000 ashkenazi jews and from 1 , 000 people with a variety of ethnic backgrounds they found that 15 percent of the jewish population had the mutated brca2 gene but that none of the nonjewish population had it the second group of researchers , which included dr offit and dr harry ostrer at new york university medical center , got the same result when they examined blood samples from more than 1 , 200 ashkenazi jewish men and women but , the researchers say , women with the mutated brca1 gene have about a 90 percent chance of developing breast cancer and about a 60 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer the new studies indicate that women with one copy of the brca2 gene have about a 30 percent to 40 percent risk of developing breast cancer , dr richards said they also are at increased risk of ovarian cancer , but the extent of that increase is still unclear , the researchers said dr collins said that the estimated risk of breast cancer for brca2 was a hunch , at best , and that he was not even convinced by the studies that the brca2 defect was less dangerous than the one for brca1 it might be , he said , that brca1 is more potent in younger women and brca2 is more likely to to cause cancer in older women dr offit said his patients did not distinguish between the levels of risk conferred by the two genes although the difference in risk is of real scientific interest , he said , women seem just as concerned when they learn that they have the mutated form of brca2 as they do when they learn they have the mutated form of brca1 the women worry most about ovarian cancer , dr offit said that is because the cancer is often deadly and there are no reliable screening tests to detect it early , when it might be more amenable to treatment even removal of the ovaries is no guarantee that cancer will not occur you can get what looks like ovarian cancer even if your ovaries are removed , dr offit said women in the new york studies do want to know whether they have one of the cancer genes , dr ostrer said more than 90 percent who are tested as part of a research study , he said , want to learn the result
seattle , aug 26 the nifty pitching matchup was supposed to be sterling hitchcock against jimmy key it wound up being hitchcock against brian boehringer after key was smashed in the left elbow with a harsh line drive and departed in the first inning it wound up being a highly entertaining game , anyway seattle s hitchcock pitched as if he had a vendetta against his former team and boehringer pitched as if he finally felt at ease in the major leagues both pitchers threw seven innings , allowed one run and were spectators by the time jay buhner rapped a runscoring single to center field off dave pavlas in the eighth inning to catapult the mariners to a 21 victory at the kingdome boehringer retired alex rodriguez to open the eighth , but the lefthander graeme lloyd aided seattle by walking ken griffey jr to start the rally pavlas walked edgar martinez on a 31 pitch to push griffey to second and then buhner , who had struck in three straight atbats against boehringer , directed the first pitch past a diving derek jeter to break the 11 tie the bullpen breakdown doomed the yankees to an openingnight setback on their critical 10game west coast road trip and reduced their lead over the secondplace orioles in the american league east to five games with 32 left before the game , manager joe torre acknowledged the importance of emerging from the doldrums we need one of those streaks to reinforce who we are , said torre , whose team has lost 23 of its last 41 games we need to win 6 of 8 or something in the next 10 days or 2 weeks it did not start tonight hitchcock lost his shutout in the seventh when tino martinez doubled off the rightfield fence and jogged to third when darryl strawberry flared a single to left strawberry , who apparently injured his leg , was replaced at first base by the rookie ruben rivera , who was recalled today when pat listach was placed on the disabled list mariano duncan followed strawberry s single with what seemed to be an ineffective play he hit a pop fly to shallow right field but second baseman rich amaral backpedaled to the ball and was not called off by buhner , the right fielder , so martinez sprinted for home and stole a run to tie the score , 11 it was a costly mistake by the mariners , and it cost hitchcock a decision the lefthander , who had beaten his former team in two of three starts , yielded five hits while striking out seven and walking one boehringer s statistics were almost identical he gave up six hits , struck out four and walked none key was less than five minutes into his start when alex rodriguez hit a line drive off the pitcher s left elbow that was hit so forcefully it scooted between two outfielders and rolled to the rightcenterfield fence for a triple torre and the trainer gene monahan scampered to the mound , but it was obvious key was in no condition to continue and left with one out in the first he was taken for xrays , which showed no damage was done after the game , key s elbow was heavily wrapped and he said it was swollen , but he did n't think it would prevent him from making his next start while the yankees were concerned with key s condition , they still had to worry about a positive start to a trip that torre called the most important of the season boehringer , who won his first major league game with five and onethird unblemished innings against the angels last tuesday , replaced key and helped himself by holding the mariners to one hit in seven atbats with runners in scoring position boehringer began by stranding rodriguez at third , but it took a bit of good fortune griffey smoked a liner to first that tino martinez leaped to snare for the second out edgar martinez smacked a ball along the firstbase line that martinez dived to smother boehringer encountered difficulty in a controversial fourth griffey rocked a oneout double to right in the still scoreless game and then edgar martinez smashed a 10 pitch to deep rightcenter the ball seemed destined to be a tworun homer , which was precisely why a fan positioned himself along the railing above the 23foot fence videotape replays clearly indicated that the fan reached over the railing with his glove and snatched the ball in the field of play the umpires initially signaled for a tworun homer , but torre came out to argue and they changed the call of course , that enraged seattle manager lou piniella he lumbered onto the field , went nose to nose with the thirdbase umpire durwood merrill and was ejected piniella s histrionics did not sway the umpires martinez was returned to second base with his 48th double and a run was erased from the scoreboard so the yankees trailed , 10 inside pitch john wetteland \( strained right groin muscle \) looked sharp during a 27pitch simulated

los angeles , may 21 pete harnisch started serving his suspension tonight in an unusual place the sixth inning harnisch took the inning off or at least his slider did to ruin a perfectly acceptable game for the mets , who lost to the los angeles dodgers , 64 harnisch yielded backtoback sixthinning home runs to a pair of musclebound dodgers , eric karros and raul mondesi , as the fickle mets wasted bernard gilkey s superb game the national league president , len coleman , may be waiting for harnisch back in new york to decide whether to uphold an eightgame suspension for brawling but the dodgers got to him first karros s tworun homer and mondesi s solo shot capsized a onerun met lead , and new york lost for the sixth time on this ninegame trip a couple of bad pitches and the game turns around just like that , harnisch said i was supposed to keep the lead , and i could n't do it gilkey appeared to be the only met who arrived at dodger stadium tonight with heavy lumber the left fielder s four runs batted in tied a career high , yet none of it was rubbing off on the met right fielders general manager joe mcilvaine calls right field our black hole , and tonight s occupant , butch huskey , went 0 for 4 and kicked an eighthinning fly ball that led to a dodger insurance run mcilvaine reiterated tonight that the hotshot minor leaguer alex ochoa is not imminently due to arrive from norfolk and it did not help when the mets learned tonight that ochoa strained a hamstring running the bases in a class aaa game well , anyone we 'd want to send down is out of options , mcilvaine said the only alternative is to trade somebody , and i do n't think so right now but we ca n't seem to get anybody to take over the mets' leadoff hitter , lance johnson , doubled , singled and singled in his first three atbats tonight , and he also beat dodger catcher mike piazza in an oldfashioned game of tag the dodgers had led by 21 entering the fifth inning , courtesy of a piazza tworun rope of a home run off harnisch in the first but the mets are dying harder now shortstop rey ordonez began the fifth with a wicked single to center field harnisch perhaps it was a sign of his fading concentration struck out trying to bunt ordonez to second , but johnson singled hard off the glove of pitcher ismael valdes that led to an awkward pitch that struck jose vizcaino on the back of his right triceps he suffered a bruise and will be day to day for his discomfort , the mets were awarded a basesloaded situation with one out gilkey , whose sacrifice fly had scored johnson in the first inning , found open acreage in the outfield this time he put an outside pitch right where he should have to right and two met runners were heading straight toward piazza the first , ordonez , scored the second , johnson , had mondesi s right arm to deal with mondesi threw a relative strike to the plate , but piazza backed up behind the plate to glove it that left a slim avenue for johnson and , although the throw beat the met runner home , he used his quick feet to elude a lunging tag so , the mets had a 32 lead and a few chuckles earlier in the evening , the mets' catcher had provided the comic relief todd hundley had bounced an ugly throw to second base on a firstinning stolenbase attempt , and , by the fourth inning , he had muffed the most routine popup behind the plate but , after piazza s misplay , the catchers were even harnisch , meanwhile , was losing strength he had retired 9 batters in a row and 13 of 14 during one span , but trouble surfaced in the form of a piazza line drive toward his midsection harnisch got out of the way , and the ball grazed his glove for an infield single frustrated at his misfortune , his next pitch showed it karros drove it 409 feet to center field for a 43 los angeles lead by this time , harnisch s head and arm were hanging low , and mondesi was the lucky recipient of a fat pitch he followed karros s homer with a 433foot home run , and the margin was at 53 would it hold up \? only if gilkey could keep coming to bat he hit a solo home run \( his 10th \) to left field in the seventh , in his final time at bat tonight , to slice the deficit to 54 photo lance johnson scoring to give mets a firstinning lead lastnight as dodgers' mike piazza waited for the ball \( associated press \)
incirlik , turkey , july 3 it is more than a thousand miles from incirlik to dhahran , saudi arabia , but the 3 , 700 american troops based here felt shock waves from the truck bomb that killed 19 of their comrades in dhahran last week the moment that news of the blast reached incirlik , the senior american commander here , col john barry , ordered all troops and families to stay on the base before lifting the order two days later , he increased patrols around the base perimeter , closed all entrances except the main gate and imposed a more rigorous system of identity checks he also sent bombsniffing dogs into almost every edifice under his control and onto many of the threedozen highpowered jet fighters here what happened in dhahran was a wakeup call , particularly because of the size of the explosion , colonel barry said as the scorching sun began to sink behind the fig palms we 're going to school on that , bigtime our antennas are a lot higher now incirlik is near the mediterranean coast and just 10 miles from adana , turkey s fourthlargest city the road connecting them follows the route of an ancient roman boulevard along which marc antony is said to have ridden on his way to meet cleopatra at tarsus , 20 miles farther west this is a place where people are renowned for their hospitality , but where there is a vague sense of unease that has become more palpable since the dhahran bombing of course it could happen here , said yasemin seckin , manager of the muhammed ali portrait studio , where americans from the base often drop off their film for onehour developing the buildings are close to the road too close most turkish people love the americans , but there are a few who would like them to leave who knows what they could do \? some of the soldiers are scared , miss seckin said i have my regular customers , and when they come in , we talk they are feeling more nervous these days although incirlik is officially a turkish base , united states forces have been stationed here for more than 40 years for most of that time , they were part of the deterrent force that nato maintained during the cold war francis gary powers , the american pilot whose spy plane was shot down over the soviet union in 1960 , creating a major international incident , took off from this base during the persian gulf war , the enemy was different and so was the mission for americans at incirlik , which was used as a staging point for allied raids and later as a base for airdrops of food to kurds in iraq today incirlik remains pivotal the american soldiers' principal responsibility is to support the kurdish enclave in northern iraq established in 1991 after the gulf war each morning at dawn , awacs reconnaissance planes lift off from the airstrip here for surveillance missions a few hours later the air is shattered by the roar of f15 and f16 jets on their way to enforce the noflight zone over the kurdish enclave the 3 , 600acre base here , which the americans share not only with 800 turkish soldiers but also with contingents of british and french troops who are assigned to the kurdish operation , is surrounded by a chainlink fence and cordons of barbed wire many buildings are as close to the road as the building bombed in dhahran soldiers and their families at incirlik enjoy many of the pleasures of home the base has a grammar school and a high school , a fully equipped fitness center , a video shop , a new hospital and a ninehole golf course lowrise homes painted in soft pastels and surrounded by manicured lawns give the impression of a california resort when they are off duty , the americans stationed here often stroll down the strip of shops and restaurants that has sprouted opposite the main gate they can dine at the moonlight cafe or the falcon bar , shop at the top gun carpet palace or jim bob s lingerie , and order clothing at the londonnew york fashion house or altay clothing , where the motto is , we make tshirts any design , and nonbaggie pants made to order although security regulations dictate that soldiers may not wear their uniforms outside the base , they are easy to spot many have made friends with shopkeepers , bartenders and other denizens of the strip , which they call the alley , although its official name is ataturk street there s a different feeling here than in saudi arabia , said senior airman brad tribble as he walked past mustafa s jewelry , where popular items include silver lapel pins in the shape of jet fighters and tie clips adorned with images of m16 rifles before coming to incirlik , airman tribble was stationed in riyadh , the saudi arabian city where a terrorist bombing last november killed five americans maybe not everyone there is as anxious to protect you as they are here , he said but if a building can get blown up in oklahoma city , it can happen anywhere perhaps the greatest difference between the conditions in saudi arabia and in turkey is that the turkish military and police have decades of experience in dealing with terrorist threats foreigners who work with them say they have an excellent intelligence network and share whatever they learn with their american counterparts
washington , april 24 in late 1994 , shortly after he became assistant secretary of state , richard c holbrooke began searching for ways to circumvent the international arms embargo against bosnia , according to white house officials the bosnian government wanted the united states to urge friendly third countries to ship weapons to the beleaguered bosnian army mr holbrooke gave the idea serious consideration with the approval of his superiors , he drew up a proposal and began to pitch it hard , white house and state department officials said in recent days such a program , he argued , would help the bosnians survive and reduce their need for arms from iran he secured an opinion from state department lawyers on how it could be done without becoming a formal covert operation the proposal was ultimately rejected by both the president s national security adviser , anthony lake , and secretary of state warren christopher , who feared it would infuriate allies in europe but mr holbrooke s activities had an unintended consequence bosnian officials began discussing the possible american plan those conversations were overheard by american intelligence , and they became one of several pieces of evidence that raised suspicions within the cia that an illegal covert operation was imminent or under way the cia raised its concerns with the white house , and that led to an internal investigation of the administration s tolerance of arms shipments from iran and other countries to bosnia that inquiry concluded that mr holbrooke had done nothing improper however , the previously undisclosed tale of mr holbrooke s failed proposal explains in part how the administration came to be investigating itself at least six congressional committees are now questioning the wisdom and legality of allowing iranian arms to flow to bosnia , a decision republicans say allowed iran to gain a foothold in bosnia among other things , they want to know if any administration official facilitated thirdcountry arms shipments or even urged governments to send arms to bosnia and herzegovina , a charge the administration denies today anthony harrington , a lawyer who heads the administration s intelligence oversight board , briefed the house intelligence committee in closed session on his agency s secret , sixmonth investigation into administration policy mr holbrooke s involvement in trying to help the bosnians arm themselves through third countries began almost immediately after he returned to washington from his post as ambassador to germany , senior white house and state department officials said he was aware that mr clinton had already sent a message to croatia through the american ambassador , peter w galbraith , that the united states would do nothing to stop them from transshipping arms to bosnia , in violation of the arms embargo in late september 1994 , prime minister haris silajdzic of bosnia told mr holbrooke that if the united states was willing to urge friendly third countries to send arms to bosnia , his country would stop pressing congress to lift the arms embargo mr holbrooke said he would see what he could do officials said he saw such an effort as a logical extension of mr clinton s earlier decision to the allow the iranian shipments , and a way to get the bosnians heavier weapons from countries like turkey , pakistan and saudi arabia , which were already supplying small arms that prompted the bosnian officials' conversations , which were picked up by american intelligence and relayed to the cia the cia already had suspicions that an illegal operation was contemplated or under way large quantities of arms were flowing into croatia and being transhipped to bosnia with ease , and the cia station chief in croatia suspected that mr galbraith knew about the smuggling with holbrooke s plan , the thought that the united states might act led to some intelligence reporting that the bosnians were hopeful something might come of this idea , said one senior white house official that led to people in the field wondering if something was going on in early november , mr lake and mr christopher rejected mr holbrooke s proposal it seemed too close to a covert operation , which would require formal notification of congress , they argued and it would certainly be viewed as a betrayal by france , britain and other allies , which were opposed to any plan to arm the bosnian government forces , in part because they had peacekeepers in the country even though mr holbrooke s proposal never went into effect and is not the main focus of congressional inquiries , it was investigated by the intelligence oversight board , a small independent group appointed by the president , as one of three incidents in 1994 that led the cia to suspect a possible illegal covert action the investigation concluded in a secret , sevenpage report to mr clinton that in none of the incidents were laws broken but it also concluded that american policy was so secretive that it created the impression within the administration , particularly the cia , that the united states was aiding or running a covert operation , according to people familiar with the report asked to comment , mr holbrooke , now vice chairman of cs first boston in new york , said , i told warren christopher i will not be available for comment and therefore i will not be mr siladzjic was traveling in europe today and unavailable for comment

joe torre was so emotionally drained saturday night that he left yankee stadium with his soiled and sweaty yankee uniform on he was so busy yesterday that he missed president clinton s first two telephone calls trying to congratulate him he was so appreciative that he had finally secured an elusive world series title , one day after his older brother , frank , had undergone heart transplant surgery , that he wondered if somebody was going to nudge him from what seemed like a prolonged slumber this must be a dream , he thought this has to be a dream , he thought but every time the yankee manager opened his eyes and looked at the smiling faces , it was no dream the yankees were still the world champions they are the perfect new york team and they own new york , as they should and as torre told the yankees' principal owner , george steinbrenner , they would before the second game of the series it s like some outofbody experience , torre said from his office at yankee stadium it really is dreamlike you wish everybody could experience this sometime in their life it s very emotional it s not only emotional , it s exhausting and exhilarating you want to soak it up you wish everyone could almost everyone in new york certainly tried and many will continue to do so when the team is lionized with a tickertape parade in manhattan tomorrow morning the 1996 yankees secured their place in baseball history in their typically resilient manner by becoming the first team to lose the first two world series games at home and then win four straight to claim the championship they secured their place in yankee history in their typically human manner by beating the atlanta braves , 32 , in game 6 on saturday night and celebrating with a spinetingling victory lap around the field , a moment that will be remembered as one of the warmest in new york sports it seems like we just floated around the field , pitcher david cone said joe torre sort of led us guys were just floating around the field next thing you know , the horses were going nuts and fans were reacting wildly it was almost in slow motion it was surreal don zimmer , the team s bench coach , had whispered the idea in torre s ear during the game , and torre acted as if he were part den mother and part conductor , waving and shouting to the yankees to assemble en masse and trot within 20 feet of the fans outfielder darryl strawberry , his fists pumping , led the bronx boogie , but third baseman wade boggs starred in the celebration by hitching a ride on the back of one of the police horses and taking a unique trip around the rollicking stadium i have no idea why i did that because i'm deathly afraid of horses , boggs said it was a bumpy ride i was holding on for dear life i was hoping he was n't going to buck me into next week the 65yearold zimmer was simply hoping to make it to next week when we got through , zim looked at me and said , 'i meant that we should walk around the field , not run , ' torre said through laughter he was dying out there the other yankees were alive and awed by the rousing experience it was so loud , pitcher david weathers said , it made me feel like my head was going to explode you want to hug every teammate and scream , but you almost want to go fan to fan , all 60 , 000 of them , and thank them for supporting you , first baseman tino martinez said i wish i could have run into the stands and shook everyone s hand outfielder paul o'neill added i 've never heard that much noise i thought the ground was shaking it was new york s way of thanking a team that provided drama , excitement and success throughout this glorious season if there has ever been a team with more humaninterest elements than these yankees , well , it must be a fictitious one no team played better than the yankees on the field and no team created more appealing stories on or off it this team showed so much resiliency , third baseman charlie hayes said that falls back on joe torre he had one brother die and he had another waiting for a heart transplant and , every day , he came out here with a positive attitude our team fed off that this means a lot to me torre s emotionally turbulent season and his first title in 32 years as a player or manager were only two of the many compelling stories there were the amazing comebacks by cone and strawberry and by pitchers jimmy key and dwight gooden there were the triumphant turnarounds by weathers and pitcher graeme lloyd and the successes of martinez , catcher joe girardi and second baseman mariano duncan , all of whom replaced popular players on the team and there were the lateseason contributions by cecil fielder , the designated hitter and first baseman , and by hayes , the blossoming of center fielder bernie williams and shortstop derek jeter and the bullpen brilliance of mariano rivera and john wetteland choose a yankee , sit down and listen to his tale everyone had one and none were tall this is a new york team , cone said it s a comeback team with a lot of heart it s a team new york can really relate to from the top to the bottom , the comeback list is incredible
with its cover of dead leaves , the hill that rises alongside route 7 in southern new milford looks much like the any of nearby hills that dot the landscape reaching 160 feet at its peak , it spreads over 75 acres in the industrialcommercial stretch of town , a place that might seem suited for skiing or sledding in the months ahead but the hill is not a landmark of nature rather , it is a manmade creation the tallest in new milford that has created divisions in the town and friction between state and local officials , run up continuing legal bills , raised health concerns and sent a sometimes pungent aroma over the surrounding area it also is a landmark to the seeming limitations of local government and of the legal system that has yet to bring a definitive resolution after more than six years of litigation and it is a david and goliath story of a large corporation and a small town that seems to have waited too long to protect itself with zoning regulations the hill is a garbage dump , once a repository for mostly household refuse from new milford and surrounding towns that has been transformed into a putrid mass comprising , along with the expected empty milk cartons and chicken bones , some very unwelcome biomedical waste , treatment plant sludge , asbestos , petroleum contaminated soil and industrial metalprocessing sludge while there is no dispute that the garbage , carted in as landfill , exceeds a town zoning ordinance limiting its height to 90 feet , the owner of the property , waste management of connecticut , has painted a cataclysmic picture of what it would entail to reduce the landfill to a legal size town officials acknowledge that dismantling part of the dump could bring on an environmental nightmare , but they maintain that the corporation deliberately created a legal versus environmental quandary under which waste management wants to maintain the size of the dump despite a court order to reduce it because of the potential environmental disaster if it obeyed the court order it is a maneuver the corporation denies , replying that its moves have been sanctioned by the state that argument whether the hill should remain with some corrective measures or be reduced in size to conform to zoning regulations is now pending before the state supreme court in the latest round of the protracted legal fight some 70 feet would have to be sliced off the dump to make it meet zoning regulations , a notion that alarms some residents when it is translated into what it would mean in a daytoday operation to remove about 16 million tons from the dump would involve about 80 truck trips a day for more than eight years along route 7 i just ca n't believe that the town would go through with that kind of disruption , said ruth malins , a local resident and the resource center director of the housatonic valley association mrs malins , a former new milford selectwoman , said that it would be preferable for the town to have the dump capped , landscaped and receive damages for the zoning violations sondra ottocherney , a resident of the 332unit willow springs condominium that is about 300 yards from dump , disagrees they put it there and now they should take it away , she said , citing the dump s stench and the flights of scavenging sea gulls that foul the surrounding area robert davenport , a former resident of willow springs who said that his unsold condominium had no equity because of the dump , is a founder of the southern new milford property owners association , which has embarked on its own legal fight against waste management the association has hired the manhattan law firm of white case to seek unspecified damages from the company for present and any future harm , including diminished property values with several environmental experts , waste management has insisted that efforts to cart away the excess garbage could result in the release of asbestos , a known carcinogen , into the air , along with noxious odors and start fires , create a feeding bonanza for rats and possibly contaminating surrounding ground water the cost of removal was estimated by the company at between 103 million and 105 million loretta urickley , the new milford zoning enforcement officer , said that removal of the excess waste could be accomplished with carefully implemented safeguards and she added that the town has little choice but to pursue the litigation to correct an illegal situation the voluminous legal documents do not suggest where the contaminated new milford waste might be deposited finding a repository could create new difficulties if the dump is finally ordered to be reduced for the town , all the money new milford received from waste management for use of the dump from january 1993 through june 1995 662 , 935 has gone to cover legal and consulting fees during the six years of litigation although waste management has been barred from adding to the landfill since sept 29 , 1995 , the company continues to make money from the site through the sale to the connecticut light and power company of methane gas created by the decomposing material
albany , march 13 for a year now , robert j malito has been considered the most soughtafter lobbyist in the capitol and for months , legislators and colleagues who have admired or envied his prosperity have pointed to one reason united states senator alfonse m d'amato before mr d'amato became the senate banking committee chairman , before he became the most important republican in new york state , before he was even a senator , mr malito was his friend , dining chum , campaign fundraiser , informal counselor and avid supporter and as mr d'amato has grown in power and stature , so has mr malito s business according to a report released today by the new york temporary state commission on lobbying , davidoff malito was the highest paid lobbying firm in albany last year for mr malito , it was a banner year the firm earned 2 million in lobbying income , a state record , which was an increase of 800 , 000 , or 64 percent , from 1994 , when it placed second the firm added 28 new clients , for a total of 69 all but one of the other top 10 albany lobbying firms had fewer than half the number of clients that davidoff malito did in 1995 while sid davidoff , mr malito s main lobbying partner in the firm , certainly contributed to this , most of the new contracts were for lobbying work in albany , which is handled by mr malito davidoff malito has been among albany s larger lobbying groups for years and in 1995 , several major lobbyists saw their business increase but none of them grew at even close to the same pace as mr malito s firm the reasons , say other lobbyists and legislators in both major parties , was the ouster in 1994 of the democratic administration of mario m cuomo by george e pataki , a republican whose leading promoter was mr d'amato mr malito has always been known as al s guy , and these days , that helps bring in business , said a republican assemblyman from long island , who spoke on the condition of anonymity mr malito , 53 , who first became friendly with mr d'amato through nassau county politics , was traveling today and could not be reached for comment howard druckman , managing partner of davidoff malito , said the firm s growth in recent years was unrelated to mr malito s relationship to mr d'amato he also pointed out that mr davidoff is close to the democratic party , particularly in new york city but he acknowledged that mr malito s long and deep ties to the republican party have helped mr malito , a former deputy commissioner in the lindsay administration in new york city , himself has not been circumspect about his alliances with mr d'amato and mr pataki in his listing in the martindalehubbell law directory , he calls himself a pro bono special counsel to mr d'amato and in an interview last year , he bragged about holding fundraisers for mr pataki he s been involved in the party for 25 years , said an adviser to mr pataki , speaking on condition of anonymity he knows everyone it s not just his connection to alfonse he s incredibly tight with the state senate still , pataki aides said mr malito has no special influence with the governor for years , mr malito s close ties to the former state senate republican majority leader , ralph j marino , helped create the impression among legislators that he was capable of blocking legislation in the senate last year , mr pataki s first year in office , mr malito showed he could do more than just block things on a 108 , 000 retainer from cocacola , he led a pack of lobbyists who helped win a tax cut for soda bottlers worth tens of millions of dollars a year but for all his links to the administration , mr malito has not always been successful a massachusetts concern that paid him 60 , 000 in 1995 failed to win a tollcollecting computer equipment contract with the new york thruway authority a maryland company that paid him 60 , 000 last year did not win a new york state contract for autoemission testing still , the clients keep lining up this year , mr malito won a 150 , 000 contract from philip morris to fight smoking restrictions
fort lauderdale , fla , feb 21 seeking an avenue to common collective bargaining ground , the owners' labor strategists presented a new proposal to the players today that incorporated the players' idea for a tax on their salaries the new proposal was made against the backdrop of declining percentages of increase in salaries players derived through salary arbitration this year those declining percentages raise the possibility that the opening day average salary will be no higher than last year and possibly lower that is all the more reason that we feel its in everybody s interest to get an agreement , randy levine , the owners' chief labor executive , said by telephone from new york levine gave the owners' new proposal to donald fehr , the players' union chief , at a meeting at the union s offices in new york as they have done consistently in their renewed negotiations , both declined to discuss the new plan , but levine said what we tried to do was incorporate some of their ideas along with some things that are important to us they told us they will review it and get back to us in short term although the owners borrowed from the players' proposal , it does n't necessarily mean the two side are moving closer together on an agreement to replace the one that expired more than two years ago the major difference continues to be a disagreement over whether to put a significant drag on salaries according to people familiar with the proposal , the owners would levy a 25 percent tax on each player s salary in the first year of a sevenyear agreement and a 5 percent tax the second year in the third year , the owners would pick up the payroll tax from the adjusting tax system they included in their last proposal , made on nov 15 the players introduced the concept of a salary tax in their feb 8 counterproposal under the players' plan for a sixyear agreement , salaries would be taxed 25 percent in each of the first three years the union estimated that the tax would annually generate about 25 million in revenue while the owners' new proposal calls for a similar tax , it would produce the same amount of revenue 75 million in two years that the players' proposal would generate in three years the owners' primary aim in the protracted negotiations has been to find a way to place a drag on salaries they prefer a luxury tax they began in 1994 with a payroll cap and it is that type of tax that would take over in the third year of their proposal the players are willing to have some type of tax imposed but none that would significantly impede salaries last november , the owners proposed a 25 percent tax the first year on portions of payrolls over 44 million subsequent tax rates and payroll thresholds would depend on the ratio of total payrolls to industry revenue each year today s proposal retains the structure for the last five years the players have proposed a tax for the last three years of a sixyear agreement , with the tax rate 25 percent and the threshold depending on the previous year s payroll the payrolls for the coming season could be down from a year ago considering the outcome of salary arbitration the 76 players who filed last month had their salaries rise by 71 percent , the lowest percentage of increase since it was 71 percent in 1989 in the intervening years , arbitrationplayer salaries rose by 102 , 103 , 100 , 107 , 93 and 78 percent players who settled their cases before hearings had their salaries rise by 75 percent , lowest since 1989 , and players for whom arbitrators decided their salaries had a 52 percent increase , smallest since 1987 in addition , players emerged with an average salary of 1 , 856 , 026 , down from the 1995 arbitration average of 2 , 099 , 379 the results did not come as a total surprise to the player relations committee , the clubs' labor arm , or the players association lou melendez , a prc lawyer , and gene orza , a union lawyer , both noted that the midpoint between club and player salary submissions decreased from last year orza said the salaries filed this year suggested that the market had gone down but , he added , another factor was that some of the better players had signed multiyear contracts before the filing period , thus removing potentially higher salaries from the process
like dozens of her peers at westfield high school , jennifer osborne is preparing to leave new jersey in the dust in august , she will flee to harrisonburg , va , and enroll as a freshman at james madison university , a midsized public institution i did n't like the schools new jersey had to offer , she said last week from her home in westfield , union county i would have gone to princeton , if i had gotten in but none of the others appealed to me new jersey ranks fifth among the states in the number of residents who attend outofstate schools , after alaska , vermont , connecticut and new hampshire , according to the state commission on higher education about 24 , 000 new jersey residents who were college freshmen in 1994 38 percent of the total were enrolled out of state , the commission found philip beardsley , the commission s director of research , attributes the high outmigration rate to new jersey s small size and relative affluence the choices here are limited , he said , with 3 public research universities , 9 state colleges and 15 private fouryear institutions many residents can afford tuition anywhere , he added as students leave new jersey , the destinations they choose are predictable pennsylvania and new york are usually the most common , mr beardsley said , followed by delaware , massachusetts , maryland and virginia the university of delaware was the most popular choice for new jersey freshmen in 1992 and 1994 , he said some schools are especially popular because guidance counselors keep recommending them , mr beardsley said that may explain james madison s popularity among westfield high school students this year ten plan to enroll there , and miss osborne said she had first heard of the school through her guidance counselor often , students choose public universities with strong athletic programs , said david devido , the director of guidance at princeton high school he also pointed to the example of west virginia university in morgantown , seven hours from new jersey the school consistently draws large numbers of new jersey residents in 1992 , it was the fourth most popular destination it s west virginia , up in the mountains , a beautiful campus , football on saturdays , mr devido said that whole culture can be very alluring several guidance counselors noted that rutgers university remains immensely popular many high schools send a dozen or more graduates there every year trenton state college is also consistently popular , a fact mr devido attributes to its selectivity but even if other new jersey colleges improved their reputations by seeking the brightest students , it would not have a significant impact on the number of students leaving the state , mr devido said you can build new campuses or bigger dorms , but i'm not sure new jersey will ever have the draw , he said it s just not sexy chart keeping track the college experience shows top destination for collegebound new jersey high school graduates , top fouryear new jersey college of instate and outofstate residents \( source the new jersey commission on higher education \)
dusan tadic goes on trial today in the hague for war crimes in bosnia , the first defendant to face the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia mr tadic , a bosnian serb , is accused of specific acts of murder and torture , but not of masterminding the brutal human rights abuses that were the signature of the balkan war that distinction belongs to other men , and the work of the tribunal should be measured by whether it is given the support necessary to pursue and prosecute them political and practical obstacles make it unlikely that many of those who engineered the ethnic slaughter in bosnia will be captured and brought to trial the unspoken price of the dayton peace agreement seems to be indifference about the atrocities committed by all parties during the war but while the united states and other nations may be defeated in the end by these impediments , they should be stubborn in the pursuit of justice the individuals who carried out the bosnian war s worst crimes like ethnic cleansing , torture , rape and mass execution should be held accountable for their actions otherwise , surviving victims will be tempted to retaliate indiscriminately against innocent members of the ethnic groups these criminals claimed to serve such vendettas would decrease the chances that bosnia s muslims , croats and serbs can once again learn to live together to date only 3 of the 57 indicted war crimes defendants one serb and two croats are in custody in the hague none of them were arrested by serbian or croatian authorities , despite their obligation under the dayton agreement to assist in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes in contrast , the bosnian muslim authorities promptly arrested two of the three recently indicted muslim defendants , and the third is in custody in germany almost all the other defendants remain at large , including radovan karadzic , the bosnian serb political leader , and gen ratko mladic , the bosnian serb military commander the west has considerable diplomatic leverage with franjo tudjman , the croatian president , who is eager to see his country accepted by washington and integrated into european institutions at the earliest possible date serbia is subject to the automatic reimposition of costly economic sanctions if president slobodan milosevic fails to comply with the war crimes requirements of the dayton accord western governments have so far preferred not to use their leverage carl bildt , the chief international civilian representative in bosnia , has not made war crimes a high priority the nato peacekeeping forces , while rightly hoping to avoid reckless manhunts , have gone too far in the other direction , leaving the impression that they have no interest in supporting the investigation of war crimes or the pursuit of war criminals this behavior is shortsighted credible war crimes prosecutions are not only important to the prospects for longterm peace in bosnia , but also bear on the country s civil tranquillity in the coming months that may affect the climate at the time of nato s scheduled withdrawal at year s end of all the aspects of the bosnian peace , the prosecution of war criminals may be the most sensitive and politically charged presidents milosevic and tudjman would no doubt like to avoid trials of defendants that might expose suspected links between their own military forces and bosnian ethnic militias but the difficulty inherent in holding people accountable for the terrible crimes of the balkan war is no reason to brush off the job western governments must insist that the serbian , croatian and bosnian governments live up to the commitments they made to bring war criminals to justice

washington , oct 2 what appeared last week to be a lowlevel spying incident between the united states and south korea has grown into a more serious case , with prosecutors saying today that they would charge an american intelligence analyst with espionage , an accusation reserved for highly damaging breaches of national security freshly declassified documents in the case also show that the analyst , robert c kim , who is accused of supplying classified documents to the south korean embassy here , attracted the attention of senior military officials in seoul who flew to the united states to meet with him in march in a session that was secretly videotaped by the fbi a senior clinton administration official said that the evidence against mr kim , a koreanborn american citizen who was arrested last week , had raised serious questions that went beyond his individual case among them is whether the south korean military , working through its embassy here , has engaged in a broader , systematic effort to spy on its closest ally and protector out of a fear that washington is withholding intelligence data or that it is secretly dealing directly with north korea however , none of the evidence that has been made public so far indicates that other americans are suspected of passing information to south korea in public , both governments have tried to play down the significance of the case involving mr kim , a civilian analyst for the office of naval intelligence , because of fears that any division between the two close allies would be exploited by north korea at a moment of severely heightened tensions on the korean peninsula fears that the united states would work more closely with north korea without the south s approval have bubbled just beneath the surface of the seoulwashington alliance in recent years there were sharp differences between the two countries when the administration struck a deal under which the north agreed to freeze its nuclear program in return for supplies of fuel oil and the construction of nuclear power plants while the united states and south korea have patched over the disagreements , there is still an uneasiness in their relationship donald gregg , the former american ambassador to seoul and once the cia station chief there , said , we are very close working partners , but it is fair to say that there is a continued residue of suspicion in seoul mr kim worked for the office of naval intelligence , which also employed jonathan pollard , an intelligence analyst who was sentenced to life in prison for passing secrets to israel life in prison is the maximum punishment for an espionage conviction until now mr kim had been charged with a less serious offense that carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison senior administration officials say they still do not fully understand the scope of the suspected south korean spying effort nor do they know whether it was authorized by any of the civilian leaders under president kim young sam but one official said that there was no evidence so far that the effort went beyond the south korean navy , working through the large military attache office housed within the south korean embassy while mr kim s approaches to the south korean embassy were clumsy at best it appears that the fbi was videotaping much of his activity on the south korean side he was being dealt with by experienced military intelligence officials this is n't amateur hour , an american official said the role of several senior south korean military officials was disclosed today in a transcript of a meeting at the sheraton national hotel in arlington , va , on march 20 , between mr kim and four korean officials , including the navy attache at the south korean embassy , baek dong il two of the korean military officers who were secretly videotaped appear to have traveled from south korea to help recruit mr kim and evaluate the information he had supplied to mr baek after mr kim s arrest , mr baek was rapidly recalled to seoul the transcript indicates that mr kim s conversation with the south koreans focused on his knowledge of a classified computerized command system that linked ships to satellites the south koreans are quoted as saying they were aware of the system but believed that the united states might deny the south koreans full access to it last week prosecutors accused mr kim of handing over secret documents about north korea but they did not disclose the nature of those documents , which had apparently been printed out from a computer system that mr kim had clearance to use at the south korean embassy , ambassador park kun woo said through a spokesman that he would have no comment until an investigation under way in seoul had been completed american officials said it was possible that ambassador park was unaware of any spying efforts in his own embassy , because the military attaches usually report directly to their commanders in seoul mr kim was cleared to read sensitive compartmented information , which included finished military intelligence assessments based on secretly intercepted communications he was arrested after agents covertly videotaped him in his office in suburban maryland stripping documents of their classified markings , photocopying them and placing them in manila envelopes that were to be handed to mr baek mr kim is suspected of passing nearly 50 documents to the south koreans , the officials said he has been dismissed from his job the 27page transcript of the march meeting was made public today by prosecutors who disclosed further details about the case to thwart an attempt by mr kim s lawyer to win his client s release on bail robert chesnut , an assistant united states attorney , said that mr kim might flee to south korea in denying bail for mr kim , a united states district court judge , leonie m brinkema , said the evidence against mr kim was overwhelming he is being held at a jail in virginia law enforcement officials have said they had no evidence that mr kim was paid for his information today the officials said that he was a flight risk because he owed 100 , 000 in credit card debt and had a third mortgage on his house the transcript showed that mr kim , 56 , told the south koreans that he expected to retire soon and wanted help finding a job , possibly with south korean

there are no new yorkers here the harp is playing and the flowers are blooming and waiters are scurrying all around the room , endlessly asking whether everything is all right and it would be if we were in singapore or kansas city but we are in the manhattan institution whose very name has become synonymous with elegance , and the waldorfastoria is demonstrating what is wrong with hotel dining it begins with this soothingly luxurious room , so anonymous it could be anywhere in the world it continues with service so obsequious that at one meal we were asked 12 times if things were going smoothly champagne , which seems appropriate to all this splendor , costs 1450 a glass the man with the bread basket \( bread comes in five flavors , none very good \) appears the very instant you finish each piece all this , of course , is to be expected in a hotel restaurant so is the menu , with its oddly translated french dishes and its emphasis on luxury ingredients the food seems as anonymous as the setting until it arrives and surprises you by being very good the chef , laurent manrique , who comes from gascony and worked at le toit de passy and taillevent in paris , can be uneven sometimes the food is n't quite warm sometimes it is too salty occasionally a dish , like those cheesy little gougere puffs that begin each dinner , has lost its magic before it appears but when he is at his best , his food is wonderful take a bite of his scallop with foie gras and black truffle shavings now close your eyes soft and softer blend as the flavors marry in your mouth and the faint taste of the truffles goes skittering across your tongue i wanted to stop eating and preserve the taste of the dish a while longer whenever mr manrique works with foie gras , he is masterly his cold assortment is an essay on pate one is stuffed inside a small apple , another into a prune and two are simply variations on terrines each is fabulous so is his warm foie gras , which he is currently peppering and serving with shallots , capers and pleasantly acid rhubarb when he makes rillettes of duck and serves them with foie gras and a salad of fava beans , the gutsy taste of southwestern france comes right into this sedate setting mr manrique is justly famous for his gascon food the classic dishes are particularly good he stuffs a chicken with mushrooms and poaches it in vegetable broth in the style of henry iv the good king is every french child s favorite monarch , and mr manrique does not let him down he does france proud , too , with a rich hanger steak with country fries only by reading the french description on the menu will you discover that these chunky potatoes are cooked in duck fat tossed with baby greens and slivered grapes , they are fabulous i like the braised salt cod with potatoes , garlic and olive oil , too this recipe comes from mr manrique s grandmother aurelie served in a castiron skillet , it is a hearty dish that seems oddly out of keeping with the setting but most of the time there is enough extravagance on the plate to remind you where you are mr manrique sends out an amusegueule before each meal one night it was a fresh anchovy with a bit of potato and marinated red peppers , another night a small red pepper stuffed with fresh tuna mousse and topped with a fine frizz of fried leeks his oyster tartar is pure luxury , a trio of oysters chopped with cured lemon and topped with osetra caviar wonderful squab is presented in its rock salt and spice coat , then removed for carving monkfish , roasted on the bone , is encircled with asparagus and fresh morels i was less impressed with other dishes a fabuloussounding fricassee of crayfish with peas and lardons never quite came together the crayfish seemed mushy against the undercooked peas and crisp bits of bacon softshell crabs were too salty , too buttery and too cooked and fresh corn soup was garnished with strangely leaden shallot quenelles but desserts are excellent the creme brulee is made with duck eggs , giving it an unusual texture to my mind , mr manrique has embellished it with too many distracting spices \( lemon , cinnamon and star anise \) , but i understand why this version has its fans i love his warm crepes stuffed with apricot cream with armagnac and orange liqueur , and i like them even better when they are served with his deeply alcoholic prunearmagnac ice cream and that warm chocolate cake with the hot espresso poured over the top , well , it has to be experienced the wine list is impressive , filled with great wines often at very reasonable prices even the food is reasonable 44 for a threecourse prix fixe dinner may be the luxury bargain of manhattan but as i left one night , moving past the bowing waiters and the maitre d'hotel , i wondered whether i would return on my own money the answer \?

atlanta , july 17 when she was 6 or 7 years old , amy van dyken realized that she was different from the other kids while other children played in her neighborhood in denver , she had trouble walking up a flight of stairs without struggling to breathe a doctor recommended that she take up swimming , where the humid environment and the controlled breathing might help her asthma at 23 , she has become america s top female sprinter , and its best hope against the dominance of china in the 50 and 100meter freestyle events at the summer olympics of course , she would like to win a gold medal but competing is satisfaction enough , considering she could not swim a single length of a pool until she was 12 what i 've done so far is so extraordinary for me , van dyken said anything else is icing on the cake but i 'd like thick , thick icing on that cake as she spoke to reporters today , van dyken said she was breathing about 65 percent of what a normal person breathes she has had asthma since she was 18 months old , and four times a day she must take medication in the form of pills and inhalers the rub is , she must be careful not to take any medication on the international olympic committee s list of banned substances there is medicine on the market that would allow her lungs to take in even more air , but the medication is prohibited for athletic competition because it is considered a performanceenhancing stimulant it makes you sore and gain weight and hungry , said van dyken , who added that she had been drugtested about a dozen times this year it does n't enhance your performance most of the talk about performanceenhancing drugs at these olympics concerns not asthma medicine but suspicion about china s female swimmers nineteen chinese swimmers have tested positive for forbidden substances since 1990 swimming opens on saturday , and in the very first olympic event , van dyken will face the worldrecord holder le jingyi of china in the 100meter freestyle it bothers her that other athletes might be taking drugs to enhance their performances while she needs medication merely to breathe , van dyken said but she refused to paint the chinese with a broad brush of condemnation asked how the chinese women became so dominant in this decade after winning only four medals in the 1988 games , van dyken said they say great training you have to believe that none of them here have been caught doing anything if a swimmer begins to think that the chinese are bigger , stronger and badder , van dyken said , that swimmer is in danger of losing the race in her head , which means she is bound to lose in the pool another american swimmer , kristine quance , had seen the chinese women recently and determined that they do n't look as big and bad as everyone says they are i do n't care about them , van dyken said i saw them i think we 're stronger and i think we 're faster i think the chinese women can and will be beaten four years ago , the american women were built up as favorites in barcelona , spain , only to suffer the consequences of unfulfilled expectations this time , the americans are not favored to win a single gold medal i think we 're going to shock a lot of people , van dyken said normally , she is as buoyant outside the pool as she is in it , a nonconformist who has a poodle named buttons that drinks coffee with cream and sugar , a superstitious swimmer who wears a certain pair of socks for each of her events she is an indefatigable talker , a hired gun with a giggle , as nbc television likes to call her but she also admits to playing mind games with the chinese , giving them stares when they pass each other at the pool i look at them , i want to check them out , said van dyken , who is 6 feet tall and weighs 155 pounds i'm not a small girl i 'll flex at 'em we try to be good , but we give them looks , she added the chinese must wonder why , van dyken said she believes they do not know it if they are being given banned substances it s easy to slip something in a swimmer s drink , van dyken said i do n't think they know still , the chinese are the competition , and van dyken does not treat her competition with handshakes and good luck wishes before a race , she said that she becomes mean and vicious in a waiting area , van dyken shoots harsh looks at her opponents they either stare back and giggling breaks out , she said , or they look down at their feet on the pool deck , she listens to heavy metal music and goes through a ritual of intimidation that includes clapping , spitting , jumping , staring and grunting i want to get to someone mentally , van dyken said i feel if someone is mentally weak enough to subject themselves to my staring and clapping and spitting , they 're just like you and me at china s last major international competition , the 1994 world championships , its female swimmers won 12 of 16 possible gold medals if the chinese women finish 12 in two events on saturday , van dyken said , other swimmers should come together as a unit , not to gang up on the chinese , but to maintain their own resolve we have to say , 'come on , we can do this , ' van dyken said you hear they 're bigger , badder and stronger , you get a little mentally weak on them you 've done all this running and weight training you do n't worry about one person you worry about yourself if she worried about defeat , she never would have overcome her debilitating asthma if someone says , 'amy , you 're not supposed to do this , ' i'm going to prove that i can , she said photo amy van dyken , who overcame asthma to become a worldclassswimmer , at a news conference yesterday \( jose r lopez the new york times \)
there has not been a summit meeting as volatile and unrehearsed as this week s middle east talks in washington since ronald reagan and mikhail gorbachev briefly ventured into the uncharted territory of nuclear disarmament 10 years ago in iceland the precarious nature of the discussions between benjamin netanyahu and yasir arafat became clear at a concluding white house news conference yesterday when president clinton read a cautious statement , then warily answered questions while the israeli prime minister and palestinian leader sat silently and unsmilingly by his side it is a bit unnerving to see statecraft conducted so close to the edge , but the outcome was respectable , given the difficult circumstances none of the material differences between mr netanyahu and mr arafat were resolved in two days of talks , including the issue of the archeological tunnel in jerusalem that ignited the fighting tensions remain high in israel , the west bank and the gaza strip , and mr arafat left town clearly frustrated that something more tangible had not been achieved but at least the two leaders talked for several hours and their aides negotiated through the night most important , both sides agreed for the first time since mr netanyahu took office to conduct sustained talks in the middle east they will begin on sunday mr netanyahu and mr arafat also recommitted themselves to settling their differences nonviolently and keeping their security forces from clashing , an important step after the recent violence as mr clinton said , it would have been better if the two men had narrowed or settled some of their policy differences , but that was unrealistic for a first encounter after the deadly clashes of last week just getting mr netanyahu and mr arafat in the same room was an accomplishment mr clinton demonstrated leadership and took a risk by transplanting the middle east crisis to the white house a month before the election mr netanyahu and mr arafat showed strength by attending barring a new eruption of violence , the israelis and palestinians can get on with the hard business of settling their differences over how to carry out the terms of the oslo peace agreements , if that is all that immediately divides them the chances for peace would certainly be greater if the new israeli government makes no effort to reopen and renegotiate the accords mr clinton made clear he hoped differences over the west bank city of hebron could be settled quickly israel agreed under the oslo accords to reduce and relocate its forces there , leaving a limited contingent to protect jewish residents and religious sites the withdrawal was temporarily postponed by mr netanyahu s predecessor , shimon peres , then put on indefinite hold by mr netanyahu , who complained that the jews in hebron would be inadequately protected under the original plan if mr netanyahu is committed to honoring the peace accords , he and the palestinians need to agree on a new withdrawal plan and put it into effect that will require some new commitments by mr arafat to insure that palestinian police do not again turn their weapons against israeli forces and that the jews of hebron not be subject to attack by palestinian rioters devising a hebron withdrawal formula acceptable to both sides is the first and most urgent order of business at the israelipalestinian talks that open on sunday settlement of that issue would restore some of the trust that was lost last week the middle east crisis is not over but for the moment , at least , it is not getting worse

hoboken a painting need not be about only the things you can see it can just as easily concern things that you hear , experiences of sound as well as sight at least , that s the assumption under which serena bocchino has been working in doing so , she has placed herself in the tradition of such esteemed predecessors as whistler , who often titled his paintings nocturnes or symphonies , and mondrian , whose last works were inspired by the boogiewoogie music he heard in his new york city exile in the 1940 s so a visitor to ms bocchino s studio here , with its wide vistas across the train yards looking toward manhattan , or to her exhibition observer highway , on view through nov 24 at the bergen museum of art and science in paramus , should expect to think in terms of not only line , form and color , but also rhythm , volume and tone the show , having traveled through new jersey and to new york city , has arrived at the bergen museum as its final stop a 36yearold artist whose work evokes music might be expected to take her inspiration from rockandroll , perhaps even from rap but the titles of ms bocchino s paintings tell a different tale early bird , miles ahead , and cool baker , with their allusions to charlie parker , miles davis and chet baker , evoke the sounds of jazz and not just any jazz , but that of a particular era , namely the bebop of the 1940 s and the cool jazz of the 50 s not that i necessarily put on a certain tape to listen to while i made the painting , ms bocchino hastens to explain of her musical allusions the relationship between the music and the painting is much less specific than that ms bocchino credits her mother , lucia confalonebocchino , an artist whose specialty was assemblage , as being among her major influences actually , i feel so conservative compared to my mother , she adds everything she did was so wild everything about our house was different the hallways were orange ! there were clashing colors and patterns nothing matched it was constant visual stimulation it certainly does n't sound like the typical hillsdale household of the 1960 s now , ms bocchino adds , i prefer something more minimal in my living space does the kind of jazz reflected in her paintings refer to what she grew up listening to \? no , she says it was more opera and classical it s really been in the last 5 to 10 years that i 've become more involved with jazz still , the jazz connection makes sense because the paintings maintain a balance between passion and restraint that ms bocchino s jazz masters would have taken a shine to similarly , their delight in subdividing a musical beat and delaying or anticipating its accents rather than placing their notes on them foursquare finds an affinity with a painter whose work implies rather than defines its forms , and in which glissandos between one color and another can imply a chromatic keynote you 'd be hard put to pin down because it turns up only in passing and then a subtle glow emanates from the canvases another reason it makes sense is that while ms bocchino is keenly interested in the art of her own generation , her paintings are clearly just as informed by the abstract art of the 1940 s and 50 s , including that of some relatively overlooked figures , like william bariotes and adolph gottlieb , as well as big names like arshile gorky , philip guston or cy twombly it s not that ms bocchino is just purveying retro style part of the pungency of her paintings is the way they insinuate halfforgotten sights and sounds into a vividly immediate contest although ms bocchino first exhibited her work in manhattan in the east village a decade ago , she has never sought either the raw , aggressive emotionalism of the neoexpressionist art that attracted so much attention there nor the cool irony of the neogeo that was the inevitable reaction only jazz could have taught her that you can wear your heart on your sleeve if the cut of the sleeve is irreproachably elegant ms bocchino still recalls the east village of the early 1980 s , when she was working toward her master of arts degree at new york university , as being the best time to be an art student it was so easy to meet other artists , to show your work , have a dialogue , she says there was a real warmth there that does n't exist anymore everything seemed so close and easy i remember being in the building where larry rivers had his studio you 'd go to the bathroom and you 'd hear larry playing the saxophone down the hall eight years ago , high rents in manhattan led ms bocchino to cross the river and look for studio space in hoboken for years she worked in a building on observer highway , but in 1993 she joined fellow artists buying a building on grand street its affordable 4 , 000squarefoot livework lofts seemed like every artist s dream but it turned out to be a nightmare when in january , puddles of mercury from a factory that had once been occupied it were found under the floorboards like many other residents , ms bocchino , her husband and their 18monthold son were both found to have dangerous levels of mercury in their blood it s not a topic the normally voluble artist talks about easily i was just crying on channel 9 last night it s enough , she says the grand street building has been condemned , and ms bocchino finds herself deep in litigation and back in a different studio in her old building on observer highway it s not easy to see how anyone can have worked so diligently on painting while under such stress seeing the new paintings ms bocchino is working on in the studio underlined a fact that might not have seemed so significant when looking at the finished works unlike most painters , her process begins not with color , not with line , but with texture she 'll often lay bits of cheesecloth into the ground of the painting so that when she starts painting , she gets some hints of form or some spaceimplying roughness that she can work with or , more often , work against the initial texture is what starts pulling me into the canvas , she explains you can still catch sight of these textured passages in the finished paintings , but because the interaction of color , brush stroke and line has become so brisk by then , they 're easy to overlook these days i'm looking for the most basic form of line for my paintings , the artist explains as she points out the emphatic , almost crudelooking black marks she has laid into one of the works in progress trying to evade facileness , she 'll just as often make her marks with a bent wire , a piece of wood or a squeegee as a brush lines pierce the color areas but also tie them together the color is typically suave , full of delicate interfusions and surprising modulations , smooth but with a sweetandsour aftertaste but the dichotomy of line and color is more apparent than real lines thread in and out of hazy colorspaces just as colors migrate through the space of other colors and mutate as they move the feeling that within these paintings everything is in transition , that none of their elements have become too strictly defined , may be exactly what keeps them fresh david messer , the director of the bergen museum , marvels that even the largest of ms bocchino s paintings still maintains the same spontaneity as if it were a drawing on a small piece of paper the artist herself puts it more simply you want to keep that surprise and unsureness in the work photos serena bocchino with an untitled work in her studio on observer

uniondale , li , march 23 overtime is the right time for the devils eighteen times they have gone into the extra period this season , and 18 times they have emerged without a loss the 18th time may have been the sweetest , though , for tonight the devils broke a threegame losing streak and righted their ship toward the playoffs with a 32 victory over the islanders at nassau coliseum steve thomas , who two weeks ago got an overtime gamewinner in pittsburgh , did it again with 1 minute 22 seconds remaining he put a rebound of bill guerin s shot past islander goalie eric fichaud , completing a game that saw the devils battle back from deficits of 10 and 21 the most important goal i 've scored all year , thomas said of the gamewinner , which was his teamleading 25th goal the devils are 7011 in overtime this season they are 332811 over all , good for 77 points as they fight for a playoff spot in the tightly contested eastern conference these are tough games , thomas said it s an absolute logjam for the last spot every game is an absolute playoff the top eight teams in the eastern conference go to the playoffs the devils , boston and tampa bay are tied for sixth place in the eastern conference , which means if the season ended today , new jersey would edge ninthplace washington by 1 point in addition , fifthplace montreal is only three points ahead of the trio deadlocked in sixth those five teams all have 10 games remaining they 're hard to get , hard to win , every one , devils coach jacques lemaire said the devils may have the most difficult schedule tonight marked their first game of a fivegame trip the devils play six of their final 10 on the road and have to play at both tampa bay and washington washington has the seemingly easiest schedule the capitals have five home games , including crucial matches against both the devils and tampa bay boston and montreal play three times over the final 10 games the bruins do not have any headtohead matches against the devils , tampa bay or washington the canadiens have a home game against washington on wednesday but do not play the devils or tampa bay only two weeks ago , the devils were in the midst of a 703 run , but they had lost three straight , including friday night against chicago this gives us a lot of confidence , thomas said we 've been struggling , and now is a terrible time to be struggling the devils' stephane richer tied the score at 22 with 5 07 left in regulation with a 30foot wrist shot that sailed over fichaud s glove richer picked up the puck in the slot and moved to his left , where dan plante should have made a check but richer skated around plante as though plante was a traffic cone , giving richer a clear view of the net this was a huge win for us , richer said we 're fighting for a spot in the playoffs every point , every game , is so important richer s goal should have put the devils ahead , but an apparent tying goal five minutes earlier was waved off by the referee dave jackson because jackson blew his whistle prematurely fichaud had stopped a shot , and the rebound landed in the crease fichaud went to smother the puck , and as he brought his glove down , jackson blew his whistle but the puck squirted out and was immediately poked in by the devils' phil housley and only 25 seconds before richer s goal , steve sullivan clanked a slap shot off the cross bar alexander semak gave the islanders a 21 lead 7 54 into the third period when his wild , spinning wrist shot skipped through the legs of devils goalie martin brodeur brodeur prevented the islanders from going up by 31 with 8 30 left in the game when he made an acrobatic glove stop on niklas andersson , who came down on a twoonnone break with zigmund palffy and forced a shot instead of feeding a wideopen palffy andersson has 12 goals , palffy 37 fichaud who stopped 40 of 43 shots shut down the devils through the first two periods , but new jersey finally broke through 3 56 into the third period to tie the game at 11 slap shots the devils travel to tampa bay , st louis , pittsburgh and then face the rangers before finally returning to continental arena on april 4 to play host to hartford the walking wounded neal broten , mike peluso and john maclean are on the trip and listed as day to day photo devils goaltendere martin brodeur making a save in last night s game against the islanders \( alan zale for the new york times \)
toronto , jan 24 kenny belmar , 27 , a night student in business administration at ryerson polytechnic university here , was waiting for a bus outside his home in east toronto when two plainclothes policemen drew up in an unmarked car , accused him of stealing an outboard motor and arrested him anthony morrison , 31 , who runs a courier business , went downstairs in his north toronto highrise to get a container of soup he had left in his car as soon as he entered a courtyard downstairs , police officers who had been called to the building because of a dispute that had nothing to do with him arrested him each man , interviewed separately , said his arrest would not have occurred were he not black they did n't listen to anything i said , mr belmar complained bitterly they were focused only on one thing , arresting me mr morrison , equally angry , said i do n't do drugs i do n't do weapons the way i was treated that night i would be naive to think it was n't racist because both cases involve judicial proceedings , police spokesmen would not comment on them but the anger of the two young men underscores a longheld belief in the black community here of pervasive racism in the criminal justice system now in an ambitious study , a commission of ontario jurists and civic officials has produced statistical evidence to support that belief from 1986 to 1993 , the commission found , the number of blacks imprisoned in ontario increased by 204 percent compared with a 23 percent increase for whites analysis of police and bail court decisions found that the proportion of accused whites released by the police \( 29 percent \) was significantly greater than for accused blacks \( 18 percent \) nearly half of metropolitan toronto black youths between 18 and 24 were stopped at least twice by the police over the last two years , compared with a quarter of white youths blacks are 27 times as likely to be jailed before their trials on drug trafficking and importing charges and 20 times as likely as whites to be imprisoned for drug possession charges these figures and mountains of other data collected over three years and published last week in a 445page report led the six commissioners to the conclusion that systemic racism exists in ontario criminal justice margaret gittens , a cochairman of the commission who is a community legal worker in downtown toronto , said that by examining the entire criminal justice system , we were able to see where the system could be unfair at key points in the administration of justice the other cochairman , david cole , a criminal court judge in the ontario court of justice provincial division , stressed that it is imperative that the criminal justice system regain the trust of all members of society the study was ordered in 1992 by the provincial government , which feared the spread here of americanstyle racial violence riots involving black youths , angered by the killing of a young black man by the police , had just occurred on toronto s yonge street they followed news reports of the los angeles riots after the acquittal of police officers in the beating of rodney king at the time , socialist new democrats controlled the ontario government last year , power shifted to the progressive conservatives although some blacks said they expected the report to be buried by the new government , which sets law and order among its top priorities , the new attorney general , charles harnick , issued a statement promising a careful review of the findings and recommendations a spokesman for the ontario association of chiefs of police said his organization would also examine the full statistical background and analysis leading to the conclusions of the report many blacks applauded the findings this is the first time in a very clear way there has been an acknowledgment by any organized body of government in canada that there is differential treatment because of race , said charles roach , lawyer for the black action defense committee , a legal aid group for black defendants some people say racism is only something that exists south of the border , he said this proves the contrary it is a first step in purging the system of these legally unjustifiable differentials ewart walters , editor of a monthly newsletter , spectrum , which circulates in ontario s caribbean community , observed that black people have nothing to hope for except that they can exist in a just society , and that hope is daily being eroded in ontario rising immigration , chiefly from jamaica and other caribbean countries , has sharply increased the province s black population in recent years between 1986 and 1991 , the study shows , the black population rose by 364 percent , while the provincial population as a whole grew by 108 percent today more 3 percent of ontario s 10 million people are black , but blacks account for 15 percent of the prison population a crackdown on drugs is seen as at least partly responsible for the disproportion policing of poor areas in which black people live leads to the arrest of many black suspects yet the report notes that law enforcement directed at smallscale traders and couriers has an insignificant impact on drug use many police officers , lawyers and judges including some we consulted acknowledge this , the report said they know that effective drug policies emphasize treatment and prevention of abuse a similar issue has arisen in the united states , where federal sentencing guidelines call for longer sentences for convictions involving crack cocaine than for offenses involving cocaine powder many consider such guidelines discriminatory because a higher percentage of crack defendants are black blacks are in disproportionate numbers in american prisons as well it is clear from our findings , the report says , that in ontario , as in many parts of the united states , one effect of the 'war on drugs , ' intended or not , has been the increase in imprisonment of black people the report examined 16 shootings of black people 10 fatally by the ontario police since 1978 , in nine cases , criminal charges were brought against the officers none were convicted often , the report notes , investigations into shootings are frustrated by a refusal of police officers to respond to questioning a requirement of officers to respond to questions or face suspension without pay is one of the main recommendations of the commission the shootings are perceived , says the report , not as isolated incidents , but as tragedies that affect the entire black community and as a reflection of the destructive force of systemic racism photo anthony morrison , a toronto resident who runs a courierbusiness , says he would not have been arrested

martina hingis s dream match with steffi graf ended almost before it began yesterday , after a tantalizing taste of action when the united states open semifinal was postponed until today because of rain , hingis , the 15yearold phenom , led the first set by one game to none one more day to put a new spin on an old story teen star on the fast track going into the match , the speculation was that the very hot hingis had a good shot at defeating graf , whose mounting physical and emotional distractions were eating up space where concentration used to live for hingis , the only burden was the burden of youth , some days light as a feather and some days heavy as a ton of bricks the trial of graf s father on tax evasion charges began on thursday the strained calf that prompted her to pull out of the olympics in july was still causing her problems and she had continuing back problems as well where graf is concerned , the experts have the facts right but the analysis wrong it is precisely the problems , the adversity , that have created the hardened professional graf has won the united states open graf has won wimbledon she has won them all injured and injury free in good times and bad on thursday night , pete sampras , sick to his stomach , fighting dehydration , held off alex corretja to win a furious fifthset tie breaker three years ago , monica seles was stabbed in the back during a match she missed 28 months before launching a comeback the once bubbly seles found a reservoir of toughness that some thought she did not possess hingis is good but she does n't have scar tissue she is young for most of the open , the teenager from switzerland has been on an amazing ride , using speed and guile , finesse and timing , pulling off upset after upset she has been gracious and lighthearted two hours before her match on friday , hingis , her mother and her training partner worked out on a practice court as 60 fans snapped photos and looked on she began by jogging around the court , then lightheartedly skipping the last few yards she smiled throughout the workout , in stark contrast to the sullen goran ivanisevic , who was practicing two courts away three years ago , hingis replaced jennifer capriati as the youngest grand slam junior titleholder virtually every story on hingis has mentioned capriati , the young flash whose tumble has made everyone defensive about the presence of rising young stars martina s a different case , said dani narizzano , who has worked as her hitting partner for the last three weeks she s a onceinageneration player not just her ability but her personality she just loves to play billie jean king added her mom is trying to slow it down i think that playing doubles helps , adds a social dimension that you do n't get just playing singles yet , for someone taking it slow , hingis is on an awfully fast track and she is playing an awful lot of tennis at the open , she played in doubles and , curiously , mixed doubles in addition to grueling singles competition trouble is , once you put children on this conveyor belt , it becomes difficult to pull them off by thursday , she had begun to feel the crush and pull of celebrity one united states tennis association official observed today was the first time she acted like she was 15 years old she was getting a little overwhelmed she s saying , 'wow , so this is what it means to be famous' people want a piece of hingis for that moment for that deadline but if she loses too many times , she 'll become the phenom that was so while it may be overly dramatic to say that a loss to graf might actually help hingis , it is close to the truth the news media , by definition and necessity , are like hawks , perched to prey on something new and fresh , even if the story is old after practice yesterday , hingis and her partner jogged around the court , finishing the workout as they had started it then , in a light rain , she signed autographs for 10 minutes as she left , she put her arm around narizzano s waist and they skipped down the ramp and out of sight into the players' clubhouse in another section , on secluded court 15 , graf was finishing a crisp workout no smiling , no skipping steffi has been there done that she knows better photo martina hingis \( barton silverman \)
london , oct 7 when it opened at sadler s wells last year , matthew bourne s provocative version of the most classic of classic ballets was immediately labeled the gay swan lake it was not surprising mr bourne s swans were not dainty dancers in tutus , but fierce , barechested men in feathery pantaloons the result could have been a disastrous parody , a fiasco destined to make mr bourne a laughingstock in london s unforgiving ballet world but audiences and critics alike have lavished praise on the production , which is now in the midst of a run on the west end and is making sellout audiences wonder how they could ever have thought of swans as graceful ballerinas in the first place mr bourne s swan lake now in negotiations , with the help of the producer sir cameron mackintosh , to move to broadway in the spring is both novel and universal , a retelling of an old story that plays with and expands its traditional meaning he s taken both a cheeky and a considered approach to the story , transposed it both in terms of time and place to make it relate to people s own experiences , debra craine , the dance critic for the times of london , said in an interview the male swans are not the only change brought to swan lake by mr bourne , a 35yearold choreographer who founded an innovative contemporary dance company , adventures in motion pictures , nine years ago the ballet is the latest in a series of productions by his troupe , whose works have included a nutcracker set in an orphanage and late flowering lust , in which the actor nigel hawthorne read poems by john betjeman while members of the company danced mr bourne s version of swan lake owes as much to the theater as it does to classical ballet , following a story line as clear and crisp as that of any play i 've never been a classic choreographer that s not the world i come from , said mr bourne , who took his first dance lesson at the age of 22 and has choreographed productions as diverse as oliver ! for sir cameron \( who is providing general management for swan lake \) and a midsummer night s dream for the english national opera he has remained faithful to tchaikovsky s score , but used the bare bones of the familiar story prince falls in love with swan , wicked alternative swan enchants prince , prince and original swan kill themselves as a starting point for his own narrative thus the work is as much about intrigue at the royal palace , the oedipal conflicts between the prince and his mother and the prince s search for identity as it is about a young man s attempts to find true love i wanted to do something that would relate to a modern audience not necessarily a ballet audience , but a cinema or theater audience , mr bourne said in a recent interview at the piccadilly theater , as his dancers warmed up onstage a director s main task is to tell a story , and i put the story first the curtain goes up , and you should have no preconceived idea no knowledge is required part of his way of reaching the audience is through humor , particularly in his comic sendup of britain s royal family the ballet takes place sometime in the 20th century , as the main character , the adolescent prince , struggles to break free from the straitjacket of monarchy and the viselike grip of his evil mother , a medea in a 1950 s swing dress the parallels to today s royal family are obvious \( there is even a figure who sells out the prince to the tabloids \) , but mr bourne says the prince is n't charles , exactly he is an amalgamation of all princes and kings this century , he said they stutter they 're timid none are right for the position of king he s in a long line of unsuitable kings ms craine said mr bourne had made the ballet accessible to the general public , without condescending dance sometimes has this image of being an arduous task that the audience has to undergo for some sort of enlightenment , she said but he s shown that you can go and see a performance and have a terrific time and not worry about not understanding the language or having to make an artistic assessment of what you 're seeing at the same time , he has n't said , 'because you do n't know anything about dance , i'm going to produce the lowest common denominator' the ballet has proved so exciting that mikhail baryshnikov dropped in and asked mr bourne to choreograph for him , and the ballerina lynn seymour asked if she could dance the role of the queen later this fall \( she can , mr bourne said \) mr bourne is the first to admit that his sexy male swans particularly adam cooper , a principal dancer on loan from the royal ballet who plays the male version of the odetteodile role on alternate nights have helped draw the crowds but , he says , the idea came to him in an uncalculating flash their enormous wingspan , their power , the violence that swans can erupt into all that suggested male rather than female dancers , he said mr bourne studied the swans in st james s park here and showed his dancers a slowmotion videotape of an angry swan attacking a fishing boat swans are not always beautiful , and they 're not always gliding , he said he strove , he said , to evoke the swannish ungainliness the birds show when , for example , they land on the water and shift their weight backward it s an odd , almost ugly thing , and it s very undancerly , he said mr bourne is loath , however , to impose his own meaning on the ballet part of this is an effort to let people decide for themselves for every person who reads homosexual love in the charged relationship between the odetteodile figure \( here simply called the swan \) and the prince , there is someone else who sees the swan as the prince s idealized version of himself this is true even in the pivotal third act , when the swan appears at the royal ball with tight leather trousers and a louche attitude , seducing everyone in sight , men and women is the prince in love with him \? of course it can be seen as a gay love story , but it can also be seen as a story about someone with no love in his life who s yearning for something more , mr bourne said the swan is a sort of alter ego he s free , he s beautiful , he s strong all the things the prince wants to be the final moments of the ballet , when the swan cradles the prince in arms that look for all the world like wings , have drawn the most emotional reactions , mr bourne said act four is about betrayal and forgiveness , he said , and it can be seen in all manner of ways people read into it things i did n't even think about photos the idea of male swans was born \( dee conway \) , said the choreographer , matthew bourne , right , at the piccadilly theater in london \( jonathan player for the new york times \) , when he thought of the birds' power and the violence that swans can erupt into
washington , march 25 it was hard enough for members of congress to make laws when they had to get them through the house , the senate and the white house these days they have to worry about the electoral college , too with the senate majority leader as the presumptive republican presidential candidate and the speaker of the house pledging support , the congressional part of the lawmaking agenda is as political as it has ever been and the presidential part is as political as it always is in a year divisible by four but the partisan imperatives lead in three directions toward laws both sides think useful as politics and policy , toward confrontations designed to emphasize partisan differences to voters and toward stunts to please important supporters sometimes an issue , like the unfinished 1996 budget , is tugged between one category and another first , there are measures that both the president and the republicans running congress want to see become law , like the lineitem veto , an increase in the limit on the federal debt , and very probably a requirement that health insurance be portable from job to job the mutual support for these measures does not rest solely on both sides' considering them to be in the national interest both sides are also acutely aware that if they go through another year with as limited a list of accomplishments as 1995 s , the public may turn on them and throw a lot of them out a us news and world report poll in late january found that 65 percent of americans considered the budget fight partisan bickering and politics as usual , while only 25 percent considered it an important debate about priorities and policies then there are bills where contradictory political judgments \( or different constituencies \) leave both sides happy to go to the mattresses although each side earnestly insists it wishes the other side would compromise \( read surrender \) , the veto fight suits them fine on issues like damages in defectiveproduct cases , or the republicans' plan to pass another balanced budget plan after senator bob dole called president clinton old veto bill , last week , the president responded you bet , and i'm proud of it finally , there are the political stunts that are more of a campaign ad than a legislative exercise , because none of their advocates thinks they can even get through congress senator bob dole has at least two of them on his april calendar another vote on the balanced budget amendment that fell short last year of the twothirds majority such actions require , and a vote on a congressional term limits amendment that he does n't much like himself the house went through one of those exercises on friday when it voted to repeal the ban on manufacture of 19 assault weapons despite the heralded consultation on republican efforts on capitol hill , house leaders had did not tell mr dole and do not expect him to seek senate action they just wanted to let an important backer , the national rifle association , that house republicans know they still loved it occasionally it is not clear where a bill falls certainly both the white house and congressional republicans agree that the time has come to finish passing the spending legislation for the fiscal year that began oct 1 , so they can start fighting over the budget for this year but the fiscal 1996 measure is not solidly to be classified as good for the country , good for us politicians , too instead , it verges into the category of let s fight it out and show the voters who is right republicans , especially in the house , are loathe to give way on cutting spending on education and on a series of policy directives in the bill on the environment , abortion and direct government loans to students democrats think they have republicans on the run on these issues and are trying to force something close to unconditional surrender another major bill whose category is not certain is the health insurance measure the general idea of portability has near universal support , and the house is expected to vote this week and the senate in midapril but confrontations are possible the president and the senate sponsors want to require insurance companies to sell individual policies to people who lose their group coverage , and much of the insurance industry hates that idea the house wants to add some other provisions that might cause the senate to balk but mr dole will probably find this bill an achievement he needs to demonstrate that he can solve problems , and representative john r kasich , the ohio republican who heads the house budget committee , said on sunday on the nbc news program meet the press that the house would not ultimately insist on its favorite addons if that would destroy the ability to give people the portability and eliminate preexisting conditions the president and the republicans are not the only players the democrats in congress have a role , too , though it is often confused they certainly have the power , in the senate , to make a political point by offering an amendment they have been talking for weeks about forcing a vote on raising the minimum wage , and may try to do it on tuesday , in connection with an energy bill a few democrats like senator edward m kennedy of massachusetts contend that if the issue is raised again and again , it may prove so popular that it will become law but more of them think of it as the right public policy , the right thing to do to for labor , and smart election politics but the major power of a senate minority is delay when the republicans were in the minority , they cheerfully used delaying tactics to keep unpleasant bills from reaching mr bush in 1992 , and to generally gum up the senate in 1994 so fewer bills of any kind would be passed those tactics do not come so comfortably to democrats , who instinctively like to pass bills we do n't want to be perceived as delaying , senator tom daschle of south dakota , the minority leader , said today but congressional democrats will not know whether delay , or other opposition , seems called for on some bills until the republican majorities figure out just what should be in them immigration is one example and republicans , in turn , have to decide whether they want a law or a campaign issue on some unsettled matters , like regulatory reform on others , like another try for a sevenyear balanced budget , which mr kasich said they would send the president , they have chosen to fight
a white merc with fins by james hawes 289 pages pantheon books 22 the bizarre ingredients of james hawes s very funny , very caustic first novel are as follows a narrator who is one of richard linklater s slackers disguised as a film noir con man a supporting cast made up of assorted british screwballs , hoods and drug addicts , and a wacky storyline that pays wry homage to quentin tarantino s reservoir dogs and pulp fiction the tone of a white merc with fins is selfconsciously tongueincheek its language is vintage , drugfueled hunter thompson manic , streetsmart and engagingly demented the unnamed narrator of merc is a young , aimless londoner , a waster , in his words , who would rather have his legs sawn off than do a steady job he s been to college , studied wittgenstein and kafka , done a brief stint as a drug addict and worked as a temp at assorted jobs reshelving tax returns for a hotel chain , sorting mail for the national antivivisection league and running errands for an outfit called baron films at 28 , he lives in a garden shed in his sister s backyard this disposable life , however , is about to end , or so mr hawes s narrator hopes he has come up with a plan that will change his life with a little help from the irish republican army , he and three friends are going to pull off a bank heist the narrator is n't planning this caper because he particularly sympathizes with the ira he is n't doing it because he has any sort of political or social agenda he s doing it because he does n't want to get a real job and ca n't think of any other way to get enough money to buy himself a nice , middleclass life a nice flat with tall windows and a garden and a fully poweredup legit mastercard in other words , he s a slacker who has become a criminal in order to become a yuppie in fact , in a crowded field , the narrator of white merc stands out , proudly , as one of the most selfish , selfdeluded characters to come along in years he prattles on , selfpityingly , about being shortlisted for happiness , and about the horrors of losing his hair he insists that the worst fate that could befall a person is to grow up and become an accountant and he complains noisily of the unfairness of a life that does n't come with a 100 percent quibblefree moneyback guarantee as the narrator sees it , the plan \( as he calls his bank caper \) is his one chance to save his life either the plan will work , he thinks , or he will walk out of the prison at 35 with a few scars , big muscles from all the bodybuilding you did to kill time and defend youself , a load of mad tales to tell , a book to write , and hundreds of adoring women to greet him and so the narrator rounds up his gang and sets the plan in motion there s his new girlfriend , suzy , a former addict who has the flattest stomach in all of london brady , a reservoir dog fetishist who spends his free time riding about the underground , dressed like harvey keitel and chico , a fat wouldbe restaurateur who speaks broken english none of them have any objections to the plan in fact , they 're all so fatalistic or spacedout that they just numbly follow the narrator s directions those directions , like most of the details of the plan , are carefully withheld from the reader throughout the book it s a coy and notverysubtle device to build suspense , and yet mr hawes manages to divert us along the way with lots of shaggy dog tales , amusing asides \( on everything from upperclass accents to the esthetics of cars with fins \) and a host of eccentric characters with walkon parts among the people we meet are mr supaservice , a procurer of stolen and otherwise dubious cars , a canny entrepreneur who uses his money to send his brood of children to good boarding schools fred , baron films s head bodyguard and chauffeur , who looks like a skinhead and lives like a good bourgeoise dai substantial , the narrator s emotional adviser , who has the voice of dylan thomas and the liver of a polar bear sammy , a sometime journalist who has spent her life looking for meaning and purpose and sammy s boyfriend , f f fitzpatrick , a silvertongued marxist with connections to a fringe group of the ira by interrupting the story of the bank heist to sketch in these characters s messy , entangled lives , mr hawes is able to send up an entire crosssection of london society , and he s also able to turn what would have otherwise been a flimsy copsandrobbers story into an antic satire of greed , class warfare and sexual high jinks though there s obviously a disturbing subtext to his story not to mention something repugnant about his narrator s casual willingness to do anything to acquire a comfortable life mr hawes does n't dwell on such matters he keeps his tale brisk and light like his hero , he remains a committed ironist irony , is what you do to stop it hurting before it starts , he writes irony is a preemptive strike on living we have to be ironists because we have nothing to risk hurting for , it is not the hurt we are afraid of , but getting hurt for no reason , we have no big picture of where it is all going and who is flying it by wire and why so we will sit here , and just veg out for a year or two with our dogs on strings and try to get some perspectives , and wait for the job , the real thing , to come ambling along photo \( jonathan cape \)
new york has always been a place where people will tell you where to go what s remarkable is what a business it has turned into the first guidebook to new york city dates from 1807 its author was dr samuel l mitchill , and its title was the picture of newyork or , the traveller s guide through the commercial metropolis of the united states by a gentleman residing in this city a compendium of municipal data \( it notes eight daily newspapers , five semiweeklies and six weeklies \) , descriptions of the urban landscape \( the park in front of city hall , then under construction , was planted with elms , planes , willows and catalpas \) , annotated journeys on foot and by boat along the hudson , and the occasional review \( mechanic hall , on broadway , was one of the most genteel hotels in the city \) , the city s initial guidebook was , in short , a worthy and recognizable progenitor of the genre still and all , dr mitchill would probably be astounded at what he eventually wrought , a veritable flood of published instruction , reflection , direction and suggestion aimed at both visitors to and residents of the commercial metropolis of the united states at this point , whole bookstore sections devote themselves to city guides , both of the comprehensive and the specialized varieties books in print , under the headings new york city description , and new york city descriptionguidebooks , lists more than 300 titles in october 1994 , city and company , a brandnew publishing house devoted to city guides , offered the first four specialty volumes \( including how to meet a mensch in new york and the new york dog owner s guide \) of a list that has now grown to 16 for a browser , even a dedicated one , the sheer variety is daunting , much in the manner of the city itself \( a guide to guides would be helpful \) and for many specific purposes , there is little choice i could find only one dog lover s book take it or leave it but many of these books overlap in their territory , so what do you do then \? the reasons for the proliferation are manifold , but together they speak to the traditional appeal of new york the variety of cultural and intellectual life keeps the people living here and creates curiosity everywhere else first of all , there are just so many people in new york , intelligent , curious people who know enough about new york to know there s a lot about new york they do n't know , said karen cure , editorial director of fodor s travel publications , which published two new york city guides in 1989 , and this year will publish eight different volumes , aimed at both visitors and residents and these are people who know there is a lot they can learn from a book society s getting more complicated , and people are feeling overwhelmed and guidebooks do organize and systematize the world for them she continued there are a lot of niche markets in new york in atlanta , there may be people interested in pet cemeteries but not enough pet cemeteries to do a book about there are in new york , and there are also enough people who 'll go out and buy the book actually , the marketplace had taken over enough by the turn of the 20th century that niches in the guidebook market had sprouted you could find information about city rail and steamboat schedules , the locations of churches , banks and insurance offices , and cursory descriptions of restaurants , museums and hotels by the 1880 s , appleton s dictionary of greater new york included a section on slumming , explaining to the bourgeoisie how to arrange a tour of the city s seamier side the midcentury even featured guides to brothels , some straightforward , some rather sneakily offered with a veil of disapproval it was a genre , said barbara cohen , a coowner of new york bound , a bookshop in rockefeller center specializing in historical and contemporary works about the city one 1839 volume was titled prostitution exposed , or , a moral reform directory laying bare the lives , histories , residences , seductions , etc , of the most celebrated courtezans and ladies of pleasure of the city of new york a typical entry jane p williams resides at 148 leonard street rather wellformed and about 35 years of age keeps a good house and some very handsome girls prices moderate but 150 years ago there were no guides specifically aimed at cat owners , architecture appreciators , jews , women , newcomers , crime aficionados , francophiles , dance enthusiasts , children , peregrine falcon lovers , antiquers or apartment hunters the arts scene may have been flourishing , but it had no comprehensive directory of performance spaces and repertory companies like the estimable applause new york s guide to the performing arts \( applause theatre book publisher , 1992 \) by ruth leon the city may have been a grueling place to live even then , but there was no guide to coping like the intrepid new yorker how to turn new york city into a manageable small town \( villard books , 1993 \) by kathy mayer braddock and tory baker masters it offers voluminous advice \( some of which is mere common sense \) for consumers on things like how get better service from your butcher or avoid long lines at the bank

in a ruling that goes to the basic philosophy of affirmative action , a federal appeals court declared yesterday that a school district facing layoffs should not have used race as the sole reason to lay off a white teacher the board of education of piscataway , nj , cited its policy of seeking a diverse workplace in choosing in 1989 whether to lay off a black teacher or a white one who was equally experienced and qualified the united states court of appeals for the third circuit found the district s policy to be unlawful because it was not put into place to remedy past discrimination and because it unnecessarily violated the rights of a nonminority employee the court , which sits in philadelphia and has jurisdiction over new jersey , pennsylvania , delaware and the virgin islands , is the highest tribunal yet to rule on the fundamental question raised by the case can racial preference be used solely to foster a workplace with a variety of people \? lawyers for both sides , as well as government officials and legal scholars who have followed affirmative action , agreed that the ruling would be closely studied by public and private employers throughout the united states , and that the issues it addressed would one day be taken up by the supreme court the issues have already bitterly divided officials of the clinton administration , which switched sides in the case and then bowed out opposing lawyers in the piscataway case agreed yesterday that the court s 8to4 ruling was potentially far more important than a ruling last march by the court of appeals for the fifth circuit , in new orleans , that nullified the affirmativeaction program at the university of texas school of law that case also involved what is loosely called reverse discrimination and is certain to be reviewed by the high court the fifth circuit court sided with four white students who contended they had been denied admission to the law school by an unlawful policy based solely on race in comparing the new jersey and texas cases , david rubin , the attorney for the piscataway board of education , said yesterday this one is as farreaching or more farreaching one is about who gets to go to school this one is about who gets to go to work the piscataway case revolves around title vii of the landmark civil rights act of 1964 essentially , title vii was enacted to end discrimination in the workplace on the basis of race , religion , sex or national origin , and to remedy the scarcity of minority workers that past discrimination had caused when appellate courts , including the high court itself , have upheld racebased employment practices , they have often looked to the spirit and language of the 1964 act the problem the third circuit majority found with the piscataway policy illustrates some of the paradoxes that have arisen around the debate over affirmative action and the litigation it has stirred piscataway schools began an affirmative action policy in 1975 in response to a new jersey board of education directive that local school boards do so but by all accounts , the piscataway policy was not enacted to remedy past discrimination statistics from the mid1970 s to the mid1980 s showed that the percentage of teachers who were black reflected the makeup of the community and that black employees of the district did not tend to have jobs of less importance than whites in 1989 , the school board accepted a recommendation from the superintendent of schools to cut the ranks of business teachers by one the decision on whom to lay off came down to sharon taxman and debra williams mrs taxman and mrs williams were found to be equally qualified and have equal seniority they started work on the same day and to be virtually alike in ability and enthusiasm but ms williams was black , and as the board president , theodore h kruse , later put it in a deposition , i believe by retaining mrs williams it was sending a very clear message that our staff should be culturally diverse mr kruse went on to say that he saw advantages for students to come into contact with people of different cultures , different backgrounds , so that they are more aware , more tolerant , more accepting , more understanding of people of all backgrounds mrs taxman , represented by stephen klausner , a lawyer from somerville , nj , filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission a federal district court upheld the thrust of ms taxman s complaint the appellate court s decision , written by judge carol l mansmann , said that she and the judges who agreed with her wholeheartedly endorse the basic principle of exposing students to people of different backgrounds we do not reject in principle the diversity goal articulated by the board , the decision says we recognize that the differences among us underlie the richness and strength of our nation but those beliefs were not enough to justify what the board did to mrs taxman , the court said it also criticized the board for not better defining what it meant by racial diversity and not being specific enough about how much diversity it wanted chief judge dolores k sloviter led the four dissenters she said the board ought to have had discretion to decide between the two teachers , the constraints of title vii notwithstanding the chief judge wondered sarcastically whether the board should have been expected to decide by means of a coin toss or lottery , a solution that could be expected of the state s gaming tables the united states department of justice sided with mrs taxman at first , but then wanted to side with the board on appeal the government s highly unusual switch has been widely seen in washington as reflecting a bitter debate in the clinton administration involving both the law and the politics of the new jersey case a potentially troublesome facet of yesterday s decision for employers is that , if they want to use race as a factor in choosing whom to hire or promote , they may feel compelled to admit or even to demonstrate past discrimination even if they think they were guilty of none judge timothy lewis , who joined judge sloviter s dissent , predicted that the ruling would cause trouble somewhere out there in the real world suppose a law firm has to choose between laying off a white lawyer and an equally qualified black lawyer , the judge wrote if it chooses to keep the black lawyer because it would be a better business decision at the time , the firm risks getting into trouble mr rubin said the fundamental question left after the decision is , is race a reflection of anything meaningful \? if the answer is no , he said , then considering it as a factor is basically arbitrary and will therefore be found wrong by the courts mrs taxman and mrs williams both work for the school district now the appeals court said mrs taxman should be awarded some 140 , 000 back pay , plus interest , for the years she was not working but denied her request for punitive damages mr rubin said the nine members of the school board , most of whom were not on the board when the case began , must approve an appeal to the supreme court but he said he knew of no other cases where the issues are as alive , and as ripe for review , as this one excerpts from court decision following are excerpts from the federal appeals court decision involving the layoff of a white teacher in piscataway , nj from the majority opinion by judge carol l mansmann
boutros boutrosghali has provided honorable and competent leadership as secretary general of the united nations these last five years , but it is time for him to turn the job over to a more dynamic executive who can reform the organization and help restore its credibility with americans the clinton administration , for those reasons and a less savory desire to deny bob dole a campaign issue , has informed mr boutrosghali it will not support his candidacy for a second term since the selection of a secretary general requires the agreement of the five permanent members of the security council china , france , britain , russia and the united states mr boutrosghali has little hope of keeping his post unless the administration changes its view he deserves a graceful exit , and gratitude for the good things he has done more than most previous secretaries general , mr boutrosghali has spoken for the weakest and poorest un members , prodded consciences and promoted global conferences on women s rights and the environment he worked hard to carry out the often illdefined mandates of the security council , and made the un a helpful partner in the american intervention in haiti some of the failures on his watch were more the result of poorly designed missions than ineffective leadership by the secretary general mr boutrosghali , an experienced egyptian diplomat , took office when too much was expected of a postcoldwar un he was unfairly blamed when peacekeeping operations proved too ambitious in somalia and too confused in bosnia nor was his tenure helped by the stubborn refusal of congress to pay the un dues owed by washington , which has contributed to a severe budget crisis at the international organization but mr boutrosghali s performance has been uninspiring in important areas morale within the un has been soured by his secretive management style , a reluctance to delegate authority and by headlines too often provoked by his offthecuff gaffes most significantly , he moved slowly to streamline the un s creaky management and financial practices , underestimating the loss of political support for the un in washington and across the united states some of the opposition to the un and to mr boutrosghali is purely partisan and campaign driven , and it has come with inexcusable personal ridicule of him but there is a more thoughtful opposition grounded in a loss of confidence in the un that is based in part on the organization s bloated bureaucracy and its history of careless and wasteful financial management pressed by washington , mr boutrosghali has adopted a nogrowth budget and other fiscal reforms , but he has shown little of the determination required to carry out a comprehensive reform of the un , and none of the salesmanship needed to overcome american doubts there is an impressive roster of potential successors , including kofi annan of ghana , the chief un peacekeeper , and moeen qureshi of the world bank , who is a former prime minister of pakistan three notable women deserve consideration , though none are avowed candidates sadako ogata of japan , the un s high commissioner for refugees , gro harlem brundtland , norway s prime minister , and president mary robinson of ireland it would be salutary if the security council took time and care in its selection process instead of conducting the kind of unseemly scramble behind closed doors that has been its habit in selecting secretaries general on assuming office five years ago , when he was 69 , mr boutrosghali assured wellwishers he would not seek a second term the clinton administration was prepared to extend his service for one year , which he rejected he ought to honor his assurances and exit with dignity
moscow , july 17 with a zeal that belies his obvious illness , boris n yeltsin has over the past month turned the kremlin into a hive of intrigue and caprice so dense and imponderable , so filled with lieutenants famously at odds with one another , that even one of the world s greatest chess masters cannot seem to draw meaning from it all i play a game where there are rules , said garry kasparov , a world chess champion and reformminded russian politician i see the movement of each piece on the board but this is something entirely different if there are rules to this game , then they are rules made and understood by one man only that seems to be exactly the way mr yeltsin wants it at 65 , newly reelected but enfeebled again by illness , mr yeltsin has started to craft a new government that seems to be built at least in part on the principle that the nation will prosper as long as none of the president s deputies can trust one another in creating a government led by two strikingly different men , the silent , workmanlike prime minister viktor s chernomyrdin and the aggressively outspoken aleksandr i lebed , mr yeltsin has stretched the meaning of creative tension the competition for power , and its ultimate prize , mr yeltsin s job , will be made even more complicated by the addition of anatoly b chubais as the president s chief of staff mr chubais , a liberal who has worked for the prime minister , is far more likely to lend his support to mr chernomyrdin than to the frankly nationalist mr lebed he is also , in the powerful name of mr yeltsin , capable of playing the two main rivals off against each other whenever he feels the urge this is the way the president rules , said gennadi burbulis , mr yeltsin s first deputy prime minister and closest aide in the early years of his presidency it is our history and it is very much yeltsin s style he is creating a dynamically tense complex of power where each person is capable of something important but none has the independence needed to act alone he added you have to keep mr yeltsin s goals in mind here he needs some space and time to maneuver he has not made up his mind about a successor and this bizarre structure will guarantee that he remains the real power everyone else can be cut off with ease mr yeltsin has never been shy about seeking power or using it since time immemorial russia has been used to having one man at the top , he said earlier this year real power vertical power power that is in charge the alternative is to have a country that fights in groups and factions mr yeltsin has managed to retain almost absolute power simply by forging a complicated new set of factions whose leaders , highly dependent on him and suspicious of one another , are destined to spend half their time checking their backs today , for example , mr yeltsin named a controversial general , igor n rodionov , much hated by liberals , as his new defense minister that was a clear triumph for the most talked about new man in the kremlin , mr lebed , who had openly advocated the appointment two days ago , however , mr yeltsin made a different kind of choice he ditched his last hawkish adviser , nikolai yegorov , and replaced him as chief of staff a job whose holder completely controls all access to the president with mr chubais , perhaps russia s best known economic reformer mr chubais helped reelect mr yeltsin and before that ran his privatization program while mr chubais and mr chernomyrdin share a sense of economic direction , they have been at odds mr chernomyrdin , a centrist who is formally in charge of the economy , passed up a chance three years ago to make mr chubais one of his two deputies mr yeltsin then simply created a third such slot for mr chubais when mr lebed was appointed security czar , the outspoken general presented an immediate and powerful threat to the silent , stolid and loyal prime minister so mr chernomyrdin reacted by challenging mr lebed on his newly designated turf last week , when bombs destroyed moscow trolleys two days in a row , mr chernomyrdin announced publicly that he , not mr lebed , would take personal control of the investigation mr chernomyrdin made his announcement only hours after mr yeltsin had signed a decree granting mr lebed wide and uncontested powers to fight crime and corruption in the capital we got the point of it , said a senior aide to mr lebed , who declined to be quoted by name we are not stupid but you know , if he is going to spend all year trying to do lebed s job , then mr chubais will be able to spend all year controlling the economy this is what passes in russia for a system of checks and balances mr lebed now controls the country s powerful security forces mr chernomyrdin is the bureaucrat who has managed to get russia through its daily crisis for years and mr chubais will bring a more westernoriented economic savvy and highly regarded organizational skills it works , said vyacheslav nikonov , who helped run mr yeltsin s campaign and now runs a research institute , called the policy institute , here just because these people are in competition does not mean they are enemies you may think this system is strange but we are moving toward democracy each of the men has a glaring weakness mr lebed is popular with voters , but he has no knowledge of the bureaucracy he has already shown in little more than a month that he is unused to the pressures of public life he has made politically damaging statements about the war in chechnya \( contradicted the next day by mr chernomyrdin \) jews in russia \( for which he apologized \) , and many other topics mr chubais is immensely intelligent , highly popular in the west and recognized even by his enemies for his organizational skills but he is detested by millions of russians for the pain suffered in the new economic order he could probably not be a cabinet minister because to the communistled parliament , which must approve such appointments , mr chubais is the symbol of all that went wrong with the yeltsin reforms that leaves mr chernomyrdin an able , solid leader , mr chernomyrdin serves at the pleasure of the president , and mr yeltsin sheds leading advisers with crushing regularity early this year he dispatched mr chubais and other liberals and surrounded himself with hawks by last week the hawks were gone and the reformers had returned to power all depends on the whim of the president churchill once said that stalin s russia was a giant struggle under the carpet , said masha lipman , deputy editor of the country s leading news magazine , itogi you knew something was going on here and every once in a while you would see a corpse or a limb sticking out but you never knew why obviously these times are different , she said but this is still not a country where you have any idea why decisions are made the power is in the kremlin , not on the streets mr yeltsin s illness adds complications to these eternal struggles if he were to die or be incapacitated , mr chernomyrdin would take over pending elections within three months there is no way to know who would win those elections when power is legitimate there is always a way to transfer it without bloodshed , said sergei ivanov , a research associate in byzantine history at the institute of slavic studies here when the succession is not as clear there is danger right now people feel comfortable who supported yeltsin but it is easy to see ways where trouble would be next boris yeltsin seems to know that the wise czar always plays the game of intrigue but it is not easy being at the top in russia never has been easy photos chart close up intrigue in the kremlin president boris n yeltsin has created a triangle of power aleksandr i lebed , anatoly b chubais and viktor s chernomyrdin destined to suspoect one another , scherme against one another and keep one another from amassing too much power 1 aleksandr i lebed president boris n yeltsin s national security adviser in charge of president s personal security staff in charge of the military in charge of the federal security service , the successor agency to the kgb in charge of the struggle against corruption in government , and against crime 2 anatoly b chubais head of the presidential administration will control whom yeltsin sees and why will decide what memos the president reads and what he does not see says he will keep away from the economy , but temptation to get involved will be great for a man who once headed the government s privatization efforts , now given extraordinary access \? 3 viktor s chernomyrdin prime minister runs the government in charge of everything from forming a cabinet to dishing out prime government office space often taken for granted because he is quiet and deliberate , but he rarely loses big fights as former head of gazprom , the nation s gas quasimonopoly , has often been seen as a symbol of the government corruption lebed is now charged with wiping out
seattle , june 12 it is different now while dining in chicago , people often walk by his table and say , thank you for putting this team together jerry krause peers into their eyes for traces of facetiousness and , realizing the contrary , politely answers , you 're welcome asked whether he would finally give his general manager some credit for this season , michael jordan said with a conniving grin on monday as much as it pains me to say it , yes , i have to give jerry his due he s taken a lot of chances that a lot of other people would n't have sadly , i must give him his due despite the fact that the seattle supersonics stayed alive by beating the bulls , 10786 , in game 4 of the nba finals tonight , the oneliners poking fun at chicago s portly general manager continued to fade fast they do n't exist not about his waistline , his wardrobe or his horrible spring allergies that often cause an annoying cough and send him scurrying for nasal spray where once nothing about his personal appearance or health was sacred , it is now time to kiss and make up ok , all right , jerry finally deserves credit , scottie pippen said as much as it hurts , i'm giving it to him why do n't i give him more \? because it 'll make his head grow krause will tell you he is the only general manager to ever build a championship team around a shooting guard , conveniently mentioning that oscar robertson never won before lew alcindor came to milwaukee he will expound on how he traded up in the draft to get pippen , how he never gave up on bringing toni kukoc to america and how nobody in the league wanted some of the guys on his bench i got an ego like anybody else s , he said i 've been in this business 30 years now people forget that in that time , krause , 57 , has infuriated agents , some of whose clients he thinks are overrated alienated people in the news media by fibbing or telling them nothing , and had jordan himself calling for his head i was told not to hire him by someone pretty high up in the league after i did , recalled jerry reinsdorf , the bulls' owner and krause s longtime friend the thinking was you had to be goodlooking , speak well , socialize with other people in the league and be a former player to be a successful gm in this league well , guess what \? you do n't have to be jerry west to put a great team together if anything , krause is the antiwest , waddling around like a ragamuffin , a guy with a tip sheet in his hand at the track , sure that you could never know as much as he does about some 6foot6inch pure shooter now playing in venezuela for air fare and a hotel room this , of course , is the same man who has turned a team that won three straight titles upside down since 1993 only jordan and pippen remain from those bulls everyone else krause went out and got , with help from reinsdorf jud buechler , steve kerr , bill wennington , nobody wanted them , reinsdorf said jerry saw something there , pieces that would fit seventytwo regularseason victories a 141 postseason and no one requesting more shots or a trade the pieces fit , even the edgy fellow with the fuchsia hair and inkblot torso dennis rodman was not the type of player krause would ever pursue , but the bulls scout jimmy stack would not let him give up on the league s rebounding and alternativeculture king krause , an old baseball scout who once worked for bill veeck and had acquired a knack for hunches , finally took the idea of acquiring rodman seriously krause went to his file cabinet and pulled out the same kind of 8 1 2by11inch pad he has used to compile notes on every prospect he has ever scouted from tony kubek to toni kukoc we decided that dennis was n't the person we thought he was , and there was enough evidence there to support that , krause said rodman came over to krause s house during the recruiting visit and then spent time with bulls coach phil jackson we called michael and scottie and said we want to talk to you guys before we made the decision they ok 'd it it was a huge gamble , but we needed to take it in another detour from team policy recently , krause and reinsdorf allowed the assistant coach jim cleamons to speak with dallas about their head job during the playoffs we did n't want to hurt jimmie , and it was n't going to hurt us , krause said am i mellowing \? you have to do what s right for your people i do n't think i 've ever been that tough some people see me in a different vein than i am they 'll say , 'he s ruthless and he s this and he s that' i'm not ruthless what i am is a person who believes in privacy i was raised , literally , by the old baseball scouts when i was a puppy growing up , i sat at their feet the sad thing is , most of my close friends are now dead i hung around with people much older than me the disdain many in chicago have felt for krause over time was fostered by early incidents involving disagreements with jordan about whom the team should acquire in the 1980 s and there were the several tales of krause s heartless behavior that have been dramatized for all the barbs he exchanges with players and colleagues what did casey stengel say \? 'my job as manager of the yankees is to keep the five guys who i know hate me away from the five guys that ai n't sure' i firmly believe in that krause has been steadfastly loyal he quit the hall of fame voting committee because the longtime bulls assistant tex winter was n't on the ballot when the former bull charles oakley was traded to the knicks , he cried i love oak , he said in fact , i can mimic him he begins doing oakley , continuing on for maybe 30 seconds until it gets unbearable , this little squealy voice making his jowls move to and fro a former newspaper copy boy , he has longtime friends in the news media none of them , however , lives in chicago one of the reasons i have been successful is because i'm not in any clique in this league , he said i can deal with anybody in this league because any general manager in this league can call me and it will never get in the media people still rip me , that wo n't stop but it s not about my belly or my clothes so much anymore i think one of the worst times was michael s retirement i got up on the platform and got booed my wife started crying that bothered me it made me real angry it s been a long time since that happened they are thanking him now , for randy brown and ron harper and all the other pieces go ahead , jordan said , give him his due he took the chances and they all paid off
for five years , liberty cable and time warner inc have waged a davidandgoliath battle for cabletelevision customers in manhattan now , david is taking on an even greater goliath the new owner of liberty cable , the rcn corporation , plans to announce today that it will offer residential telephone service in new york city challenging the nynex corporation under the rcn brand name , the company also plans to offer expanded cable service and access to the internet when rcn opens its sales office in midtown manhattan today , it will mark the first time that any company has offered new yorkers television , telephone and data services in a single package nynex and time warner have each announced plans to offer such onestop shopping , but neither has done so yet we 're going into the markets with the largest revenues in the country but the poorest service , said david c mccourt , the chief executive of rcn , which stands for residential communication networks our strategy is to be a bit cheaper , but a lot better mr mccourt said rcn would offer cable and telephone service in boston later this summer and in several other northeastern cities in early 1997 the company acquired 80 percent of liberty cable in april as a vehicle for its drive into the new york market and it plans to spend 200 million over the next 18 months to build a fiber optic network capable of carrying television and telephone traffic in new york , mr mccourt asserted , rcn s monthly rates for basic cable and phone service would be 15 percent cheaper than those of time warner and nynex in addition , rcn plans to offer services like call waiting and call forwarding at no extra charge to customers who sign up early for all that , rcn will still face an uphill struggle against nynex the regional bell operating company has three million residential customers in new york city and its copper wires snake into nearly every apartment building in the city nor has liberty cable made much of a dent in time warner s huge cable franchise despite its scrappy marketing and a shrewd strategy of focusing on large , affluent apartment buildings , liberty has signed up just 34 , 000 customers time warner , by contrast , has 12 million subscribers throughout the five boroughs still , rcn could be a far more serious threat than liberty cable the company is backed by peter kiewit sons inc , a privately held industrial conglomerate based in omaha , that has estimated revenues of 3 billion and unlike liberty cable , which continues to use cumbersome microwave technology to beam its programming to satellite receivers on the roofs of apartment buildings , rcn plans to transmit its video and telephone service over fiber optic strands that run into the basements of the buildings to do that , mr mccourt said rcn would lease excess capacity on a fiber optic network built and owned by the mfs communications company , a telephone company that offers service to business customers in new york and 41 other american cities mfs , like rcn , is backed by kiewit through mfs , rcn has already obtained regulatory approval to construct its network and deliver video programming over it executives at nynex and time warner , who have tended to dismiss liberty cable as a mite rather than a menace , said rcn s strategy and financial muscle could make it a more robust competitor on the richter scale , it s not a 10 , said brian lane , the group vice president of marketing at nynex but it s a 3 or a 4 richard c aurelio , the president of time warner cable s new york city franchise , said that 200 million is a significant amount of money to spend if you 're concentrating on new york mr aurelio noted that time warner planned to spend 500 million over the next four years to upgrade its coaxial cable network to carry telephone and video services but the company has not set a date for entering the local telephone market in new york city announcing new services is fine , he added , but first , you 've got to build the network to carry them mr mccourt said rcn would be in a position almost immediately to string fiber optic cable to the 200 apartment buildings that currently receive cable service from liberty he said rcn had won approval from landlords to wire buildings with 35 , 000 more potential customers other buildings , however , face a longer wait because rcn would have to obtain approval for wiring and then do the actual construction indeed , at the moment , rcn is offering phone service in just four buildings , one of which happens to be mr mccourt s rcn s plan is to appeal first to customers who already receive liberty cable to promote the service , mr mccourt has retained peter o price , the former publisher of the new york post , who ran liberty cable for the milstein family , which still owns a 20 percent stake \( mr price and the milsteins are suing time warner , accusing the company of anticompetitive business practices but mr mccourt said that rcn was not a party to that lawsuit \) yesterday , mr price said he would use much the same guerrilla marketing approach to sell rcn s services that he used to promote liberty that includes tiny advertisements that have run almost daily at the bottom of the front page of the new york times in the ads , liberty cable gives the address of a building that signed up for its service and then proclaims that the building has been liberated from the cable monopoly mr price said that rcn s fiber optic transmission would be easier to sell than liberty cable s microwave method , which required apartment buildings to install satellite receivers on their roofs in both cases , the individual apartments receive the service via coaxial cable to offer phone service , rcn plans to string copper wire to individual apartments or lease capacity on the existing copper network owned by nynex i used to walk on rooftops , mr price said in a telephone interview yesterday from aboard a chartered yacht in the greek islands , where he was on vacation , now , i 'll be walking through basements mr price will be able to offer customers some attractive rates in the early going rcn said its average monthly rate for standard cable service would be 2495 , compared with 3018 for time warner the company will offer touchtone phone service for 858 , versus 1010 for nynex but nynex and time warner seem likely to fight back mr lane of nynex said the company was negotiating a partnership with an undisclosed company that would soon enable it to offer a basket of telephone and television services time warner also intends to offer telephone service and package rates none of that seems to faze mr mccourt two days before he was scheduled to introduce his service , he proudly offered a tour of rcn s glittering showroom , which covers 10 , 000 square feet in an office tower at 1133 avenue of the americas the centerpiece of the room is rcn s network operations center , which is housed behind glass at the street level there , at a control panel that looks like the bridge of a spacecraft , the company s engineers monitor rcn s network and can locate any glitches in service mr mccourt likened the open design to that of a fastfood restaurant with no wall separating the front counter from the kitchen we want people to see exactly what they 're buying , he said that way , they 'll know we 're giving them hamburgers and not horse meat

said representative patricia schroeder , a democrat whose district includes most of denver county we hope , none jannie coverdale , who lost two grandsons in the bombing , agreed , saying in a telephone interview from oklahoma city we do n't feel very safe just listening to some of those militia groups on tv saying they are going to attend i know there are some other people involved i do n't believe that those two people did it all by themselves with that concern widespread , militarystyle security accompanied all aspects of the trial s transfer from oklahoma to denver for instance , on april 2 , fbi agents and united states marshals escorted a secret road convoy of three mayflower moving vans from oklahoma city to denver the vans carried trial exhibits , including building debris , photographs and parts of automobiles the tightest security surrounded the transfer of the two defendants from their cells in the el reno federal correctional institution , about 20 miles west of oklahoma city awakened on the night of march 29 , the two men were handcuffed and laid face down on the floor of a van , then taken over back roads to oklahoma city s will rogers airport there , they were put aboard a defense department jet and flown to jefferson county airport , 15 miles northwest of denver hours earlier , the airport had been placed under federal control from the airport , the defendants were flown 20 minutes by helicopter to the jail , also in jefferson county for their court appearance , the two defendants were driven into the city just before dawn in a fivecar convoy , with 15 police motorcyclists providing an escort at the jail , the defendants follow the strict regimen prescribed for all inmates awaiting trial segregated from contact from each other , and from other prisoners , mr mcveigh and mr nichols live in cells 10 feet by 6 feet mr mcveigh s lawyers had requested that a videocassette recorder and personal computer be placed in his cell this , they argued , would save taxpayers money by allowing him to review , without the presence of a lawyer , 400 hours of witness videotapes and 21 , 069 witness statements recorded on cdrom the request was denied by mr perrill , the warden we are trying to treat mcveigh and nichols the same as other inmates of the same status , he said today other inmates do not have computers or vcr s and we are not going to allow that for mcveigh or nichols despite the stark regimen , mr mcveigh is happier here than in oklahoma , his lawyers say he is doing better at englewood , said rob nigh , one lawyer who recently visited mr mcveigh the commissary list is longer he can now get dental floss , snacks , juices , cheese and crackers photo with the anniversary of the oklahoma city bombing tomorrow , security is tight in denver , where the two bombing defendants will be tried officer terry crawford patrolled yesterday near the federal courthouse \( ellen jaskol for the new york times \)
washington , may 24 while foreignpolicy makers have trouble even defining the postcoldwar era , washington deal makers have already figured out how to make millions in it a cottage industry of consultants , business executives and lobbyists are tapping into one of washington s leastknown pools of money international development banks foreign aid budgets are shrinking , but these banks are growing each year they generate some 30 billion in contracts and in the washington tradition of revolving doors , former officials of these banks are taking advantage of the new business opportunities the institutions , which are financed in part by american taxpayers , have much less restrictive rules on what former officials can do and how much they must disclose about their activities those deals often benefit from another new trend of the postcoldwar era the worldwide emphasis on privatization big public works projects that were once undertaken by governments from airports to water treatment plants now are often being done by private entrepreneurs the cold war s demise removes the philosophical underpinnings for the earlier support of government intervention , said moeen qureshi , a former top official of the world bank , who sees development banks acting now as catalysts for business executives like himself consider the interamerican development bank , which is owned by 46 nations and helps latin american countries reduce their chronic poverty it recently made available some of its billions of dollars in annual loans to private businesses , following the trend at other international lending organizations last fall the bank entered into a firstofitskind alliance with a private group of investors whose advisers include several prominent former development officials , from mr qureshi to lloyd m bentsen , who served as secretary of the treasury in 1993 and 1994 and was a governor of the interamerican bank now a businessman , mr bentsen is helping organize a billiondollar investment fund backed by giant corporations and pension funds they hope to realize profits of as much as 25 percent a year by investing in latin american power projects , telecommunications systems and toll roads , according to mr bentsen in a turnaround , mr bentsen went to buenos aires last march to attend the interamerican bank s annual meeting even though he was too busy to attend those sessions when he was treasury secretary this year he went to entertain executives of the bank and potential investors who were attending the bank s annual meeting however , mr bentsen said , he has not been involved in actual negotiations with the bank when raising money for its fund , mr bentsen s group makes note of its unique agreement with the interamerican development bank , which offers information sharing and possible cofinancing , and the previous ties of the group s mangers to various development banks , according to mr bentsen and other fund officials if the bank can provide comfort to investors in the project fantastic , said enrique v iglesias , the interamerican bank s president he hopes the agreement with mr bentsen s fund will be the first of many such alliances but some bank officials and outside experts question whether a public bank set up to finance projects in developing countries that the private sector considers too risky should be helping wealthy private investors the idb should n't be in the business of making life easier for the capital markets , said jerome booth , a former official of the interamerican bank who is now head of emerging markets research for the australian new zealand bank , a private bank it s in the business of helping development of countries , typically things like water , sanitation , health and education , not toll roads , telecommunications or power stations moreover , the world of development banks is one of washington s least regulated most lobbyists before congress or the executive branch of government must register and disclose their clients in addition , federal law limits or prohibits former officials from having substantive dealings with the government agency that had employed them none of these rules apply to the development banks and though the banks are financed by governments , their loans face far less scrutiny from the public these institutions are pretty opaque , pretty much beyond scrutiny , said doug bandow , a senior fellow at the cato institute the principal international financial organizations in washington are the international monetary fund , the world bank and its affiliate , the international finance corporation and the interamerican development bank mr iglesias said in the interview that the interamerican bank would prod mr bentsen s fund to follow its lead and invest in the region s neediest countries but he acknowledged that he fears money will only flow to the best projects since mr bentsen s fund s stated intention is to make 80 percent of its investments in the region s six richest countries mr qureshi has told investors the fund hopes to generate returns of 20 to 25 percent
last month , at a conference in buffalo called science in the age of \( mis \) information , scores of scientists railed against anti science , including the vile trend known as postmodernism hearing the denunciations at this meeting , one might guess that distinguishing truth lovers from truth defiers is child s play the forces of rationality sport shiny white jump suits , like the hero of toy story , while the epistemological subversives skulk about in black tshirts and berets if only things were that simple like a mutant virus , postmodernism has infected not only philosophy and the social sciences but even such alleged bastions of truth and objectivity as physics and chemistry some of the most prominent scientists in the world traffic in hypotheses that are remarkably postmodern in character i like to call this type of theorizing ironic science the concept of irony is central to that wellspring of postmodernism , literary criticism according to such eminent critics as northrop frye , no text should be viewed as literally true the bible , finnegans wake , even mr frye s own essays are all ironic in the sense that they have multiple meanings , none of which are definitive the job of the literary critic is thus not to pin down the true meaning of a text an impossible task but to invent new meanings , ones that challenge received wisdom and provoke further dialogue similarly , ironic science advances hypotheses that , while often profound and provocative , should not be considered literally true my favorite example of ironic science is superstring theory , which for the last 15 years has represented the cutting edge of physics sometimes called a theory of everything , it posits that all the matter and energy in the universe , and even space and time , stem from infinitesimal loops of urstuff writhing in a hyperspace of 10 \( or more \) dimensions the leading practitioner of superstring theory is edward witten of the institute for advanced study in princeton , nj time magazine recently named dr witten one of the 25 most influential americans , and with good reason dr witten s papers on superstrings have made him far and away the most cited physicist in the world in a now famous paper published last may in social text , a quarterly devoted to cultural studies , alan sokal , a physicist at new york university , proposed that superstring theory might help liberate science from dependence on the concept of objective truth professor sokal later announced that the article had been a hoax intended to expose the hollowness of postmodernism in fact , however , superstring theory is exactly the kind of science that subverts conventional notions of truth the tiny domain that superstrings supposedly inhabit is even less accessible than the quasars haunting the edge of the visible universe for instance , a superstring is to a proton in size as a proton is to the solar system to probe this realm directly would require a particle accelerator 1 , 000 lightyears around \( the entire solar system is only one lightday around \) in other words , it is highly unlikely that we will ever know whether superstring theory is true that s what makes it ironic ironic science has flourished on the macro end of physics as well physicists like sidney coleman of harvard and andrei linde of stanford have speculated that our galaxyemblazoned cosmos is merely one of an infinite number of universes , some perhaps with similar laws of physics and even similar inhabitants a fascinating possibility and one that will probably never be verified the phenomenon of human consciousness is a seed from which myriad ironic blooms have sprung every year more books and conferences are devoted to the question of how mere matter can possibly give rise to subjective thought is a bat capable of thought or an amoeba \? what about a computer \? of course ! thunders marvin minsky , the artificialintelligence maven of mit no way ! retorts roger penrose , the british physicist and bestselling author the real answer is , who knows \? science cannot gain access to the subjective realm no human can be absolutely sure that any other human has an inner life we all make this assumption because it is the reasonable thing to do but reasonable people always can and will disagree on whether a machine or an amoeba thinks , because there is no way to settle the dispute empirically most scientists vehemently reject the notion that they are engaged in anything smacking of postmodernism but a few brave souls have made such an admission , albeit obliquely one is the belgian chemist ilya prigogine , who won a nobel prize in 1977 for showing how certain chemical reactions selforganize into striking patterns professor prigogine s work is the inspiration for the trendy field of chaos , which addresses phenomena so messy and complicated that they resist conventional scientific analysis pointing out that chaotic phenomena are by definition unpredictable , professor prigogine has declared that we have reached the end of certitude science in the future will be increasingly probabilistic and speculative in other words , ironic an even more radical view has been set forth by john wheeler of princeton , who coined the term black hole and is one of this century s most respected physicists professor wheeler spent years pondering quantum mechanics , which portrays electrons as either waves or particles , depending on how the experiment is carried out he concluded that reality is a participatory phenomenon , defined in some sense by the questions we put to it i do take 100 percent seriously the idea that the world is a figment of the imagination , professor wheeler once said professor wheeler s view evokes that of the late thomas kuhn , the philosopher whose 1962 book , the structure of scientific revolutions , remains a seminal text of postmodernism professor kuhn contended that science reflects not the truth about nature but merely scientists' prevailing mindset , which is always subject to change this claim simply does not withstand scrutiny science has established beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of atoms and elements , dna and bacteria , stars and galaxies , gravity and electromagnetism , natural selection and the expansion of the universe these are all facts they will be true a century or even a millennium from now why , if scientists can achieve real truth , do they indulge in ironic science \? because conventional science , as far as it has come , has left many mysteries unresolved are quarks and electrons made of smaller particles , which are in turn made of still smaller particles , ad infinitum \? is our universe just one of many universes \? was the evolution of conscious , intelligent beings inevitable or a fluke of nature \? lurking behind all these questions is the biggest question of all why is there something rather than nothing \? unfortunately , scientists have even less hope of solving this riddle than literary critics have of deciding , once and for all , what keats s ode to a nightingale really means i do not mean to imply that ironic science has no value far from it at its best , ironic science , like great literature or philosophy or , yes , literary criticism , induces wonder by addressing unanswerable questions and imagining realms beyond the reach of true science , ironic science helps insure that we remain forever awestruck before the mystery of the universe but ironic science cannot give us the truth

nairobi , feb 19 a united nations tribunal today indicted two rwandans in jail in zambia on charges of genocide , setting the stage for the first trial to stem from the 1994 massacres in rwanda in which an estimated half million people died the indictments were the first to be handed down against people who , because they have already been arrested , seem most likely to be extradited to stand trial before the sixjudge tribunal , in arusha , tanzania in december the tribunal indicted eight former rwandan officials in connection with mass killings in kibuye , on the western edge of rwanda , but none have been taken into custody while zambia , belgium and switzerland have detained a dozen people suspected of leading the genocide , tribunal investigators have received little help from governments in neighboring states like kenya and zaire , where many of the leaders of the former hutu government in rwanda are living in exile the attackers were hutu most victims were tutsi the mass killings ended when tutsi forces drove out the hutu and established a new government what the zambians did could easily have been done by others , said a spokesman for the tribunal , alan sigg he said indictments were expected in a few days against three men arrested in belgium , elie ndayambaje , joseph kanyabashi and alphonse higaniro the tribunal is waiting for the belgian legislature to pass a law making it possible to extradite the men one man indicted today is georges rutaganda , a former vice president of the interahamwe , the hutu militia that witnesses say carried out the bloodiest massacres the second suspect was identified as jean paul akayesu , a former mayor of tapa , in gitarama prefecture mr rutaganda is accused of taking part in massacres in kigali and nyanza , the tribunal registrar , andronico adede , said in a statement because of his position in the interahamwe , investigators said , mr rutaganda is thought to have played a significant role in the planning of the 100 days of genocide he was also a highranking official in the former ruling party , the national revolutionary movement for democracy and development , and a major investor in rtlm radio , which broadcast hate propaganda against the tutsi he is a large figure in the interahamwe , mr sigg said obviously , being in his position , he had a certain role the indictment charges mr akayesu with encouraging the murder of a tutsi teacher on april 19 , 1994 , in tapa , where he was mayor the killing set off widespread killings of tutsi he is also thought to have ordered the killings of several people near his office and to have supervised the torture and beatings of tutsi residents the two men were among 16 rwandan exiles arrested by zambian authorities last october at the urging of judge richard goldstone , the south african jurist who is the tribunal s chief prosecutor tribunal investigators in kigali say at least two other rwandans in zambian jails are likely to be charged , though they would not identify them among those being held are jean de dieu habineza , a former minister in the government , and como bizimungu , a former mayor of kigali , the capital a year ago the united nations security council passed a resolution requesting all members to detain people suspected of genocide and to hold them until investigations are complete so far , very few african states have complied zambia stands in contrast to kenya and zaire , which have been reluctant to detain rwandan exiles in kenya , where many of the former rwandan elite are living in style , president daniel arap moi has refused to hand over rwandans charged in the mass killings and has threatened to arrest anyone who comes to kenya to pursue defendants zaire has arrested 13 hutu leaders in refugee camps on its soil not for their reported roles in the genocide but for intimidating thousands of refugees from returning to rwanda but zaire has done nothing to detain dozens of other former ministers , journalists , civil servants and military leaders sought by the tribunal most are living in goma and bukavu , often in luxurious houses mr sigg said the two men indicted today would be extradited to tanzania in midmarch when the first jail cells are built the tribunal hopes to start trials this spring , but the courtroom is still under construction

pete sampras could not have chosen a worse afternoon to take up sleepwalking there was the defending champion of the united states open , stumbling around the stadium court like a bear who had been aroused from hibernation against his consent he was too tired to get to the net he was even too tired to turn on the heat and throw some aces at the agile opportunist across the court he was too sick to his stomach to care that his was not a textbook performance and until he woke up with a jolt in the fourth set and made the unnerving discovery that 31stranked alex corretja alex corretja ! was not just wide awake but paying the utmost attention to a twosetstoone lead in their quarterfinal , sampras seemed to have sentenced himself to a long night of nightmares about the big one that got away it took him a full five sets , and then a tie breaker , to reel it back in , but sampras , a threetime open champion who needs to defend his title here to salvage an otherwise grand slam titleless year , finally forced corretja to surrender , 76 \( 75 \) , 57 , 57 , 64 , 76 \( 97 \) each player produced 25 aces , one more coincidence in a match that was , for both , an experience that exceeded all of their expectations and their fears for sampras , it was yet another emotional struggle to come through in the crunch and pay further grand slam tribute to tim gullikson , the longtime coach he lost to brain cancer in may for corretja , it was a test and proving ground it was probably the best match of my career , the best match and the worst one , said the loser , who was heartsick that it was his doublefault , a rare mistake at the worst possible moment , that ended things the match made sampras sick literally and after losing the second point of the final tie breaker , he received a warning for a time violation as he vomited at the back of the court when the players switched sides with the breaker knotted at 33 , they received a standing ovation after sampras went up by 54 with a forehand winner , corretja fell down trying to chase it , then bounced back and won the next point with a volley still reeling with nausea , sampras got to match point with an overhead that drew a missed pass from corretja , but he lost it by dumping a forehand in the net for a 66 deadlock sampras then saved a match point with a volley and , barely able to stand up , he managed to eke out a secondserve ace to give himself a second match point at 87 with sampras looking too shellshocked to hit even one more ball , corretja removed the burden with the double fault that gave the defending champion the victory he s physically and mentally exhausted it s been a rough 18 months , said paul annacone , sampras s coach , referring to the daunting span of time that began at the 1995 australian open , where gullikson collapsed and was later diagnosed with cancer sampras soldiered on and played his way to the final of that grand slam , where his tearful recovery from a twosetstonone deficit to jim courier in the quarterfinals was the most traumatic match of his career it was , at least , until last night annacone termed the performances by both players mindboggling and cited sampras s ability to survive it as further testimony of his greatness with his stoic personality , you would n't think he 'd have such a flair for the dramatic , said annacone , who expected sampras to be fully recovered in time for tomorrow s semifinals annacone also gave special credit to the loser for playing pretty close to a perfect tennis match ultimately it was the spaniard who collapsed to the court in despair after his matchending double fault corretja had made only 30 unforced errors , 38 fewer than sampras he then headed toward the net , moving like sampras at a snail s pace , and shared an embrace with the weary winner the 4hour9minute marathon was the longest match of this tournament certainly each moment of the final tie breaker was the most electric moment of this tournament begun in the full glare of the afternoon sunshine , this odd couple the seventime grand slam winner , sampras , against the firsttime grand slam quarterfinalist , corretja could not reach a resolution until the sun had disappeared then spotlights had to be trained on the unexpected spectacle of sampras , 384 on hardcourts this year before last night , scrambling to catch a break from an unheralded but unrelenting spaniard when corretja , asked before the match if he thought he stood a chance , said he planned to treat sampras like a nobody , he was not kidding i think i have to feel happy because i almost knocked out the no 1 in the world , corretja said after losing , but it s disappointing because you feel like you got it and suddenly it escapes after making another one of his notorious slow starts , sampras only barely escaped from the first set with its tie breaker in his pocket with corretja serving for the set at 54 , sampras stirred himself to save a set point with a lunging , twisting backhand volley , his major effort of the match at that juncture but corretja , who evidently forgot to tell sampras just how much he prefers hard courts to clay despite his spanish pedigree , promptly served an ace to earn another set point
washington , june 8 with varying degrees of skepticism , trepidation and excitement , print journalists and paperless cyberscribes have been awaiting the ballyhooed debut this summer of slate , the microsoftbacked online magazine to be edited by michael kinsley , formerly of the new republic and crossfire meanwhile , in relative obscurity , pete du pont , former governor of delaware and erstwhile republican presidential candidate , has been laboring here to start another publicpolicy journal in a raw medium where , he noted , people are n't always polite yet another politician leaping into the rapidly diversifying news media , mr du pont , who will edit the journal , is clearly enjoying himself are n't these amazing machines ! he said this week , watching a mock version of the magazine scroll across a computer screen in its publisher s offices here the first issue of the weekly whose name is intellectualcapitalcom is scheduled to appear on june 20 slipping into online patois , mr du pont describes the journal as a publicpolicy ezine of opinion he said it would stick out among the proliferating electronic publications a babel of biting commentary , researched articles and sophomoric maundering by offering meatier fare to appeal to viewers of the news hour with jim lehrer , readers of the new republic and the national review and students of government everywhere mr du pont said that , in addition to his own conservative editorial , he would feature several columns from a stable of 26 regular contributors he said their views would range from liberal to conservative it s a much more intellectually aggressive atmosphere , mr du pont , already a syndicated columnist in the newsprint world , said of life on the world wide web and i think more fun it may not all be fun skeptics said that a magazine whose logo displays rodin s thinker superimposed on a cdrom disk may be illsuited to the anarchy of the web it s not a topdown medium where gasbags dispense wisdom , said jon katz , a contributing editor to wired magazine , who writes the media rant column for the netizen , the politics and media web site of the online publication hotwired it s much more individualistic it s much more open but it is by drawing a highbrow crowd that the journal s publishers , a2s2 digital projects , hope to solve the critical problem for electronic journals by actually making money rather than charge for subscriptions , they want to draw large advertisers so far , none have signed on but we 're talking to several , said sam sneed , managing director of a2s2 and what the magazine calls its executive producer of interactive applications by contract , mr kinsley has said he intends to charge readers of slate a fee , as yet undisclosed , if they are not members of the microsoft network he has also said he would sell advertising for his more ambitious magazine of opinion , politics and the arts , which is to go on line soon mr du pont , in deference to the difficulty some people find reading on line , said his columns would be short , about 500 words , and rendered in large type he plans to devote articles to a hot issue and to interesting ideas from think tanks , and to include a grab bag called quips , quotes , and quibbles the journal will hold an online forum once a week and solicit reader contributions mr du pont said he had commitments from 20 of the 26 writers he declined to name any but james k glassman , a television host and columnist with the washington post mr glassman , who plans to write on politics and economics , said he was anxious to reach the online population i'm not really sure who s out there , he said we 're obviously in a pioneering stage , and i 'd like to be one of the pioneers while he acknowledged a lingering preference for newsprint , mr du pont , who is 61 , said that his children read their news on line he expressed confidence that such computer devotees would sort through the online clutter of news and opinion to find a publication offering respected names engaged in informed debate in the long run , mr du pont said , quality is what counts
washington , june 17 the defense department insisted today that it had no conclusive proof that americans are being held against their will in north korea , even though an internal pentagon report has suggested that as many as 10 to 15 american prisoners of war are still alive there the internal report , which was made public last week by a member of congress , has set off a firestorm among the families of soldiers missing in action from the korean war and the vietnam war the families argue that the march 26 report is proof that the pentagon has ignored evidence that americans are being held against their will in korea and other former war zones but at a news conference , a defense department official involved in the issue played down the conclusions of that report , suggesting that it reflected the views of a single pentagon analyst and that its findings were based on primarily on hearsay reporting from north korean defectors the official , alan liotta , deputy director of the pentagon s office on prisoners of war and troops missing in action , said that while the defectors had provided valuable information suggesting that american prisoners might still be alive in north korea , none of the information that they provided to us was information that you could characterize as a smoking gun we have no conclusive proof that americans are being held against their will in north korea , he said mr liotta s remarks were met with skepticism from the families of soldiers missing in the korean war , who have described the release of the internal pentagon report as a landmark in their campaign to prove that americans prisoners are still alive in north korea , more than four decades after the war , which lasted from 1950 to 1953 the national alliance of families , which represents the families of missing troops in korea and vietnam , said in a statement that the failure of the pentagon to act on this information is an american tragedy the clinton administration must act swiftly to bring our loved ones home the report , which was marked for official use only , was prepared by insung lee , a pentagon investigator who studies the fate of the more than 8 , 100 american troops missing from the korean war in the report , mr lee said the pentagon had received a recent flurry of very compelling reports suggesting that americans troops might still be alive in north korea mr lee did not return phone calls today the pentagon had said in recent months that it knew of only two americans living in north korea both of them defectors , not prisoners of war the release of the internal report came at an awkward moment for the defense department , which announced only last week that it had been given permission to search in north korea next month for the remains of missing american troops after visiting north korea just last week , mr liotta said that it was important to proceed with the searches , even if there was information suggesting that americans might still be held against their will there i would argue that when you have a society as closed and as isolated as north korea , you have to seize on any opportunity you can to make inroads into that country , he said the issue of missing americans from the korean war still stirs significant debate among scholars and military analysts clay blair , a military historian , said that it does not seem logical to me that any of the prisoners could possibly be alive , given that the north koreans killed so many of our people before why would they keep these people alive \? he asked for what purpose \? but laurence jolidon , the author of last seen alive , a recent book on american prisoners of war in korea , said it was absolutely possible that north korea might still be holding americans some of them could easily have been kept in north korea , which is perhaps the world s most closed society , he said
washington , oct 1 a federal district judge today rejected ross perot s argument that the presidential debates should be halted unless he was included , ruling that mr perot had neither a legal nor a constitutional right to be part of this year s debates mr perot s senior aides immediately filed an appeal , but they seemed suddenly resigned to the idea that they are not likely to prevail in the courts and will not be included in the debates pat choate , mr perot s vicepresidential running mate , told reporters outside the courthouse that the campaign will now turn to plan b , which he loosely defined as seeking as much exposure as possible on television , including free time offered by talk shows and advertising time bought by the campaign the federal judge , thomas f hogan , issued his ruling from the bench , saying that the courts did not have the authority to determine who should participate in the presidential debates and that mr perot did not have a right under the first amendment to participate the judge s decision came less less than two hours after lawyers for mr perot , along with lawyers for john hagelin of the natural law party , argued that the court should block sunday night s opening debate in hartford between bob dole and president clinton mr perot s lawyer , jamin b raskin , told the court that because of the exclusion of his client , the american people know something is deeply wrong here in delivering his blow to mr perot s hopes for inclusion , judge hogan seemed to agree he said that the commission on presidential debates , which voted last month to exclude mr perot , should perhaps rethink its standards for the next presidential election the 10member bipartisan commission had said that mr perot did not meet its test to be included of having a realistic , rather than theoretical , chance of winning the election mr perot was allowed to participate in the 1992 presidential debates , and then received 19 percent of the vote in the election judge hogan acknowledged today that the procedures and regulations governing who is invited to participate in the presidential debates had led to frustration and perhaps unfairness for those who consider themselves legitimate candidates he said the exclusion of thirdparty candidates meant they were denied valuable exposure on television and today , to meaningfully communicate with voters , candidates must have access to television nonetheless , judge hogan said the nation s courts did not have the power to change the commission s ruling he said it was equally beyond his authority to order the debates commission to use other criteria that could result in the inclusion of either of those candidates mr perot s lawyers had mounted a complex legal attack on two fronts first , they said , federal election commission regulations specify that an organization sponsoring a debate may only accept contributions from corporations if it uses objective criteria to determine who is invited to participate the debates commission , which has accepted corporate contributions , used 11 criteria , some of which are seemingly objective , like whether a candidate is a citizen and is on the ballot in enough states to theoretically win the 270 electoral votes needed to be elected but mr perot objected to other criteria that he characterized as unfairly subjective , like whether a cross section of journalists and political scientists believe that the candidate has a realistic chance of winning members of the debates commission said that of those journalists and political scientists they had canvassed , none thought mr perot had a chance of winning a single state but judge hogan said that under the law establishing the federal election commission , questions like whether the criteria were fair must be decided by the election commission and not the courts he acknowledged that meant that most complaints about election law violations would not be resolved until after the election and that it would then be too late to do much about them but he said he was bound by precedent against courts intervention he noted , for example , that the courts refused to hear a claim brought by president jimmy carter in the midst of the 1980 election that the reagan campaign was violating spending limits lewis k loss , a lawyer for the debates commission , said congress had originally prohibited court intervention , fearing that the courts would otherwise be flooded with lawsuits disrupting the elections the second legal argument raised by mr perot s lawyers was that his exclusion violated his constitutional right of free speech and his right to an equal chance to participate in the political process but such discrimination is unconstitutional only if it is committed by the government the debates commission was explicitly set up to be immune from the charge that it was an arm of the government it accepts no public or party money it is financed by corporations and foundations judge hogan flatly rejected mr perot s assertion that the debates commission was an arm of the government , a ruling that would make it very difficult for his case to succeed on appeal the appeal will be heard on thursday on an expedited basis a threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit will hear arguments from mr perot and mr hagelin russell j verney , the national coordinator of the perot campaign , told reporters , the democratic and republican parties have stolen these debates , but according to judge hogan , they stole it legally in hearing the case today , judge hogan appeared to appreciate the commission s difficulty in having to decide who should be invited to a debate , saying it would be unwieldy to invite all the candidates janet h brown , the executive director of the debates commission , has said that there are more than 130 candidates for president ms brown said the commission would heed judge hogan s suggestion and reevaluate its procedures after the election
shanghai , feb 4 inside a gray sixstory office building , a dozen young men gathered around a conference room table on saturday evening to discuss the internet only one was over 30 , and all looked like computer nerds , the kind of people who prefer to spend a saturday night talking about their favorite software , rather than venturing into one of the lively cafes on the street below yet with the chinese authorities tightening control over information networks , even something as innocuous as an internet club is now suspect so the participants met with an air of secrecy , engaged in a lengthy debate over lukewarm cups of tea on how to avoid government interference , and wondered about the true identity of five latecomers who sat to one side of the room and said little the internet is still very sensitive in china , said a 24yearold computer technician , who like the other participants asked not to be identified we 're not trying to do anything illegal , but if the government finds out about us , we 're finished the internet is just starting to grow in china , and the authorities are trying to keep it firmly within their grasp today , china issued a new set of rules to regulate internet use , the latest in a recent series of moves to assert control over the flow of information here rather than try to choke off internet access , as some of the young men gathered around the table had feared , the regulations instead appear to be steering the flow of electronic information through officially controlled ports so that it can be better monitored the new regulations require that any network offering internet service be subject to close supervision by the ministry of post and telecommunications or one of three other designated government agencies , the new china news agency announced the new regulations are intended to insure healthier development of the exchange of international computer information , the news agency said but the rules were clearly also concerned with information the government deems threatening neither organizations nor individuals are allowed to engage in activities at the expense of state security and secrets , the agency said they are also forbidden to produce , retrieve , duplicate or spread information that may hinder public order the transmission of pornographic or obscene material was also expressly banned the rules come at a time when internet users in china have gained easy access to a wide range of politically sensitive material posted by dissident groups based outside of china reports that were accessible within china via the internet today were offered by human rights in china , a new yorkbased group the center for modern china , run by the dissident writer liu binyan and based in princeton , nj , and china spring , another new yorkbased dissident group china s security apparatus is widely believed to monitor an enormous volume of telephone and fax connections , and it is expected to do the same with internet messages it is an open question whether the authorities will try to block access to information they do not like , and whether they would succeed if they tried access to the internet , however , is still a privilege for relatively few in a country where few homes have a private telephone let alone a computer most who have access to a computer do so through their workplace about 4 , 000 people have registered for internet accounts with the ministry of post and telecommunications in beijing and shanghai since it began offering china s main commercial internet service in mid1995 zhang shiyong , a computer science professor at fudan university in shanghai who directs the university s internet operations and advises shanghai s post and telecommunications on computer networks , estimates that fewer than 30 , 000 internet users in china have an email address , mostly university professors and students , and scientific researchers others familiar with the internet assert that 50 , 000 to 100 , 000 in china may be using it , many of them university students with irregular access because of limited computer time , and others who privately pay a registered user to share an email address a main impediment to internet growth is the high cost while university professors and students get email free , shanghai s post and telecommunications office charges 75 a month for 40 hours of use , a sizable fee in a city where a typical office worker makes 250 a month for all the free speech potential that the internet portends , robin munro , hong kong director of human rights watch asia , said few if any dissidents within china had access to it , because of limited access to computers he suggested that , with official monitoring , the internet would not be an ideal

in the last few years , hundreds of mutual funds have gone to their shareholders with their hats in their hands the funds' investment advisers want a raise and they usually get what they ask for typically , the fund s management and its directors offer a multitude of reasons that paying more money will benefit shareholders , then vote for a new management contract with higher fees then the contract is approved by shareholders while the increases may seem tiny , only a fifth or a tenth of a percentage point , they can represent millions of dollars in added costs for each fund plenty of funds , though , have resisted the temptation to charge investors more for their services some funds have even cut their fees as assets have ballooned fidelity investments , for example , has lowered the management fees on hundreds of its funds the management fees charged by united states stock funds vary , but they are clustered at 070 percent to 075 percent of fund assets despite no drastic changes in this number in recent years , management fees have roughly doubled over the last 50 years , said amy c arnott , editor of morningstar mutual funds , a fund newsletter stein roe special , third avenue value and seligman communications and information are among prominent funds that have moved recently to raise management fees these funds and their directors say the decision was not undertaken lightly there were literally hours and days and many meetings , said brian zino , a managing director for j w seligman company as reasons for the increases , the funds point to sixfigure salaries of portfolio managers and the cost of investment research still , investors would do well to ponder whether they are getting their money s worth it is difficult to justify an increase in fees , said ken gregory , the editor of the noload fund analyst , a newsletter based in san francisco i think it s more a matter of knowing they can get away with it mutual funds levy a tangle of fees , covering everything from payments for regulatory registration to payments for outside directors management fees typically cover the salaries of the portfolio managers and the other funds' analysts , the cost of investment research and various administrative costs associated with running the fund investors curious about their funds' fees may have difficulty comparison shopping stein roe , for example , used to charge one fee for management and administration but now levies two the management fee at third avenue value does not include the cost of its leased office space , which the fund also picks up what is and is n't included should be listed in the fund s prospectus and other documents so how do funds justify pay raises \? we deserve it , is a frequent explanation when a fund delivers outstanding returns year after year , investors have an easier time swallowing a pay increase and funds an easier time asking for one take the seligman communications and information fund , which is seeking shareholder approval next month for a 20 percent increase in its management fee under the direction of paul h wick , the fund has beaten all other technology stock funds over the last five years with a spectacular average annual return of 37 percent , according to morningstar on funds like seligman , i frankly do n't give a damn about higher fees , said robert markman , who manages the markman multifund trust in edina , minn , and owns the fund , except from a moral point of view but seligman would make plenty of money even without the fee increase its top performance has been a magnet for assets , which soared from 404 million at the end of 1994 to 26 billion at the end of last year under its old fee structure , which put the management fee at 075 percent of assets , seligman would have earned more than 3 million on 404 million in assets that fee would have grown to an estimated 19 million as assets multiplied last year by increasing the fee to 09 percent of assets , the fund will reap an additional 4 million at its current size if the fund , which is expected to reopen to new investors next week , grows substantially , the amount would rise that much more the seeds were all planted a year and a half ago , explained mr zino , who said the astronomical growth in the fund s assets occurred well after the discussion over the management fee began even funds without such impressive results raise their management fees , of course the stein roe special fund , managed by e bruce dunn and richard b peterson , is charging shareholders 085 percent of assets for management and administrative services , up from 075 the previous year the 11 billion fund has underperformed other growth stock funds in three of the last five years the sad fact is that investors have no guarantee fees will decline if a fund becomes a dismal performer while directors may ask for higher fees on the basis of strong past performance , only a quarter of all funds tracked by morningstar link management fees directly to performance so that the fees drop when performance suffers
suspects by thomas berger 294 pp new york william morrow company 23 thomas berger is the master of the plausibly insane novel in his bestknown work , little big man , a single character gets to see the battle of the little bighorn from both a white man s and a red man s comic perspective in neighbors , an ordinary suburbanite s life is destroyed in a breathtakingly short time when a couple of crackpots move in next door and in meeting evil , a novel that makes the ideal christmas gift for paranoids , a good samaritan is sucked into a churning whirlpool of car theft , armed robbery and homicide after innocently offering to help a stranger whose car has stalled in his new novel , suspects , mr berger takes a long time to spring the trapdoor for the first few chapters , the book reads like a conventional murder mystery a mother and daughter are found slashed and bludgeoned the man of the house has been having an affair with his boss s wife naturally , he s fingered as the killer but , little by little , mr berger s trademark weirdness sets in the suspect s half brother , a drifter , was fired from his job the morning of the murders , after threatening his boss with a knife he is then apprehended by a security guard in a variety store after stealing a rubber duck the cop who arrives on the scene lets him off with a warning , then is killed in a liquor store holdup the cop s former partner gets a new one , who collars an 11yearold purse snatcher whose cousin happens to be one of the thugs who killed the previous partner the drifter is arrested at his sisterinlaw s funeral while carrying a gun he stole from a female trucker who graciously offers to post his bail and get him a job his new employer discovers that he s suspected of murder but does n't hold it against him because , heck , he himself once had a runin with the law when he was young finally , yet another officer , after learning that his partner has been using his apartment for sexual assignations with his best friend s daughter , decides to take his own life but just as he is about to pull the trigger , he gets a call from the drifter , who has been exonerated and is so impressed by the way the police have handled the case that he wants to become a cop himself all these odd goingson are described in such a matteroffact way that it takes a long time to realize how profoundly odd the whole book is in part , this is because none of the characters seem to think any of this is , in fact , especially odd consider what happens when the failed rubberduck heister phones the suicidebent cop do you think i could join the police force \? if the gun charges are dropped , i do n't have any record , i gather i'm of age and in good health the one thing i'm worried about is whether i'm tall enough in a lot of novels , this scene would be vastly overplayed but here the cop merely takes a swig of beer and says i do n't think they have a height requirement anymore nowadays the department has to take anybody who applies , i think , or they get sued that suspects involves a murder in which the victims' throats are slashed , features a suspect with a very shaky alibi and is merciless in its portrayal of an incompetent police force and an exploitative press cannot be an accident the plot has o j simpson written all over it what makes the book so unusual is that mr berger has taken a bizarre murder case and used it as a springboard to something even more bizarre suspects is a harmonic convergence of lunacy , in which the world is ruled not by god or the law but by very peculiar coincidences you fellas do one whale of a job , says the killer when he is finally brought to justice , mainly because of his own idiotic blathering but he is perplexed when the cops tell him he will not be able to do a scheduled interview with a tabloid television program because confessed murderers must remain in custody he feels that the cops lack a sense of fair play the fraternal order of police may disagree , but suspects is an engrossing , often hilarious offering from one of our most persistently strange writers
nearly four decades after its commercially indifferent first run , vertigo has become the most widely celebrated of alfred hitchcock s films it is prized not simply for its razorsharp suspense technique but also for its air of mystery , its tragic dimension , its literary layering of memory and obsession scholars have compared it to proust , tristan und isolde and the orpheus myth critics have voted it hitchcock s masterpiece robert harris and james katz , the film restorers who previously revived lawrence of arabia and spartacus , have completed the canonization by releasing vertigo in a 70millimeter , digitalsound version , which opens today \( with a video to follow early next year \) it would be heresy to suggest that the greatness of vertigo is owed to anyone but hitchcock , whose fingerprints cover every aspect of the production but there is a second genius at work in vertigo , and his voice will be heard more clearly in the restoration mr harris and mr katz refurbished not just the images but also the sound , bringing digital technology to bear on the bernard herrmann score , whose original tape turned up in a vault nearly intact herrmann was an absolute master of the strange art of film scoring , and in a career that stretched from citizen kane to taxi driver , the 1958 vertigo was probably his peak how much , indeed , of this film s famous atmosphere is owed to herrmann \? close your eyes and think of one sequence , and you may well remember kim novak s somnambulistic tour of san francisco , from a chapel to a graveyard to a picture gallery it is the music as much as the lighting and the filters that gives those scenes their eerie shimmer none of which is to detract from hitchcock s glory he knew the nature of the talent he had engaged , and he created extraordinary opportunities for herrmann to make his mark vertigo is a symphony for film and orchestra herrmann was born in new york in 1911 he made his name first as a composer at cbs radio he arrived in hollywood with the young genius of the airwaves orson welles his first effort at film scoring was citizen kane like welles , he was viewed with intense suspicion by the film community his life in hollywood was fraught with difficulties , many of his own making he was a passionate , irascible , unpredictable character who often treated film people with contempt he wished more than anything else to make his name as a composer of concert music and a conductor on the international circuit if herrmann thought himself a failure at the end he died in 1975 on the night of the last recording session of taxi driver then he sadly undervalued his achievement over four decades , he revolutionized movie scoring by abandoning the illustrative musical techniques that dominated hollywood in the 1930 s and imposing his own peculiar harmonic and rhythmic vocabulary in place of lush melodies , he wrote short , obsessively repeated figures , static collections of chords , parodies of past styles the sound was original , even experimental , but also useful it wonderfully matched welles s electrifying fast style it took a while for herrmann and hitchcock to come together the director tried many times to engage herrmann before finally signing him for the trouble with harry , the first of nine collaborations hitchcock , too , had long been impatient with the busily illustrative type of score perfected by central european emigres like max steiner and erich wolfgang korngold while making lifeboat , he was heard to complain that the audience would wonder where the music was coming from , out there in the middle of the ocean \( ask hitchcock where the cameras come from , the composer david raksin famously replied \) hitchcock was not deaf to music he simply wanted to make its use more pointed he always enjoyed experimenting with live sources for music on film in rope , for example , farley granger s guiltridden character nervously plays poulenc at the piano in rear window , a cocktailpiano sound streams in from an adjacent apartment in herrmann , hitchcock found a composer whose music would blend into the action with the same uncanny directness , but now on a different level herrmann would address the unconscious regions , summon atmosphere and dread music would play its own starring role at times , it would take over the action vertigo fired herrmann s imagination because its byzantine plot perfectly matched his gothic sensibilities a retired police detective afflicted by vertigo is hired to follow and protect a woman named madeleine who seems to be suicidally possessed by a spirit from the 19th century although he discovers that she has been playacting as part of an elaborate murder plot , his intensifying obsession causes history to repeat itself in terrifying cycles the scenario has resonances with any number of doomdrenched romantic and symbolist dramas it also closely resembles an operatic model ironically , korngold s youthful masterpiece , die tote stadt \( in that opera , too , a man tries to make over a woman in the image of his dead beloved \)
east rutherford , nj , jan 20 the nets delayed today the fourplayer trade that sent kenny anderson and gerald glass to charlotte for kendall gill and khalid reeves before their 10397 overtime victory over the minnesota timberwolves at continental arena tonight , the nets asked the national basketball association for an extension until noon tuesday so that more medical tests could be conducted on reeves s sprained left ankle both of the players the nets acquired in friday s trade underwent physicals today in new jersey reeves s ankle still had some swelling , prompting the team s physician , dr jeffrey minkoff , to advise further testing we 'd just like to know the extent of it , said the nets' president , michael rowe we just needed some more tests and we could n't get them scheduled for today , so we 'll do them monday the nets do n't expect reeves s injury to cancel the trade , although none of the players involved are eligible to play until a determination has been made on reeves s physical condition a magnetic resonance imaging test is scheduled for monday the nets expect to know the results monday night i saw him walking with a queens limp this afternoon , said nets forward armon gilliam , referring to reeves , who is from queens i thought he was just being cool i did n't know anything was wrong with jayson williams sidelined with the flu , the nets had only nine players dressed for tonight s game still , they pulled out a victory in overtime behind a careerhigh 30 points from chris childs and 23 from gilliam the nets outscored minnesota by 115 in overtime with childs making five straight free throws to help break a 9797 tie the nets , who snapped minnesota s threegame winning streak , had planned to be shorthanded gill and reeves are n't expected to be available until tuesday s game at toronto anderson , however , was dressed and expected to start in the hornets game in charlotte tonight against golden state he returned to his street clothes after learning the trade was on hold i'm disappointed , anderson said i never thought of something like this happening the nets were aware reeves was coming off an injury he recently spent 11 games on the inactive list with a sprained left ankle but he had been activated for the hornets' last three games although he did not play when the deal was made friday , rowe said the nets were led to believe reeves was ready to play we were under the impression that he was game ready , rowe said we 'd like the test to further indicate that he is game ready if the ankle is worse than expected , rowe said the nets will explore options such as canceling the trade , restructuring the trade or seeking more medical information if warranted , the nets could ask for compensation in the form of money , a draft pick or another player such as sharpshooter dell curry , whom the nets initially coveted the chances of anderson returning to the nets are slim if the results are marginal our response will be marginal , rowe said if there is something dramatically wrong , there are some alternatives that can be worked out or there can be additional tests we 'll wait to see what the test results are and we 'll make a decision at that point charlotte s president , spencer stolen , was cautiously optimistic the deal would remain intact we 've had players in before and we 've had debates about whether we should cancel a trade or send the player back , he said but we never ended up doing it all of it was of little interest to the rest of the nets , who had their hands full with the timberwolves the game was tied , 9292 , at the end of regulation gilliam made two baskets to help the nets earn a 9794 lead in overtime , but the wolves tied it at 9797 on a jumper by christian laettner an illegal defense call against minnesota led to a childs free throw , and after laettner missed a jumper , childs drew a foul while getting the rebound he made two more free throws for a 10097 lead with 193 seconds showing minnesota sealed its fate when isaiah rider \( 17 points \) missed a 3pointer from the corner childs wound up at the freethrow line again this time he made one of two , putting the nets ahead by 4 ed o'ba'non , who scored a careerhigh 19 points , hit two more free throws for the final margin
dublin , ohio , may 31 john huston was walking toward history at the memorial tournament today , following his perfect tee shot down the 17th fairway at muirfield village behind him was the flaming wreckage of the golf course that he had already torched for 10 birdies and an eagle in front of him , if he could add just one more birdie in the final two holes , was the alltime pga tour scoring record of 59 he was laughing , joking with his caddie , just as a man with a large belly and a bigger voice yelled , somebody go get jack nicklaus out here , 'cause this course is just too easy huston smiled he was thinking about the record now , and it was funny , because the way he was playing golf , muirfield village did seem easy he had only to hit a 9iron from 142 yards somewhere in the vicinity of the flag and make the putt then , if he parred 18 , he would join al geiberger and chip beck , the only players to break the 60 barrier geiberger shot a 59 in 1977 in the memphis classic beck did it in the las vegas invitational in 1991 that was probably the moment the spell was broken you do n't talk about nohitters and you do n't think about 59 s the 9iron shot drifted and bounced into the deep right bunker huston hit an exquisite bunker shot , deftly killing the speed of the ball in the fringe and allowing it to trickle two and a half feet from the hole but his putt spun out hit the left side of the hole and careened right goodbye , 59 , but hello , courserecord 61 and the lead in the tournament my caddie and i were joking that jack came up here and kicked that ball out of the hole , said huston , whose nineunderpar 135 for 36 holes gave him a twostroke lead over ernie els , who shot 67 , and a threestroke lead over six players , including tom watson , payne stewart and larry mize nicklaus chortled at that he was impressed by huston s feat , which broke the muirfield course record of 63 shot by kenny perry in 1991 , but he could n't resist a little joke of his own that s why he gets paid to wear those shirts , nicklaus said those shirts bear the nicklaus name , and huston s round bore a resemblance to nicklaus s game early 60 s vintage it was five strokes better than the secondlowest of the day a 66 by paul stankowski and it could have been lower it began with five straight birdies the putts were diving in the hole , as the pros often say , like homesick gophers from 18 feet at no 1 , from 12 feet at no 2 , from 15 feet at no 3 , from 20 feet at no 4 and from 25 feet at no 5 , none of them ever threatened to stay out his playing partners , hal sutton and david frost , sensed something special might happen when a guy makes five in a row from those distances , you get a pretty good idea that he s thinking about going low , said sutton , who last year shot a 61 at the bc open he was in that zone he had his foot on the accelerator , and he never did hit the brakes no , what he did was hit a 3wood from 264 yards on to the green at the seventh hole and made the 8footer for eagle then he barely missed a pair of 12footers at the eighth and ninth huston , who turns 35 saturday , turned in 29 today on a spectacularly clear and calm afternoon that 29 was another muirfield record after twoputting for par at the 10th , huston started a string of five more birdies at no 11 , a 538yard par5 that exacted a double bogey from watson on thursday and one from steve jones today huston hit his sand wedge seven feet from the hole and made the putt at 12 , it was a 9iron to 20 feet at 13 , he hit a 7iron within 5 feet he nearly holed his sand wedge at the 14th after hitting a 3wood right to the edge of the fairway at the par5 15th , he hit his 3wood through the green , chipped from 60 feet to within 2 feet and walked to the 16th tee 12 under for the day at the 212yard par3 hole , he pulled a 4iron shot some 50 feet left of the hole , and then ripped his putt down the hill , 10 feet past huston is one of the fastest players on the pga tour , and he stepped up to that putt , a righttoleft breaker , and poured it right into the middle of the cup then he missed the only green he would miss all day , and he missed a 15footer for birdie at the final hole but as he tapped in for par , the huge gallery on the hillside stood and applauded up by the scorer s tent , davis love , john cook and mike hulbert , players who had come out to watch him finish , slapped huston on the back curtis strange phoned the press room to see how huston had done a terrific day , huston said it s a fun game when the putts fall chip shots notables to miss the cut , which was at three over par , were greg norman , who shot 7376 and went home to work on my short game , and jack nicklaus , the tournament founder and host , whose rounds were 7775 the united states open champion corey pavin \( 7573 \) also missed ian bakerfinch \( 7879 \) missed his 27th consecutive pga tour cut photo john huston reacting to cheers on the 18th hole after shooting

adding another twist to the investigation of the crash of trans world airlines flight 800 , federal officials said yesterday that the jetliner was used during a test of a bombdetecting dog five weeks before the crash , which they said could explain the traces of explosives found in the wreckage in the test , packages containing explosives were placed in the plane s passenger cabin for the dog to find , the officials said the officials said that the test packages contained the same explosives as those found by investigators after the crash but they emphasized that it was not at all certain that the material in the packages contaminated the plane traces of two explosives have been detected on two pieces of wreckage from the passenger cabin , which is the strongest evidence that the plane was destroyed by a bomb or a missile officials said the discovery that the plane was involved in the test did not necessarily lessen the possibility that an explosive device caused the crash on the evening of july 17 , killing all 230 aboard but they said the test deepened the mystery of whether the plane exploded because of sabotage or mechanical failure in a statement released yesterday , the federal bureau of investigation said as part of a routine recertification test for a dog , test packages containing explosive chemicals were placed aboard the aircraft , which could possibly relate to the trace residues previously identified the test packages were removed from the plane at the conclusion of the exercise a senior law enforcement official said last night that one of the microscopic traces discovered on a piece of debris was not found in a location where any of the packages had been hidden during the training exercise that could mean a lot , or it could not , the official said we do n't know it s mystifying this could be an explanation of how some or none or all of the chemicals got on the plane several law enforcement officials said yesterday that the testing of the dog on the plane would make it nearly impossible for investigators to construct a circumstantial case that the plane was destroyed by an explosive device even after detecting the explosive traces on the plane s wreckage , officials said they needed clear evidence of metal deformed by an highexplosive detonation before they could declare the crash a crime the traces of the two chemicals , petn and rdx , which are components of plastic explosives , were not considered definitive proof of a bomb blast because they were not found blasted into the metal wreckage as proof of sabotage has eluded investigators , some officials at the national transportation safety board have begun a reexamination of the possibility of a mechanical failure but officials have said there was no indication before the crash that the plane was experiencing difficulty and no evidence has emerged since to point to mechanical failure the officials have said that the plane s center fuel tank exploded but that they are are not certain what set off the explosion a federal official familiar with the investigation said the fact that the jetliner was used in the test was discovered on thursday , after investigators traced the whereabouts of the plane in the months before the crash the official said that investigators did not learn of the test earlier because it was not mentioned in records kept either by twa or the federal aviation administration the test was performed by the faa on june 10 , while the plane was on the ground at the lambertst louis international airport , according to federal officials john mcdonald , a twa spokesman , said he could not confirm that the flight 800 plane was involved in the test , but he said that we routinely cooperate with law enforcement in training exercises a law enforcement official involved in the inquiry said investigators were shocked that twa or faa did n't know about this and that this was only found out because the fbi put out an all points bulletin for where the plane had been an faa official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said investigators had researched whether there was any way the plane could have been contaminated by explosive residue before the crash the investigators , who knew that planes were used for testing and training bombsniffing dogs , wanted to find out if this particular 747 had been used in such an exercise since the plane s records did not reflect it was used in any tests , investigators began checking the records of law enforcement agencies in cities where the plane had been on the ground long enough for such a test , the official said in st louis , a record was found of a dog having been tested on june 10 , but the record said only that the plane used was a widebodied jet and did not identify it by tail number the dog apparently was part of the st louis airport police canine unit using records of what gates planes were parked at that day , investigators were able to identify that the plane involved in the test was the same one that crashed off the coast of long island eliot brenner , an faa spokesman , said the agencies investigating the crash were informed about the test as soon as the discovery was made a law enforcement official said the explosives are kept in a tightly wrapped package during the tests even so , mr brenner said , it was possible that testing can leave traces behind one senior official involved in the crash investigation said the discovery of the dog test once again offered investigators definitive proof of nothing , expect for the difficulty of their task the bottom line here is that people do not know , the official said
alan greenspan used the word bubble while talking about stock prices , and financial markets around the world deflated yesterday , evidently fearful that mr greenspan , the chairman of the federal reserve board , might do something to bring down the buoyant stock market but by the time the selloff had traveled around the globe depressing stock markets in japan and germany by more than 3 percent it had lost much of its force and even though share prices opened sharply lower in the united states , they soon stabilized and then mounted an afternoon rally by the end of the day , the dow jones industrial average was down only 5516 points , or 09 percent , to 6 , 38194 at its low , reached shortly after the market opened , the index was at 6 , 29250 , or down 14460 points the rebound came as the government reported that employment in november grew by a modest 118 , 000 , and the unemployment rate rose to 54 percent from 52 percent although there was a jump in average hourly wages , the report was interpreted as reflecting a weaker economy , making it less likely the federal reserve would consider raising shortterm interest rates what set the markets off yesterday were remarks mr greenspan delivered in washington on thursday night , in a speech to the american enterprise institute there he did not say stock prices were overvalued , but he did ask , rhetorically , how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values , which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in japan over the past decade \? he added that he would not be concerned so long as a collapsing financial asset bubble did not threaten economic harm but he went on to warn against complacency that such a collapse would not harm the economy \( page 35 \) none of that stopped traders , at least initially , from taking his remarks to mean that stocks were too high it was a wild end to one of the wildest weeks in recent market history the dow was down 13976 points , or 214 percent , in wall street s worst week since april a lot of the bleeding took place earlier in a brief flurry on tuesday , when the index plunged more than 40 points in the last 15 minutes of trading , evidently set off by a report of poor car sales from general motors on wall street , as prices plunged early yesterday , many rushed to say that the bull market remained intact byron r wien , the chief united states equity strategist at morgan stanley , said that considering interest rates and inflation , share prices now were slightly undervalued david shulman , who holds a similar post at salomon brothers , said that he did not think prices would go much lower even though one common measure of the value of the market the ratio between stock prices and earnings on the standard poor s index of 500 stocks last week was at a record level for this late in an economic cycle and abby joseph cohen , the cochairwoman of the investment policy committee at goldman , sachs , said that american stocks were roughly at fair value now , in contrast to 1987 , when they were overvalued those three strategists , along with a number of economists , met privately with mr greenspan on tuesday according to people familiar with the meeting , who spoke on condition on anonymity , they reviewed their market opinions with him , but got little in the way of a reaction that reaction may have come in his speech thursday night in which he noted that the sharp stock market break of 1987 had few negative consequences for the economy , but then added that we should not underestimate or become complacent about the complexity of the interactions of asset markets and the economy such factors , he said , would influence monetary policy in financial markets , one of the nastiest things that can be said about a rising market is that it is a bubble , conjuring images of a burst that would wipe out most of the gains in an instant that is one reason mr greenspan s use of the term caused such a severe reaction as reports of the fed chairman s speech moved onto news wires about 7 20 pm , new york time , there was little immediate market reaction but the prices of stock index futures , which trade at night on the globex electronic system , began to plunge about 7 45 and soon markets in australia and new zealand , which were already open for friday trading , began to fall japan was next , and then europe american stocks opened sharply lower at 9 30 am , but soon began to recover , amid talk that the federal reserve dared not tighten credit the fed has no intention of tightening policy simply to push the equity market down , said bruce steinberg , a merrill lynch economist it will only tighten when it believes the inflation climate requires it or , as christopher quick , who runs the new york stock exchange operations of quick reilly group , a discount brokerage firm , put it while talking to bloomberg business news , instead of raising rates , he is going to make speeches

shanghai , july 1 in a small brick home on a leafy side street in this city , a dozen idealistic young men gathered around a scuffed wooden table 75 years ago today to launch china s communist party , or so the history books say one of the participants , mao zedong , then just 27 , later rose to lead the communist party through civil war to make it the ruling power of the land for decades , mao directed efforts to install the party s authority in every office , factory and school , creating a juggernaut that could spread the party s word to every household and monitor the daily activities of every worker or student today , the old building is a museum to a lost ideal virtually no one believes in communism anymore as economic growth eats away at old systems and habits , the communist party s influence in daily life has receded sharply in the past few years , particularly among young urban dwellers the kind , in their 20 s , who might be setting up a political party if they lived in a different era in the most modern sectors of chinese society , such as securities firms , trading companies , banks and real estate dealers , the onceomnipresent party has almost no presence at all the party still has an iron grip on the national levers of political power yet its groundlevel organization seems to be falling farther and farther out of touch with the work and life styles of the men and women who increasingly drive china s bustling economy no one with any ability joins the party today , said yang jun , a 26yearold computer salesman who likes goldrimmed glasses and polo shirts my company has 80 employees , but there s no party organization if there are any party members , i do n't think any of them would admit it not long ago , a college graduate like mr yang would be assigned a job by one party official and supervised in a new workplace by another if he wanted to get married , his choice of spouse would also have to be approved by a superior a neighborhood committee would keep an eye on his home , noting who came and went in contrast , today mr yang lives relatively free from party interference he chose his own job and home he shares a twobedroom apartment in downtown shanghai with a coworker and does n't worry about who approves of his girlfriend , or when she stays over i have n't introduced her to my parents yet , he said , a little sheepishly party officials do not seem overly concerned with individualistic computer jocks like mr yang , though their indifference would disappear in a flash if he organized any antigovernment activity but they concede that they are having difficulty setting up party cells in freemarket sectors of the economy new companies are being set up faster than we can keep track of , acknowledged zhou heling , who as deputy director of the organization department in shanghai s communist party oversees the establishment of new party units we are encountering a lot of problems with these new economic entitites joint ventures are very complicated , mr zhou added , referring to companies with both domestic and foreign investment sometimes they register but do n't operate sometimes they operate without registering it s hard to keep up with them paradoxically , as party organizations lose touch with china s young professionals , they are aggressively enrolling more new young members than ever before perhaps it is to coopt as many young people as possible perhaps it is simply to pad the fiction that the party is getting ever stronger young people are the key , mr zhou said last year , 54 percent of our new members were under 35 in addition to the 19 , 600 35andunders who joined the party in shanghai last year , mr zhou said proudly , 110 , 000 more people applied , up 20 , 000 from the previous year altogether , there are 114 million members of the communist party in shanghai , a city of 14 million , and 57 million nationwide but numbers can be deceiving a 35yearold currency trader at a leading chinese investment firm recalled how a manager at his company recently pressed him to apply for party membership , simply because an order had come down to step up recruitment but i do n't want to have to pay the party fees , the trader protested , as he remembered it later , because he would owe 3 percent of his 3 , 000 monthly salary in fees you do n't have to join , just apply we need to raise our numbers , pleaded the manager help me out the trader agreed , on the condition that the manager made sure his application would be rejected but then the trader had trouble finding any colleagues to write him a recommendation , because none were familiar with the party line that needs to be regurgitated in an application , and eventually gave up the implications of this sometimescomical attitude toward party enrollment , like the political future of china itself , are anyone s guess one of the puzzles of modern china is whether the communist party , if it remains in power , will simply decide to shed its outdated name even a leading party organizer like mr zhou does not sound much like a communist when he discusses the establishment of party cells in a company our primary concern is moneymaking ability , he said setting up a party organization should be done in parallel with business functions we will not get in the way outside the museum where the communist party s first meeting was held , wu xiaoyong , a 40yearold party member who arrived with a busload of colleagues , pondered the future of the organization not too clear , he said young people have a lot more choices today than we did

white plains takima gonzalez , a high school senior here , grew up long before she wanted to for her , turning sweet 16 had less to do with parties and pretty dresses than it did with a baby daughter called shynel and a boyfriend who was a father in name only instead of dreaming as other young women often do about college and a family someday in the future , this young woman struggles in the present to balance motherhood and schoolwork and loneliness life stopped short for me , just like that , ms gonzalez , who is now 18 , said recently becoming a mother meant i could n't hang out with my friends any more or go to parties or even have a regular conversation without worrying about whether the baby needed a clean diaper her story is not an unusual one every year in the united states , 12 million teenage girls bear children while those numbers have dropped slightly in recent years , at 569 births for each 1 , 000 young women between 15 and 19 in 1995 nearly 6 percent america has by far the highest teenage pregnancy rate for any industrialized democracy the incidence is startlingly higher in the neighborhood where ms gonzalez is raising her daughter here , in a mostly business district with poor , predominantly minority residential areas , the numbers are 201 births for each 1 , 000 young women or 20 percent , which is the sixthhighest birth rate for teenagers in the state in rochester , the rate is 37 percent , the state s highest , and in the central harlem district of new york city , it is 32 percent the outlook for most teenage mothers like ms gonzalez is not promising , although she said she hoped to beat the odds statistics show that more than half of teenage mothers drop out of school after having a baby , and they are more likely than older mothers to seek public assistance ms gonzalez , however , is not on welfare , and she said she is determined to earn her diploma and graduate in june along with her classmates when she is not studying or caring for 2yearold shynel , she works as a photographer s assistant at a portrait studio in a nearby mall her grandmother , with whom she lives , and her mother , who lives nearby , help care for the child , and the father , who is unemployed , visits his daughter once a month and occasionally contributes to the expenses of raising her ms gonzalez said she had refused to marry him just because i had his baby in yonkers , where the teenage pregnancy rate is 17 percent , jesenia rodriquez shares a similar story , although she receives some public assistance now 18 , ms rodriquez lost a year of school when her son , joshua , now 11 months , was born , and she is completing her graduate equivalency diploma and beginning college studies for a degree in social work through a program offered at an extension unit of mercy college but she shares none of the student camaraderie that she had hoped for at college , and like ms gonzalez , she is alone much of the time ms rodriquez spends most of her days with joshua in their small basement apartment , which is decorated with handmedown furniture and photographs of the toddler s first year increasingly , stories like these young women s have become the focus of an intense political debate the welfare reform bill signed into law by president clinton on aug 22 will mean stricter work requirements and less public support for young women and their children we consider it a very punitive law , said bob hochman , coordinator of the yonkersbased teen linkage program of the westchester county department of health , which helps pregnant teenagers , teenage mothers and young women considered at high risk of becoming pregnant the message is that you guys are on your own and that if you 're going to get pregnant , we 're not going to support you donna m butts , executive director of the washingtonbased national organization on adolescent pregnancy , parenting and prevention , a nonprofit group , called it an abstinence only measure she said that under the law , states with programs that teach teenagers to prevent pregnancy by abstaining from sex will be eligible for 250 million in matching block grants citing statistics showing that 70 percent of teenagers have sexual experiences before they leave high school , ms butts said , hope , not abstinence , is the best form of birth control she said that teenage pregnancy is linked to low socioeconomic conditions , lower intellectual and academic achievement , unemployment , child abuse , drinking and drugs ms rodriquez , who works as a peer counselor for the teen linkage program , said some girls choose to have a baby because they need someone to be with who wo n't leave them in counseling other young women , she is quick to tell them that having a baby is a lot of hard work i met one girl in a class who said 'oh , babies are so cute , it s so easy to take care of them you just give them milk' but i told her babies have tantrums and they want to get picked up all the time ms rodriquez s case is unusual in that she has continued her relationship with the baby s father , who visits the family every day and contributes to joshua s support before i met him , i hung out with street guys , with hoodlums , she said i grew up in the projects , and that was my view of the world maybe i thought i could n't do better ms rodriquez said the baby s father works after school and gives her 300 a month and if joshua needs sneakers or something else , he gives me more ms butts and other social workers are worried that the new welfare law is unduly harsh and will cause hardships for many mothers like ms rodriquez and ms gonzalez
st louis , june 15 with all the great plays rey ordonez has made this season , an out is expected every time he gloves a ball but guess what \? he is human after all an illadvised decision by the rookie shortstop propelled the st louis cardinals to a threerun second inning and a 42 victory over the mets tonight at muggy busch stadium ordonez , who was not in the original lineup but opted to play tonight and take sunday off , gambled and lost big when he decided to throw home to try to stop a run instead of conceding the run and going for what would have been an easy double play the tough chance came after the cardinals had already scored one run in the first inning brian jordan and tom pagnozzi led off the second by singling off mets starter bobby jones , putting runners on first and third david bell then hit a sharp ground ball to ordonez he fielded the ball , hesitated , then threw home the ball arrived late and jordan made an elusive slide to score instead of a 20 lead with two out , the cardinals had a 20 lead with none out it was early in the game and you usually go for two , mets manager dallas green said that s why we had him back plus he hesitated , and once he hesitated he could n't get jordan the cardinals took full advantage when ron gant drove in the third run with a sacrifice fly and bell scored from third when royce clayton walked and then got caught in a rundown while attempting to steal the mets were guilty of poor execution on that play as well catcher todd hundley should have looked bell back to third before throwing to second he never looked to third , green said it made a difficult start for jones more difficult he got behind quickly , surrendering the run in the first inning when clayton doubled and scored on a single by gary gaetti after the long second inning , the mets found themselves in a 40 hole but jones was solid after that , holding the cardinals scoreless for the next five innings he pitched after the first two innings i settled down and started hitting my spots , said jones \( 63 \) , who gave up six hits in seven innings lance johnson began bringing the mets back by belting a solo home run off starter alan benes \( 64 \) in the third inning it was his second of the season , and it came in the same stadium and against the same pitcher as his first homer , on april 25 it became 42 in the sixth when johnson walked and scored on a triple by jose vizcaino there were no outs after the extrabase hit , but a potential big inning was wasted when vizcaino made a baserunning blunder when jeff kent hit a ground ball to gaetti at third , vizcaino broke toward home but stopped halfway as gaetti fielded it gaetti fired to first for one out and the relay came home in time to nail vizcaino at the plate for a costly double play i should have stayed at third base , vizcaino said it was just instinct to go home when i saw him throw to first it was the last decent chance the mets had benes left after giving up six hits and two runs in seven and a third innings rick honeycutt finished the eighth and dennis eckersley pitched the ninth for his ninth save at least all jones had to concentrate on tonight was throwing strikes , and not throwing at someone in his last outing against the braves , jones was criticized for not throwing at steve avery after the braves pitcher had drilled vizcaino in the knee with a fastball , an act the mets felt was deliberate jones threw two pitches inside that avery easily dodged before drawing a warning from the plate umpire charlie williams probably most of the guys do n't even think about it , john franco said , speaking generally about the situation but maybe there are a handful of guys that think about it and are disappointed it s not that we do n't respect bobby but if one of our guys gets it , one of theirs should when someone on your team gets hurt and everybody knows it s on purpose , something should be done at least two mets have said jones was trying to hit avery with both pitches but simply missed i ca n't come out and say i was trying to hit somebody , jones said before tonight s game but i think everybody knows what the intent was there has been a lot of negative stuff coming out and i do n't think that should happen i just hope everybody on my team knows that i 'll protect them and stand behind them and do whatever i have to do to let them know i wo n't back down inside pitch paul wilson threw without problems today he will be reevaluated sunday jose vizcaino was 3 for 3 , and is 9 for 9 against alan benes this year bob macdonald accepted his appointment to class aaa norfolk photo cards' brian jordan sliding safely past mets catcher toddhundley , ahead of shortstop rey ordonez s throw \( associated press \)
chicago scottie pippen rushed back into chicago s lineup last night , but it was hardly necessary michael jordan had everything under control with pippen hampered by a bad back , and dennis rodman suspended with a bad attitude , jordan again showed why he is the baddest player on the planet fueling a spectacular 203 bulls run to end the second quarter , jordan \( 36 points , 11 rebounds , 5 assists \) catapulted chicago to a 10786 victory that put a screeching halt to new york s fourgame winning streak by halftime , the knicks looked as dazed as frank bruno looked saturday night this was a revenge game for the bulls , and for jordan less than two weeks ago , the knicks embarrassed chicago , 10472 , at madison square garden in a nationally televised game just before the bulls took the court , james brown s classic the big payback was blaring over the united center loudspeaker maybe jordan requested it because he paid the knicks back in full i believe in paying back , jordan said after the game , with a twinkle in his eye it was a playoff atmosphere from new york s perspective , the whipping was a daunting dose of reality they have looked more aggressive , more committed , and more confident since jeff van gundy took over for don nelson when charles oakley \( broken thumb \) and hubert davis \( hyperextended knee \) start wearing uniforms again instead of suits , the knicks can make a run at indiana for third place in the eastern conference but the bulls \( 607 \) are on a different level , headed for a 70victory season if they can win 10 of their last 15 games and jordan is the main reason jordan is so good , what he does is almost taken for granted , as if it s easy to take 19 months off during your prime , come back , and still be better than everyone at age 33 if jordan does not win the most valuable player award again this season , there should be an investigation and if jerry reinsdorf allows jordan to walk away as a free agent this summer , the bulls owner will never be forgiven in this town anyone who knows jordan knew he would have a big game he lives for situations like this his team shorthanded , the knicks in the house , a 33game home winning streak to protect jordan and patrick ewing are good friends , but when they greeted each other at midcourt , there was no smiling , no hugging , just a simple touch of fists this was a business meeting and jordan was the chief executive officer by halftime , jordan had 26 points , 8 rebounds , and 5 assists after a half like that , some players would be ready to call their agent and ask for a contract extension some of jordan s moves were simply breathtaking the knicks kept throwing different defenders at jordan john starks , anthony mason , derek harper , willie anderson not that jordan cared , or noticed during one sequence , jordan made two spin moves on anderson that made anderson s legs buckle like a folding chair if jordan had wanted to talk trash , he could have but his play said it all the bulls may only be stopped if they stop themselves jordan and pippen are so competitive that coach phil jackson has trouble convincing them to take it easy , and both players may be tired heading into the playoffs jordan has been logging heavy minutes , especially recently , filling the void left by pippen and rodman it was probably bad judgment for pippen to play last night he looked like a shell of himself , scoring his first points with just 10 minutes 25 seconds left in the game he finished with 6 i do n't feel too good , pippen said i know i was a little rusty tonight , i have n't practiced i guess i wanted to play this one because of what happened last time in new york rodman is another potential chicago problem he has three games left on his sixgame suspension for headbutting a referee who knows if rodman was watching this game , or if he was out getting a new tattoo but if he expects a new contract from the bulls this summer , he ca n't ruin their chances of winning a championship this spring how rodman behaves when he returns will have a major impact on chicago s fortunes from new york s point of view , now that the knicks know where they stand against the bulls , they can spend the next few weeks dealing with their toughest stretch of the season , playing against houston , san antonio , orlando and indiana during the next two weeks there are some positive signs for the knicks starks is happy again playing for van gundy , and the knicks need starks for the postseason on backtoback nights , starks had to face reggie miller , then jordan for a shooting guard , that s a little like facing joe frazier , followed by muhammad ali but starks outplayed miller , and nobody would have outplayed jordan tonight the victory raised chicago s home record to 340 the bulls have won 41 consecutive regularseason home games , and they are 7211 during the regular season since jordan returned from retirement in march of last year asked what the odds were of the bulls losing at home this season , pippen said i do n't think we 're going to have a problem we have so much confidence on this court i think the odds are slim and none as for jordan , he had a score to settle with the knicks tonight and when he was finished , the knicks had got the message
angry about their working conditions , some welfare recipients required to work for their benefits say that with the work should come the many protections available to other workers while not objecting to work itself , these laborers complain that they are occupying a new basement tier in the labor force , one that lacks regulations on hours , wages and safety that other workers take for granted there are 30 , 000 workfare laborers in new york city , and officials say the new federal welfare law could push the total to more than 100 , 000 with numbers like that , even murmurs of complaint ring loud to the city s municipal union leaders those leaders , worried about the future of jobs for their own members , have questioned the program and begun to speak out about the recipients and the basic rights of workers mayor rudolph w giuliani , eager not to jeopardize the program he has called a great achievement of his administration , has agreed to meet today with stanley hill , the head of the largest union of city employees , to broker a resolution at the start , the unions willingly stereotyped us as a bunch of transients , and only now have they opened their eyes to what is taking place , said john gantt , who will report for his latest workfare assignment next month some of us ca n't believe they have come around others believe it s about damn time he is among a small band of workers who are not waiting for help from the unions and are trying to organize on their own they are distributing leaflets and badges , preaching solidarity and planning ways to make the city take notice this nascent effort at unionizing is merely one more reflection of the considerable discontent that prevails among the thousands of men and women who have swept streets , transported corpses at city hospitals or performed other chores in the city s work experience program , or wep participants work at least 26 hours each week in return for benefits that can be as spare as 6850 in cash and 60 in food stamps every two weeks any organizing efforts face steep legal barriers under federal law , welfare beneficiaries in workfare programs are not entitled to bargain as a group with an employer they do not come under the jurisdiction of the national labor relations board , which administers union elections but their complaints echo grievances that have served for decades as rallying cries for unions low wages , conditions that include no gloves for street cleaners , no safety training and scant chance for advancement into permanent jobs they say that as the city grows increasingly reliant on their labor , their sheer numbers will give them some leverage we have to come together or else we 'll sound like a bunch of complainers , said barbara stewart , a welfare recipient who said she worked for her benefits as a clerk at a welfare office in downtown brooklyn there are more than 30 , 000 of us there has to be some power in that exactly how much power remains a big question leaders of the group organizing the workfare recipients , wep workers together , say they have a couple hundred members willie james , the head of the transport workers union in the city , agreed last week to allow thousands of workfare participants to clean subways and buses alongside union workers , but also raised the possibility that his union could later capture their numbers if they got real jobs mr hill said that at his meeting with the mayor , he was willing to go to bat for the welfare recipients he said that the workfare program in the city was not being run properly , that the guidelines about union jobs not being filled by welfare workers had been violated in some cases , and that the program was not leading to meaningful numbers of people entering the real workplace i 'd love to organize as many of them as we could , but we do n't have the legal leverage , mr hill said of the recipients the program needs to be fixed it needs to be about jobs , real jobs the fear about worker and job displacement is real , and it s a national fear other union leaders , perceiving the recipients as either a threat or potential allies , have begun to speak out about the conditions victor gotbaum , mr hill s predecessor as executive director of district council 37 of the american federation of state , county and municipal employees , the umbrella union of nonuniformed city workers , said the unions had reason to be nervous we tried to unionize the welfare recipients a decade ago , mr gotbaum said they were ruled not to be workers we wanted to give them protection , and i do n't think we even spoke of dues they are an exploited , underpaid group but our problem was n't a large one then candidly , it now appears overwhelming workfare participants have no unified or singular voice the city says that a large portion of the 100 , 000 people who have moved through the program have jobs , but officials have not conducted longterm studies there are many who are grateful for the chance to be doing anything other than nothing
chappaqua , ny , march 13 for four years , students taking health classes at horace greeley high school here have read earvin \( magic \) johnson s 1992 book , what you can do to avoid aids , as part of the aids education curriculum but early this year , a group of parents complained that the basketball player s written depictions of oral and anal sex were inappropriate for 14 and 15yearolds as a result , the district stopped using the book last month and on tuesday , the school board , after a standingroomonly meeting that focused largely on the issue of sex education , decided to establish a health advisory council to review all materials used in the health classes it also said it would let parents preview the materials used in class and allow them to have their children opt out of any instruction they found objectionable the uproar surprised the school board in this wealthy community , which is known for its progressive views last year , the board adopted a policy protecting the rights of gay students with barely a whisper of community protest but it was clear on tuesday night that many parents believed the sexeducation curriculum had gone too far jim runde , whose daughter will attend horace greeley next year , said he was appalled that mr johnson s book , which is published by times books , had been included in the curriculum the book first describes the benefits of sodomy to include birth control and preserving virginity , mr runde said , and second , discussed the use of saran wrap as a prophylactic for oraltoanal sex this course material needs to be scrutinized to insure that such inappropriate material is not included again geri c smith , who has four children in the district , said in an interview my husband and i met with the principal and the health teacher this year and told them that we object to our daughter reading magic johnson s book this is the same class where last year they used a banana to demonstrate the use of condoms i'm not a prude , and i think the children need education , but you can certainly question the way these things are taught over the last four years , there has been increasing debate about the content of sex education programs , said debra haffner , president of the sexuality information and education center , an organization based in manhattan since 1992 , she said , her group has documented more than 400 sexrelated community disputes in 47 states , mostly about the content of curriculum none specifically involved mr johnson s book , she said but when the book was released , store chains including walgreen s and kmart refused to sell it because of mr johnson s blunt language the book is to be reissued next month by times books , a division of random house school administrators said that the book had been endorsed by the american medical association and the children s defense fund and mary beth roche , a vice president of times books , said it had been used in school districts in california , maryland and missouri nonetheless , after hearing from parents and consulting with the high school health teacher , district officials decided to stop using the book in class after the last semester ended in january when magic johnson made his statement about being hivpositive four years ago , it was getting a lot of attention from kids , said maryann doyle , assistant superintendent for curriculum , who took part in the decision now you have a questioning of the district s judgment because of the book , and it s become a lightning rod she said it was not worth going through a formal procedure to defend a parental challenge to the book , since there were so many other ways to teach about aids at tuesday s meeting , parents also criticized films shown in the health class that deal with sexual abuse and rape , and raised concerns about a segment on selfexaminations for breast and testicular cancer but many parents and students at the meeting vigorously defended the health class i greatly value the current curriculum and i would hate to see it taken away , anne davison said my daughter learned a tremendous amount about safety in sexual matters about disease prevention and pregnancy prevention this was invaluable to her and i would n't want to send her to college without the information she got in that health class joe kerns , a senior at horace greeley high school , said i attend mass at st john s and st mary s every sunday , and maybe they wo n't want me back next week , but i know at a high school level everything does have to be talked about , because by 10th grade , you 're going to be exposed to a sexual activity abstinence should be taught , but no matter what you teach , kids are going to be having sex during high school photo language in magic johnson s book for teenagers was protested bymany parents in chappaqua , ny , on tuesday one , james runde , above , said , this course material needs to be scrutinized \( jim estrin the new york times \)
los angeles , aug 22 to be successful in professional basketball these days , you have to master the fundamentals shooting , passing and marketing mostly marketing the los angeles lakers of the national basketball association stunned the sports world recently with the richest contract ever signed a 7year , 120 million deal with a 24yearold center , shaquille o'neal a basketball franchise is , at bottom , a business , so how can the team afford to pay a single player even a 7 foot 1 inch , 320pound star that much and still make ends meet \? the answer is that times have changed experts say the deal is just another step in an escalation of both costs and revenue in what is now more properly part of the entertainment industry o'neal s commanding presence is sure to sell more tickets , adding to the bottom line , but tickets are only part of the calculation he should also increase sales of lakers merchandise , raise the team s take of local broadcasting contracts , attract more corporate sponsors and make it more likely the lakers advance in the playoffs , gathering added revenue ticket revenues once covered player salaries , but no longer the lakers , like most teams , do not disclose financial information , but financial world magazine estimates that two seasons ago , the latest period for which it has figures , the lakers took in 269 million from ticket sales , while paying out 456 million to players the salary figure was inflated because of special payments , but the payroll could still come to 35 million or more this year the los angeles lakers inc , fortified with o'neal , could take in , using optimistic assumptions , about 85 million to 90 million from all sources tickets , broadcasting , concessions and the like some experts estimate that even after paying shaq s towering salary , the team could end up with 10 million of operating income within a few years , a nice rise from financial world s estimate of 62 million two seasons ago the deal also added impetus to plans to construct a new arena , with skyboxes and other lucrative amenities if , as it hopes , the team moves into the arena in 1999 , the numbers could rise sharply the fastestgrowing sources of revenues are broadcast rights , rentals on skyboxes , merchandising , corporate sponsorships and lending the team s name to various products that is the essence of what the shaq deal represents , experts said the transformation of athletes into entertainment products , content to be packaged and repackaged of course , this will all be enhanced if o'neal helps win some games sweat , talent and glory have not disappeared as elements of the game we do n't have a captive market here , said jerry west , the legendary player and now executive vice president of the lakers , who negotiated the deal to bring o'neal to los angeles the lakers need to win or none of this works but for all the moaning about rising salaries michael jordan will reportedly be paid a record 25 million this coming season those familiar with the business of basketball say that the costs , while huge , are effectively investments and they have a reasonable shot at paying off if handled intelligently , similar to paying top dollar for tom hanks or michelle pfeiffer for a film the best evidence is that entertainment and cable companies , from walt disney and time warner to comcast and itt , are snapping up sports franchises and plugging them into their marketing machines in fact , sony pictures entertainment discussed buying a large stake in the lakers several years ago this game has really changed , mr west said i mean really changed he added , a touch of exasperation in his voice , that the o'neal deal is an aberration it wo n't happen again it ca n't happen again but many other experts say it is just the start shaq represents the convergence of sports and entertainment , said leonard armato , o'neal s agent added paul wachter , a managing director at schroder wertheim company who represents buyers and sellers of sports franchises the yankees are n't competing with the mets anymore , they 're competing with 'independence day' there are several obvious ways the lakers hope to cash in on their new star the cheapest lakers ticket jumped from 950 last season to 21 in the coming year , and courtside seats , usually occupied by celebrities like jack nicholson , went from 500 to 600 the planned arena would be developed and owned by the los angeles kings , a hockey franchise , and shared by the lakers though the arena could cost more than 200 million , the payoff is expected to be substantial the lakers now play in the great western forum , which was built in 1967 and is the oldest arena now used in pro basketball it has 17 , 505 seats , compared with 20 , 000 planned for the new arena more important , the forum has no skyboxes or other corporate suites , which can sell for as much as 60 , 000 a season , or room for the clubs , restaurants and stores that accessorize modern arenas new arenas can also bring in substantial money by selling corporate sponsorships pacific telesis has agreed to pay 50 million to name the san francisco giants' planned new stadium pacific bell park , and philip morris s miller brewing unit has paid 40 million to have its name atop the milwaukee brewers' new ballpark great western bank itself paid a reported 20 million in 1988 for the lakers' venue to be renamed the great western forum
british ballet had two founding mothers ninette de valois , who established what is now the royal ballet , and marie rambert , who in 1926 founded the ballet club , which became ballet rambert and then the rambert dance company as these name changes imply , the rambert troupe , which bills itself as britain s oldest dance company , has not been without identity problems , particularly since its founder s death in 1982 at the age of 94 on two previous visits here in the 1980 s , the group s esthetics were in flux but on tuesday night , when the company opened a weeklong run at the joyce theater \( 175 eighth avenue , at 19th street , chelsea \) with music ranging from mozart to the rolling stones , it was clearly a revitalized company that had found its center christopher bruce , rambert s newest director , has always been a choreographer with firm ideas whether he has been a major one until recently is open to debate generally , one could admire his stubborn faith in highly unfashionable socialprotest pieces and worry about their lack of complexity but last year there was evidence of a stunning artistic breakthrough his premiere , meeting point , was the showstopper of the 1995 united we dance festival in san francisco brimming with sophisticated , inventive movement , it was terrifically danced , thanks to the dancers mr bruce recruited in 1994 when he took over rambert alas , meeting point will only be seen on the company s second joyce program , and the first does not quite have the same impact but it did define how mr bruce , 51 , sees the company eclectic , balletic in base and moderndance in approach the evening opened with jiri kylian s petite mort \( performed two years ago by mr kylian s netherlands dance theater at the brooklyn academy of music \) and included the local premieres of mr bruce s swansong and rooster swansong , originally created for the geneva ballet , establishes its ruling image from the start a man and a woman in khaki flank another woman on a chair the seated woman is the prisoner the pair are her interrogators we expect them to beat her to a pulp , but the tormentors torture their victim by dancing before her it is a sharp metaphoric twist on a literal conceit , somewhat overextended but brilliantly conceived and executed not just the costagavras of european contemporary dance , mr bruce has previously turned to the theme of the disappeared in latin america echoes of argentine politics can be felt in swansong , but the power of the performers radiates a more universal resonance didy veldman is riveting as the woman who does not break , no matter how much she is yanked around in the acrobatic choreography and there was a purity about her deliverance as she walked out in a beam of light , courtesy of david mohr as the secret police , christopher powney and sarah warsop managed successfully to channel their tangos , softshoe or astaire routines \( cane but no top hat \) into metaphors for intimidation , not entertainment only philip chambon s percussion score on tape was literal , serving as a soundtrack the choreography here is the equivalent of plain talk , but the torturebydance joke is never a joke in itself mr bruce took a gamble with a risky image and won in rooster , set to a series of rolling stones recordings , mr bruce is less interested in the speed and highflying energy of swansong than in crowdpleasing vignettes and neat patterns the lyrics are a springboard for the dances , which do not necessarily illustrate the words nonetheless , steven brett , in jacket and tie , was properly roosterlike to little red rooster , and most of the piece was concerned with mod mating rites sheron wray was the first independent woman onstage , and the episode danced to lady jane had simon cooper being more or less faithful to hope muir in a dreamlike sequence full of lifts rafael bonachela and kate coyne continued the series of duets that studded the piece , and patricia hines , in red boa , and vincent redmon were nicely glib , dancing to play with fire sara matthews was lyrical and virginal in ruby tuesday oddly , the mix of disco and ballet made for a mild ensemble in sympathy for the devil nevertheless , the company looks much better with its clothes on than off dressed in corsets , the dancers gave petite mort less power than mr kylian s own company and added little to its meaningless tone elsewhere , mr kylian has explained that the title is a french literary expression for orgasm , and his duets , no matter how stylized , are none too subtle the mozart music suggests a weightiness that the work does not have photo patricia hines and vincent redmon of the rambert troupe in rooster at the joyce theater \( sara krulwich the new york times \)
washington , sept 19 in winnowing thousands of recorded speeches of this century s american political oratory down to a mere fourhour video of what every voter craves excitement , surprise , conflict , leadership parker l payson sampled the quadrennial presidential debates but usually hit the fastforward button they do n't really have it , said mr payson , an alexandria , va , producer of the great american speeches video , who discovered no vaulting rhetoric or memorably moving images as he followed the candidates like so many ronald reagans meandering down that endless ocean highway to peroration great speeches are a function of the need for people to have something to say , mr payson said , having found in sampling everyone from theodore roosevelt to mario cuomo that candidates for the modern presidency have everything to say , rather than something , and they try saying it every day , often the same way , sooner or later everywhere kennedy set that standard , i think , and when people are speaking all the time , they run out of things to say that said , the glorious tolerance of the american voting public will once more be on display next month when , and if , the clintondole debates begin and an expected record turnout of curious viewers is registered an overlooked fact of modern politics is that while voters' cynicism toward the scripted party conventions of feelgood tableaux has seen an emphatic dropoff in tv attendance , the televised presidential debates have been drawing americans in record numbers 97 million viewers tuned in to the third 1992 debate as if it were the superbowl , showing none of the impatience evinced by president george bush as he nettlesomely checked his wristwatch on screen in the midclash of ideas we are in a placid moment in american history , and shaking the electorate out of the doldrums may take some doing , so the first debate will be very important , said roderick p hart , a professor of communications and government at the university of texas if the first is a yawner , i do n't think bob dole has the personality to constantly gather an audience in an odd way neither personality gives evidence that a great clash is impending because bob dole is so mellow and the president is too smooth to say intemperate things whatever , as mr dole is wont to orate , the matchup has its contrasts it will feature an incumbent of historic garrulousness but middleground cautiousness , a candidate whom political tacticians credit with taking the art of focusgroup testing to rarefied levels of canniness with endless sampling of the most casual seeming phrases and images of his practiced performance in the other corner is bob dole , one of the most taciturn candidates of modern times , a speaker of such modest oratorical habits that he made big campaign news by hiring a novelist to reach for compelling heights in his behalf , and by taking lessons at the teleprompter , as if it were a newfangled flying machine surely everybody in america knows bill clinton is the greatest debater since benjamin disraeli , said john buckley , mr dole s spokesman , strategic as a boxing manager at the oratorical art of poormouthing his candidate just being on the same stage with him will be quite an accomplishment , knowing bill clinton s ability to sing the birds out of the trees in such a matchup , bob dole s sincerity and plainspokenness will serve him well after the 1992 debates , brian arthur , the british editor of the penguin book of twentiethcentury speeches , concluded that there seemed some basis for the view expressed quadrennially in this country that , in an era of electronic vigilance and elaborate backstage calculation of even the simplest human moments , great spontaneous speechmaking by politicians has gone the way of the torchlight parade not everyone agrees do they show poise and articulation under pressure \? asks bruce buchanan , director of the markle presidential watch , pointing to the most basic questions of viewers who , he stresses , appreciate the debates for presenting candidates unfiltered initially by journalistic commentary do they touch my heart when they 're thinking on their feet \? dr buchanan , a political scientist , monitors news coverage of the campaign and found that electronic journalists overwhelmed the candidates at the party conventions , occupying 12 times more air time than the speaking candidates this only whetted the public s appetite to hear the contenders in debate pure and unspun , he feels , citing studies that voters prefer to decide their own significant cues and not await the news media s memorializing of george bush wristwatch metaphor this most democratic impulse for doityourself spin doctoring may , in fact , prove to be the main innovation of the 1996 debates beyond whatever clash the candidates offer four years ago , the commission on presidential debates held focus groups in 17 cities to get a better idea of what should be asked and what more than 600 viewers were learning an unexpected lesson was that participants lauded the sheer experience of postdebate discussion as much as the debates , bonding like jurists with other panel members and compounding their appetite for politics we did n't intend this it just happened , said diana carlin , a political scientist who ran the focus groups this year she is initiating a debatewatch program in which thousands of simple volunteer discussion groups are being created across the nation at the invitation of major civic and political institutions to spread the enthusiasm summaries of the discussions involving tens of thousands of impressions will be fed back to the commission in a kind megafocus group that has political specialists salivating but the real payoff , dr carlin said , will remain with the voters after 90 minutes of dense information , people typically retain 50 percent of what they heard , but the discussion groups stirred far better results voters learned much more , it turned out , than if they had listened at home , turned to the cat and said , 'oh well , they did what i expected'
to the editor i write to protest the querulous , dismissive review by michael hofmann of new selected poems , by donald justice \( dec 10 \) based on the premise of a rigid and niggardly historicism as relates to period styles , mr hofmann belabors mr justice s poems for not being uptodate , as if pound , in anything but the style of modernism , had not written , what thou lov est well is thy true heritage mr justice s brilliant poems , alive with a moving nostalgia , a delicately modulated melancholy , an idiosyncratic wit , a musical formality that is also a lyric freedom , seem beyond the range of mr hofmann s ear he admires robert lowell \( as do i \) but is prepared to tune out anything in a different register as sounding oldfashioned what must he make of the archaisms of hardy and ransom , the deliberate formalities of graves , the classicism of keats \? mr justice was a nominee for last year s national book award , was admired unreservedly by the likes of w h auden and howard nemerov , and continues to enjoy the great esteem of such accomplished critics and poets as harold bloom , paul fussell , mark strand and dana gioia , none of whom would consider his poems derivative or irrelevant , as this reviewer appears to think in the same issue , alistair horne allows himself to admire as not bad at all , revealing a romantic and surprisingly sensitive nature , the ridiculously inept doggerel of gen george s patton what is a reader of the book review to think of its attitude toward poetry \? anthony hecht washington
after months of news reports about bastard out of carolina , it may be difficult to separate the film from the fuss around it the first feature directed by anjelica huston , it tells of a little girl beaten and raped by her stepfather in south carolina in the 1950 s made for tnt , the film was abruptly dropped after ted turner took a look and declared its content too rough for his network plenty of unsettling issues are still swirling around that lateinthegame decision , questions that touch everything from how mr turner s iron whims might function at time warner to what television ought to show in prime time but bastard out of carolina \( on showtime tomorrow night at 9 \) deserves to be judged apart from its volatile history this is a haunting and harrowing film , directed by ms huston with a fine eye and a strong will it includes an astonishing , sad and quiet performance by jena malone as bone , the abused child most important , bastard is not some lurid victimoftheweek movie , but an intelligent and sensitive work , which recognizes that any story of abuse is also the story of the lives that allowed it to happen ms huston was right to hold out for something so tough jennifer jason leigh , with aliceinwonderland hair , looks like a little girl herself at the start her character , anney boatwright , is about to give birth to bone , named by an uncle because she was no bigger than a knucklebone in the film s first 15 minutes , anney and bone s disastrous courses are set , and the boatwright family is defined the illegitimate bone is born after anney is tossed through the windshield of a car in which she was riding with drunken relatives in a few years anney marries , but her new husband , lyle \( dermot mulroney \) , dies in another car crash , leaving her with another baby daughter anney s sister ruth , played by glenne headley in one of the film s most touching performances , looks into her stunned face at the funeral this is as old as you 're ever going to get , girl , she says this is your face for the rest of your life the boatwrights are raucous , basically good but thoughtless people michael rooker is especially vivid as anney s brother earle , who brings his friend glen into the restaurant where she is a waitress glen is a goodlooking bully with a temper after he marries anney , he turns out to be far worse as glen , ron eldard , known for softer roles in the sitcom men behaving badly and as shep on er , captures the benign surface that deludes anney and the depraved undercurrent that causes him to abuse bone one effect of all the advance word on the film is that viewers will be waiting for the crucial scenes of abuse there are two , and the first manages to be both explicit and circumspect when glen pulls bone onto his lap in the front seat of the car one night , the camera focuses intently on their faces there is no doubt what glen is doing as he writhes and moans what makes the scene especially disturbing is that viewers are made to share bone s helplessness she stares , blankfaced , throughout the ordeal from then on , ms malone captures the deep pain of a child who is afraid to say a word about what has happened for months after , daddy glen , as he is called , beats bone with his belt when the boatwrights learn what has been happening , bone s uncles beat glen savagely anney hysterically cries he loves bone he 'd never hurt her bone sobs i'm sorry i made him mad this is a family tragedy glen returns to rape bone in a scene far more graphic than the first this time she kicks and screams her mouth becomes bloody it is excruciating to watch but unlike so many scenes in bloody action movies , this one has a point it depicts a genuine horror despite its strengths , bastard out of carolina sometimes goes astray , especially when it tumbles into redneck cliches as granny boatwright , grace zabriskie sits on the porch of her shack spittin' and rockin , ' and bone s uncles drink moonshine from glass jars and an occasional voiceover by laura dern as the grownup bone echoes the most overripe prose from dorothy allison s otherwise strong novel but none of those flaws diminish the film s impact like her film , ms huston deserves to be judged on her own but she has clearly learned something from her father , john like his films , bastard out of carolina is strong and unfussy , with clarity in each scene and a firm dramatic line showtime is smart and lucky to have it bastard out of carolina showtime , sunday night at 9 anne meredith , screenwriter anjelica huston , director gary

patrick air force base , fla , june 30 president clinton led two memorial services today for the 19 airmen killed on tuesday in a bombing in saudi arabia , telling their families , america stands with you in your sorrow and in your outrage , and vowing that we will not rest until their killers are caught there is a passage in isaiah in which god wonders , 'whom shall i send , and who will go for us \? ' the president told 4 , 500 friends and colleagues of the fallen airmen this morning at eglin air force base , in the florida panhandle isaiah answers 'here am i , lord send me , ' mr clinton continued these men we honor today said to america , send me' mr clinton cut short a visit to france at the end of the annual summit meeting of the seven largest industrial democracies to attend the services today as he did throughout the summit meeting , which ended in lyons , france , on saturday , mr clinton vowed today that those who killed the airmen would be hunted down they were taken before their time , the president repeated in identical language at the separate services , felled by the hands of hatred in an act whose savagery is matched only by its cowardice we will not rest in our effort to capture , prosecute and punish those who committed this evil deed today s eulogies were the latest of several services in which mr clinton has taken on a role of the nation s chief mourner for commerce secretary ronald h brown , who was killed in a plane crash in croatia for adm jeremy m boorda , the chief of naval operations , who committed suicide , and at the oneyear anniversary of oklahoma city bombing while none of these have been political events , mr clinton s advisers often comment that they make use of mr clinton s best oratorical skills mixing the role of empathetic national pastor and that of national leader in a time of a new type of threat mr clinton met today , at both eglin and patrick air force bases , with the families of each of the men who died , and later said he found them incredibly strong at one point one relative said the president needed to think about this when you see your daughter , chelsea one day your children are there and the next they are gone , an administration official who saw the encounter recalled hearing and it s very difficult to know why several times the president hugged the children whose fathers had died the grandparents of one of the dead , master sgt michael g heiser , a 35yearold communications specialist , gave mr clinton a picture of their grandson with the president last year at ramstein air base in germany sergeant heiser had given the president a small medal with the insignia of his unit mr clinton keeps a display of such medals behind his desk in the oval office and the photograph of their meeting had been on the mantelpiece in the grandparents' home the first service today took place on the sprawling eglin air force base , where 12 of the 19 men had been based in the front row of a huge air hangar were 11 men who survived the bombing they came to the service on foot , in wheelchairs , and in a few cases on hospital beds that were wheeled into the huge space our nomads have ceased their wandering , mr clinton said , a reference to the nickname of the 33rd fighter wing at eglin , which is responsible for keeping planes serviced and flying they have come home may god embrace their souls and may god bless america s mission of peace and freedom , for which they gave the last full measure of their devotion mr clinton steered clear today of any comment about security at the base in dhahran , saudi arabia , or about reports that the saudi government had not cooperated when the united states asked for a wider perimeter around the base but a survivor of the explosion , master sgt william sine , 39 , said he thought security was extra tight compared with his previous visits to the base he added that he had heard some talk about expanding the security perimeter before the explosion sergeant sine , a large man who wore a red beret to today s service here , said he had escaped with minor injuries because he had just left his suite in the building and was a few steps from the elevator air force officials said saturday that in a case of mistaken identity in the chaos after the bombing , they had initially told the family of one airman who had been killed that he was alive , but seriously injured , in a hospital in dhahran the mistake involved airman 1st class christopher b lester of pineville , w va air force officials said members of mr lester s unit had incorrectly believed that an injured airman , paul a blais , was mr lester mr blais s whereabouts had been listed as unknown since the explosion the confusion was not sorted out until friday evening , more than three days after the blast the air force sincerely regrets all hardship and pain caused to both families , the pentagon said photo at a service yesterday at eglin air force base in florida , president clinton hugged a relative of a victim of the bombing in saudi arabia \( reuters \)
before radio had formats or ratings , before drive time , before pop , or rock , or talk or shock jocks , it had classical music and just as radio has found a quiet place for itself in the cacophony of technological revolutions since 1906 , classical music is doing quite nicely in the arbitrondriven world of radio today the american radio systems corporation s recent agreement to pay 665 million for two of marlin broadcasting inc s radio stations and to retain their classical music format is only the latest sign that a tradition as old as radio can survive but classical music broadcasters say patience and hard work are required if you track the performance of classical over the past five years , you 'll see a steady increase of shares across the country , said steven dodge , the chairman and chief executive of american radio , which is based in boston and owns , or has agreements to acquire , a total of 63 stations none of the others with classical music there are so many formats in radio that when you 're in a niche format like this , it s a good place to be while many popularmusic stations bounce up and down in the ratings as they tinker with their formats , classical programming remains a stable moneymaker with a virtually guaranteed audience that is demographically attractive to advertisers we just agreed to advertise on classical music broadcasts for the first time in a long time , said dan haughton , director of marketing services at merrill lynch we 're doing this to show our support for the arts , and we feel it s a good way to reach a very affluent client base merrill lynch is sponsoring evening at the pops with skitch henderson , which the concert music network , a national satellite network , transmits to 35 affiliates robert unmacht of m street journal , an industry newsletter , said the number of commercial stations playing classical music had remained fairly steady over the last five years currently 39 , including wqrsfm in detroit and wflnfm in philadelphia , the stations that american radio bought from marlin the number of noncommercial stations with such programming has decreased somewhat , he said few cities have more than one commercial classical station chicago and san francisco each have two , while boston and the portland , me , area each have three in new york city , the only commercial station playing classical music is wqxrfm , owned by the new york times company the audience is also served by wnycfm , a noncommercial station which plays more than a dozen hours of classical music a day , and blocks of music on smaller stations if you go classical , you need a marketing strategy , you need to be in it for a long haul , you need to go after the better advertisers , said mr unmacht it s much easier to tell an agency , 'here s how many bodies we have ages 25 to 54 send us the ford spot , and the check' peter newman , the general manager and program director of one of the most successful classical stations , kingfm , in seattle , said if you look at where the big advertising money is , it is usually in beer and soft drinks classical owners have to consider how much money this format , with its bias , will be worth in a given market the programming format , meanwhile , is not monolithic we run our radio like a top 40 station , said howard tanger , the president and chief executive of marlin broadcasting it must be entertainment mr tanger said marlin stations run contests , golf tournaments and beethoven birthday parties marlin sold the two stations to american radio to provide liquidity for myself and my other stockholders , mr tanger said the company , which is based in boston , is repurchasing wtmifm , a classical station in the miami area , for 18 million mr tanger s father , alexander m tanger , owns and operates a classical station , wbqq , in kennebunkport , me his brother doug has wboqfm in gloucester , mass many other stations were founded in the 1940 s and 1950 s , with relatively small investments , by individuals dedicated to classical music classical music on the air predates commercial radio , back to when enrico caruso sang from the metropolitan opera house in a live broadcast in 1910 during the 1930 s , concerts were common , and in 1937 nbc formed its own symphony , led by arturo toscanini but as prices for stations have surged , many owners have been tempted to seek a more mainstream audience in new york city , for example , wncnfm , a classical music station , had a 17 share of the radio audience and could not crack the top 20 among adults 2554 now , as hard rock station waxq , it recently scored an arbitron rating of 62 among men 1834 , which places it third in the market , and its revenues are about 50 percent higher , said randy bongarten , the general manager the station was owned by gaf broadcasting during the makeover on march 15 , gaf sold it for 90 million to a small company that in turn traded it to viacom inc for three stations in seattle owners of classical stations have learned that they have to market the buying power of their audiences and persuade media buyers to look beyond the ratings if you 're strictly buying the numbers you 're not doing the job properly , said richard cotter , regional broadcast manager at j walter thompson kingfm , which is owned by classical radio inc , is one of the country s most successful classical stations , averaging about a 4 share over the last five years in seattle , a city that has emerged as a leader in pop music but the most profitable classical station in the country is wgmsfm in washington , said james duncan jr , the publisher of duncan s american radio , a trade paper the station has pretax earnings of close to 3 million on revenues of about 75 million it is owned by colfax communications inc wqxr , in new york , and kkgofm , which broadcasts in los angeles and is owned by mount wilson fm broadcasters inc , have similar revenues , he said , but higher marketing costs mr newman in seattle said his approach was to keep the programming clean and simple , concentrating on the music , without wine ratings and business reports the station has three tiers of music about 200 wellknown pieces that are broadcast once each month , a second tier of lesswellknown fare and a third of programming that is pleasant but without a strong presence i have a 40minute brahms symphony , but i'm not going to play it at 8 in the morning , mr newman said in the morning we play shorter , lighter things , as we do in the afternoon drive generally classical stations are optimistic as baby boomers age , classical programmers are hoping that their tastes will turn toward bach and away from the beatles , mr newman said the classical broadcasters are also testing the syndicated market marlin hopes to offer a worldwide classical music service sony worldwide networks has signed six affiliates since august , when it offered a classical format it

washington an inventor s combination wristwatch and pepper sprayer probably wo n't ever become a staple in james bond s cache of sophisticated covert weapons but william w moseley of mertztown , pa , is hoping that it will have broad appeal to ordinary people mr moseley is working with engineering and business students at lehigh university to develop a working prototype of the device , which was patented this month mr moseley said his invention would resemble an ordinary sports watch , with a wristband nearly two inches wide a replaceable cartridge with six shots of pepper spray would be mounted under the watch the main advantage of this , over carrying something in your pocket , is accessibility , mr moseley said it s where you need it , when you need it you do n't have to reach in your pocket or purse to find it mr moseley said he designed the device for the protection of cyclists , who do not usually wear clothes with pockets a person wearing the watch only has to slide a safety catch off the trigger , near the 1 o'clock position , and press down it s just like you 're going to look at the time on your watch , mr moseley said when you raise your forearm , your thumb is toward you the pepper sprays out away from you at the 12 o'clock position mr moseley , who plans to market the invention himself , hopes to find an investor to help finance testmarketing and production of the device mr moseley received patent number 5 , 516 , 005 a vinyl buoydiver to keep boats away before scuba divers plunge beneath the water , they usually mark their position with a redandwhite flag to signal boat operators to avoid the area but sometimes the flag is hard to spot , or boaters do not know what it means so ken s rumminger , an entrepreneur and recreational diver who lives in greenville , sc , has patented an inflatable vinyl buoy that looks like a diver popping up out of the water one of the buoydiver s hands is raised overhead , in an internationally recognized gesture signifying that a diver is ok the buoy also carries a sign caution , diver below the buoy can be inflated with a diver s air tank , and as long as the buoy is attached to ballast , it will stay upright , mr rumminger said he said he received about 400 orders for his buoy after demonstrating it at a diving show a year ago , though none of the orders have been in quantity i just did n't have 30 , 000 to pay for a minimum manufacturing order , he said now with patent in hand , he hopes to license the invention to a company or find a financial backer to begin production mr rumminger received patent 5 , 516 , 316 tattooed swimsuits of bare illusion tattoos seem to be popular these days with everyone from schoolchildren to the chicago bulls star forward dennis rodman now , kimberly a simmons , of salinas , calif , has received a patent for apparel including a swimsuit that when wet would seem as if it had been tattooed onto the swimmer s body according to the patent , such a swimsuit would be made of two types of material , both of which are opaque when dry one of the materials , preferably something like lycra in skintone colors , would appear transparent , the patent said the visible parts of the swimsuit , like shoulder straps , would not seem to have support , giving the tattooed effect the patent said that air pockets would have to be minimized to enhance the suit s disappearing act it may be necessary to have a lowcut appearance to avoid air pockets between the garment and the cleavage of wearer , the patent stated ms simmons received patent 5 , 515 , 542
manchester , nh the republican presidential contenders in new hampshire are showing grave signs of candidate wilt turn on the spotlight and they droop like overheated begonias some of the gleam is off the edge of the flower , nods john stabile , state republican chairman he was talking about steve forbes , whose fortunes seem to have gone especially droopy after a few glorious weeks when voters seemed to find his flat tax and visitorfromanotherplanet mystique entrancing , he is losing his standing as the fresh face to lamar alexander fresh faces are a particularly perishable commodity the world may not have yet noticed that mr alexander once invested a dollar in an option to buy a newspaper , and emerged from the deal with a 620 , 000 profit but if the former governor keeps moving up in the polls , the world will get an earful he makes hillary clinton look like a piker next time he plays the piano , it will probably be alexander s ragtime scam , sniped mr forbes the least spontaneous of candidates , he gives the impression of having practiced his insults in front of a mirror pat buchanan was having so much fun in his new incarnation as a wall streetbashing populist that the beltway native seemed to be developing a southern accent but last week he ascended to the status of potential frontrunner , and the light moved over to his campaign cochairman s connections to the militia movement and white supremacists mr buchanan tried simultaneously to exhibit loyalty \( he s mah friend \) and to distance himself from the problem another aide with white supremacist links quickly popped up in florida campaigning for president seems to be fun only if you have no chance of winning is n't this great , beamed representative bob dornan before the big debate if you are tracking at zero in the polls , you can go out there and brag about your committee assignment \( you 're looking at the chairman of military personnel ! \) , announce that bill clinton passed the most massive tax increase since the pharaohs and wake up the next morning none the worse for wear meanwhile , bob dole , who has not looked as if he was having fun in months , dispatched minions to argue that voters do not dislike him nearly as much as people say his negatives in new hampshire will improve once the primary is over , said an aide after the debate by then the candidate himself had gone home to prepare for a trip to the north country to admire some sled dogs , who struggled to run away when he tried to pet them mr alexander s people , of course , say their candidate will not droop under the pressure of being the reigning notdole , notbuchanan the exgovernor has been stumping new hampshire since last summer telling voters that he can do for the nation what he did for his increasingly prosperous home state \( mr alexander cannily refrains from calling it the tennessee miracle \) hard work , free trade , an educated work force and no more washington handouts are his general prescription as a sign of mr alexander s new stature , his campaign now has an accountant to answer questions about how his net worth rose from 150 , 000 to 1 million while he was governor and tennessee was pulling itself up by its bootstraps after tuesday s primary , the campaign will move south with fresh faces in very short supply unless the voters turn to the perpetually ignored but deeply available senator richard lugar eventually , the republicans will decide that there is one of these flawed packages they can learn to live with for proof that there is life after wilt , they just had to look across the snowbanks this weekend and spy bill clinton campaigning happily gail collins

queen of bohemia the life of louise bryant by mary v dearborn illustrated 365 pp boston houghton mifflin company 2495 i do wish sometimes i were as shallow as a louise bryant everything would be so simple this is a line of emma goldman s , written in 1922 her reference is to her own overwhelming sense of tragedy at the course of the bolshevik revolution , and to bryant s blithe response to the same events this is real disdain , not even personal but generic and since goldman was not alone among bryant s contemporaries in her opinion , mary v dearborn , the author of queen of bohemia the life of louise bryant and no disinterested scholar , sees the existence of a conspiracy of envy , meanspiritedness and gender politics to keep bryant from her rightful place in history ms dearborn contends that a great irony is at work here in spite of , or even because of , her great contemporary impact , her presence has barely been recorded by history recovering her story , ms dearborn promises , discovers a true 20thcentury heroine who has , ironically , been overlooked by traditional history and nearly lost to legend not so louise bryant s life is well documented but i also confess here to a weakness for emma goldman \( accused of many things , but never before of meanspiritedness to my knowledge \) , and also to an aversion to the promiscuous use of irony louise bryant was born in san francisco in 1885 and raised in nevada her social and economic circumstances were fairly marginal bryant \( she used her stepfather s name \) grew up to be a bold young woman , beautiful , smart , ambitious and inclined to scandalous behavior ms dearborn sees her as a natural freethinker struggling against the bonds of bourgeois morality in 1909 , after college , bryant went to portland , ore , where she landed a job on the weekly spectator , covering the doings of the city s elite that same year she married paul trullinger , a dentist from a rich , prominent family ms dearborn admits that his money and status were not unimportant to bryant for if louise was a freethinker , she could also be a bit of a social climber this is not , ms dearborn quickly adds , as contradictory as it seems at first consideration because as much as she wanted to be free of social convention , she recognized that it was easier to do so if you were thought to come from a 'good' background on one level , she could simply get away with a lot more on another , she had determined at an early age to improve her lot , and if vaulting ahead in class would enable her to do that more easily , she had no problem with it am i missing something here \? are there two kinds of social climber \? as a young matron , bryant maintained a separate studio in downtown portland , kept her job and gave martinidrinking and ethersniffing parties in her husband s office but she was restless she had made some connection to the world of radical bohemians through the woman suffrage movement , and also through portland s resident libertarian , charles erskine scott wood when john reed , who had been a protg of wood s , came to portland at the end of 1915 , bryant made a play for him he was already a celebrated radical journalist , dashing and romantic bryant was 31 , told him she was 27 , and gave him the strong impression that she was a woman who had achieved prodigious artistic and professional success they began a love affair and she soon left dr trullinger in her dust bryant joined jack reed in greenwich village in the first days of 1916 far from being lost to history , her life among the village radicals and bohemians shows up in many biographies of the period and has even made its way into the movie reds her tumultuous fouryear marriage to reed , her involvement with the provincetown players , her affairs with eugene o'neill and others \( she overcame o'neill s reluctance to betray his good friend by telling him that reed was impotent when jack confessed to a brief infidelity of his own , she became totally distraught and brought the marriage to a crisis , all the while continuing with her own affairs \) in august 1917 , a reconciled louise and jack sailed for russia from this trip came reed s classic ten days that shook the world and bryant s six red months in russia \( she was actually there only four months \) her book has gullible schoolgirl charm and inherent interest as a document , though it is not a serious work of reference ms dearborn , however , strains to take it very seriously referring to one of louise s typically hyperbolic assertions , she writes that it may seem like an overstatement it may even have seemed so to louise as she made it but , she adds , bryant may have found that to her delight and amazement it might well have been true to which one can only say , huh \? bryant came back from russia by herself , ahead of reed , and at once began an unsuccessful attempt to renew her affair with o'neill again ms dearborn offers one of her bemused analyses although her actions usually had an internal , idiosyncratic logic , at various points in her life they appear bizarre or inexplicable bryant was now a celebrated authority on soviet russia her book had been published , she was writing for the hearst papers and , in a political atmosphere increasingly hostile to bolshevism and homegrown radicals , she made speaking tours on behalf of the revolution and of woman suffrage jack reed died of typhus in moscow in 1920 bryant was with him at the end , soon to be comforted by none other than emma goldman after reed s death she continued as a journalist for a time \( ms dearborn tells us that bryant s observations in russia were more trustworthy than goldman s , since they were backed up by interviews with soviet officials themselves ! \) but her life had been shunted onto another track at the end of 1923 , when she was pregnant with their daughter , she married the very rich and social william bullitt ms dearborn is uneasy about this marriage has her heroine reverted to social climbing \? but was it really weakness to want to live well \? ms dearborn wonders though it seems at odds with her feminism , louise cannot be faulted for participating in a reigning ideology that assessed a woman s worth according to her husband s married to bullitt \( who thought she was 29 she was 38 by then \) , bryant lived the life of a rich man s wife houses , servants , parties , clothes she drank too much in paris , she began an affair with gwen le gallienne , a sculptor , and her marriage ended in a horrendous divorce she developed the rare and disfiguring dercum s disease she lost custody of her daughter she lost control of jack reed s papers in the end she was a pathetic paris character , telling stories of past and imagined glory in 1936 , at the age of 50 , she died in a 2anight hotel no special pleading is needed to write louise bryant s biography hers was a theatrical life , filled with drama and tragedy , fascinating people and great events it has an interestingly flawed protagonist in fact , it has been written before , by virginia gardner , whose research seems to form the basis of ms dearborn s book what is original with ms dearborn , the author of a life of henry miller , is some sort of feministradical agenda , but her arguments are so contorted \( mirthprovoking , even \) that they are a disservice to any political cause she might have in mind let s not even mention history or literature photo dorothy gallagher is the author of hannah s daughters sixgenerations of an american family , 18761976 and all the right enemies the life and murder of carlo tresca
almost two months after mayor rudolph w giuliani pledged to find a way to move 1 , 000 failing publicschool students to religious schools , not one student has been transferred , no contributions have been collected and there is not even a bank account for donations in fact , no one has agreed on how the students will be chosen , or who will do the choosing still , a small group of wall street executives and philanthropists is working , so far independently of city hall , to accomplish much of what the mayor envisioned the establishment of a charitable organization to raise tuition money from individuals , philanthropies and businesses and then shepherd some of the city s worst students out of public schools and into private and parochial schools i think it is premature to say much because there is not much to say , said peter flanigan , a director of the investment banking firm dillon , reed company , who has long been involved in raising tuition money for catholic schools the mayor obviously would still like to have it done a group of us are in general talks about doing it that is about as far as you can say the honesttogod truth is that we are a long way from having come to some agreement as to how to design and implement this program , he added we still do n't know whether this is going to become a reality much of the effort is being mounted by mr flanigan and two other prominent businessmen they are richard gilder , a stockbroker and the chairman of the gilder foundation , which has donated nearly 1 million to the city s catholic schools over the last decade \( he also pledged 17 million to the central park conservancy three years ago \) , and roger hertog , the president of sanford c bernstein company , the investment research and money management firm mr flanigan is the founder of the studentsponsor partnership , which lined up enough patrons to put 1 , 030 students through catholic schools this year all three are trustees of the manhattan institute , a conservative publicpolicy organization whose counsel the mayor has often sought none said they had decided how much money they would pledge to the effort , which is expected to cost more than 2 million a year we think we can raise the money , mr gilder said but no one has guaranteed it mr gilder quickly added i plan to contribute i would n't be caught dead not contributing it was during the first week of school , amid reports of severe overcrowding , that mr giuliani accepted a longtime offer from the archdiocese to take 1 , 000 publicschool students who rank among the lowest 5 percent in academic achievement the mayor , a product and champion of catholic education , raised the possibility of paying tuition with public money but within a day amended it to say the initiative would have to be paid for with private money , to avoid a constitutional challenge he also said that other religious and nondenominational schools would be welcome to participate richard schwartz , the mayor s senior adviser , said yesterday that he had since spoken with catholic , orthodox jewish , lutheran and baptist schools , which all expressed interest in accepting students the figure of 1 , 000 students came from what the archdiocese estimates as its number of empty seats currently , 108 , 000 students attend archdiocese schools in manhattan , staten island and the bronx , with an additional 74 , 000 in brooklyn and queens diocese schools a spokeswoman for the archdiocese schools , nora murphy , said the archdiocese still expected to have room for 1 , 000 students next year while the catholic schools begin fall registration in january , ms murphy said the archdiocese would make every effort to accept the scholarship students as late as next summer we are still waiting for specifics to come from the mayor s office , ms murphy said mr schwartz said that a formal announcement of the program remained several months away and that much of the planning was so far being done by mr flanigan and others working outside city hall we are in conversation with them , mr schwartz said but this is a privatesector effort , no question about that , a private sector effort that was in response to a challenge laid out by the mayor all the individuals who have expressed interest in this program have said that they would like to do this in a way that is consistent with the mayor s vision , he added still , a number of questions remain , like whether the program will be open only to high school students , or to all , a far more costly proposition over the long term and how the students will be identified , given that schools chancellor rudy crew has announced he will not provide city hall with a list of the lowestperforming students mr gilder said he understood that many parents , and the schools themselves , were eager to hear the answers to such questions but , he said , to do things right takes time

hempstead , li , feb 29 the jets , demonstrating how a lowly football team can immediately gain respect in the world of free agency , awarded the largest contract in their history today and landed quarterback neil o 'donnell from the super bowl runnerup pittsburgh steelers and all it took was money , the promise of better times and some stroking for a 29yearold who nearly led pittsburgh to the sport s biggest prize a month ago the jets lured o 'donnell away from the steelers , the other team he was considering , with a fiveyear deal worth 25 million , including a signing bonus of 7 million that he will receive up front as part of his 85 million salary this year the package makes o 'donnell the fourthhighest paid player in the national football league for the jets , it was the latest and the largest of three financial commitments they have made in the span of 15 days as they continue to remake their team earlier this month they signed two offensive tackles , david williams and jumbo elliott , to contracts worth a combined 27 million in a very short period of time , we have strengthened our football team , jets coach rich kotite said after six years i can come here in the prime of my career , said o 'donnell , still appearing stunned by the sudden change in his fortunes as well as a change in heart for as late as 7 o'clock wednesday night he had decided to remain in pittsburgh , flipflopping from his position of the night before when his agent , leigh steinberg , had wheedled this enormous contract out of the jets not bad for a performer picked in the third round in 1990 out of maryland yet , o 'donnell had changed his mind on wednesday he wondered about leaving a successful team in pittsburgh , which had made four straight playoff appearances , to join a team with a recent history of misery , and he wondered about leaving the coaches and teammates he had befriended but at his madison , nj , home late wednesday , o 'donnell was joined by his wife , leslie , steinberg and a family friend to discuss the pros and cons o 'donnell still said he did not want to leave steinberg called the steelers again pittsburgh s last offer was for an average of about 4 million a year and was , in reality , even farther below the 5 million average the jets offered contracts are not guaranteed except for signing bonuses the steelers' bonus offer was 4 million , meaning o 'donnell would get 3 million less this year if o 'donnell were to take the steelers' money , steinberg pointed out , in a few years they could be in salary cap trouble , which could make him expendable o 'donnell also wondered whether the steelers were a team on the rise , as the jets are trying mightily to be despite appearing in a super bowl only 32 days ago , the steelers are dramatically changed they have lost right tackle leon searcy to free agency , may lose linebacker kevin greene and have dismissed three coaches , including the offensive coordinator ron erhardt , now with the jets the four people at o 'donnell s house voted he became a jet at midnight , toasting the decision with vodka and cranberry juice at 12 15 this morning , steinberg telephoned steve gutman , the jets' president for their money , the jets get a player in his prime , coming off his best season true , he was surrounded by what could be considered the best cast in the american conference the last two years , and this probably played a role in the steelers' lower offer also , the steelers' hierarchy believes that it has a fine quarterback in the thirdyear player jim miller still , o 'donnell has got the job done four straight appearances in the playoffs , including the conference title game for the 1994 season , and then a super bowl appearance last season in which the steelers came close to defeating the dallas cowboys before falling , 277 o 'donnell threw two costly interceptions in that game , and that may have tempered the public perception of his accomplishments o 'donnell s career wonlost record as a starter is 3922 his career interception percentage is the lowest of any active quarterback his touchdowntointerception ratio is 6839 a haggard gutman pronounced the deal for o 'donnell as being made for the millions and millions of jets fans who are waiting for our team to come back reflecting on the frantic negotiations in which he was able to lure a quarterback from a super bowl team to one with football s worst record , 313 , gutman said , i thought after 19 years in this business , i had seen everything the bonuses for o 'donnell , elliott and williams can be prorated for salarycap purposes still , the jets have already committed about 7 percent of their available salaries over the next few years just to bonuses to the three new players , none younger than 29 if the team does not win within two years , say , it could find itself in an unhappy position of being saddled with a limited budget they jets picked up 125 million against the salary cap by releasing the backup quarterback bubby brister , who started several games in place of boomer esiason last season , and linebacker wilbur marshall the team had already made clear it would not try to resign esiason glenn foley , who will not be totally recovered from a surgically repaired shoulder until the season starts , will be the backup kotite conceded that the team still needed to get quality receivers the jets , of course , still have the overall top pick in the draft , and may select keyshawn johnson , the receiver from southern california o 'donnell , meanwhile , remained wistful about the steelers we were one drive away from winning , he said but i thought about what was best for me and my family he said he had always thought of playing in the meadowlands he grew up a short ride away in madison as a giants fan but he said he had been watching the jets closely i saw how they hired ron erhardt , he said at a news conference in the jets' auditorium i watched a little longer and saw how they got two big tackles i grew up here i know about the hype , the media it s been a very stressful time , he said i wanted to make my decision so , let s go , green and

prague , april 4 the american davis cup team , like so many americans of late , has come to prague to the czechs , that would normally mean a chance to get a closeup look at pete sampras or andre agassi , jim courier or michael chang unfortunately for the autograph hounds in the old town square today , none of those american tennis stars committed to this quarterfinal match against the czech republic sampras , last year s davis cup hero , and chang are heading for asia courier wants to get his claycourt game in high gear agassi wants to save his strength and patriotic passion for the olympics this summer but the effect in prague is palpable ticket sales , already hurt because this match occurs over the easter holidays , have been sluggish at the somber sports hall here , a blocklike structure in the midst of a city filled with fanciful baroque curves , organizers predict there will be no more than 6 , 000 people in the 12 , 000seat arena for friday s opening singles matches a subdued atmosphere could be good news for the american no 1 , todd martin , who will face the czech no 2 , petr korda , in the opening match , and for the american no 2 , malivai washington , who will face the czech no 1 , daniel vacek but even if the crowd is not a major factor , the absence of the top four americans means the captain , tom gullikson , and his dedicated band could end up being upset before getting the chance to defend the title his team won so dramatically in moscow last december i knew this second round would be a difficult one to recruit for , gullikson said i'm just very thankful these guys committed because they are quality players in truth , the situation is reminiscent of what happened in 1993 to the former captain tom gorman s team , which was upset in the first round after the top americans declined to make the trip to australia certainly , martin , ranked no 17 in the world , and washington , ranked 19th , are hardly chopped liver gullikson also has a potentially strong doubles combination in patrick galbraith and patrick mcenroe , who won their first davis cup match together in the 1996 firstround victory over mexico but mcenroe is nursing a sore shoulder martin and washington are both familiar with and fond of fast indoor surfaces , and the supreme court here certainly qualifies martin reached the final of the grand slam cup in germany on a similar surface last december but whatever happens in prague , martin may already have turned in the finest performance of the week during a united states team dinner monday night , martin began complaining to gullikson of stomach pains , and once the players returned to the hotel and began playing cards , he complained again , stumbled into the hallway and collapsed the united states team physician , george fareed , rushed to martin s side and solemnly declared that it was probably food poisoning meanwhile , martin was wincing and holding his knee and yelling about a fracture , which fareed soon confirmed as well tom was white , fareed said that was when martin yelled , april fool s ! they got me , gullikson said but i 'll get them back

picture the scene it s a glorious sunday in summer the sun is shining , a comforting breeze is making patterns in the waves at the mouth of the connecticut river and in a small boat there , a family of three mother , father , young son are fishing idyllic , right \? not even close it s actually summer at its wackiest the little boat was anchored smack in the center of the channel , which all sizable boats must use going into or coming from long island sound , and was being tossed about by the wake of much bigger boats and much more powerful boats zooming around on both sides of it somehow , the three people in the tiny boat , none of whom was wearing a life jacket , seemed oblivious to their peril they just kept tossing and turning and fishing until an officiallooking boat pulled up alongside and ryan healy yelled at them to fish somewhere else , nearer shore , and get out of the channel now it s a wonder they were n't swamped , mr healy said or flipped over when one of the bigger boats passing so close caught a rope on them and that would have meant one more river tragedy mr healy is a conservation officer with the state department of environmental protection on a recent sunday he and another conservation officer , james wolfe , were the crew on what might be considered the department s flagship , a 35foot lobster boat for which the state paid nothing the boat was formerly owned by a lobsterman in stamford who made a major tactical error he objected to the stamford marine police insisting that he obey lobstering laws one day , so the story goes , he rammed the police boat with his lobster boat that upset the police so much that they arrested him and obtained his boat in a forfeiture action then stamford gave the boat to the dep a great many people in connecticut , including many boaters , do not realize that the department , usually associated with parks and forests , also has jurisdiction in state waters some boaters find this out to their dismay when they are stopped for various infractions on rivers , lakes and long island sound and handed citations calling for hefty fines examples 120 for reckless boating , 420 for boating while intoxicated both mr healy and mr wolfe are former professional lobstermen and mr healy also worked for several years on a charter fishing boat they know the power and danger of water and it upsets them that many boaters do not share their respect for it indeed , sometimes show derision we get a lot of lip , said mr healy people ask us what we really do for a living we 've been called water nazis the big problem in enforcing regulations about behavior on water , said mr wolfe , is the water itself something happens to people when they get on water , he explained it s sort of party time stop them and they 'll talk to you with a beer can in one hand can you imagine anyone being stopped by a state trooper on a highway and chatting with a beer can in his hand ! both men will emphasize that their rather low opinions of people met on the water applies only to a small minority of them , the ones they get to know best because they stop them and question them , and sometimes arrest them ninety percent of boating people are law abiding , said mr healy it s that minority that gets their goat they all lie , said mr healy you ask some guy for his safe boating certificate and he 'll say it s back at the marina so you check his name through the computer and find out he never did get a certificate and you tell him that he laughs it s a big game with these people and some of them use all sorts of deceptions to evade state safety regulations , he added one of the regulations is that a boat pulling a water skier must have a spotter , someone on board to watch the skier as a safety measure one boater on the connecticut river , mr healy said , has been circumventing the regulation by having a blowup doll sitting in his boat he has n't apprehended the boater or the blowup doll yet but it is high on his priority list a couple of hours on a sunday on a dep patrol boat on the connecticut river would convince even the most skeptical person that it s sometimes a very strange world out there and that it is fortunate someone is around to keep order among highlights on one recent day the cabin cruiser that lost power and had to be pulled back to a marina by a towing company , ruining the day for three fishing buddies but helping make the day for the nearest tow boat , an active and very competitive business on the river and sound these days the nine college students jammed into a small speedboat who seemed to regard a ticket for reckless boating overcapacity , insufficient lifejackets , creating a wake in a nowake area as a major inconvenience to their fun the family fishing expedition in the channel , of course , because of its potential for tragedy by the middle of july this year two drowning deaths had been recorded in the connecticut river , tying the total for last year the first was that of a 16yearold west hartford boy who either fell from or was knocked off his motorboat by a wave after an intensive search on the water and along its banks his body was finally recovered the second was that of a 51yearold rocky hill man who evidently fell off his boat during that search neither the man nor the boy had been wearing a life jacket the two deaths also followed a july 4 headon crash of two boats in the river , resulting in eight people being rushed to hospitals and a consensus that it was miraculous no one was killed
denver , nov 16 come to this city , look around , flip on the radio , and there are constant reminders of where you are you have just entered john elway country drive 30 miles outside the city to the broncos' spiffy headquarters and there is no mistaking where you are near the broncos' complex are two huge john elway car dealerships enter the broncos' offices and what greets you \? a largerthanlife mural in the lobby , a picture of john elway with his feet inside mile high stadium it is an awesome sight , 20 yards long and more than 13 yards tall that is more than three first downs' worth of elway you have just entered john elway s team there is nothing like this of jerry rice in san francisco s headquarters nothing like this of barry sanders in detroit nothing like this of troy aikman in dallas and the surprising thing \? in football , where the team concept is preached , the broncos have placed elway front and center without even a thought that it would create jealousy in the locker room in an era when pro football players display huge egos and a mefirst attitude and even become sensitive to which players are featured on their teams' media guide covers , the broncos players do not give his special treatment in the lobby a second thought i think what the denver broncos are saying is that they are going to give john elway his cake and his coffee , too , and let him enjoy it right now , while he is playing , said broncos defensive tackle jumpy geathers all of the players here recognize that and john makes them comfortable with it i have played with big stars before earl campbell , ken stabler and art monk , some of the greatest players in league history john is the best at handling his stardom he gets on the treadmill like everyone else he lifts weights like everyone else if i want to eat with him , i say , 'john , let s go eat' some stars , you have to make an appointment with running back terrell davis said john elway is actually larger than life here and he makes it work because he does n't step on toes and the broncos' owner , pat bowlen , said john elway is the constant here he is synonymous with the denver broncos it is very hard to imagine that john would be anywhere else but in denver who else would we put up there in the lobby \? there have only been a half a dozen players in this league who have ever meant to their franchise what he means to us it just does n't happen bowlen has made sure that elway , denver s quarterback since 1983 , will be a bronco for his career he recently signed elway to a fiveyear contract through the year 2000 for 295 million that is , indeed , putting your money where your mouth is and not a bad deal for a 36yearold quarterback let s get a few things straight about john elway he can be impatient , unaccommodating and rude he can be insensitive and a prima donna he has never won a super bowl and , in fact , has lost three of them and , of course , he is not in the hall of fame not yet , anyway john elway is human but you would not know that here here , he has been placed on a pedestal a mile high and the people here say that is just where he belongs he is more a symbol of perfection and success in this city and in the state of colorado than michael jordan is in the united states he has been a giant in community service he has been a giant on the field look at what john elway has done for the city , for the state , for our team , for the national football league , said safety steve atwater you just ca n't put it in words he is the man the players feel we are all important here but none of us feel we would be in this position if it were not for john elway denver is sitting in a pretty position now it has the best record \( 91 \) in the nfl it plays at the new england patriots \( 73 \) sunday , and elway is 80 against them , including a playoff victory in 1986 elway views the hoopla surrounding him with a shrug i do not look at things the way other people do at all , elway said i'm just a cog in the machine the picture in the lobby , my teammates rarely enter through there so they do n't see it that much i'm not part of management and i do n't have anything to do with that well , that is a dance if there ever was one if he did not want it there , do you think it would stay \? let s just say i'm proud that they think of me that way and they think enough of me to do that , elway said i do n't think my teammates have a problem with it i'm in a great situation here and i let my teammates know that we 've got a mature football team we 've got great chemistry they 've got elway he is king of fourthquarter comeback victories with 40 he leads all active quarterbacks in games with 200 he has more victories \( 122 \) since 1983 than any other quarterback he has more home victories \( 78 \) than any other quarterback since '83 with three more rushes , he breaks randall cunningham s record of 677 rushing attempts by a quarterback this is what his teammates said elway plays with a big heart , a big arm and is a very accurate passer he can scramble and make big plays in the clutch there are no negatives so maybe this is why elway enjoys the stature he does here , especially among his teammates in the pressurecooker world of the nfl , he takes the pressure off them no matter how badly they may do , there is always a chance that he can cover for them john elway has respect because he has earned it , and it did not come from any picture in the lobby , denver coach mike shanahan said but john knows he cannot do it all alone this is a business about developing relationships as much as talent , and this is a team that knows they always have each other in each one s corner credit shanahan for that he gave the denver defense a jolt by signing free agents , including linebacker bill romanowski , end alfred williams and tackle michael dean perry he drafted davis , who in his second pro season reached 2 , 000 career rushing yards faster than any other bronco rusher denver is the nfl s no 1 rushing team denver owns 32 sacks , second in the american conference , while allowing only 18 denver is first in the league in thirddown conversions \( 497 percent \) , which indicates a strong running game and sparkling playcalling by shanahan no wonder denver is 91 denver has a lot and it has elway john feels like he does n't have to carry the entire load , that with a defense and a running game now that a lot of the pressure is off him , and that is allowing him to play more freely and make even more things happen , bowlen said he thinks we can go all the way all the way to the super bowl and win and if the broncos keep rolling , they will get homefield advantage through the playoffs in two seasons under shanahan , denver is 122 at home , 60 this season i 've been able to stay healthy and we 've been able to stay focused , elway said i do n't think about pressure i think about making plays and winning sure , it would be great to make the playoffs and know that you would play every game at home in elway country photo john elway is practically an institution in denver , and a fiveyear , 295 million contract insures that things will stay that way into the year 2000 \( associated press \)
ben bianchi pollockkrasner house and study center , 830 fireplace road , east hampton to july 28 by appointment , 3244929 in a departure from presentations of art related to the pollock years , this historic site features 1995 collages by ben bianchi , a friend and onetime neighbor of lee krasner over the years , visitors have noted an intriguing , surreal assemblage by mr bianchi that ms krasner had placed rather centrally in her parlor mr bianchi tried to infuse the collages with visual and mental energy by layering torn fragments of his watercolors , drawings and prints with a miscellany of commercial and periodical papers original gestural markings in his recycled art now appear abruptly truncated by their new , accidentally determined boundaries , and this contributes to the busy dynamics there is a reminder here of ms krasner s tearing and reusing of her earlier work , but mr bianchi chooses a broader palette , bringing in lettering from printed matter and images conjuring sight and sound impressions , particularly of new york s chinatown , the location of his last studio a scrap of medical chart in one collage serves as a reminder that this is , in a sense , a memorial exhibition mr bianchi died in march at age 62 after a long illness he had worked on the collages while recuperating from surgery a concurrent presentation calls attention to a single painting , a collaborative work by jackson pollock , william baziotes and gerome kamrowski , that resonates with historical significance it brings visitors back to an evening in 1941 when mr baziotes brought pollock to mr kamrowski s studio and the three decided to experiment with some quickdrying paint developed for commercial purposes a principal interest was finding a freer way of applying paint to go further with the psychic automatism that they had been recently discussing with the surrealist painter matta they tried dripping , pouring and flinging the loosely flowing material the result is a dark surface bearing bold biomorphic shapes activated by overlapping lines of varying widths lines alternately strike a course , then swirl and loop unpredictibly , inviting the eye through a maze of visual discovery where these energetic strands loop into the canvas s black areas , they eliminate the separation between image and background and suggest the shifting ambiguities that were so important to subsequent phases of abstraction this is the one surviving work from that evening it is on loan from mr kamrowski s daughter coenties slip artists now and then elise goodheart fine arts , 61 island view drive , sag harbor to july 14 7255764 more than 30 years ago , charles hinman physically altered the picture plane with concave convex canvases , and agnes martin turned rhythmic gestures into a mesmerizing repetitive order both were among a group renting studios on coenties slip , at that time an inexpensive and forgotten part of old new york s commercial waterfront their work , along with that of their neighbors joe cali , robert indiana , ellsworth kelly , fred mitchell , lenore tawney and jack youngerman , is the subject of this modest but historically sound overview comparisions between that period and recent work suggest that most have continued to grow within the formal areas they defined while at coenties slip , although this is not the comprehensive show that would be necessary to examine the question fully perhaps the greatest shift appears in the remarkable pieces by ms tawney her 1967 shield is a partfirm , partpliable form of feathers and fiber that emphasizes the expressive handling of materials the 1996 assemblage shrine xv uses a puffy , toylike animal anchored in a grid of blue wires to deliver a conceptual message about a hightechnology world there are obvious shifts , too , in some fine pieces by mr kelly , who has continued to research minimalist dynamics , and by mr mitchell , who now softens edges and tones , infusing them with light to add a shimmering quality to a rich , densely painted surface mr indiana s sixfoot sculpture love now seems like an icon of its day this and the artist s several other examples make strong additions to the presentation conrad marcarelli vered gallery , 68 park place passage , east hampton to july 11 3243303 in this wonderful selection of primarily black and white collages , 1956 1996 , mr marcarelli looks his best as good , perhaps , as he did in his whitney museum show in 1967 it may be significant that just 6 of the 15 pieces here are dated after that show , and it is undoubtedly significant that the gallery has hung none of the late60 s collages with strap motifs , which , in retrospect , seem to have slowed the surface interactions it should be noted , however , that two works from the 70 s make substantial contributions to the show windmill , a smashing 11foot burst of diagonal energy , functions in the area between worldly image and abstract emblem figures provides a sense of texture , unravelling material and handcrafting its adaptation of grommets as a visual motif also encourages a play between a factual reading and pure abstraction a complex inventory of ideas runs throughout the exhibition most impressive is the use of perceptual forces as a subject in the best example , october , dots of differing sizes behave like stains , blurring and spreading as if they were seeking their own boundaries while all relate , each is held within its own unit it is the variety of approaches to creating units , or fragments , that also makes an impact these segments establish order , but at the same time the torn edges introduce a sense of the accidentally determined shape other works stand out for the way they consider questions of weight , movement and the layering of seemingly flat forms in different planes most of the work has held its force , urgency and power well over the years the bolder examples that are close to the interests of younger artists may even have gained in stature photos top and right , conrad marcarelli and ben bianchi collages below , indiana s yield brother samuel , and pollockkamrowskibaziotes

day after day for nearly a week this month , hundreds of people parents with children , grandparents with their children s children , children by themselves ambled through the cavernous livestock barn at the tioga county fair in owego , ny they admired the horses' elegant manes and mooed back at the cows some petted a 6monthold goat being exhibited by a 4h club member one child shared cotton candy with it by the final day of the fair on aug 10 , the little goat was shaking and sickly the girl who owned it was worried it could barely stand on its young , spindly legs later , it bit her last week , it was killed after it was determined the goat had rabies , a disease that kills thousands of domestic animals and several people each year worldwide since then , health officials have been conducting the largest rabies vaccination effort in new york state history so far , more than 2 , 000 people have called a rabies emergency phone line , \( 607 \) 6878563 , and 345 were found to have had enough risk of exposure to have begun a painful cycle of rabies shots some people may have been exposed to the disease by a friendly lick on a hand that already had an innocuous cut dr barbara debuono , the state health commissioner , and other health officials said that once symptoms appear it is too late rabies symptoms typically take one to three months to develop but the goat presented special problems because rabies is rarely seen in that animal if you 're talking about when the goat was shedding virus , dr debuono said , they 're not sure on the latency for goats they assumed that the goat was infectious from july 29 forward jim howe of owego said that his 11yearold daughter , kendra , had been bitten by the goat , which was mostly brown but had blackandwhite markings this one was sucking on her finger like a young animal will , mr howe said it backed away and when she reached for it again , it nipped her thumb the first thing she did was put her finger in her mouth , which is about the worst thing you can do she was n't too happy about having to get the shots , but she acted very calm through the whole thing deborah berry of newark valley , ny , said her 9yearold daughter , jessie , remembers seeing the goat but not whether she petted it i'm trying not to panic here , ms berry said i'm frustrated i 've been worried for days nancy mathewson , a day care director from newark valley , took 33 children to the fair as a treat she has talked with the children twice , but few can recall what animals they petted never in my wildest dreams did i imagine this , she said none of my parents are panicking they 're staying calm , but it s not like getting the measles as soon as the rabies diagnosis was confirmed by the state health department , which examined the dead goat s head in a laboratory in albany , doctors from surrounding counties and the state health department descended on tioga county to handle calls to the rabies phone line they also set up five clinics for potential rabies victims under the direction of two representatives of the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta then came the challenge of screening people who may have seen the goat and deciding whether they should be vaccinated if you were just walking by the goat , that constitutes no risk , dr debuono said if you put your hand out and the goat licked your hand , that s a much higher risk officials say that as many as 25 , 000 people , roughly equal to half the population of tioga county , visited the fair , held in the marvin park section of owego , about 25 miles west of binghamton the scramble to find out who had been exposed to the goat led to what officials say is the largest postexposure treatment for rabies in the state s history in 1994 , an autopsy showed that a sullivan county girl had died of rabies fiftyfive people who had seen her in the weeks before her death were given rabies shots the goat had a strain of rabies that infects raccoons , suggesting that it might have been bitten by a raccoon before the fair opened we do n't know where the raccoon came into contact with the goat , dr debuono said raccoons are certainly not shy about coming into proximity with people and much more aggressive if they are rabid she said that the vaccines are expensive about 1 , 000 a person and that her agency would reimburse the county health department for at least some of the cost health officials have withheld the name of the goat s owner , citing patient confidentiality laws , and they have also refused to release the name of the goat , saying it could be traced to the family colleen deweywright , a 4h project coordinator , said that all the animals in the livestock barn had passed a veterinarian s inspection before the fair began she said that 4h required vaccinations for the cows , and that any animal showing any signs of illness was sent home she said the goat appeared to be healthy until the last day of the fair , although kristine a smith , a health department spokeswoman , said that it had stopped eating two days before that , which is unusual dr debuono said that 600 cases of rabies had been identified in new york state this year map of new york showing location of the tioga county fair
lubbock , tex , march 7 as george bush might say if he were running for president this year , the action should now be switching from the big apple to the big enchilada to texas , with its 123 republican delegates , the most of any state so far in the battle for the republican nomination the problem is , none of the candidates , except for bob dole , have taken much of a bite at this point , five days before tuesday s primary consequently , the senator is running far ahead in the polls and is widely expected to score an easy victory of the surviving candidates , only senator dole has used any television advertisements here over the last few weeks not that he himself has been around much when his plane swooped into austin on tuesday so the candidate could collect the endorsement of mr bush s son , gov george w bush , it marked only the second time the senator had visited texas since declaring for president but in a strategy switch that adds some drama to the contest , patrick j buchanan announced today that he would curtail his time in florida , which also votes on tuesday , for a bigcity blitz in texas that even mr buchanan argued was aimed less at winning here than at trying to hold mr dole s majority to below 50 percent , the point at which a candidate wins all of a texas congressional district s three delegates mr buchanan admitted today at a campaign stop in jackson , tenn , it s going to be tough to do and in a bizarre twist , mr buchanan s bid could be helped by senator phil gramm , who has dropped out of the race and thrown his support to mr dole mr gramm s name remains on the presidential ballot , and he is advertising heavily for his senate reelection bid , not that he faces any major competition so senator gramm just might gain 5 to 10 percent or even more in the presidential primary , either as a protest vote or because some voters will be confused and think he texan is still in the presidential race bill miller , an austin political consultant , said the buchanan strategy was to exploit mr gramm s presence on the ballot they 're playing the percentages against gramm here , and that s a smart play for them , he said under texas s formula for allotting delegates , mr buchanan could get as many as a few dozen delegates by holding mr dole below 50 percent in as many districts as possible and scoring more than 20 percent in certain districts the most recent texas poll , released this week by the university of texas s office of survey research , showed mr dole with the support of 45 percent of republican voters , followed by mr buchanan at 20 percent and lamar alexander , who has since dropped out and backed mr dole , with 10 percent in the lubbock area , a republican bastion that gave president bush 60 percent of the vote in 1992 compared with bill clinton s 23 percent , the sentiment among many likely republican voters clearly leaned toward mr dole though most said they would vote with a sense of resignation instead of enthusiasm and many said they were bothered that by the sharply narrowed field i wish we had more choices , said 44yearold pat cross , a sales associate in lubbock i was kind of interested in lamar alexander , but i never could find out much about him every time i saw him on television , he was just playing that piano and now he s gone anyway ms cross said she would probably wind up voting for mr dole , as did patsy strawn , 48 , a lubbock homemaker i think i can learn to be comfortable with him , mrs strawn said as she shopped the other evening at the south plains mall in lubbock still , mr buchanan is clearly capable of making inroads here in some cases even splitting the vote within families susan dyess , 33 , a secretary and another shopper at the mall , said she had already cast a ballot for mr dole under texas s earlyvoting procedures i like dole , all his experience , being in washington and all that , she said but her husband , george , 32 , holding his wife s hand as he spoke , said he had voted for mr buchanan , mainly because of his stand on trade and immigration the man says things that need to be said , he said he reflects a lot of stuff that people feel but that no one else is saying mr dole enjoyed at least one unabashed supporter among those in the mall i'm for dole and i'm enthusiastic , said betty turner , 68 , a clerk in the 'tis christmas boutique he has the experience , he s been there , and he can handle any situation that comes up television advertising in texas s two dozen major media markets can cost a small fortune , and the national spokeswoman for the man who has one , steve forbes , said tonight that mr forbes planned a substantial buy of tv time in texas , though she could not provide figures mr forbes s state chairwoman here , diana denman , said she was still waiting to hear from the new jersey headquarters about advertising purchases but , noting that more than 1 , 000 texans had called the candidate s tollfree number to see how they could help the campaign , she said i think it s wideopen for forbes in texas right now johnny bowen , an east texas pathologist who is mr buchanan s state cochairman here , was equally optimistic for his campaign we certainly do n't have the backing that senator dole has , we do n't have endorsements of our senators or governor , he said in a telephone interview but we have the grassroots support aides to mr buchanan said they hoped that a strong showing here would give him momentum going next month into several key midwestern states , an industrial heartland

the itt sheraton corporation and the hilton hotels corporation are each involved in discussions with the bally entertainment corporation about a possible merger , according to people close to the negotiations none of the companies would comment on the reports , but bally s share price gained 3625 yesterday , or 20 percent , to 21625 joseph v coccimiglio , a senior analyst at dean witter reynolds , said he expected bally would fetch 24 to 26 a share should it agree to a sale , which he said it might not there s a lot at stake for them , he added they have to compare the money they can get today with the money they can get by going it alone at those prices , the whole company would be valued at 26 billion to 28 billion that includes the assumption of bally s debt , which totals upward of 1 billion the stock has been actively traded in the last few days typically about 500 , 000 shares trade daily , but on both friday and monday , more than one million shares traded , and yesterday the volume soared to more than 46 million at yesterday s close of 21625 , the stock was up 32 percent in one week itt sheraton , a subsidiary of the itt corporation , and hilton are the two largest hotelcasino companies they have made no secret in recent years about wanting to acquire other gambling operations , and bally s name has periodically popped up three years ago , before itt jumped into the casino business , it had bally s park place in atlantic city in its sights instead , it bought the desert inn properties in las vegas , nev , for about 160 million then in 1994 itt paid 17 billion for caesars world , which owned casinos in las vegas , atlantic city and lake tahoe , nev caesars also operates four resorts in the pocono mountains of pennsylvania two months ago , after bally announced fourthquarter earnings , dean witter reynolds suggested that bally , which is based in chicago , might be a target for either itt , hilton or mgm grand and two days ago dean witter suggested that bally would be a good fit for itt specifically yesterday , dan dorfman of cnbc reported that itt and bally were in highlevel talks on a possible acquisition of bally itt and hilton both have mostly highend gaming , mr coccimiglio said and because bally is more of a midmarket company that derives the majority of its revenues from slot machines , it s not as volatile as having to depend on high rollers so the acquisition would reduce the volatility of itt s or hilton s gaming cash flow if itt bought bally , mr coccimiglio said , it would increase its sizable lead as a hotel and casino company in addition , bally owns the land that is blocking a 608room expansion planned for caesars a hilton acquisition would not only narrow itt s lead , it would also give hilton , which is based in los angeles , a longdesired presence in atlantic city two months ago hilton hired stephen f bollenbach , a longtime hotelcasino executive , as its chief executive , and soon afterward he said he would not split hilton into separate hotel and casino companies at the moment hilton might appear to have its hands full it is already involved in discussions with ladbroke group plc , the british company that owns the right to the hilton name outside the united states hilton also said yesterday that it was exploring whether to pay to complete the stalled harrah s jazz casino in new orleans , which is in bankruptcylaw proceedings it said it would decide within two weeks whether it wanted to offer financing in return for operating the casino itt is also interested in the project harrah s entertainment inc of memphis has an exclusive contract with louisiana to build and operate the state s only nonindian , landbased casino hilton said bondholders for the project had approached the company about completing and managing the partly built casino in downtown new orleans mr bollenbach of hilton said the plan under discussion would probably have bondholders owning the casino and hilton managing it
fall is always a frenetic season for the state legislature , but this year , its members face an especially daunting task both houses are supposed to put the finishing touches on a courtordered plan to equalize spending in new jersey s poorest and wealthiest school districts and they must work fast the state supreme court is awaiting the legislature s proposal , which was originally due this month two weeks ago , the court extended the deadline to dec 31 , acknowledging that the lawmakers were making progress but much remains to be ironed out , and much of the work will fall to two men senator john h ewing , a republican from somerset county , and assemblyman john a rocco , a republican from camden county , are the chairmen of the education committees in their respective chambers they are in charge of negotiating a compromise between the two houses and the whitman administration , which means whittling three complicated proposals down to one the debate has grown increasingly partisan , and the growing tension between the republicans \( who control both houses \) and the democrats makes the situation even more challenging for mr ewing and mr rocco , the coming months will involve hours of closeddoor meetings with the republican leadership and officials from the governor s office and the education department they two men will take phone calls and read letters from dozens of school officials , parents and interest groups who want the plan to serve them well and they will undoubtedly referee quarrels between other legislators who find fault with the details the goal is to end new jersey s heavy reliance on property taxes to pay for education , thereby leveling the playing field in poor districts like camden and rich ones like princeton governor whitman and the education commissioner , leo f klagholz , have put forth a plan that would define with statewide curriculum standards the thorough and efficient education the state constitution requires mrs whitman has said her standards would cost each district roughly 7 , 200 a student annually , and any district that spent more would have to raise the extra money through property taxes affluent districts are alarmed by the possibility that they will have to either take an ax to their budgets or raise taxes astronomically to pay for programs the state considers excessive meanwhile , lawyers for the education law center in newark , the group that has represented the state s poor districts in court for two decades , say none of the current proposals are acceptable because they do not address the court s original order to raise the spending level in the 30 poorest districts to that in the 125 wealthiest here is a look at the two men in charge of fixing one of new jersey s messiest problems john h ewing mr seniority at 77 , jack ewing is the oldest and one of the longestserving members of the senate , a distinction that gives him automatic seniority on most issues and insures that his opinions will be heard he has been in state politics since 1967 , when he was newly retired from abercrombie fitch in new york , where he had been chairman of the board he was elected to the assembly that year and served there for a decade before moving to the senate in 1977 although education was never his area of expertise in fact , he dropped out of trinity college in hartford after his sophomore year he expressed an interest in schools early on in his political career when i first came in , i thought education was of vital importance , he said last week as chairman of the senate education committee , he has been an advocate for prison education , charter schools and the dismantling of the state department of higher education in 1994 he was a vocal proponent of legislation that allowed the state to seize control of school districts it considers poorly managed , and he pushed especially hard for a swift takeover of the newark district in 1995 both admirers and detractors praise mr ewing for his willingness to meet with any group and listen to its concerns this year , he has presided over numerous hearings for mrs whitman s financing plan and listened to hundreds of witnesses provide testimony that has more often been angry than enthusiastic you can never say jack ewing is unwilling to meet with the public , even when he knows he s going to take knocks , said lynne strickland , the executive director of the garden state coalition , which represents the 120 suburban districts fighting mrs whitman s plan on the other hand , ms strickland said , mr ewing has not challenged the whitman administration s financing plan , which has rankled middleclass and wealthy districts around the state as it stands now , the senate s proposal is nearly identical to the governor s ewing seems to be a point man for the administration , ms strickland said maybe the governor s hardline position meshes with his personal philosophy indeed , mr ewing says he does not believe it is the state s responsibility to pay for poor districts to catch up with the ones that can afford the sleekest school buildings , most sophisticated computers and most diverse extracurricular programs some people drive a mercedes some drive a ford taurus , like me , he said we ca n't pay for everyone to drive a mercedes
for the 11 or 12 airheads who still are not sure that smoking causes lung cancer , we now have a direct scientific link between a toxic chemical in cigarette smoke and the malignant tumors that have caused such agonizing deaths for so many none of these airheads hold highranking positions with the tobacco companies more than anyone , the tobacco biggies know the real deal some years ago a model named david goerlitz , during a photo shoot for a winston ad , asked a group of r j reynolds executives if any of them smoked one of them replied are you kidding \? we reserve that right for the poor , the young , the black and the stupid the tobacco executives are not into suicide they want to hang around awhile , enjoying their fabulous lifestyles and thinking up devious new ways to promote the destruction of others each year the tobacco companies have to replace two million american smokers a million and a half kick the habit annually another halfmillion or so are bulldozed into early graves because they could n't quit if the life styles of the tobacco bigs are to be preserved , annual replacements for those two million americans must be found now where do we think the companies look for those brand new smokers \? hint nearly all adult smokers began smoking as children the average young smoker begins at age 13 and becomes a daily smoker by 14 1 2 the tobacco execs know exactly where the replacement smokers are they are wherever children gather in the classrooms and the playgrounds , the candy stores and the toy stores all over america and just as surely as smoking causes cancer , the tobacco companies are directing an enormous amount of their advertising toward children they are trying to hook the kids according to the campaign for tobaccofree kids , a national effort to stop the marketing and sale of tobacco products to youngsters , 86 percent of all children who smoke prefer marlboros , camels or newports the three most heavily advertised brands when r j reynolds introduced the joe camel cartoon character , camel s market share among underage smokers quickly increased from 3 percent to 13 percent william d novelli , a former advertising executive who is leading the campaign , said for the vast majority of the kids , that camel was the first cigarette they smoked they started with joe joe camel debuted in 1988 and was an instant success the first couple of years of the joe camel advertising campaign were accompanied by the first increase in teenage smoking in a decade last week , during an interview , mr novelli handed me a cardboard box full of goodies guaranteed to appeal to children there were camelpowered toy cars a set of smokin' joe s trading cards cigarette packs containing joe camel cartoons and play money that could be redeemed for prizes goofy tshirts promoting a variety of tobacco products and brands , and , particularly insidious , a toddler s tshirt with an autoracing scene that featured a design very similar to the famous marlboro logo , but without the marlboro name there was also a rolling stone magazine that contained an elaborate camel ticketmaster ad on the first page of the ad , joe camel , in a black leather jacket and shades , and with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth , says , wanna see a show \? you turn the page and the ad comes to life a large foldout of joe reaches out of the magazine with a replica of two tickets in his hand the ad offers 25 gift certificates to just about any ticketmaster event \( think rock concerts \) all it takes is some of that play money in the camel packs you get one 25 gift certificate for every 100 camel cash cnotes each pack of cigarettes that i saw contained one cnote so you 'd have to smoke 100 packs of camels to get enough cnotes for a gift certificate now the back page of this ad says you 're not supposed to participate unless you 're over 21 got that \? the campaign for tobaccofree kids is trying to combat this sort of thing it wants the tobacco companies to keep their hands off the kids , and it is moving aggressively in advertising and other forms of media to get that message across we 'd like to be the tobacco institute for the good guys , said mr novelli
it was at the ryder cup last september that we got the renewed sense that there was something very special about phil mickelson it was n't merely that he seemed impervious to the pressure , that he coolly worked over the european competition and was 30 in his matches that was impressive , but the most telling point was that mickelson was upset , quite miffed actually , when he did n't play in every match in any athletic endeavor or any enterprise for that matter this is the reaction of a goto guy in the midst of a bubbling caldron of pressure that can wilt even the finest players , the goto guy wants the ball , he wants the shot that s phil for purely public relations purposes , mickelson now tries to play down his reaction to sitting out both the friday and saturday foursomes in the united states' loss at oak hill he shrugs and says all the right things about the captain having the final say , and that there would have been no guarantees that he would have contributed any more even if he had played that s fine , too it s just another indication of how , at the age of 26 , mickelson knows how to play all aspects of the game but he is at his best inside the ropes that is where he does the things that truly set him apart and with his victory on sunday at the nortel open in tucson , ariz , mickelson has again demonstrated that he is , without a doubt , the best young golfer in the united states in fact , with six victories at this point in his young career , he is well ahead of some very impressive company to find a player who had this many pga tour victories at his age , you would have to go all the way back to one jack william nicklaus , who had exactly three times as many as mickelson so much for the next nicklaus cliches those 18 victories or the fact that nicklaus had won three of the four majors by the time he was 23 should establish once and for all that there is not now nor is there likely to be a next nicklaus but we might have the next best thing on our hands because no other player currently on the pga tour had this many victories by age 26 not tom watson , corey pavin , payne stewart , fred couples or davis love 3d , all of whom had two not johnny miller , who had three not ben crenshaw or jerry pate , both of whom had five there are international superstars whose european records are superior seve ballesteros had 23 victories on the pga european tour and 4 in the united states by age 26 jose maria olazabal had 16 in europe , two in the united states nick faldo had 11 victories in europe , none in the united states ernie els , who is 26 , has 13 international victories and two in the states you can argue for days about whether the europeans compiled those records against inferior competition , but there can be little argument that mickelson is , at this moment , the best young american player the question is , and it is a big question with mickelson , is how to keep him that way simply put , the guy is easily bored after winning at tucson last year , he did n't win again he threatened at the first two majors tying for seventh at the masters after a disappointing 73 in the fourth round , and tying for fourth at the united states open after starting the final round one stroke behind that was it he missed the cut 9 times in 21 appearances after tucson with his game , he should never miss the cut when you are playing every week , it tends to get monotonous to the point where you do n't get geared up or tuned or mentally focused , he said or , you do n't think clearly week in and week out it s difficult to get focused every week , and i found myself just kind of slacking off a little bit as opposed to working hard on every shot he is the type of player who needs a challenge he showed that in a 1990 college match with manny zerman , his archrival from arizona , when , after zerman refused to give mickelson a drop from casual water , mickelson holed out from the fairway with a 7iron i guess you did n't need that drop , zerman said after watching the ball disappear from 165 yards away then there was the time mickelson was winning the 1990 united states amateur early in a match with a player named jeff thomas , mickelson had a 4footer for birdie and thomas had a 30footer for par he told thomas his par putt was good and then made the birdie mickelson won , 6 and 5 that s the sort of fire he needs to rediscover sure , he s a millionaire now , loaded up with equipment money from yonex and appearance money from overseas , and more than 25 million from tournament earnings over here motivation is not easy when you already live on easy street but mickelson is showing signs of renewed interest he has promised to rededicate himself to playing hard in the first two rounds he wants to make the presidents cup team he wants to win his first major so , if he needs a little added motivation , here it is the sony world ranking , released after his victory at tucson , says that there are 20 players in the world better than he is phil , you 're good , but you 're still away photo phil mickelson celebrating with his caddie jim mackay afterwinning the nortel open on sunday \(

san francisco the advertising executive who so loved the sea that he became the commodore of the new york yacht club is now sailing into cyberspace the j walter thompson company unit of the wpp group is putting up a world wide web site \( http www jwtworld com \) that features its founder , james walter thompson , among the prominent icons the colorful site , which is intended to promote thompson to potential clients as well as reinforce ties with current clients , includes a commodore s mailbox to leave inquiries about the agency and a biography of the founder that begins here s the skinny on that old guy the site is meant to help the people at j walter thompson get comfortable with this as it comes at us so they 'll know how to create and manage sites for themselves and for clients , said steve darland , executive vice president and general manager of the thompson office here mr darland , the worldwide brand communications director for thompson , oversees interactive marketing and discussed the web project on friday some disdain the push by madison avenue onto the internet already , there are 50 to 75 web sites from shops of all sizes as a gimmick or ploy to convince advertisers that any agency with a home page is an expert in interactive marketing one thompson executive , however , disputed that contention clients are as not as impressed by agencies' having web sites as they are by agencies' actually having interactive capabilities , said hunter madsen , a senior partner at jwt san francisco and director for jwt ie , the thompson interactive unit the thompson site s home page is focused on a globe , which mr madsen called a metaphor for thompson being among those agencies with the greatest global reach and being a world unto itself , with 206 offices in 78 countries to underscore those resources , he added , thompson has strongly encouraged each office to build its own web site to supplement and complement the corporate effort twenty are in development and half a dozen are already up , including jwt asiatic in karachi , pakistan jwt hong kong jwt sydney in australia , and thompson specialized communications , a recruitmentadvertising agency in atlanta and los angeles each office can customize its effort for example , on the site for jwt thailand in bangkok , the commodore resembles the british naval officer who was deborah kerr s old flame in the king and i still , mr madsen said , there are commonalities so that as a visitor goes from the corporate site to specific office sites , there 'll be a sense it s all tightly integrated and for offices without resources sufficient to produce sites , a template is available mr darland identified them as the smaller offices that when you say 'put your chief information officer on , ' they say , 'we do n't have one' the thompson web site offers links to the web sites of seven large multinational clients , including the eastman kodak company , the ford motor company , the kellogg company , the sprint corporation and sun microsystems inc other features include the jwt art show , offering glimpses of extracurricular work by thompson employees like the paintings of partricio bonta , president and chief executive of jwt argentina an area to request customized pages where samples of television commercials and print advertisements can be downloaded , and private showing , which mr madsen described as a site to share information between thompson offices and between thompson and its clients , which is password and securityprotected one characteristic that thompson hopes will distinguish the corporate web site is a playful tone in both the text and graphics for instance , the continents on the globe rotate depending upon where a computer user is based someone here will see north and south america front and center while someone in paris will be presented with a eurocentric world view for a company like thompson , this sends a very distinct message that we want this medium to be a friendly and approachable one , said mark trippetti , a senior partner and group creative director at jwt san francisco who was the art director for the site graphics were also developed by vivid studios in san francisco and steven salerno , an illustrator based in new york as it was being developed , the site initially had a different look a large , rambling estate that mr madsen labeled the thompson homestead but the more we looked at it , he said , and considered the commodore playing colonel sanders , we just felt the globe would be more effective the cost of the site was similar to that of developing one for a marketer , which ranges from 50 , 000 to 300 , 000 other jwt san francisco employees involved with the site included carrell mccarthy , a partner and director for ad services who is the site administrator , or websterina morgan stetler , an online technology specialist who described his job title as webmaster tig tillinghast , assistant director for jwt ie , and malachy walsh , a copywriter , who inspired a feature named the ad game , where aspiring copywriters try getting a campaign approved it s a cautionary tale , mr madsen said , which prompted mr walsh to interject , none of it is autobiographical
to the editor your dec 8 news article about the gas pipeline project through burma being undertaken by total of france , the unocal corporation of the united states , the petroleum authority of thailand and the burmese military regime was onesided in its portrayal of unocal as a humanitarian corporate good guy this is far from the truth unocal stands to make billions from the pipeline over the ensuing years the deal is immersed in politics , contrary to unocal s statements the national coalition government of the union of burma is made up of elected representatives of the 1990 general elections , democratically chosen by the people of burma after the national league for democracy , led by aung san suu kyi , won more than 82 percent of the seats in parliament , the state law and order restoration council , or slorc , refused to yield power because of unocal s refusal to abide by the demands of the elected government , slorc stands to reap billions from its part in the pipeline deal none of this income will help the people of burma unocal is not being responsible to its shareholders , since any contracts made during the reign of the illegitimate military government will need to be reviewed by the democratic government when it regains control since the social and environmental impacts of the pipeline are enormous , it is likely that the project will not continue in its current form showpieces such as the few schoolhouses that were shown on the slorc guided tours for journalists are far outweighed by the impact the pipeline will have on the countryside and its people and are crumbs compared to the billions unocal stands to make the democratically elected prime minister has called for companies to cease investments in burma until democracy is restored if unocal were truly apolitical , it would abide by the wishes of the burmese people and do just that thaung htun new york , dec 10 , 1996 the writer is representative for un affairs for the national coalition government of the union of burma
los angeles , june 2 members of california s reform party immersed themselves today in the nittygritty aspects of building a third party , attending workshops on everything from organizing precincts to writing a party platform but none of those sessions delved into the topic that was on the mind of mark a sturdevant and some others all weekend now is the time for someone else to step forward to broaden the base of the party ross perot founded and head its 1996 presidential ticket , said mr sturdevant , the california reform party s vice chairman mr sturdevant said he wanted former gov richard d lamm of colorado , one of the weekend s featured speakers , to be the nominee while the meeting of the reform party of california was the perfect venue for national politicians seeking a platform for their ideas , only mr lamm auditioned , and only tentatively , at that he expressed hypothetical interest in heading the reform party ticket under the right circumstances , but he emphasized that he spoke to promote his ideas , not his credentials as a presidential candidate in his speech , he said that demographics would force the country to make hard choices on social programs for example , he maintains that the coming retirement of babyboomers will put extraordinary pressure on how the country pays for security security mr lamm s wellreceived speech and his careful remarks at a subsequent news conference underscored the mystery that envelopes mr perot s partybuilding efforts why should another politician test the waters or run for the reform party nomination when mr perot has not ruled out the possibility of his running a second time \? in addition , a candidate entering the race this late would face a daunting financial challenge the federal election commission has issued a preliminary ruling that if mr perot runs in 1996 he can receive federal money because he won 189 percent of the vote in 1992 in some form mr perot s group is on the ballot in 12 states i think perot should let someone else run , said linda thom , a democrat , after listening to the mr lamm and mr perot speak on saturday at the los angeles convention center it is n't just a ross perot party and i particularly like richard lamm he s lowkey he s not a rabblerouser ms thom , a santa barbara democrat who voted for bill clinton in 1992 , said she would join the reform party if mr lamm became its nominee ms thom said she had long supported the democratic presidential nominees , including michael dukakis and george mcgovern like mr sturdevant and ms thom , yeh lingling is firmly in the prolamm camp ms lingling said she joined the reform party a few weeks ago because she was very disappointed with the major parties a resident of orinda , near oakland , she said they had no courage to address real issues some conference participants like zika djokovich were enthusiastic about mr lamm but not at all concerned about mr perot s plans perot is not going to be the candidate , said mr djokovich , 70 , a santa ana resident he s too smart for that mr djokovich , a world war ii veteran , said he voted for mr clinton in 1992 and expected to back him again this year he said mr perot was a great teacher john place , a reform party member running for congress in the 10th congressional district in california , would like mr perot to win the reform party presidential nomination personally , i would like to see perot run , mr place said he s consistently stuck to his ideas he really works harder now than four years ago to run for reform party nomination , candidates will be required to gather signatures from 10 percent of the party s members in july , said russ verney , the head of the effort to create a national party he has estimated that the party will have 13 million members by the end of june , meaning a potential candidate would need 130 , 000 signatures to make a bid for the nomination at a convention later this summer mr place said the nomination process could draw out more potential contenders it s up to them , he said some contenders seem certain to remain on the sidelines along with mr lamm , former senator david boren of oklahoma and former representative timothy j penny of minnesota have long been attractive candidate for many reform party members both are interested in thirdparty politics but say they are not interested in being the nominee there has to be a transformation from a oneman band to an orchestra , mr boren , who is president of the university of oklahoma , said in a telephone interview he said that had not occurred yet at united we stand america , the nonprofit mr perot group founded after the 1992 election , and the nascent reform party mr penny , a senior fellow at the hubert h humphrey institute of public affairs at the university of minnesota , said the perotbacked groups were defined by what they are against , not by the specific policy they support disgust , anger at the deficit are motivating factors but it does n't add up to an ideadriven agenda , he said in a telephone interview
when 2yearold laura vaughn entered white plains hospital in suburban new york to have her tonsils out , her mother wanted to be with her when she awakened from the anesthesia but the doctor said no visitors , not even parents , were allowed in the recovery room , so jean vaughn had to sit in the waiting room down the hall then a nurse came in and said that laura was hysterical , said ms vaughn of dobbs ferry , ny she said , she s upset , you have to come' she realized that laura needed me most parents want to be present during common procedures like taking blood or inserting an intravenous line because they think that they can ease their children s fears and possibly their pain , says dr howard bauchner , director of general pediatrics at boston medical center , who has been studying this issue for several years but many doctors believe that having parents in the room can do more harm than good , he said , because parents make them so nervous that they are afraid they will not perform well as it turns out , both the parents and the doctors may be overstating their cases in a study by dr bauchner and dr robert vinci , director of the pediatric emergency room at boston medical center , parents who stayed with their children for medical procedures did not hamper doctors' performances , but they did not ease children s pain either those who benefited most were the parents , the researchers found parents who were with their children were much less anxious than those who were not , according to the study , which is reported this month in the journal pediatrics the study involved 431 parents who took children under 3 years old to the emergency room of boston medical center none of the children had lifethreatening conditions parents were randomly assigned to three groups one group was asked to leave when doctors performed an invasive procedure like drawing blood or inserting an intravenous line or a catheter to obtain a urine sample a second group was invited to stay and was taught a technique that was supposed to calm the children a third group was invited to stay but was given no instruction on allaying the children s fears the researchers wanted to answer several questions did children cry less when their parents were with them \? did the calming technique work \? did the doctors' performance suffer for example , did they have to do a procedure more than once before successfully completing it \? to the researchers' surprise , the children in all three groups cried with nearly the same intensity and duration based on the crying , the children s pain was rated as extreme by 13 percent of the doctors who did not have parents present , 18 percent whose parents were present but had not been taught the calming intervention and 14 percent of the doctors who had parents in the intervention group the parents were much more likely than doctors to rate their children s pain as extreme , but the intervention had little effect on their ratings fiftyfive percent of parents in the intervention group and 50 percent of those in the other group said their children s pain was extreme another important finding was that the doctors performed just as well whether parents were watching them or not and there was no difference in the anxiety level of the doctors as measured by a psychological questionnaire completed 10 minutes after the procedure was over the only significant difference was in the anxiety level of the parents parents who did not stay with their children said they felt more anxious than those who did hospital policies on parental presence during invasive procedures vary jennifer smith stepanek , a researcher for the association for the care of children s health , an advocacy organization in bethesda , md , that supports parental involvement , said that in a national survey conducted by the association at more than 400 hospitals in 1992 , fewer than half of parents said they were allowed to be with their children during medical procedures things have n't changed much since then , she said ms stepanek believes that the presence of parents is more beneficial to children than the new study found she said that other studies had found that children whose parents stay with them during medical procedures experienced less stress than other children , and that lower stress led to faster recuperation dr bauchner agrees that his study may not have measured all of the ways that parents can comfort their children in hospitals and doctor s offices and given that the parents do no harm , he says he hopes that his study will encourage more doctors to invite them to stay

settlers on the rich mississippi river bottom land at the turn of the century , residents of valmeyer are homesteaders in a strange new land it is a place near and yet far only two miles from the town they now call old valmeyer , washed out during the great flood of 1993 but 400 feet higher for two and a half years its residents have been living in temporary housing , visiting the temporary post office , sending their children off to the temporary school while they built the new town , with the help of 35 million in federal and state money together they have debated sidewalk widths and fretted about street names , fortified by coffee and a levee of resolve in the process , they have had to define themselves as few towns ever do , and come to terms with whether it is possible to return home to a brandnew town it s not the old town , definitely , said jessica nolan , 17 , standing on a ladder in the new school auditorium as she smoothed gold foil decorations for the

yet even as bulldozers clear land for the new town s squircle \( a combination square and circle \) and dust swirls in freshly minted culdesacs , the tapestry of familiarity is slowly being woven it can be as subtle as the comforting sound of the union pacific freight train , which can still be heard as it passes or as symbolic as the watermarks preserved on the old wooden cross at the st john united church of christ , because , the rev david riebeling said , that s part of history now the midwest flood of 1993 made history in many ways it was the nation s costliest flood ever , with 50

beyond repair by appraisers it is the first and largest of four towns swamped by the flood that have elected to rebuild themselves by moving to higher ground the establishment of the new valmeyer follows a shift toward a more realistic national flood plain policy , one that takes the emphasis off trying to control nature historically , the federal response to flood recovery has been to rebuild levees and dams valmeyer is insuring the future in a different way , by moving residents out of harm s way changing the behavior of people instead of rivers , in the words of bill becker , an official with the federal department of energy in denver and adviser to valmeyer although towns have been relocated with federal help before the first was soldiers grove , wis , which moved away from the kickapoo river in 1978 none have tried it on this scale after two floods in quick succession , the residents of valmeyer , exhausted and heartsick , decided they had had enough when the levee was first breached , in august 1993 , engulfing the town with 18 feet of water in some places , many people left belongings on their second floors , intending to return we thought after throwing sandbags , going down to the firehouse and having a few beers , it would go away , said christine schanz , a welder the water receded , but on sept 10 it came back , holding valmeyer in its murky grip for nearly a month that really knocked the spirit out of the people , recalled dennis knobloch , former mayor and current village administrator , who is credited with keeping his town together rather than disperse or take their chances by rebuilding , daddylonglegsstyle , on 12 to 15foot stilts , as prescribed by flood regulations , the people of valmeyer voted to move their valuables to higher ground , much as the mississippi river packet boatmen did a century ago the roofs , steeples and signs valmeyer ii a new beginning are now rising on 500 acres of what was once walter and dorothy stemler s dairy farm , which from certain vantage points has views of the st louis arch to rebuild , valmeyer families relied on proceeds from the sale of their damaged homes to the federal emergency management agency , payments from national flood insurance if they had it small business administration loans and their savings mr knobloch said that about onethird of the residents , many of them elderly , were free and clear of mortgages but had been forced to start over again , like newlyweds
our bones are scattered the cawnpore massacres and the indian mutiny of 1857 by andrew ward illustrated 703 pp new york a john macrae book henry holt company 30 it can be sensibly argued that no human earthquake in the imperial era was so misnamed or misunderstood as the indian mutiny of 1857 to many of the british it was only that a mushrooming mutiny of native troops , or sepoys , against their european officers and the east india company , which then ruled india its immediate cause was the belief among indian troops that their newly issued enfield rifles would have to be loaded with cartridges coated in grease taken from cows , anathema to hindus , or from pigs , abominable to muslims worse , the cartridges had to be bitten when the first rumblings reached the colonial authorities in january , a prompt order exempted sepoys from using lard native troops were instructed to concoct their own grease from vegetable oils and beeswax but objectors saw this as yet another ruse to degrade their faiths in march , a young sepoy named mungal pandy was executed for defying and wounding an officer a protracted rebellion followed in northwest india it came close to unseating the british raj , and it resulted in savage atrocities that were to haunt india and britain for generations this was no simple mutiny in our bones are scattered , andrew ward focuses on cawnpore , scene of some of the worst butchery , weaving a narrative from a host of old and newly available sources he has striven , i think successfully , for fairness , but so overcrowds his canvas that even a patient reader may lose sight of its design the revolt erupted in barracks just north of delhi the rebel troops swiftly overran delhi and proclaimed themselves followers of the last mogul emperor , bahadur shah , whom the british had kept on his throne as a powerless pawn his hindu counterpart was nana sahib , the adopted son of the last maratha ruler although nana had been deprived of his titles , he lived in courtly splendor in bithur , 10 miles from cawnpore , a garrison town on the ganges as the rebellion spread , nana was hailed by mutineers as the heir to the once mighty marathas the british were absurdly outnumbered some 250 , 000 indian soldiers were led by 34 , 000 europeans but the rebels had no unity of command or shared political purpose the british quickly limited the contagion by disarming wavering sepoys and calling in reinforcements to relieve besieged europeans in lucknow and cawnpore britons were hopeful , since the formidable sir henry lawrence was in charge at lucknow , while the commander at cawnpore was the battletested maj gen sir hugh wheeler but wheeler , whose wife was indian , vainly overestimated his influence on nana sahib nana declared for the rebels , and may have connived with them owing to the skillful nudges of a britishloathing aide , one azimullah khan , who prowls like an avenger through mr ward s pages when nana switched sides , wheeler s british officers , faithful sepoys , servants and civilian noncombatants came under raking fire in an exposed entrenchment wheeler in desperation agreed to an offer from nana of safe boat passage for all those willing to leave for allahabad , the next big city downstream on the riverbank there ensued a massacre of british officers and sepoys some 125 surviving women and children were rounded up , taken to a dwelling called bibighar and stabbed to death , and their dismembered bodies flung into a well mr ward makes a persuasive case that allegations of rape were exaggerated and probably unfounded but the slaughter was deeply shaming to the rebels it drew britons together and drove indians apart in england , the prevailing belief that european women had been raped seemed to many a nightmare fouler than death when cawnpore was retaken , retribution was savage officers and men searched the bibighar for inscriptions that might prove their worst fears , mr ward relates , and , finding none , invented their own 'my child ! my child ! ' 'think of us' 'avenge us ! ' and in several places , daubed in broad and clumsy strokes , 'remember cawnpore ! ' which would become the british battle cry for the remainder of the rebellion even suspicion of sympathy for rebels could mean hanging or being tied to the mouth of a cannon and blown apart but blood cooled , and queen victoria spoke out for conciliation the most obvious lessons of the great mutiny were quickly absorbed the ratio of europeans to sepoys was diminished more care was taken to heed signals of discontent but the wider import of the mutiny was not generally grasped the rebellion grew in soil fertilized by the average briton s contempt for india s history and culture , by a pervasive racism expressed in scornful kicks and derision , by the raj s reluctance to open highranking positions to indians and by the religious intolerance of missionaries it was fed by the shattering encounter of a traditional society with european ideas and technology i wish mr ward had dealt more fully with these matters , which are discussed in previous accounts of the mutiny whose help he acknowledges it is a pity , as he remarks , that so little testimony by indians exists about such unsolved puzzles as nana sahib s fate in my own delving , i was struck by the prescient reportage of william howard russell of the times of london russell sailed to india after covering the crimean war , was repelled by the nasty racism among angloindians and took note of crude forgeries of cawnpore atrocities he went on to remark that the horror of cawnpore was that black men dared to shed the blood of their masters here we had a war of religion , a war of race and a war of revenge , of hope , of some national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger , and to reestablish the full power of native chiefs , and the full sway of native religions there is a kind of god s revenge against murder in the unsuccessful issue of all enterprises commenced in massacre , and founded on cruelty and bloodshed whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt , it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders , as if by common instinct , determined to effect their end was the destruction of every white man , woman and child who fell into their hands a design which the kindliness of the people frustrated on many remarkable occasions the soundness of russell s judgment is demonstrated in andrew ward s welcome and definitive narrative
there are moments during the indignities of his presidential campaign when steve forbes wonders what pop would have thought of it all last week alone , father and son would have found plenty to talk about senator phil gramm ridiculed mr forbes for raising polo ponies on his farm three governors attacked him in washington , and what his headquarters called a christian right smear campaign accused him of having a robert mapplethorpe print on his yacht \( a seascape , not homoerotic art , the candidate shot back \) speaking of his father , malcolm , as his 22yearold campaign bus bounced across the frozen tundra of iowa from fort dodge to des moines , steve forbes said , i think he 'd be bemused by the intensity of the reaction mr forbes says he is running for president because jack kemp would not , and to sell america on his flat tax but this explanation does not entirely satisfy even his friends , who remain mystified about why a 48yearold magazine scion with no elective experience would get up one morning to announce that he will spend whatever it takes , about 165 million so far , of his inherited fortune to live in the white house mr forbes says he has not reached some sort of personal watershed i do n't believe in midlife crises , he asserts so speculation on at least part of his motives inevitably turns to the specter of his late father , the eccentric and flamboyant publisher whom by all accounts the shy , awkward steve adored some friends see mr forbes s campaign as an attempt to emerge finally from the shadow of his father , something the candidate rejects believe me , there are other ways of making a mark for oneself without the risks , the aggravation , the investment , the wear and tear on family life and the meatgrinding process of a presidential campaign , he said in fact , what is far more striking are the parallels in the lives of the two men like his eldest son and chosen heir , malcolm forbes did not come into his own as a powerful figure at forbes magazine until he was in his 40 s , when he took over after his brother died like his son , malcolm forbes wanted to be president , and in pursuit of that goal ran twice unsuccessfully with young steve often at his side for governor of new jersey i came to the conclusion there was no way i could consciously imitate this particular individual , steve forbes said and it would be futile to do so he was unique it s like in athletics you know , great athletes they retire the number with my father , i figure they retired the shoes do n't try to fill them get your own shoes father s political path was an early influence born malcolm stevenson forbes jr , steve was raised in the oldmonied hillsides of somerset county , nj , moderate republican foxhunting land , where the neighbors ran for congress and served in the cabinet christine todd , mr forbes s childhood friend from the far hills country day school , would grow up to become governor whitman steve forbes joined the club at 6 , when he ran doorbells and bumped along in the converted milk truck that served as the campaign bus in his father s gubernatorial race malcolm forbes was then a state senator , and he lost in a close 1953 republican primary to a candidate backed by the powerful new jersey republican organization an outsider position like the one his son is assuming now when malcolm forbes was trounced by the governor , a democrat , in the general election of 1957 , he gave up politics for the family business his son went off to the brooks school in north andover , mass , then on to princeton , malcolm forbes s alma mater six months after graduation , in 1971 , he joined forbes as a researcher and began working his way up as the preselected heir by this time , malcolm forbes was busy promoting his magazine as the product of a happy multimillionaire who ballooned , yachted , motorcycled and collected faberge eggs aside from his popular fact and comment column , he only occasionally meddled in the editorial content fortune magazine asserted in its feb 5 issue that under the younger mr forbes , who now has the title of editor in chief , writers have seen tough articles about companies that advertise in forbes changed from negative to positive assessments mr forbes denied that in contrast with his father , steve forbes always loved policy , and he became enamored of a small group of supplyside economists in his early days at forbes jude wanniski , a supplysider who helped push mr forbes into the presidential race , remembers first seeing him at a 1977 supplyside gathering at the mayflower hotel in washington , dc steve was there on the periphery , taking notes , mr wanniski said after malcolm forbes died suddenly in 1990 , mr forbes took over the magazine as well as the media company of forbes inc , a transfer of power that gave him 51 percent of the voting stock his younger siblings , three brothers and a sister , had accepted the decision years before despite of or because of his anointment , the new king among princes characterized this period as one of great strain that s when everyone was looking , 'can he do it \? ' mr forbes said
arthur morrison cuts an impressive figure in court in his impeccably pressed , navy blue pinstriped suit , starched white shirt and rep tie , he seems every bit the lawyer until he starts presenting his case i have been in prison for the last 46 months , mr morrison told jurors one recent morning in federal court in lower manhattan i am so proud this date has finally arrived mr morrison , 49 , who describes himself as a former business partner of muhammad ali , has served almost all of a 51month federal prison sentence after pleading guilty to making threatening phone calls to former girlfriends now , after persuading a judge to let him withdraw his guilty plea , he is back in court , in a quixotic attempt to clear his name that guilty plea never stopped bothering me because i am completely innocent of the charges , he said in a recent telephone interview from the metropolitan correction center in manhattan mr morrison has a lot to lose if the jury convicts him , prosecutors say they will seek a 15 to 17year term the maximum he faces is 55 years still , he appears unfazed in the 15thfloor courtroom , and in several recent interviews , mr morrison has displayed an almost pathological confidence that the criminal justice system will exonerate him never mind that prosecutors have presented a mountain of evidence against him for example , jurors listened to audio tapes of mr morrison making vengeful telephone threats to one former girlfriend and her employer never mind that mr morrison ignored the warnings of the trial judge , kimba m wood , who urged him to think twice about withdrawing his guilty plea just months before he would be released never mind that jurors seem perplexed , and even annoyed , by mr morrison s line of questioning and never mind that mr morrison made another decision that further lengthens his odds of winning an acquittal he decided to defend himself as jurors have come to learn in judge wood s courtroom , mr morrison is an unusual defendant , with an even more unusual background in his opening statement , mr morrison explained that he worked for 27 years as mr ali s business associate they were partners of a company called muhammad ali s world champion brand industries another partner was the motorcycle daredevil evel knievel , whom mr morrison said he had known for 14 years he was careful not to tell jurors that he pleaded guilty to making phone threats to several former girlfriends , and their employers , between 1989 and 1992 earlier this year , however , he withdrew the guilty plea because he said his lawyer had misled him into believing that federal agents would allow him to try to catch a renegade iraqi arms dealer to gain leniency judge wood ordered a new trial when the lawyer conceded there had been a misunderstanding between himself and mr morrison over the terms of the guilty plea after mr morrison withdrew his plea , prosecutors obtained a tough 14count indictment , including charges that he had telephoned bomb threats to a police station in east lansing , mich , and to the american board of emergency medicine , forcing the cancellation of a national board exam a former girlfriend was scheduled to take during the trial , which has lasted two weeks , several of his former girlfriends have taken the witness stand to testify against mr morrison , telling jurors that his harassment and threats had disrupted their lives in his opening statement , mr morrison acknowledged that his chances for acquittal were slim and said that he preferred to describe his predicament in a fight vernacular now , ladies and gentlemen of the jury , you may see blood , but it does not mean that the defendant is down , said mr morrison , who routinely refers to himself in the third person just because he s bleeding , it do n't mean that he should be counted out with the help of a legal adviser , thomas f x dunn , mr morrison has employed a strategy that can best be described as a namedropping defense besides describing his business ties with mr ali , mr morrison has told the jurors that he accompanied the former heavyweight champion to iraq in 1990 to help secure the release of 385 hostages who were being used by saddam hussein as human shields an american patriot , mr morrison has called himself through it all , judge wood has demonstrated extraordinary patience for mr morrison , whom she told in february , i believe you at times have a tenuous connection to reality still , judge wood has allowed him some leeway , even with the people he has put on his witness list when mr morrison s defense began last week , the first witness he called to the stand was ramsey clark , the former united states attorney general a personal friend of mine , mr morrison called him mr morrison also called the rev al sharpton , who had dinner with mr morrison in the early 1990 s after answering a few of mr morrison s questions none having anything to do with the charges mr sharpton left the courthouse in a huff who knows why i'm here \? he told reporters this whole thing is ridiculous finally , mr morrison has promised jurors that he , too , will take the witness stand , but late yesterday he began to waver on that point , telling the judge he would seek the advice of mr clark he has described the phone calls to his former girlfriends as scandals in his personal , domestic life , saying jurors could relate to such scandals mr morrison also made a lessthansubtle reference to judge wood s domestic life the judge recently filed for divorce , drawing tabloid headlines everyone knows about scandals in a domestic situation , mr morrison told jurors , even the honorable judge wood objection , the prosecutor , roman e darmer , said sustained , judge wood said
the cyberthief and the samurai by jeff goodell 328 pp new york dell paper , 599 takedown the pursuit and capture of kevin mitnick , america s most wanted computer outlaw by the man who did it by tsutomu shimomura with john markoff 324 pp new york hyperion 2495 the fugitive game online with kevin mitnick by jonathan littman illustrated 383 pp boston little , brown company 2395 the drama of the computer business is often hard for outsiders to visualize , since so much of it occurs in software programmers' cubicles or in negotiations among venture capitalists the most famous exception took place one year ago on feb 16 , 1995 , the front page of the new york times carried an article whose headline said a mostwanted cyberthief had been caught the outlaw hacker was kevin mitnick , 31 , who had already served a prison sentence for illegally breaking into computer systems and was being hunted for parole violations according to the times s article and several subsequent ones , written by john markoff , mr mitnick destroyed himself through the classic sin of hubris he had dared intrude on and tamper with the machinery of a renowned computer security expert , tsutomu shimomura feeling personally violated and viewing the capture of the intruder as a matter of honor and a crusade , in mr markoff s terms , mr shimomura threw himself into the manhunt he advised federal authorities and telephone company experts as they ingeniously figured out that mr mitnick was the culprit and that he was operating from a modest apartment in raleigh , nc , where they seized him in a predawn raid the drama of the moment was heightened by the contrast between the two antagonists the mug shot of mr mitnick that ran on the times s front page depicted a scowling , overweight , bespectacled young man the picture of a nerd gone bad , as jeff goodell puts it in his book about the case mr shimomura s photograph on an inside page showed an intense , refined asian figure with flowing shoulderlength black hair , perfectly matching the article s theme that he was a genius with a spiritual bent , determined to avenge a dishonorable act almost a year later , three books about the episode are being published , and the images created by the original newspaper stories have a direct bearing on two of them takedown tells the story of the hunt for mr mitnick from mr shimomura s perspective as hunter the coauthor is john markoff , who wrote the new york times s articles about the capture and who accompanied federal bureau of investigation agents as they closed in on mr mitnick the fugitive game , by jonathan littman , describes the hunt from mr mitnick s point of view as prey it could also be seen as embodying a crusade of its own , for its animating spirit is the accusation that mr shimomura and mr markoff have done something dishonorable in writing their book the least embattled of these books , the cyberthief and the samurai , by jeff goodell , is a skillful , balanced account of how kevin mitnick went wrong and how tsutomu shimomura helped to capture him like the other authors , mr goodell emphasizes the lasting effects of mr mitnick s bleak upbringing in a struggling household in southern california mr mitnick s friends and relatives were often in trouble with the law he was in chronic trouble at school as a teenager he discovered that he could use electronic gadgets telephones , ham radios , eventually computers for prankish or adolescently destructive ends for instance , he and some friends rigged the outdoor speakers at fastfood restaurants so that when customers drove up to order burgers , the speakers would start cursing at them they programmed the home phones of people they disliked to say please deposit 20 cents ! whenever their owners picked them up by his 20 s mr mitnick had developed a habit of snooping through companies' and individuals' electronic accounts when he was arrested for the fifth time for computer crimes , his attorneys tried \( unsuccessfully \) to keep him out of prison by arguing that these repeated intrusions showed him to be a sick computer addict rather than a criminal mr goodell emphasizes that mr mitnick s greatest gifts were as an actor and amateur psychologist rather than as a technologist while he clearly understood computers and cellular phones well enough to manipulate them , mr mitnick himself said he obtained the most sensitive information through social engineering , his term for the oldfashioned con man s activity of lulling , threatening or deceiving people into revealing material they should n't mr goodell shows that even the police effort to capture mr mitnick combined the use of elaborate electronic sensors with oldfashioned gumshoe techniques while concluding , as the other authors do , that mr mitnick is an angry , suspicious , meanspirited character who has no respect for others' privacy and is willing to spend months electronically harassing those he thinks have done him wrong , mr goodell is skeptical about just how much of a menace he was there is little evidence , mr goodell writes , that mr mitnick ever sold the information he obtained , used it for blackmail or caused significant commercial damage he quotes an associate of mr shimomura s as saying of mr mitnick , he needed to be stopped , but i do n't think he belongs in jail mr goodell points out that shortly before mr mitnick s arrest , the raleigh office of the fbi broke a criminal ring that stole telephone creditcard numbers and cost phone companies many millions of dollars in fraudulent billings this case received only modest coverage , compared with the more melodramatic shimomuramitnick showdown
sar cheshma , afghanistan , oct 24 in a country where at least 10 , 000 villages have been bombed , shelled and burned into rubble , the razing of one more hamlet can pass almost unnoticed for hundreds of thousands of afghan families who have lost their homes , the anonymity of the loss only adds to the pain so when a battered kabul taxi arrived here this morning , smoke still rising and the smell of torched ruins heavy in the air , villagers clamored to tell outsiders how sar cheshma had died hastening down narrow lanes between fireblackened houses , the handful of people remaining in the village abandoned for a moment their rush to board trucks waiting to carry them away as refugees the villagers' story has been a familiar one in the 18 years that afghanistan has been at war the twist this time was that the men who destroyed sar cheshma were the turbaned warriors of the taliban , the ultraconservative muslims who have imposed a medieval social order across much of afghanistan two years ago , the taliban sprang from religious schools with a promise to suppress the carnage that has killed an estimated 15 million afghans and driven millions from their homes the villagers of sar cheshma say 30 taliban fighters swept in at dawn on tuesday , then spent several hours pouring canisters of gasoline into the 120 courtyard houses and setting them on fire sar cheshma lies barely five miles from the northern outskirts of kabul , the capital , where the taliban forces are fighting a villagebyvillage battle with the forces of ahmad shah massoud , a less conservative muslim leader whose troops used sar cheshma briefly on monday as a base to fire on the taliban a bloody robe , a koran in ashes a young mother and her three sons were killed by a taliban rocket fired when the massoud forces were in the village there were no further deaths in the torching , which nearly obliterated the village but in one mudwalled courtyard after another where hundreds of people lived , little remains but buckled bed frames , melted kitchen utensils and charred piles of grain are we not humans \? sobbed a 45yearold woman named narwaz , rushing forward with others to greet visitors who had slipped past taliban checkpoints posted to keep outsiders away beside her , a villager named khairuddin , 55 , waved a bloodied burqa , the headtotoe shroud that the taliban force all women to wear outside their homes the garment was all that remained of his daughter , the woman killed with her sons in the taliban rocket attack in a home up one of the village s dusty pathways , another man , najmuddin , 30 , broke away from sifting through his blackened grain supply , hoping to find enough uncharred bits to carry away suddenly , the grain forgotten , his face contorted , he rushed to fetch a metal bowl piled high with ashes that had been balanced on a section of broken wall it was all that remained of a copy of the koran that he said had been in his family for generations tyrants ! tyrants ! he shouted , referring to the taliban this is the book of god kill us if you must , but do n't burn our holy book ! their attention attracted by his cries , several neighbors rushed forward , one with a large metal plate sitting among the utensils that najmuddin had saved from the fire reverentially , najmuddin placed the bowl with the ashes onto the plate and carried it away we honor these ashes , he said , weeping the koran is the book of god the shock of what happened here appeared to be all the greater among the villagers because the perpetrators were the taliban when they emerged as a fighting force in 1994 , the taliban presented themselves as the harbingers of a new afghanistan , modeled on the teachings of the koran and inspired by a burning zeal to reunify the country from their original base in the southern city of kandahar , they swept east and west , suppressing local militias that had reduced much of the country to anarchy the muslim clerics who led the taliban promised that their forces would set new standards of decency in the fighting , and indeed taliban units appear to have avoided the raping and pillaging of most of the other afghan forces that have fought in the civil war but they have become widely hated for the draconian social order laid down by the taliban leaders , which bans women from working outside the home and girls from going to school , requires men to grow beards and forbids children to fly kites or play soccer since kabul fell to the taliban four weeks ago , there has been a series of uprisings against them in towns and villages north of the capital now the taliban have gone a step further , using tactics indistinguishable from those of other forces that have contributed to the country s destruction today , two days after the attack on sar cheshma , taliban jets bombed kalakan , a village under the control of the massoud forces about 10 miles further north a reporter for the bbc who visited the village said the bombing had killed 20 civilians scene of fighting against russians in the case of sar cheshma , the taliban attack was the latest in a series of disasters the residents have repeatedly found themselves in the middle of the fighting because of the village s strategic position , hard up against the ghoza mountain range , which runs like a shield across the northwestern flank of kabul in the decade that soviet forces were here , sar cheshma became a stronghold for the muslim guerrillas who ultimately drove out the soviet troops
jerusalem , april 15 israeli planes and artillery hammered lebanon for the fifth day today , but israeli and american officials said intensive contacts had begun in an effort to end the fighting , possibly by week s end a white house spokesman said secretary of state warren christopher , en route to east asia , opened a round of extensive talks today with syrian , lebanese and israeli officials at the same time , israeli radio reported that the iranian foreign minister would visit syria and lebanon within the next two days the dance has begun we hope the time is ripe , an israeli official said , confirming that mr christopher held long telephone talks today with prime minister shimon peres and foreign minister ehud barak of israel , as well as foreign minister farouk alsharaa of syria and prime minister rafik alhariri of lebanon in other diplomatic moves , the french foreign minister , herve de charette , met in israel today with mr peres and mr barak , though israeli commentators put little stock in his initiative mr de charette reportedly asked the iranian foreign minister , ali akbar velayati , to join in the efforts to halt the fighting the jordanian prime minister , abdul karim alkabariti , is also expected in israel , on tuesday , to help mediate israeli officials said they believed that a ceasefire agreement could be reached within two or three days , in time for residents who had fled from threatened regions of northern israel to return to their homes by the national holiday on april 22 mr peres has not spelled out the goals of attacks in lebanon , which began last thursday and have sent hundreds of thousands of lebanese civilians fleeing from cities and villages south of beirut but israeli officials have made clear that the primary objective is to mount enough pressure on lebanon and syria to force them to curb attacks by hezbollah , or the party of god , a militant shiite muslim organization supported by iran once the point was driven home with the combined pressure of the large exodus and incessant air and artillery attacks , including select strikes on beirut , the plan was for the united states to step in and broker a new ceasefire arrangement , much as mr christopher did after a similar israeli operation in 1993 , which lasted seven days hezbollah has been fighting a guerrilla war for 11 years against the israeli occupation of a ninemilewide buffer zone in southern lebanon israel launched the attacks asserting that the guerrillas had escalated their attacks beyond the limits set in 1993 , both inside the zone and against northern israel though there was no indication yet what arrangements the united states was discussing , israeli officials said that as in 1993 , there would be no written agreement the israelis said the minimum they expected to gain was firm commitments from the lebanese and syrian governments that hezbollah would not attack inside israel , either with katyusha rockets or infiltrations beyond that , the israelis said they hoped that syria would agree to clamp down on hezbollah , a commitment israel had been seeking from syria before their peace talks were suspended last month those talks were broken off in the political crisis that followed a wave of suicide bombings in israel an american official said washington was pressing syria to restrain hezbollah , which derives much of its support from iran but which is dependent in southern lebanon on syrian tolerance we want the katyushas to stop , one american official said , expressing hope that a ceasefire for a longterm period , not a week or 10 days could be established within 48 hours the official american position is that the current violence is a direct result of hezbollah s firing rockets into israel but as the israeli military response continued , mr christopher decided to try to stop the violence his engagement was spurred by the continuing violence , as the rocket attacks continued and israel responded in a very muscular fashion , and the whole situation became more tenuous and dangerous , an american official said mr christopher is to attend a meeting of foreign ministers of 29 countries and organizations in luxembourg on april 22 , designed to be a followup to the antiterrorism commitments made in sharm elsheik , egypt , on march 13 , a summit meeting called to help israel overcome the suicide bombings the syrians and the lebanese , who refused to go there , have been invited to luxembourg american officials hope that if a ceasefire can be arranged in southern lebanon with syrian help , damascus may be willing to send mr sharaa to luxembourg lebanon , a client state of syria , would follow suit any agreement ending katyusha rocket attacks on northern israel is bound to bolster mr peres s chances in the israeli elections on may 29 after the suicide bombings that took 63 lives in late february and early march , his ratings took a steep dive because of the popular impression that he was dovish

an internal investigation of the city child welfare agency s handling of a case in which a 4yearold starved to death last august has uncovered evidence that a caseworker failed to check repeated reports of neglect , that another caseworker examined the wrong child during a visit and then monitored the family by telephone , and that no meaningful supervision was provided by agency superiors according to officials with the administration for children s services , investigators also discovered that a private doctor had once examined the badly malnourished child , determined that she was dangerously underweight but never followed up or reported the problem to child welfare authorities the investigators also determined that , despite their legal obligation to report neglect , public school officials and workers at a neighborhood social services agency failed to contact child welfare officials about their knowledge of chronic health and school attendance problems involving other children in the family the internal report was prompted by the death on aug 31 of nadine lockwood , who , a week shy of her fifth birthday , weighed only 15 1 2 pounds carla lockwood , the child s mother , has been indicted on murder charges accusing her of systematically starving her child to death the report , whose findings were disclosed by agency officials speaking on the condition of anonymity , determined that a caseworker sent to investigate reports of nadine s malnourishment in may 1995 was instead shown a neighbor s child the caseworker made a detailed examination of the child she believed to be nadine , describing her as healthy the caseworker apparently never fully examined carla lockwood s washington heights apartment and did not interview the children apart from their mother a basic requirement in investigations according to the report and while the caseworker did make a formal finding of educational neglect and inadequate guardianship , she ultimately checked on the immunization of the children and their enrollment in school only by telephone the case , with the approval of supervisors , was closed late in 1995 none of the caseworkers have been identified nicholas scoppetta , the commissioner of the administration for children s services , dismissed a caseworker this summer for his handling of the case of 6yearold elisa izquierdo , who died at the hands of her mother it was the first such dismissal at the agency maggie lear , a spokeswoman for the agency , said she could not comment on the lockwood case until the investigation is complete the final version of the report is expected to be completed within several weeks the report found that the botched investigation in may 1995 followed three prior reports of neglect or abuse that a different caseworker ruled unfounded after responding to anonymous reports made in october 1994 and march 1995 , the caseworker told investigators he often could not find the mother or child the report , noting that roughly a dozen caseworkers , supervisors and managers had knowledge of the family s involvement with the agency over nearly a decade , cites a litany of squandered chances to intervene despite three children born with drugs in their systems , no effort was made to take carla lockwood before a family court judge in 1994 , when one of carla lockwood s children was being adopted , caseworkers did not investigate the circumstances of the other children the internal investigation also found that many others legally required to report instances of neglect or abuse failed to do so carla lockwood took nadine to a private doctor before her second birthday she weighed roughly 11 pounds the doctor told ms lockwood to return with the child the next month she never did the doctor never followed up in any way with the mother or the authorities , the report says
united nations , sept 16 technology may do for the united nations what years of talk have failed to accomplish slash through its mountains of paperwork and rein in its corps of international frequent flyers , the head of a new efficiency task force said today joseph e connor , under secretary general for administration and management and chairman of the efficiency board established late last year by secretary general boutros boutrosghali , said that one of the keys to reform is the introduction this month of a new united nations site on the internet s world wide web , which will provide both inhouse and public access to 270 , 000 organization documents in six languages , none of which need to be printed computers are also being used for more desktop publishing mr connor , a former chief executive of the price waterhouse accounting company , spoke after releasing the board s first report today the sevenmember board of officials and diplomats has been aided by eight efficiency experts from 27 member countries , including pamela johnson , a senior member of vice president al gore s reinventing government team , the national performance review madeleine k albright , the united states delegate , said today that one of the most gratifying aspects of this report is how un managers and staff have demonstrated that they are both willing and able to lead in this process of change among changes outlined in today s report is the greater use of video conferences to reduce the need for trips to new york or the organization s other two headquarters in geneva and vienna , mr connor said the organization has begun to interview candidates by videotape also , helping to speed up and cut costs in international recruiting , which will now be reduced on average from 25 weeks to 10 to 13 weeks curtailing the practice of sending translators to conferences and keeping them on duty in headquarters instead , working by electronic mail , has already achieved substantial savings , mr connor said for example , the fourth world conference on women in beijing last fall , a major trial run of the new system , saved about 378 , 000 in translation costs to the organization and the chinese government in an organization of 185 member countries , many of them with less than streamlined administrations , documents are often written in such a cumbersome , repetitive , uninformative and elliptical style that they mean little mr connor said today that there is no need to write the documentation as if none of the capitals had ever head of the issue before although the report lists staffgenerated 400 projects undertaken in the last six months , it says there is still much to be done efficiency is a process , not an event , mr connor said
sidney j holbrook manages 1 , 100 employees and a 90 million budget in an effort to keep the state s air and water clean , the fish and wildlife healthy as commissioner of the department of environmental protection , he is also responsible for boating safety , hunting , controlling forest fires and monitoring long island sound the department also oversees its own saw mill in portland depot to supply boards for picnic tables and a 13acre seedling nursery in voluntown some people complain about the stringency of the environmental regulations here but i think it helps to to establish a quality of life in connecticut that is second to none , mr holbrook said you can feel safe breathing the air and drinking the water mr holbrook came to the job early last year after 12 years in the state house of representatives , including 10 years as republican whip recently , he discussed some of the challenges his agency faces in an interview at his hartford office following are some excerpts from that conversation q could connecticut s parks , forests and beaches be better utilized \? a connecticut has 126 parks and forests and they are absolutely a hidden treasure although at this agency 80 percent of the focus is on air , water and waste , personally my love is natural resources and outdoor recreation i try to get out every week or so to a different park we are responsible for four state beaches sherwood island , rock neck , hammonasset and silver sands in milford local beaches are the responsibility of the municipalities and the department of health by next year silver sands , the newest park , will have better beach access , better parking , new dunes , a beach and boardwalk our campgrounds were sold out over memorial day they 're doing very well the staff does a good job even though the staffing is thin currently 50 percent of the staff in wildlife management are prisoners q will the state add new parks \? a i believe there will be new parks , yes will they be the kind of parks we think of in the traditional way \? probably not what we are doing in some of our state forests is developing more recreational areas that in essence turn those into parks we 're working more with utility companies to obtain easements and make their land available to public access they have a tremendous amount of land they have been very receptive to opening their lands it does n't have to necessarily be managed by us the goal , the bottom line , is to provide more space to the public we work in partnership with groups like the nature conservancy that has acquired much land a good example is selden island where we acquired an easement on an island in the connecticut river q what about the urban areas \? a we have a program where we work with the alternative incarceration program it s about 14 months old we go into cities to illegal dumping sites , lots that have been abandoned , and restore the sites to as pristine a quality as we possibly can these people , parolees or those sentenced to perform community service , clean and restore the sites in new haven , bridgeport and hartford we have cleaned up over 150 sites we find that when the sites are cleaned up they are not trashed again i personally would like to see these sites stay more focused on nature than recreation but this is something the cities have to determine q what is the quality of connecticut s air this summer \? a with deregulation and restructuring of midwestern power generating plants we have a problem they do n't have the same regulations or requirements as we do here in new england they generate a tremendous amount of pollutants we have close monitoring of all emissions into the air within connecticut the toxic release inventory released by the epa showed connecticut is the leader in new england as far as reduction of toxic releases by industry 69 percent since 1988 q does your agency have any role in the possible power shortage this summer \? a we only get involved in making sure they burn the cleanest fuels they can and that they come up with a conservation plan the power companies are going to open some of their old fossil fuel facilities they are supposed to do public service announcements to let people know if there is a problem with the demand going up and the generation down i think it s important for the public to aware that this is a serious situation we have basically lost our main source of generation in the state through the loss of millstone we hope for a cool summer q some people believe that connecticut is too densely populated for hunting to be safe do you think so \? a absolutely not i do n't believe that at all there are certain laws and requirements that insure that safety of people is the no 1 concern we have setback requirements as far as shooting from roads and from homes or any dwelling we have a tremendous amount of state forests that are available to hunting there s a lot of private lands open to hunting but it is constantly diminishing that s why we try to constantly look for lands that we can buy or obtain through easements to make available to the sportsmen of the state
the miami heat , making three trades that drastically changed their team , highlighted an eventful day of dealing before the trading deadline yesterday in the national basketball association when the dealing was done , pat riley had made a series of bold moves in his first year as miami s coach , president , and part owner , hoping to fastforward the heat s growth into a contender meanwhile , christian laettner , tim hardaway , kevin willis , billy owens and walt williams all found new teams the atlanta hawks , by adding laettner and sean rooks , looked like an improved team on paper and the sacramento kings , riding an eightgame losing streak , hoped that a risky deal would help them finally reach the playoffs in all , it was one of the busiest trade deadline days ever the minnesota timberwolves started the transactions by trading laettner and rooks to the hawks in exchange for guard spud webb and center andrew lang then miami got busy , sending willis and guard bimbo coles to golden state in exchange for hardaway and forward chris gatling miami followed that move with another major deal , sending forwards owens and kevin gamble to sacramento in exchange for the talented swingman williams and forward tyrone corbin several lesser deals were also consummated in a move to strengthen its bench , orlando acquired forwardcenter kenny gattison from vancouver in exchange for the backup forward jeff turner gattison should give quality relief to horace grant off the bench the philadelphia 76ers traded forward sharone wright to the toronto raptors in exchange for forwards ed pinckney and tony massenburg , plus a conditional draft pick meanwhile , miami also traded guard terrence rencher to phoenix in exchange for guard tony smith when the smoke cleared , miami was the big dealmaker in one day , the heat traded willis , owens , gamble , coles and and rencher , while acquiring hardaway , williams , corbin , smith and gatling the heat \( 2429 \) is in danger of becoming the first rileycoached team to miss the playoffs in his 14 seasons so riley took action , not only to shake up this season s team , but also to clear salarycap room to make a run at free agents this summer now the heat can finish with a nucleus of alonzo mourning , hardaway , williams , rex chapman , corbin , kurt thomas and keith askins the kings gambled by trading williams , their secondleading scorer who was having his best season but sacramento \( 2425 \) had to act to halt its recent collapse , and the allround skills of owens may blend nicely with mitch richmond and brian grant minnesota s decision to deal laettner was expected , after tension between laettner and several teammates reached a climax sunday during a game against the washington bullets laettner and the 19yearold rookie kevin garnett exchanged words during a timeout , and after the game , laettner elaborated on minnesota s internal problems you need certain people to shut their mouths , and you need other people to take over the team , said laettner , who is in the fourth year of a sixyear , 216 million deal you 've got to have the rookies and the young kids shut up , and you 've got to have the coaches and the veterans take care of the team we 've got some big britches on this team we have a lot of people who know everything minnesota had a team meeting monday , but several players remained upset that laettner had taken his complaints to the news media the timberwolves hope that lang , whose strengths are shot blocking and defense , will be a better fit for their team with tom gugliotta , isaiah rider , garnett , and doug west , the timberwolves feel they have solid scorers and lang is not a player who needs the ball to be effective getting laettner looks like a good move for atlanta , at least on paper averaging over 189 points , laettner gives the hawks a lowpost scoring threat they have lacked to complement mookie blaylock , steve smith and stacey augmon rooks is expected to replace lang as atlanta s starting center several rumored deals fell through the portland trail blazers considered trading point guard rod strickland to the denver nuggets , in exchange for guard jalen rose and forward reggie williams strickland has a frosty relationship with portland coach p j carlesimo , while williams had requested a trade toronto s herb williams wanted a trade to a contender , the celtics discussed trading dee brown for mark price and the houston rockets were looking to move the backup point guard kenny smith none of those deals worked out , but the deals that were made will make the second half of the season even more intriguing

rochester robert m unterberger , president of the eastman kodak company s twoyearold digital and applied imaging division , loves telling the story it seems his wife , mary ann , wanted their daughter kathy to pick out a sweater as a birthday gift but the unterbergers live in rochester and kathy lives in austin , tex not a problem mary ann unterberger took her kodak digital camera to a store and photographed three pink sweaters back home , she sat at her computer and converted 540 , 000 pixels of pink wool into three electronic postcards , which she electronically mailed to kathy kathy sent an email back to her mother , saying which sweater she liked best mom went back to the store , and the sweater was shipped that same day to mr unterberger , that s the kodak moment of the 1990 s so what if hardly anyone has a digital camera yet commercial photographers , advertising agencies and other users of photography can run kodak digital scanners to upload filmbased prints consumers , too , can use scanners , software packages and other devices that turn snapshots into bits and bytes , to be absorbed , used , manipulated and distributed , just like any other data photographs are n't just memories anymore , mr unterberger said they are information that s a pretty radical comment from a kodak man this is the company , after all , that made an art form out of feelgood advertising urging people to capture a moment , unchanged , forever but now that computers have created endless ways to massage data , kodak must convince the world that photography and photographs are still relevant that kodak can , to quote its new advertising slogan , indeed take pictures further kodak is part of a growing cadre of companies trying to tailor their paperbased businesses to a world in which electrons rule hewlettpackard is devising lowcost machines to print photoquality images from digitized snapshots xerox is pushing digital copiers , which put images into computerreadable language that can be transmitted to computers , printers and other copiers these companies are not abandoning their old technologies analog products still deliver reliable quality at low prices , and are likely to enjoy many years of sales growth in asia , latin america and other developing areas moreover , digital products are still too new to be profitable so kodak and its documentprocessing cohorts are traveling dual paths one leads to digital products the other leads to ways to let customers digitally manipulate their photos and documents , while still using their familiar analog cameras , copiers and printers kodak s theory is that the more people can do with a picture , the more pictures they will take and the longer that kodak can maintain the silverbased film and paper business that with its profit margins of 20 percent or more is one of the most profitable product lines extant the task facing george m c fisher , the chief executive who joined kodak from motorola three years ago , is to make electronics enhance , not usurp , silver halide film depending on how well he accomplishes that task , kodak will emerge as either a star example or a cautionary tale of what happens when a company stops fighting new technologies , and embraces them instead he has clearly made progress under his tutelage kodak , once the most insular of companies , has formed joint ventures with competitors , computer companies and retailers he has peppered its management with executives from ibm , digital equipment , microsoft and other information companies they , in turn , are infusing kodak with an electronicage culture that revolves around rushing to market products that customers want to buy , rather than slowly perfecting products that kodak wants to make we need a system where new ideas can attain escape velocity , mr fisher said wall street seems to be in mr fisher s corner kodak s shares were trading in the 40 s when he came they have steadily risen since , trading in the 70 s through this year , and closing at 81125 on friday the applause is tempered , though analysts gripe that mr fisher has been too slow to attack swollen inventories of everything from silver to office supplies , overstaffing and antiquated accounts receivables systems they question why he has not embraced digital technologies that streamline the editing process for movies , or that let companies transmit photographs via satellite still , complaints about what mr fisher has not done are often drowned out by applause for what he has accomplished they always had good technology , said jack l kelly of goldman , sachs company , but he has instilled a sense of urgency about translating it to products indeed , in just a few years mr fisher has divested kodak of some 79 billion of tangential businesses and revamped those that remained into seven profit centers recognizing that sophisticated digital technologies were as out of place in kodak s silver halide research labs as the first word processors would have been in a typewriter factory , mr fisher consolidated all digital research and development into mr unterberger s division if we had allowed digital to remain fragmented , we 'd never have attained critical mass in any product line , mr fisher said
state officials said yesterday that the new york city public school system would lose at least 30 million in state aid because the board of education had signed leases for school buildings without state approval the news , which top board officials learned at a state senate hearing on the condition of the city schools , was the latest in a series of embarrassing disclosures about the school leasing program , including reports that the board of education had overpaid millions of dollars on school leases in the last few years yesterday s revelation appeared to shock the board officials , who said they had no idea that they risked losing the state aid by the end of the day they said they would seek special legislation to recover it under a 1991 law , the board , which is paying about 60 million a year to lease 193 sites across the city , can be reimbursed for roughly half the rent on many of those leases if the state education commissioner approves them at yesterday s meeting , chancellor rudy crew looked shaken as senator frank padavan , a republican from queens , said , it s one horror story after the other , and the proceeding quickly turned into a public scolding of the board it is very strange that i have not received word of this , said dr crew , explaining that on wednesday , board officials announced they were beginning an inquiry into whether lease applications were fraudulent and that he would look into the latest development but senator padavan said , i do n't think we can let it go at that he added , just what are you doing to reform the entire leasing procedure \? the board president , carol a gresser , promised that new leasing procedures would be discussed at a board meeting next wednesday officials said on wednesday that they would report back to the board on the new leasing procedures within two months yesterday , however , they pledged to act sooner later , as mrs gresser was leaving the hearing , she said , it ca n't be possible that no one knew that the state aid was in jeopardy by the end of the day , board officials said they had discovered that some school officials had known the board was not going to get reimbursed for the rents and were working with state education officials to pursue special legislation that would allow the board to recover the money and state education officials acknowledged that the exact procedure for submitting leases had not been agreed upon until last year it s certainly not the flagrant situation it was portrayed as at the hearing , said harry spence , the board s deputy chancellor for operations i genuinely believe this is not an issue that speaks to the integrity of the leasing program this is an issue of filing claims , mr spence said asked why officials from the board s office of revenue and budget had not informed top officials of the status of the aid before yesterday s hearing , mr spence said the possibility of losing state revenue and needing to seek legislation to recover it was not alarming , but fairly routine he added , we are not going to be able to be prepared at every hearing for every issue somebody chooses to raise board officials said they would more aggressively pursue the legislation that would allow them to recover the aid , none of which has been disbursed the board is facing a 500 million shortfall in the next school year , and severe overcrowding , which prompted the officials to sign 30 new leases in the past year in a program designed to provide 15 , 000 classroom seats by 1999 at yesterday s hearing , lawmakers also derided the board for announcing an overhaul of the leasing program just this week when investigators had begun looking into allegations of profiteering by landlords last fall in december , an investigator for the school construction authority , which handles the leasing program , released a detailed report on a 12 million lease agreement on a bronx building for which , investigators said , the board overpaid by millions of dollars the report found that the landlord who signed the agreement did not even own the building investigators also said there were conflict of interest questions involving a former board official , robert a shahid , who oversaw the selection of the site and was later hired by the landlord to oversee the building s renovation the landlords are responsible for hiring contractors to do the renovations , but the contracts , for which the board has paid 130 million in the last year , have not been reviewed by board officials board officials now say they will screen landlords more closely and monitor the construction agreements the board assembled a panel of real estate experts in february to help it negotiate better deals on leases , but it was n't until earlier this month , when the daily news ran a series of articles critical of the leasing program , that officials pledged to fix the system of awarding leases obviously , for a matter of months you and others were aware of the problems that existed in the framework of the procedure , senator padavan said , looking at dr crew after the hearing , dr crew said we can spend a very long period of time laying blame for past transgressions , inefficiencies and problems the real issue is what we want to do now the chancellor added , i'm going to go back to the office now and there s going to be a lot of discussion about this
mayor rudolph w giuliani pledged yesterday that the police department would not reduce the number of officers patrolling new york city s streets and subways or the level of public safety , even as he acknowledged that he was considering a reduction of 1 , 000 officers to help balance the city s budget as the mayor and his aides continued yesterday to draft a preliminary budget for the coming fiscal year , to be presented next week , mr giuliani for the first time in his administration put himself in the position of arguing that the police department could and perhaps should have to make cuts in its force of nearly 38 , 000 officers although i think policing and safety is its no 1 priority , mr giuliani said of the city during a news conference , it has other priorities as well the mayor s remarks underscored a remarkable shift for a republican who made fighting crime his core campaign promise and who spent his first two years in office staunchly resisting calls by elected officials or fiscal monitors for significant cuts in the police department budget or in the number of officers although mr giuliani emphasized that he had made no final decisions on the budget , the proposal appeared to reflect the depth of the city s budget problems despite two years of spending cuts and belttightening , the mayor faces another gap in the city s budget estimated to have grown to at least 2 billion , or 6 percent of the current budget for the fiscal year that begins on july 1 while the city has not indicated the savings expected from such a reduction , it could reach 20 million to 30 million or more , according to fiscal monitors even police commissioner william j bratton acknowledged that much tougher times and a dearth of other options had prompted him to propose a reduction in the size of the force mr bratton s remarks , along with those of other police officials , seemed to reflect a view that some sort of cut was inevitable both the mayor and the commissioner said the department could absorb a reduction in officers without affecting the existing levels of policing and public safety because the merger of the city s three police forces last year had freed up more than 1 , 000 officers in administrative jobs at the same time , the mayor warned that he would consider further , much more serious reductions in the department if the police union won approval of state legislation that would change the way the union resolves its labor disputes with the city the mayor s office has said the legislation could cost the city hundreds of millions of dollars mr giuliani , who in 1993 enjoyed the strong support of the union , the patrolmen s benevolent association , has over the last year lobbied vigorously against the legislation the bill was passed by the state assembly on wednesday , though , and next heads to the governor s desk gov goerge e pataki has indicated in the past that he favored some version of the bill , but an aide said yesterday that the governor had grave concerns about its cost to the city the proposal for reductions in the police department drew swift and critical reaction from louis matarrazzo , the president of the patrolmen s benevolent association , who accused the mayor of imperiling public safety he also accused him of threatening to punish the union for its drive for passing the legislation to change the union s arbitration process if you cut police officers , he said , we 're going to have more crime the proposed reduction also prompted cautionary reactions from a variety of elected officials , although none declared flatly that they would oppose a reduction in officers the city council speaker , peter f vallone , said he felt an emotion somewhere between shock and surprise when he learned that the mayor was considering a reduction the council , he said , had been an architect of a state law called safe streets , safe city , which had resulted in the hiring of 6 , 000 new police officers it seems highly unlikely to us at this stage in the game , where we 've finally established a safe city , that we 're going to start diminishing the number of police officers you see in the streets , said mr vallone , a democrat from queens but mr vallone left open the possibility , saying the mayor and the police commissioner would have to prove to the democratic majority he controls on council that a reduction in officers would not affect public safety or the number of officers actually on patrol an effort both mr giuliani and mr bratton appeared to begin in earnest yesterday the chairman of the council s public safety committee , sheldon s leffler , a queens democrat , said later that the council would ultimately go along mr leffler said he believed that the police department could reduce the total number of officers without affecting public safety by forcing officers now working behind desks out into the street and , he noted , not cutting the police budget would mean additional cuts in other services , like education it makes sense , he said i think it will be supported by the council , rather than having additional cuts in other services the proposal to reduce the number of officers has come now that the state law that created safe streets , safe city is about to expire in june that program , created by mayor david n dinkins and the city council after sharp increases in crime , allowed the city to raise property taxes and impose a 125 percent surcharge on personal income taxes to pay for hiring the new officers in exchange , the city had to insure that the police force reached specific targets , peaking at 38 , 310 those mandates now expiring had protected the department from significant budget cuts during the city s nagging financial troubles of the 1990 s they have also been credited , at least in part , with the stark decline in crime rates , particularly in the last two years under mr giuliani with crime having dropped and with the city facing another budget gap , estimated at 2 billion , mr giuliani said yesterday that the police merger and other management initiatives had allowed the department to consolidate three positions into one that , he said , had freed hundreds of officers essentially in the category of , i guess the broadest way to describe it would be , desk jobs mr giuliani , saying he had not yet made a final decision on the issue , pledged that any reductions would have absolutely no impact on street strength or the ability to carry out our mission asked why he would consider cuts in the police force now when he had dismissed similar proposals previously , the mayor replied , there may be some flexibility there that was n't there before mr dinkins , who arrived at city hall yesterday to appear before an unrelated council hearing , expressed concern that the city s budget problems could erode a program he considered one of his most significant legacies and he said he hoped the current mayor would make cuts

seattle ken griffey jr stood behind the batting cage on tuesday evening , chipper and content as he accepted congratulations for winning player oftheweek honors and dealt with the line of inquisitive reporters that never seems to end in his presence on this day , though , the line of questions did evaporate baseball s original junior , gray and a little bald , but still a magnetic attraction in his own right , was about to begin his official press briefing hey , mister , i'm running for president , but they want to talk to you ! griffey joked as reporters moved hastily to where cal ripken jr sat for a firstgameofaseries media ritual that grew out of his chasing down of lou gehrig s iron man record a year ago ripken , eloquent as usual in a tizzy of attention , not only answered one or two questions about the streak 2 , 201 consecutive games and counting but he also commented on the latest distraction in baseball s most orderly , predictable life the notion that his manager , davey johnson , might shift the longtime shortstop to third base but johnson had told ripken way before tuesday night s game that the thought of moving him to another position for the first time since 1982 was less than fleeting it had flown continuity was restored little did ripken s audience realize just how much that means to ripken for after making his 2 , 174th straight start at short , all ripken did was hit a careerbest three home runs in the game and drive in a careerhigh eight runs as if cal needed icing on such a day , the man who started at third last name ripken , first name billy also homered , giving baseball s most celebrated family this side of the griffeys four home runs and nine runs batted in in a 128 victory over seattle that propelled baltimore into a firstplace tie with the yankees in the american league east as for cal , if you think that the bat did n't feel quicker and the ball look bigger given the circumstances , consider what ripken said before his monster night , regarding a potential move to third you try to prepare mentally for the game that you come out and play and it s a whole lot easier knowing where you are going to play so yes , it probably occupied some time in my mind , thinking what it would be like to try to go over what the responsibilities are and how they are different hard as it is to believe , the man who chucked aside gehrig s seemingly immovable record last september actually seemed a little lost and , dare we say , vulnerable , at that moment which raises the question as to why davey johnson would even think of rearranging his infield , and why he would do so publicly was johnson crazy \? knowing johnson , he was like a fox when the manager first speculated on the move a week earlier , the orioles were more than a little banged up and short on infielders , what with the starting third baseman , b j surhoff , on the disabled list but they were also 2419 and genuinely headed in the right direction for the first time since early april , when they appeared invincible still , oriole teams in recent years have had a way of becoming complacent , no matter where they stood in the standing and postseason visits ceased after 1983 so johnson , perhaps remembering that some of the best moves a manager can make are none at all , stirred things up just by musing in effect , johnson applied a prod , not necessarily just to ripken , though the shortstop is an historically slow starter \( ripken was hitting 250 with 22 rbi and 3 home runs before tuesday s game \) as johnson was quick and proud to point out before the pasting of the mariners , i think everybody , since this has come up , has played well indeed , the orioles are 41 since the subject of third base was broached , and they have won 12 of 16 as for getting cal s attention , johnson reveled in that as much as he reveled in the three home runs , telling reporters afterward if i have to hack him off every night to have him hit three home runs , i 'll do it maybe i 'll ask him to dh
john williamson , an electrifying guard who teamed with julius erving to help the new york nets win two american basketball association championships in the 1970 s while enhancing the image of the struggling league in the process died saturday at yalenew haven hospital he was 44 the cause was kidney problems , a nets spokesman said williamson , of new haven , had undergone dialysis for the past eight years williamson , who earned the nickname super john for his ability to light up scoreboards with a jump shot he was n't afraid to launch from anywhere or at any time , was a 21yearold highspirited rookie from new mexico state when he joined the nets for the 197374 season surrounded by talented players like erving , brian taylor and larry kenon , williamson , a muscular , 6foot2inch player , started out on the nets' bench but after new york lost nine straight games early that season , coach kevin loughery decided to start williamson he was a hardnosed defensive player , but his forte was offense , something the nets needed despite the presence of erving the move paid off , said rod thorn , one of loughery s assistant coaches that season and now a senior vice president of the national basketball association with john in the lineup , we just took off from there and went on to win the championship john was the missing link to all our success that season williamson joined the nets at a time when the aba , which came into existence in 1967 , was competing with the longestablished nba for marquee players and advertising dollars , with their offcourt battles resulting in lawsuits in 1976 , the aba s last season , williamson and erving teamed to give the nets another championship , but their contributions had far greater ramifications the nets , considered one of the aba s glamour franchises , were one of four aba teams along with indiana , denver and san antonio absorbed in a merger with the nba suddenly , walt frazier and earl monroe of the new york knicks were n't the only backcourt stars in town at the time , i think the nba felt that the nets would be an extremely important franchise to add to their league , said loughery , who remained the nets' coach after the merger we had some real good players , none better than dr j when doc left before the start of the merger season to join the philadelphia 76ers , john williamson became our top star midway through the 197677 season , the nets traded williamson to the indiana pacers , but the favorite of nets fans was traded back during the 197778 season , when the team moved from long island to new jersey during an eightyear career , which ended with the washington bullets , williamson averaged 201 points a game in the nba and 141 points in the aba his best season was 197778 , when he averaged 237 points a game in split duties with indiana and new jersey , one of three seasons in which he would crack the 20point plateau he held several nets records , most notably 22 free throws in a game , against san diego in 1978 williamson s other team records included his 40 fieldgoal attempts against buffalo in a 1978 regularseason game and 34 shots against philadelphia in the 1979 playoffs williamson scored the secondmost points in a nets playoff game , 38 against philadelphia in 1979 the late drazen petrovic broke williamson s mark with 40 points against cleveland in 1992 holy cow , you could n't stop him , said lou carnesecca , who coached the nets from 197073 and who left to take over the st john s program the year before williamson arrived he was so strong and had such great tenacity he was small , but he could score on practically anyone williamson , whose no 23 is one of five uniform numbers the nets have retired , had his biggest scoring spree in a twogame span in 1978 , putting up 40 points in atlanta on april 2 and then 50 against indiana on april 4 in today s game , a lot of guys really do n't want to take the big shot , loughery said john was never afraid to shoot in fact , he was so confident in his ability that he often felt he should take the big shot before dr j did williamson is survived by his wife , bertha one son , maurice , 27 three daughters , kali , 21 , raushanah , 19 , and shareebah , 15 , and two grandchildren photo john williamson \( the new york times , 1979 \)
pale , bosnia and herzegovina , feb 6 angered by the seizure and detention of two of its top commanders , the bosnian serbs suspended all contact with the bosnian government today and vowed to retaliate unless the men were released the dispute is the most serious to arise between the bosnian serbs and the bosnian government since the signing of the balkan peace agreement in paris in december nato officials warned that the arrest of gen djordje djukic , a senior bosnian serb officer and aide to the bosnian serb commander , gen ratko mladic , could jeopardize the transfer of the serbheld suburbs of sarajevo , which under the peace accord are scheduled to be handed over to the bosnian government in march the most commonly used routes in and out of sarajevo pass through serbheld suburbs , and bosnian serb leaders warned today that free passage for the muslims in the city , part of the peace agreement , would be discontinued if the captives were not freed there are 3 , 000 cars that travel through ilidza every day , said a bosnian serb security official who insisted on anonimity not be identified but you can be sure that if we are not given free passage by the muslims , we will not give free passage to them they are making a grave , grave mistake if these men are not freed the muslims will find themselves once again trapped inside sarajevo bosnian government officials insisted that they were within their rights to detain the men but brig andrew cumming , the british officer who directs the nato force s joint operations center , described the arrests as provocative and inflammatory it would be a pity if this encouraged a retaliatory reaction , brigadier cumming said i trust that there is a considerable maturity amongst the parties that we will not get into one of these titfortat situations people are finding it very difficult to live together again , brigadier cumming said a small thing like this could have a reaction out of all proportion the detained bosnian serb general , the highestranking serb officer now held by the bosnian government , is one of eight serbs the muslimled government arrested between jan 20 and feb 2 the circumstances of the arrests remain unclear nato officials said they were investigating general djukic , his driver and col aleksa krsmanovic , who was traveling in the car with the general , were picked up on jan 30 after apparently taking a wrong turn into government territory near sarajevo , brigadier cumming said brigadier cumming dismissed a serbian claim that general djukic was on his way to meet with nato officers , and thus protected from arrest , when he was detained under the accord , all sides have the right to arrest suspected war criminals but military activities within the no man s land separating the governmentheld territories from those of the bosnians serbs are prohibited the bosnian serbs are also asserting that bosnian government officials were within the demilitarized zone when they arrested general djukic a bosnian serb official , maj gen dragomir milosevic , said nato bore the ultimate responsibility for the arrests he accused nato troops , who patrol the separation zones , of failing to provide serb soldiers and civilians with security they were taken to jail without any explanation , general milosevic said they were unarmed colonel krsmanovic s wife , slobodanka , insisted today that her husband is not a war criminal we are waiting for the turks to set him free , she said referring to the muslimled bosnian government the bosnian government said five of the men , including general djukic , were being detained on suspicion of war crimes the general s driver and two other serbs being questioned as witnesses will soon be freed , said the chief of the bosnian security service , bakir alispahic we have evidence that not only they participated in killing civilians but also helped organize the killing of civilians , mr alispahic said of the general and the colonel mr alispahic said that general djukic participated in mass killings of civilians around sarajevo since there exists evidence that both officers were involved in committing war crimes against civilians , we were authorized and obliged to start an investigation , mr alispahic said under the accord , people suspected of war crimes are supposed to be handed over to the international war crimes tribunal in the hague none of the serbs recently detained by the bosnian government have been indicted by the tribunal but the bosnian government has asked the tribunal to send representatives to sarajevo to examine its evidence against the suspects some bosnian government officials said they would release any suspects the tribunal decides not to charge but other senior bosnian officials said that the serbs may be offered in exchange for some 300 to 400 prisoners the government says are in bosnian serb forcedlabor camps , or that they could be tried on warcrimes charges in bosnian courts the dayton accord does not address the issue of local courts trying war crimes charges mr alispahic said that three other serbs recently detained tese tesic , petar todorovic and dusan borovic were also suspected of war crimes mr alispahic said the three had been stopped in a car filled with rifles , grenades and ammunition , and were suspected of killing civilians in bijeljina , zvornik , visegrad and foca , towns in eastern bosnia the international tribunal in the hague has indicted 45 serbs and 7 bosnian croats the bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and general mladic have both been indicted for war crimes the tribunal has only one man , a serb , in its custody the only serb in bosnian government custody accused of war crimes is borislav herak , a soldier who was detained in 1993 map of bosnia and herzegovina showing location of sarajevo \( pg a6 \)

los angeles , march 9 although congress and president clinton remain deadlocked on landmark legislation overhauling the nation s welfare system , states around the country , with conservative governors and legislators in the lead , have already cut billions of dollars from welfare programs and have won waivers from washington enabling them to experiment with ways of cutting billions more as a result of these initiatives , some of the most significant welfare changes contemplated by congress limiting the length of time in which a beneficiary can receive assistance , for instance , and imposing work requirements on most recipients are already being tested at the state level the net effect of the various efforts , either adopted or pending , will have been to remove millions of people from the welfare rolls and slash the benefits of those remaining even though washington has not been able to produce a new welfare system , welfare as we know it is already disappearing , said steven d gold , a senior fellow at the urban institute , a nonpartisan research organization in washington nowhere are the changes more evident than in california , where even a county government has been led to undertake welfarecutting last week los angeles county reduced general assistance a program of cash payments that aids ablebodied adults without children and has 90 , 000 local beneficiaries by 25 percent in sacramento , meanwhile , the republican majority in the state assembly recently won passage of a measure that would impose a statewide twoyear limit on benefits to a generalassistance recipient among a number of other assemblypassed provisions is one that would eliminate welfare entirely for people who are disabled because of alcoholism or drug abuse and gov pete wilson is trying to nudge welfare recipients into the job market with his proposals not only for time limits but also for a reduction in the size of benefits if california s efforts at changing welfare have been aggressive , they are by no means uniquely so in the last year alone , half a dozen states , including ohio , pennsylvania and wisconsin , have followed an example set by michigan and eliminated general assistance altogether in the same period , 11 states , connecticut among them , have asked the government for waivers from federal law so that they can limit the duration of the assistance that they dispense under the main , 23billionayear federal welfare program , aid to families with dependent children in all , 37 states , including new york and new jersey , have now won such waivers , either to adopt time limits or to impose other restrictions , including stringent work requirements and a denial of additional benefits to women who have more children while on welfare these drives , and others , coincide with continuing efforts by the republican congressional majority to write a vast transformation of welfare policy into federal law legislation passed by congress late last year would have ended the government s sixdecadeold guarantee of cash assistance to poor children , instead giving states block grants to use for relief programs , with relatively few federal strings attached president clinton , who had initially supported a senate version of the bill , vetoed the measure that emerged from congress , declaring that it could impoverish hundreds of thousands of children despite the current stalemate in washington , few state officials doubt the inevitability of a huge shift in responsibilty for welfare , from the federal government to the states , an approach that has the backing of the nation s governors given that prospect , state officeholders say , what better time than now to design their own , less expensive welfare operations \? that sentiment has only added to an impetus for changes that stems from a variety of factors mr clinton s own 1992 campaign promise to revamp welfare thoroughly , a shift to the right not only in congress but also in statehouses around the country , popular support for the concept of government downsizing and general acceptance of the notion that welfare as it has existed since the new deal has done more to promote a cycle of dependency than anything else between the president s rhetoric of 'ending welfare as we know it , ' which moved the public sharply to the right his use of the waiver to let states experiment , and the republicans' taking control of congress , a torrent of new thinking has been unleashed on welfare , said douglas j besharov , resident scholar at the conservative american enterprise institute for public policy research am i happy with 100 percent of it \? mr besharov said no but for too many years we were on autopilot what california needed was not what michigan needed we need looser joints and the waiver program is letting us do that agreement comes from michael dubke , executive director of the ripon society , a national organization of moderate republicans , who says time limits on welfare benefits are particularly welcome individuals who are on welfare , mr dubke said , use a lot of the creative energy that could be used in the workplace on ways to stay on welfare and how to stay trapped into this system of dependency so i think that having a cutoff point from benefits is good i do n't think a twoyear time limit is too draconian
harrison , ny politics is never gentle , not even in the seemingly tranquil , eversopolite suburbs what has happened recently in this westchester county community shows how brutal suburban politics can get the facts on march 2 , a saturday , the harrison town board held a special meeting to declare that a sitting town councilman s seat was vacant because of a legal technicality the councilman , pat vetere , the only democrat on the fivemember town board , had failed to sign his oath of office within the required 30 days of taking office the town board notified the state board of elections of the vacancy and appointed a republican to fill mr vetere s seat the situation mr vetere , a thirdterm councilman , former zoning board member and wellknown political nemesis of the town supervisor , admits that signing the affidavit had slipped his mind he had been caring for his wife , who was gravely ill with emphysema more than once , mr vetere was paged by his wife s nurse during board meetings and had to rush home after his wife died on feb 19 , he was told he had failed to sign his oath under village law , the village clerk is responsible for making sure elected officials sign the oath of office but harrison is one of three municipalities in new york designated as a coterminus townvillage the mayortown supervisor , philip a marraccini , says town law supersedes village law , so the townvillage clerk was not obliged to tell mr vetere a thing the law is the law , said mr marraccini , who is serving his second term and has never faced this kind of situation before the law exists in new york state if people have problems with the law , they should call the board of elections we had no discretion in the law professionally and legally , we were correct in what we did yet it seems these affidavits of oath have never been taken as seriously in harrison as they were in mr vetere s case the local newspaper , the daily item , found that one of mr marraccini s appointees , the public works commissioner , was appointed aug 1 , 1994 , but did not sign his oath until six weeks ago the town and village books show that many elected officials , department heads and commission members failed to sign their oaths within 30 days none were removed from office and while norma brunner ponce , the town clerk , is not obliged to remind officials to sign their oaths , she took the oath book to the deputy mayor s office jan 29 , the day before the deadline , so he could sign it the deputy mayor and ms ponce are both republicans mr marraccini said ms ponce did not notice mr vetere s lapse until midfebruary by then , it was too late , he said we could only do what we are obligated to do by law but many in harrison say that this is nothing but partisan politics as usual last month , for example , mr marraccini and the republican majority voted to change electoral district lines and remove a polling place at the state university college at purchase , where the voters are overwhelmingly democrats this is a harrison tradition when democrats rule the town board , the college gets voting booths , when republicans rule , the polls are removed perhaps the republican majority expected that replacing mr vetere with the town s veteran services officer would go unnoticed or unprotested in this sprawling town of 23 , 400 residents it was wrong about 125 residents jammed a board meeting held after mr vetere was replaced to raise their objections local radio and television stations picked up the story irate letters began appearing in the daily item in my 50 years in westchester , wrote john f maloney of chappaqua , i ca n't recall a more blatant piece of skulduggery david m krug of west harrison wrote the political agenda is so thick in this latest episode that it will take a long time for the public to forget what has happened mr vetere , a construction engineer by trade , is suing the board in state supreme court to get his seat back he calls the board s action a personal vendetta against me by the town supervisor because of the overwhelming public demand , on sunday , the board removed mr vetere s replacement , and reinstated mr vetere for one year to keep his job , mr vetere must run for reelection in november asked why the board did not appoint mr vetere in the first place , mr marraccini said , we felt the position could be better filled by someone other than mr vetere frankly , mr marraccini added , i resent mr vetere for putting us in this position no one wishes more than i that he would have signed the petition book so that he would n't have put us through this
the old welterweight contender jimmy archer has a 1930 s vision he will open a gym on the lower east side of manhattan , that boiling kettle of poverty and ambition , and the tough , hungry , desperate kids will come down from the projects to be trained for the ring he will channel their intensity and teach them balance and they 'll all climb the rankings together meanwhile , archer , who is 60 , has an immediate concern about his current kid , a 56yearold political heavyweight named sid davidoff who has channeled his own intensity into a nasty jab archer has been training davidoff for a few exhibition rounds with gerry cooney , a onetime almostheavyweight champion , later this month there is reason to think that davidoff will try to throw a real punch i keep telling him , says archer , you ca n't embarrass a pro in front of a crowd you hit him , sid , he s gonna hit you back that the davidoffcooney match , part of a benefit at madison square garden on may 23 for the united states olympic team , somehow seems more interesting than the show next friday night at what is still , incredibly , advertised as the mecca of boxing \( could they get away with the vatican , the wailing wall of boxing \? \) may be some sad snapshot of current fistiana the three bouts tim witherspoon versus jorge gonzalez , evander holyfield versus bobby czyz and lennox lewis versus ray mercer are good ones , and the six heavyweights are no tomato cans but they just do n't engage our interest we 're not quite sure who all those guys are without the usual aids of sports biz , the college information directors , the sneaker marketeers , the pro league publicists and the district attorneys there s no sanctimonious coach involved in the show , no new nike , no charismatic character on the brink , not even a good felony rap boxing was once the redlight district of sports , an ugly , thrilling , illegitimate place where swells could go slumming and poor boys could get over that concept now seems archaic because sports pornography see the university of nebraska , for starters is available on cable , cassette and even at your local high school the worst of boxing its exploitation , corruption , brutality has been coopted it is very hard to keep holding up mike tyson and don king as symbols of the evils in sport when lawrence phillips and tom osborne are being waved through the toll booths of american morality tyson and king went to trial , one was jailed , one was declared not guilty at least the system paid attention meanwhile , phillips lost some money by dropping a few places in the national football league draft call it a fine for lack of character \? coach osborne , who also has to answer for a seemingly even less controlled player , christian peter , cruises righteously on osborne kept phillips on the team , he said , because the explosive running back needed athletic structure the young woman he assaulted apparently needed the help of publicity to have her safety net restrung after nebraska revoked her athletic scholarship meanwhile , the best of boxing the art , the craft , the discipline has been obscured by the deadening politics of the various sanctioning bodies and their television partners , and by the willful neglect of safety and health concerns by state and city commissions in thrall to the promoters but the drama of this most basic sport never dies here is davidoff , energetic and strong at 210 pounds , but definitely middleaged , piqued by a dream of youth this is something a guy has always wanted to do , right \? he said , sweaty and winded from three rounds with archer in the downtown athletic club gym last week archer waited until davidoff began his situp routine before rolling his eyes if i had this guy 40 years ago , yeah , i could have made him a fighter he s got that intensity , he looks you in the eye like a winner , he keeps coming you know , he actually tried to hit me , i had to , uh , tap him in the stomach last week he better not do it to cooney the headliner of this event , the chairman of the new york stock exchange , richard a grasso , a slim , 49yearold , 137pounder with an amused look , pulled off his own gloves this is not a macho thing , grasso said it s a fundraiser our first choice would have been a celebrity basketball game with the dream team , but they 're all still playing then we thought of this roy jones jr has been a big supporter grasso will box jones , a supermiddleweight champion who won an olympic silver medal in 1988 john steffens of merrill lynch will box joe frazier and joseph grano of painewebber will box mark breland howard albert , former comanager of emile griffith among others , is managing the preparations , and archer has been training the wall streeters , none of whom has boxed before these guys learn fast , said archer grasso has nice , quick moves , and davidoff , he came in here with two left feet and he punched like a girl , but he s got the eye of the tiger he must be like that in court , huh \? when i get my gym going , i 'll have them come down be an inspiration to the kids maybe , maybe not the only way to kill boxing may be to make it respectable , a college sport coached by the builders of character

have little experience in treating the cancer , a leading cause of death in men with aids mr donaldson now pays out of pocket to go to the kaposi s clinic at bellevue medical center his plan s executives defend the reliance on generalists to treat aids , and say he could have changed doctors if he was dissatisfied but the network is nonetheless revamping its treatment for people who have aids for the first time , large numbers of people with hiv and other chronic conditions are in managedcare networks , in part because more companies are placing their employees in hmo s and in part because government insurance programs are moving swiftly to place medicaid patients in such networks but hmo s evolved to meet the needs of healthy people , and few have track records with aids and other serious chronic conditions even officials who favor forcing medicaid patients into managed care are wondering whether they will need to create networks tailored for people with hiv last month , gov george e pataki announced 2 million in grants for health care companies to develop such plans , in the hope that they could be offered to medicaid patients by next year we do n't have a lot of experience taking care of hivinfected patients within hmo s , said the state health commissioner , dr barbara a debuono these hmo s are all over the lot in their care in fact , the federal department of health and human services insisted last fall that aids patients be exempt from a new york city plan to place medicaid patients in hmo s , specifically because it felt that their aids services were inadequate aids patients in managedcare networks complain of many problems from an inability to find doctors knowledgeable about the disease , to inadequate coverage for drugs , to long waits for appointments , which may be merely inconvenient for a healthy person but dangerous to a person battling a progressive disease our clients who 've been in managed care have had horrendous experiences , said charles king , president of housing works , a group that helps people who have aids the networks are n't equipped to deal with people who have hiv healthcare providers differ on whether people with aids and other chronic illnesses can be treated effectively in managedcare plans plan executives contend that their emphasis on prevention and coordinated care , including such services as counseling and nutritional advice , makes them in many ways ideal for the chronically ill in fact , we would argue that hiv and aids can be best managed in hmo s , said stephen matthews , senior vice president of managed healthcare systems , a forprofit network for medicaid recipients but many healthcare researchers say the financing procedures and incentives of conventional managedcare plans can never accommodate aids care such hmo s often receive less than 2 , 000 a year to take care of a healthy young man but at least one of the halfdozen experimental networks for people with aids requires about 50 , 000 a year to treat a patient with advanced disease susan m dooha , a senior policy analyst at gay men s health crisis , the country s largest aids services group , said i do n't have any success stories about hmo s , just a lot of complaints , and i think it s a structural problem the hmo s consistently rely on a gatekeeper to prevent overuse , which may be appropriate for healthy people like me , but is not appropriate for someone who is medically fragile i think we have to modify the plans for people with hiv although confidentiality laws make it difficult to know exactly how many people with hiv are in managed care plans , more than 30 , 000 people in new york state have aids and more than 100 , 000 are hivpositive , according to the state health department so all plans probably have such members and some have had good experiences one patient with aids , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said that his hmo , oxford health plans , had been great about approving medication and specialist referrals on the other hand , he said , he generally had to find out about new treatments on his own many networks are adamant that hiv and aids patients belong under their care and say they have tried to accommodate them mr matthews of managed healthcare said that most of the primarycare doctors in his network came from neighborhoods where they had extensive experience with the disease in addition , he said , the organization has developed programs to assist aids patients , such as assigning a nurse to help oversee their care a number of other networks have specialized programs for people with aids , including reminder cards for their periodic blood checks , but most are fledgling efforts
nairobi , kenya , dec 18 with peace talks on somalia stalled , rival faction leaders in mogadishu , the capital , have been waging street battles and hammering each other with mortars for five days in the worst fighting since july , aid workers and diplomats say at least 300 people have died , many of them civilians , even though no faction has gained any territory the renewed violence comes at a time when ethiopia has convened all but one of the clanbased political groups in mogadishu to attend talks at a resort town , sodore , outside the ethiopian capital , addis ababa though the negotiations , which began on nov 29 , were aimed at forming a new government , they have almost no chance of success , since one of the strongest factions , the habr gedir clan led by hussein mohammed aidid , has boycotted the talks diplomats say the surge of fresh fighting could mean that some factions in mr aidid s coalition do not want peace and have renewed the fighting in an effort to undermine the talks mr aidid s faction calls itself the only legitimate government , and he has refused to negotiate unless his rivals acknowledge him as president another theory is that mr aidid s main rival , mohammed ali mahdi , whose abgal clan controls north mogadishu , is behind the latest outbreak of violence because he wants to demonstrate his military strength and thus bolster his claim to the presidency during the talks in ethiopia whatever the underlying cause , the fighting has been brutal , aid workers say rival militias with heavy machine guns and rocketpropelled grenades have pushed each other back and forth across the southern suburb of medina , killing many bystanders along the way markets and hospitals have been shelled on sunday , mortars killed 40 people in the barakat market , including shoppers mr aidid s faction has accused mr ali mahdi and osman hassan ali atto , a former aidid ally who now controls an eastern slice of the city , of starting the most recent round of bloodshed neither mr ali mahdi nor mr atto , who are secluded at the ethiopian resort , could be reached for comment they broke the truce , said mohammed jama , an aidid spokesman in nairobi , referring to a 10day ceasefire they are not targeting any military places they are just targeting civilians aid workers say that as many as 900 people have been treated for gunshot wounds at hospitals since the fighting increased on friday , and at least 80 have died of their wounds the real toll is much higher united nations officials estimate that at least 300 combatants and civilians have been killed hundreds of residents have fled medina for the relative safety of the countryside mr aidid has found himself besieged on three fronts not only does he face a threat from mr ali mahdi in the north , but he is also fighting forces loyal to mr atto , and forces allied with musa sudi yalahow , a relative of mr ali mahdi s who holds medina aid workers say it is still unclear if mr atto and mr ali mahdi have joined forces to drive mr aidid out of the city so far , mr ali mahdi s forces in north mogadishu have limited themselves to shelling mr aidid s territory and making a show of force along the green line dividing the town if he were to invade southern mogadishu , it would signal an allout battle for control of the city what is clear , though , is that mr aidid is becoming more and more isolated politically and besieged militarily diplomats say there are signs that his support among the habr gedir clansmen is eroding as well , though no one has broken away yet mr aidid , 34 , a former united states marine , succeeded his father , gen mohammed farah aidid , who died in august the younger mr aidid was elected president of somalia by his own supporters , but he and his government have been rejected by the other faction leaders aid workers say mogadishu appears to be doomed to periodic battles because the faction leaders cannot find a political solution to the question of who will rule the country the latest round of fighting is the third since april , when mr atto s group split away from the rest of the habr gedir clan and began fighting with general aidid s faction a second surge of fighting welled up in july and august , during which the elder mr aidid was shot and killed while fighting in medina being unable to find a political settlement , they regularly try to take over militarily , said an aid worker , who insisted on anonymity but so far none of the rival groups have developed the military ability to dislodge mr aidid nobody has the power to do a knockout blow , said a diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity
newburgh , ny lieut gov elizabeth mccaughey ross was hurtling through the hallways of the free academy high school in this hudson river mill town early this month when a bellbottomed teenager innocently asked a loaded question just what does the lieutenant governor do \? asked rose wissig , a sophomore ms mccaughey ross , momentarily perplexed , paused long enough to touch the lacy scarf around her neck , then answered briskly , i do everything i can to help the governor by all accounts , gov george e pataki and his top advisers would take issue with that job description in what has become an open secret in albany , the governor and his aides have locked the lieutenant governor out of their circle with mistrust growing on both sides , they have left her uninformed of major policy decisions and stopped inviting her to important meetings they have , in effect , consigned her to political purgatory , a sentence that has driven previous lieutenant governors to grumble , rebel , even quit her problem , in their eyes , is that she has violated the cardinal rules of her job , namely stay in the governor s shadow , do only what he asks and , above all , do n't wear your ambitions on your sleeve while tensions between the governor and his lieutenant date back to the 1994 campaign , they have clearly escalated in recent weeks after published reports that ms mccaughey ross was plotting to challenge senator alfonse m d'amato , the governor s friend and political mentor , in the 1998 republican primary ms mccaughey \( pronounced mccoy \) ross , 47 , denies the reports , but few people close to the governor seem to accept her story mr d'amato , she says , is not returning her calls even the usually amiable mr pataki has become lukewarm in his public comments about her i think she s done some very positive things , was all he could muster when asked recently about her as for keeping her on the ticket , he said , we 'll look at the politics of '98 when we get a lot closer ms mccaughey ross s supporters admit she is nothing if not independent , individualistic and ambitious that is , almost constitutionally unfit to be a lieutenant governor she does n't listen to them , said fran werner , former chairwoman of the queens county republicans she seeks her own counsel but they want it to be , 'how high' they do n't want anyone who is independent but despite rampant republican talk of omitting ms mccaughey ross from the 1998 ticket , at least one person contends that things are just fine ms mccaughey ross i think if members of the administration had real grievances , she said , they would speak and be identified i do n't think anyone would say , on the record , that i have been anything less than loyal and committed to the governor because it is just not true in her view , she is a team player i am very ambitious to do a good job , she said , denying ambitions for higher office i will be very proud if people say , 'you are doing an excellent job as lieutenant governor' the governor s aides many were interviewed but none would speak publicly about ms mccaughey ross say the d'amato incident was merely the last straw in a series of perceived transgressions , among them issuing press releases without approval and contradicting administration positions in public but ms mccaughey ross , who insists that she rarely contradicts the governor , steams ahead unfazed , unfettered and unrepentant she continues to issue a stream of news releases and give speeches without asking permission , mr pataki s political handlers say she is raising money more than 163 , 000 in the last six months like someone preparing to run for another office and she is packing her schedule with public events across the state , garnering the type of media attention that annoys her critics as much as it seems to delight her as she swept through two newburgh schools on feb 15 conducting research for her latest project , a review of public education , the lieutenant governor presented the very image of a thinktank scholar turned politician , which she is one moment she was firmly gladhanding politicians and smiling for group photographs the next she was firing questions at teachers and students while autographing notebooks for students at the gidney avenue memorial school , she managed to sign her own notepad and give it away \( she got it back \) later , she offered advice to the budding capitalists who ran the school s bookstore you want to undersell , but not too much at the high school , she sat in on a ninthgrade algebra class , bringing along a homework assignment unable to repress urges to be the smartest in the class , she repeatedly raised her hand and shouted out answers i cheated , she admitted to the confused teenager sitting next to her i did these last night during the car ride back to manhattan , where she lives , ms mccaughey ross said that she became interested in public education after reading a fourvolume 1993 report on the state s schools she recalled fondly that in 1994 , she embarked on the project that made her famous a scathing critique of the clinton health plan titled no exit in similar fashion by calling a friend in washington , getting a copy of the 1 , 364page bill and then reading it all

maybe it s contagious maybe it s women s tennis that s burning out , and not just those teen tykes who play it or maybe the game s just suffering from a shortterm case of shootingstar syndrome the proven superstars , steffi graf and monica seles , are perennially injured , but even if perennially healthy , they have never generated the charisma or the rivalry of such predecessors as chris evert and martina navratilova the perennially popular gabriela sabatini quit at 26 , as did japan s superstar , kimiko date anne worcester , the tour s devoted chief executive , is subjected to perennial criticism of her leadership , which errs on the side of the benevolent rather than the dictatorial , and is the subject of perennial rumors about her imminent ouster if sisterhood is supposed to be powerful , then what has gone awry with women s tennis , once the role model for the rest of women s professional sports \? maybe the unrest on the part of the tournament directors who ante up 37 million in prize money despite being undermined by notoriously unreliable player fields , lack of interest on the part of network television executives , ennui on the part of the top players and backbiting on everybody s part has come about because all the sisters are pulling in different directions it would n't be the first time after all , it was the threat of a palace coup two years ago by the powerful international management group , which was sick and tired of the sport s rudderless approach to the business of marketing itself , that provoked worcester s hasty installation as ceo of the frightened women s tennis family in the first place and what a family it is women s tennis continues to be run by committee , positions of internal power continue to be as much inherited as earned , and the constituents , like the players , tend not to trust each other too much according to one wellplaced source , women s tennis is n't on its deathbed , but it is ailing according to another , the wounds are largely selfinflicted and already worcester , who was made captain of this ship mainly because she did n't scare anybody , has enemies how can a corporation this insular be this divisive \? the answers are clear now img , which represents most of the top players and owns a significant portion of tournaments , is also the marketing agent for the tour through 1999 now sara fornaciari , an agent and tournament promoter who was once a candidate for the job worcester got , is head of the players association , the job worcester was poised to take before she became ceo now ray benton , known for shepherding jimmy connors to big bucks on the senior circuit , has been hired to represent the interests of the marquee players and holds their vote on the tour s board since benton s the only relative newcomer to the bunch , it was left to him to pipe up and admit that the bloom is off the rose at one point , women s tennis was certainly the preeminent sport for women , and now its position has either been eclipsed or shared , said benton , who met with all the top players and came away convinced that they have lost their enthusiasm i do n't think the sport is falling apart by any means , but it appears it does n't have the kind of dynamics it had in the past and with the top players , you 're up against that old adage of how do you tell somebody who s making 5 million a year that something s wrong \? instead of the political cause celebre that billie jean king and her peers championed with such passion 25 years ago and philip morris and its subsidiaries bankrolled until two years ago , women s tennis for 1997 is a quagmire of vested interests some are jaded some are insatiable , and none share an agenda according to worcester , who holds the tiebreaking vote on a board made up of tournament , player and international tennis federation reps , nobody wants to experience shortterm pain for longterm gain not even the players are united the marquee performers believe they 're overworked , and the rankandfile players accuse the top players of reaping financial success from the sport without giving back to it although the top 10 players are required to play 12 tournaments per year , in the past two years only four of them fulfilled their commitment their failure to do so has had its repercussions how can the sport deliver a blockbuster television package , or demand increased prize money , when it ca n't count on its players to show up at curtain time \? our product is our player field , said worcester , who insisted the new ranking system for 1997 does represent a radical change for the better under the old system , players were actually rewarded with ranking stability by not playing now there s a yearly race for points , so players enhance their standing by playing more often , especially if they 're top 10 contenders the elite players who meet their commitment of 12 events , plus grand slam events , plus the yearend chase championships now qualify for a 3 million bonus pool the carrot is the bonus pool the stick is the penalties , said worcester , who noted that the penalty to top players who withdraw from tier 1 events has escalated from 10 , 000 to a minimum of 25 , 000 last year , the women s tour , which costs 6 million to operate , was sponsorless and used its savings to get by this year , the software giant corel , in the first year of a threeyear deal , pumped in 4 million , and fees from international television brought in an additional 3 million it was progress , but not enough to soothe those who believe the corporate community has tired of women s tennis because it has failed to package its stars like superstars there has been speculation of another img coup , but worcester thinks that s unlikely there s speculation the international tennis federation and the grand slam tournaments will splinter and run their own tour that might force an alliance of the men s and women s tours and would open the women s tour to a takeover from without there s also speculation that things will limp along unchanged , at least until a genuine superstar emerges and rejuvenates the game if you look at the game itself , the actual tennis is better than ever , pam shriver said what s missing is the pizazz
millions of people participate in health plans that use managed care for their mental health benefits a growing number are complaining that in the name of saving money , managed care companies are denying essential mental health services , and as a result patients are suffering the consumer affairs agencies in california and rhode island take such complaints seriously enough that they have begun investigations of how managed care companies handle psychiatric claims and in massachusetts a group of patients and mental health therapists are suing blue cross blue shield over what one harvard psychiatrist in the suit calls deceptions , disincentives and intimidations that effectively prevent many patients from receiving the advertised mental health benefits managed care executives deny any such pattern , and many contend they are merely bringing much needed discipline to a corner of health care that for years had little or none article , page c9
the rangers , who have passed the first step in their quest for this year s stanley cup , are still paying for the stanley cup they won two years ago george nicolau , the national hockey league s impartial arbitrator , has ruled that the rangers owe four players from their 1994 championship nearly 250 , 000 in playoff bonuses nicolau also ruled that they owe one of those four and a fifth player bonus money for last year s playoff , bringing to 277 , 850 the combined playoff bonuses the rangers presumably had hoped they would n't have to pay the arbitrator issued his ruling last friday in an 18page opinion , a copy of which was obtained by the new york times yesterday the decision came in a case in which the league and the club , believed to be acting at the league s urging , contended that the rangers did n't have to pay the bonuses because they were negotiated with other clubs before the rangers acquired the players in trades the case , which nicolau heard last january , was not a complete loss for the nhl the arbitrator also ruled that clubs hereafter do not have to pay qualifying for the playoffs bonuses to players they get in trades unless they agree at the time of the trades to pay the bonuses the bonuses teams do have to pay , nicolau ruled , are those that players negotiate for winning or advancing to particular playoff rounds the league , citing an earlier nicolau decision in another bonus matter , argued that the bonuses do not travel with traded players but the nhl players association countered that the previous case was not relevant to the ranger bonuses in question in his decision , nicolau noted that neil smith , the rangers' president and general manager , readily agreed that the very purpose of obtaining players at or close to the trading deadline is to achieve success in those future contests nicolau ordered the rangers to pay nick kypreos 112 , 850 , glenn anderson 40 , 000 and craig mactavish 25 , 000 for their stanley cup contributions he also said esa tikkanen was entitled to the 100 , 000 the rangers had paid him under protest for the 1994 playoffs , though he has to return 40 , 000 the club initially had paid him under its own bonus plan in addition , the rangers must pay kypreos and petr nedved 20 , 000 each for last year s playoffs none of the the five players are still with the rangers smith did not return a telephone call seeking comment on the ruling
georgia race issue oozes into a campaign georgia s first black congresswoman , cynthia a mckinney , found her attempt to win a third term harder after the united states supreme court ruled last year that the state district map was unconstitutional because race was the predominant consideration in its design under the map redrawn for 1996 election by a panel of federal judges in georgia , ms mckinney will run in the new fourth district , which hugs the eastern side of atlanta and is 64 percent white she had represented the 11th district , a largely rural area of central georgia that was 64 percent black while her three challengers in the july 9 democratic primary each a white , male lawyer have said they do not want to make race an issue , it emerged last weekend through a small article in an atlanta weekly newspaper called creative loafing it said louis farrakhan , leader of the nation of islam , was planning a fund raiser for ms mckinney calling the report completely false and with no basis at all , ms mckinney demanded a retraction and got one on wednesday but the episode reminded her campaign how easily , if not intentionally , race could become a major factor in the election bill fletcher , ms mckinney s media consultant , said he did not suspect any of her challengers played a role in planting the item but he said there was a racially charged atmosphere of politics rolling across the south and vowed that ms mckinney would stay above it we 're not going to become a victim , he said if our opponents are saying to us , 'hold still , little piggy , while i stick you , ' they will be destroyed missouri where obscurity faces incumbency just as democrats in georgia yearn to derail speaker newt gingrich s bid for a 10th term in congress , missouri republicans would love to oust representative richard a gephardt , the minority leader , who is seeking an 11th term but republican efforts in missouri are likely to prove no more successful than the democrats' in georgia eight republicans have entered the aug 6 primary to oppose mr gephardt , and while three have run for the seat before none of the republicans are particularly well known in the heavily democratic district , which includes parts of st louis and communities to the southeast while daryl duwe , communications director of the state republican party , and earl lionberger , the st louis county republican chairman , both acknowledged that two candidates from st louis , deborah wheelehan and peter kelly , were the frontrunners , neither of the officials knew much about the two they said mr kelly is a former marine who works as a technical writer , and they had no idea what ms wheelehan s background was efforts to reach her by telephone were unsuccessful the fact that nobody knows anything probably dictates their chances , mr duwe said , adding that he doubted any republican in the district could unseat mr gephardt this year he s got all kinds of money , mr duwe said , and democrats in that district are absolutely solid behind him texas democrats reject tobacco support citing a state lawsuit against tobacco companies , the texas democratic party has decided that it will no longer accept campaign contributions from the industry bill white , chairman of the state party , said it wanted to avoid even the appearance that tobacco industry contributions could be regarded as an attempt to influence public officials this does n't pass the smell test , mr white said to take money from somebody whom the state government is suing sure runs the risk of appearing that they 're trying to influence public policy the lawsuit against the tobacco industry , to recover healthcare costs caused by smokingrelated illnesses , similar to suits in other states , is being led in texas by dan morales , the attorney general and a prominent democrat in the state mr morales filed a 4 billion lawsuit against tobacco companies last march mr white said it would have been awkward for the party if the tobacco industry financially supported events mr morales attended while contributions from the tobacco industry made up only about 5 percent of the 1 million received by the state party last year , mr white said philip morris , the world s largest cigarette maker , was the party s single largest corporate donor texas republicans sneered at the democrats' decision it s typical democratic grandstanding , said ernest angelo , a texas representative to the republican national committee and i assume they are going to ban all democrats from smoking at their convention lester van pelt 3d , a spokesman for the state republican party , said the party would continue to accept contributions from the tobacco industry tom lauria , a spokesman for the tobacco institute ,

washington , oct 12 with bob dole off the campaign trail and in strategy meetings with aides , jack kemp and speaker new gingrich assailed president clinton and his administration with a vengeance today on the issue of ethics mr kemp , who had been criticized as failing to attack the clinton administration forcefully enough in the televised vicepresidential debate last week , today accused the administration of an arrogance of power and hiding behind half truths when bill clinton took office , he promised to have , in his words , the most ethical administration in history , mr kemp said , giving the republican response to the president s weekly radio address but four years later , the words that seem to characterize the ethics of this administration are words like travelgate , filegate , independent counsels and possible presidential pardons later in the day , mr gingrich , campaigning in his home district in georgia , accused the president of soliciting illicit campaign money from foreigners , harboring drug addicts in the white house and opening united states borders to illegal immigrants with aids he also revived his assertion , first made in 1994 and denounced by the clinton adminstration , that drugusers make up onequarter of the white house staff , accusing mr clinton of choosing to shut an onsite fbi liaison office rather than expose guilty staff members on inauguration day , they 're breaking the law and doing drugs , mr gingrich told an audience at a restaurant in roswell , ga , the reuters news agency reported two days later , they 're in the white house this must be the most disciplined set of addicts in the world , because none of them has ever used drugs once since they joined the white house staff the day s presumably orchestrated events were the latest evidence that mr dole s campaign had settled on a surrogate strategy , in which representatives of the candidate instead of mr dole himself make attacks on mr clinton this approach reflects both the fact that mr dole himself has seemed uncomfortable about making such charges , and the calculation by the campaign that mr dole cannot risk feeding the public perception that he is already overly partisan by being the point man on such attacks with mr dole still trailing in national polls , a dole aide said the campaign expected more surrogates to be bringing such matters to the fore in the three weeks left before the election as a precursor to today s strong attacks , william j bennett , a senior adviser to the dole campaign , predicted on friday that the campaign would indeed be raising questions of public trust about the administration but as soon as mr bennett made his comments , dole aides pointed out that his comments were only suggestions and not a new strategy that the campaign would follow mr dole , and especially mr kemp , has been reluctant to criticize mr clinton s character and ethics , even though polling suggests that those issues are among his most politically vulnerable spots in the last few days , both mr dole and mr kemp have been criticized by some republicans for not hammering the president on those issues as the dole campaign continued to debate its strategy , the clinton campaign spokesman , joe lockhart , today accused mr dole and his aides of thinking out loud about how and whether to attack mr clinton as a means of getting the news media to focus more sharply on the president i think all of this public rumination about whether or not to go negative is for your benefit , mr lockhart told reporters on air force one while flying to colorado for campaigning by mr clinton they want to keep the story alive for a couple more days they have no message as for mr bennett , mr lockhart added , i must have missed the chapter in his book where spite , envy , hostility and negativity are virtues he was referring to mr bennett s best seller , the book of virtues \( simon schuster , 1993 \) for some time now , aides to mr dole aides have been split over whether he should become more aggressive in an effort to narrow president clinton s strong lead in the polls or whether mr dole should top off his 35year career in washington by taking the high road if history is any guide , attacks by surrogates will not get quite the attention they would get than if mr dole made them himself but they are certain draw attention to ethics issues that have surrounded mr clinton depending on the response in the next few days , the tactic might also help the dole campaign decide whether mr dole himself should raise the issues at the presidential debate on wednesday in san diego until his radio address today , mr kemp had refused to be drawn into a combative role he told mr dole before accepting the vicepresidential slot that he did not want to be the campaign s hatchet man despite his comments today , mr kemp insisted that he still had not engaged in a personal attack on the president we do n't believe in disparaging anyone s personal character , he said bob dole and i have never done it , and we will not start now but we have a duty to talk about this administration s posturing and their public disregard for the very standards they set for themselves later in the day , on the cnn program evans novak mr kemp said his criticism was aimed at public issues , not personal ones i'm not an attack dog , he said bob dole does n't want me to be one yet , mr dole does not want to play that role , either , having done so in his past to his own detriment on the campaign trail , mr dole emphasizes his own trustworthiness and questions the president s , but he has stopped short of the kind of remarks mr kemp delivered today nelson warfield , mr dole s campaign spokesman , said for all the charges and countercharges that swirl around in a campaign , you can count on one thing that bob dole wo n't attack the president s personal life
back in the 1980 s , i was walking down a street in woodstock when a volkswagen microbus pulled over and the scraggly haired driver asked , can you tell me where the rock festival was \? at the time , i was in woodstock , england the woodstock festival of 1969 , and its 25thanniversary sequel in 1994 , did n't happen in woodstock , ny , either the first one was in white lake , ny , 60 miles away in sullivan county the second one was closer to woodstock , in the neighboring ulster county town of saugerties yet a hippie mythos still clings to woodstock itself , where my wife and i recently spent a long weekend tucked among bucolic and sometimes spectacular catskill scenery , with a fulltime population of 6 , 290 \( as of the 1990 census \) , woodstock is the counterculture s country retreat , where the upstate woodlands meet the new age it s a haven of hearthbaked bread , folkrock on the local radio station \( wdst , at 1001 and 969 fm \) , art galleries , artisans and spiritual seekers under houses of worship , a chamber of commerce brochure lists not only the dutch reformed church but also a tibetan buddhist monastery among the various welcome to woodstock stickers at local stores , one reads , if you lived here , you 'd be om now yet despite its legendary name and a century of experience as a tourist magnet , woodstock remains a friendly , closeknit small town there is no traffic light at woodstock s main intersection , where tinker street meets rock city road , and the cluster of stores stretches just a few blocks on a recent friday afternoon , before the weekend influx from new york city , tinker street was populated by women without makeup and men with ponytails people in their 20 s and people in their 50 s all wore the ponchos and fringed buckskin , patched jeans and embroidered shirts of the international peasantwear economy running shoes were the only sign of the 1990 s still , the shoe store in the center of town featured birkenstocks woodstock drew utopian free thinkers long before the 1960 s during the 19th century , according to alf evers s comprehensive woodstock history of an american town \( overlook press , 1987 3950 \) , it was an industrious \( and none too environmentally conscious \) hamlet , logging hemlock trees from the catskill mountainsides and using the bark to tan leather in 1902 , a wealthy englishman , ralph radcliffe whitehead , started an arts colony , byrdcliffe to realize the ideals of the arts and crafts movement , it would produce oldfashioned handmade goods and run a summer arts school handicrafts could n't support byrdcliffe , but painters , potters , musicians , weavers and actors had discovered woodstock the art students league , based in manhattan , opened a woodstock summer school in 1906 , and other groups of artists soon followed the maverick colony , just across the town line , drew social reformers , visual artists and performers and presented summer festivals from 1915 to 1931 , the real woodstock festivals in 1921 , factions of the communist party convened at the overlook mountain house hotel and united as the communist party of america through the 1920 s , artists , theater people and the tourists who arrived to gawk at them kept woodstock thriving rockers arrived later , when bob dylan and the band settled upstate in the late 1960 s and recorded music from big pink and the basement tapes other musicians , including a jazz contingent , are still in the hills , descending to play rock at the tinker street cafe or the joyous lake , the town s two rock clubs , or jazz at the intimate auditorium of the kleinert james arts center wellknown bands like phish record albums in the wooded privacy of bearsville studios we visited the woodstock historical society , which displayed a newspaper clipping from 1929 , headlined nude bathing parties offend an exhibition of paintings by woodstock artists included a striking selfportrait from the early 1930 s by petra cabot a young woman with a modish black hat and a confident gaze a woman with long white hair walked in and told the caretaker , i must have that painting , so i can photograph it it was ms cabot , who smiled as she looked at her selfassured 21yearold self oh , we had some great times , she said woodstock , we kept realizing , is a place unto itself it is a town where the biggest , pushiest crowd we saw was the one that mobbed the biweekly saturdaymorning usedbook sale at the library we had been told about it by the proprietor of readers' quarry , a small but wellorganized used bookstore if i see you there , she said , i wo n't be able to talk i 'll be too busy peace and apples one attraction during our weekend visit was the town s harvest festival like other town fairs , it had a local apple farmer demonstrating an antique cider press but being woodstock , it also started with a peace ceremony , a parade of schoolchildren with assorted national flags a man walked by wearing a crystal the size of a dill pickle around his neck a teenager had a saucepan for a hat on the outdoor stage , the group women who drum followed a hebrew blessing with a seneca peace prayer
moscow , july 30 when its devoted readers reached into their mailboxes this morning for russia s oldest and most famous communist newspaper , they came up with a big surprise nothing pravda , the ponderous organ of communist thought founded by lenin and his bolshevik comrades in 1912 , one of the enduring icons of the soviet era and probably history s most inaccurately named publication \( pravda means truth in russian \) , has ceased publication a victim of many modern ills in the newly competitive marketplace , none have hurt the paper as profoundly as its inflexible desire to cater to a vanishing communist readership the paper , which once served 11 million people each day and spoke with the absolute , leaden authority of the kremlin , has shriveled badly in the years since the soviet union disappeared in 1991 it now has fewer than 200 , 000 subscribers , and the paper s owners , two greek millionaires who believe in free enterprise and say they lost millions on the paper , have fought frequently with the communist staff after a series of new squabbles in the last week , which ended when the owners were barred by the police from entering their own building , they finally pulled the plug there is no discipline at the paper , said theodoros giannikos , who along with his brother christos is a director of pravda international , a company they control that has pumped millions of dollars into supporting the newspaper since they took it over in 1992 the editors and reporters drink too much they publish nothing worth reading they say they are a paper of the opposition and we oppose them because we oppose their politics that is nonsense even the papers that support the government are more aggressive critics than pravda mr giannikos said that if he could not replace the staff laws here make that almost impossible pravda subscribers would receive instead a relatively new weekly publication , pravda pyat \( pravda five \) , a slick tabloid that publishes leftist articles but specializes in crime , sex and death can you believe that this has happened \? asked pravda s editor , aleksandr a ilyin , who was preceded in his job by stalin and nikolai bukharin , among others if they no longer want us , we will have to find people who do that will not be easy there is little call left in this country for a newspaper that devotes its pages , as pravda recently did , to the 90th birthday of aleksei stakhanov , the legendary soviet hero who mined coal at a rate no human possibly could nor is there a place in a rapidly changing russia for a paper to simply deposit truth into the minds of its readers for generations , however , that was pravda s job there is no news in pravda and no truth in izvestia , was one of soviet life s more commonplace sayings about the nation s two great news organizations unlike pravda , however , izvestia , which means news , has sloughed off its past , embraced the market reforms of the new era and become the nation s leading liberal newspaper pravda has always been the clearest bellwether of soviet thought we are taking power alone , lenin wrote the day after seizing the winter palace in 1917 and establishing bolshevik rule having taken power we will punish with an iron hand the enemies of the revolution and the saboteurs we will give them the dictatorship of the proletariat lies were the special talent of the soviet leadership , and as its official mouthpiece , pravda was the best showcase for that talent the experience of the first few months during which the compulsory labor camps have operated on the basis of selffinancing have produced positive results , the newspaper said on aug 30 , 1922 , describing the origins of what would become the largest system of death camps in modern history pravda was often the only place a reader could turn to to get a sense of what mattered to the soviet leadership when stalin ran it , the newspaper set the dark tone for the vast repressions of the 1930 s , using letter campaigns in which writers always assumed and later proved to be fictitious demanded the death penalty for enemies of the people when khrushchev replaced stalin in the 1950 s , his reforms and ultimately his attacks on stalin were enunciated in the newspaper by the time the last soviet leader , mikhail s gorbachev , left office in 1991 , the paper had become the newsletter of perestroika , his program of openness but even then , pravda always did the bidding of the kremlin when boris n yeltsin was purged by mr gorbachev from the communist hierarchy in november 1987 , it was pravda that gave soviet citizens the news , in remarkable detail two full pages were devoted to mr yeltsin s forced removal , and the reports were filled with comments intended to make mr yeltsin then the most outspoken supporter of democracy among the russian leadership look foolish and evil his actions should be considered a kick below the belt to perestroika and all muscovites , one party official said incidentally , i , as a member of the moscow party , would separate myself from boris nikolayevich in his guilt , another said , referring to mr yeltsin in many ways the paper , at least under communism , stood alone it never ran ads , for instance , and was distributed almost at no charge news did n't matter there rarely was any and former correspondents who visited the offices talk of seeing the pages completed by lunchtime the day before publication propaganda was pravda s business , and before the fall of communism business was always good but russian papers now face many of the pressures that confront their colleagues in the west newsprint is expensive , advertising essential but tough to find a niche also matters , but a niche among aging pensioners who have little disposable income is not something most businessmen would wish for i understand pravda has been seen by people like you as a symbol of the great soviet union , said aleksandr a prokhanov , the editor of the extreme nationalist newspaper zavtra and a leading intellectual of the russian opposition but if it finally is going to disappear from the political culture we should not take it as such a tragedy it s a sad note , of course , just some more proof about our lost nation but it has been a long time since pravda stood on firm theoretical ground , he said since gorbachev s time it has become the slackest of opposition papers slack and feeble nobody should go soak himself in gasoline because pravda may die it will probably return but it wo n't matter it has already been dead for years a chart accompanying the article misstated the date on which pravda published an article by stalin on collectivization it was nov 7 , 1929 , not 1928 photo lenin in his study at the kremlin in 1918 chart looking back as told by pravda a sampler sept 27 , 1918 on taking rations from kulaks , prosperous landed peasants whom the communists considered exploiters the commissariat of social security has confirmed the necessity of stripping all the kulaks and bourgeois elements , both rural and urban , of their rations the surplus thus obtained will be used to increase the rations of rural and urban poor the rations of the poor were not increased , and millions died of starvation nov 7 , 1928 stalin s article a year of great change appeared in pravda it spoke of the radical change that has taken place in the development of our agriculture from small backward individual farming to largescale advanced collective agriculture he concluded by saying , we are advancing full steam ahead along the path of industrialization while that was true , collectivization has widely been judged as one of the great disasters of soviet life , killing millions and turning successful farms into useless plots of dirt june 18 , 1936 the draft of the stalin constitution reflects a fact of exceptional importance , the full equality of rights enjoyed by the intelligentsia this was published as stalin began to imprison , shoot or send to siberia every intellectual suspected of disloyalty sept 26 , 1968 communists in the fraternal countries could not allow themselves to remain inactive in the name of an abstract principle of sovereignty while watching one of their number fall into the process of antisocialist degeneration in august 1968 , sovietled forces invaded czechoslovakia to oust a liberalizing communist government
a genius in hollywood s dictionary , orson welles once said , is someone who is either unavailable or dead welles died in 1985 he has been a genius for more than 10 years now , and hollywood pays him tribute in get shorty , john travolta recites dialogue from memory as he watches touch of evil , the welles film noir that bombed in 1958 and has been gaining admirers ever since in the player , robert altman mimics the endless tracking shot that opens touch of evil brian de palma did the same in the bonfire of the vanities ed wood goes one better and resurrects welles himself , in a 50 s hollywood setting the practice of quoting touch of evil actually goes back to alfred hitchcock s psycho \( 1960 \) , which played variations on a scene of janet leigh marooned in a spooky roadside motel and touch of evil is not even welles s bestknown movie citizen kane , which welles directed , produced , cowrote and performed at the age of 25 , haunts hollywood no end the latest homage is oliver stone s nixon , which lifts great chunks of kane a rainswept mansion glimpsed through an iron gate a mock newsreel biography a tyrant regarding his wife down an elongated dinner table the central motif of bernard herrmann s score hundreds of films have made similar obeisances , if none quite so brazenly as nixon welles is what american directors want to become , or overcome he has not , however , ascended to an untouchable pantheon there is still furious debate about the meaning of his career biographies appear every few years the latest is simon callow s orson welles the road to xanadu \( viking \) , covering the years up to 1941 and citizen kane a video documentary , the battle over citizen kane , is being shown this week at the sundance film festival in park city , utah , and broadcast on monday , jan 29 , on pbs it traces parallels between welles and william randolph hearst , the newspaper tycoon who inspired kane , then tried to have it destroyed both the documentary and the book paint welles as a man doomed to artistic failure the idea that welles directed kane and little else of consequence is a myth that refuses to die touch of evil alone ought to annul it in the last few years , other littleknown achievements have reemerged it s all true , his aborted brazilian documentary restored versions of othello and macbeth , shot on shoestring budgets in the late 1940 s and early 50 s a video release of f for fake , welles s meditation on the art of forgery even a reconstruction of his unfinished don quixote that a nearly complete feature film , the other side of the wind , remains unreleased means that a final judgment cannot be rendered welles remains elusive for other reasons for one , he still looms so large as a personality , or a succession of personalities arrogant boy wonder , international bon vivant , sad old man that it is difficult to appreciate his silent work as a director second , he leaves an ambiguous legacy for film itself he had the aura of a showman , but at the same time his jagged style consistently put off the general moviegoing public he seemed to delight in building up great expectations and then completely confounding them oliver stone notwithstanding , he is still the most radical filmmaker who has ever worked in hollywood the man a thricetold tale of rise and fall the story of the young welles , who came roaring down from chicago and conquered american theater , radio and film by his mid20 s , is astonishing in itself , although it stands apart from his maverick film career he made his professional stage debut at the gate theater in dublin , as a 16yearold on a summer trip he later claimed that he had lied his way into the job , saying he was a famous new york actor it is one of the caustic little triumphs of mr callow s entertaining , endlessly carping biography to show that welles said no such thing he lied about his lying that s the churlish way to look at it you could also say that welles was a great storyteller he established himself in new york by directing mostly classical repertory in startlingly offbeat settings his first productions all had revolutionary impact a voodoo 'macbeth' with an allblack cast the cradle will rock , marc blitzstein s leftist musical julius caesar in fascist guise \( ian mckellen s 1930 sera richard iii , now in theaters , is another bit of wellesian legacy \) he was also furiously prolific on radio , mixing melodrama and documentary realism in the notoriety that resulted from one of his experiments , the panicinducing war of the worlds , he gained a contract at rko pictures to make six movies , with total creative control arriving in hollywood , he instantly aroused rabid dislike and envy nearly a year went by without results , despite talk of an adaptation of joseph conrad s heart of darkness almost in desperation , welles seized on a pet notion of the screenwriter herman mankiewicz , to make a film a clef about hearst less than a year later , citizen kane was complete despite technical excellence in every department , it was notable above all for the headlong force of its storytelling welles attacked his subject from all sides and angles , gaining more from the process of the search than from the small secret discovered in the end
detroit , march 11 the effects of a weekold brakefactory strike rippled across north america today , with the general motors corporation s closing of 14 assembly plants and 16 parts plants from chihuahua , mexico , to oshawa , canada today s layoffs turned the strike into the largest auto industry work stoppage in recent years , surpassing a 1992 strike at a gm parts factory in lordstown , ohio , that idled 43 , 000 workers at nine assembly plants the walkout by 3 , 200 members of the united automobile workers at two gm brake factories in dayton , ohio , idled 58 , 000 gm workers elsewhere today , as assembly plants ran out of brakes to install and stopped building cars and trucks companies across the continent that supply gm with parts also began reviewing today whether to shut down their operations the strike has halted production at nearly half of gm s 29 assembly plants in north america and forced the furlough of a sixth of its north american work force it is probably costing gm 30 million to 40 million a day , said scott f merlis , an independent automobileindustry analyst in westport , conn gm began the strike with a very large inventory of cars and fairly large supplies of popular pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles spot shortages of some popular vehicles could develop if the strike continues the strike has also delayed cars that customers order from factories because gm s operations are so vast and affect so many other industries , the strike already appears to have lasted long enough to have a small but measurable effect on the united states' overall economic output in the first quarter , said paul d ballew , a longtime federal reserve economist who recently joined j d power and associates , an auto industry consulting firm even if the strike ends quickly , gm may not be able to resume full production quickly it could take them a good week , mr ballew said they 've got to get dayton back up and running , you 've got to get parts back in the pipeline despite the damage from the strike , union and company negotiators in dayton have gone three days without even trying to hold talks there are none and there are none scheduled because we seem to be very far apart , said james m hagedon jr , a gm spokesman there were some informal contacts in detroit between union and company officials over the weekend about 300 of the 3 , 200 striking workers in dayton continue to enter the factories each day with the uaw s approval to produce brakes for the chrysler corporation and american isuzu motors inc some uaw hardliners have criticized the unusual arrangement tom lewis , the union s strike chairman , said today that these workers remained on strike against gm itself and carried picket signs when they were not inside the factories the strike is ostensibly about whether general motors has kept a 1994 pledge to continue buying almost all of its brakes and brake parts from the dayton factories gm says that while it now buys some brake parts elsewhere , overall employment at the factory has edged up because other parts are now being made there the union says the company should build many more parts there and hire more workers but , more broadly , the uaw is fighting to keep its control over the production of auto parts as well as the final assembly of cars and trucks gm , the ford motor company and the chrysler corporation are all trying to buy more parts from outside companies that have lower costs and typically have lower wages the extent of these purchases will be a central issue when the union s national contract expires on sept 14 , auto executives and union leaders say strikes at parts factories are also costeffective for the uaw , because it only needs to pay 150 a week in strike benefits to several thousand workers at one or two factories when big auto companies then lay off tens of thousands of workers at assembly plants and other parts factories , the laidoff workers quickly qualify for state unemployment compensation , possibly driving up gm s unemployment insurance costs for years to come about 7 , 300 workers at gm s saturn division were idled this afternoon when the company shut down its operations in spring hill , tenn but those workers went into training sessions and maintenance work instead of being laid off , because they had a separate contract

you wo n't find it in dante s inferno , but there is apparently a 10th circle of hell , wherein writhe those foolish enough to be hollywood screenwriters this image of satanic tortures inflicted on fragile literary egos dates at least to the days of faulkner and fitzgerald , and it has only grown darker and more surreal think of the player , the robert altman movie from michael tolkin s novel , and the coen brothers' barton fink now andrew bergman , a historian , novelist and playwright who is best known as a writer and director of engagingly quirky , goodnatured films , has come up with his version of a screenwriter s season in hell , a play called working title , at the american jewish theater mr bergman would seem to be just the man to give a giddy new flourish to a threadbare subject he has certainly worked hard at extending the boundaries of this one , turning a selfflagellating , marginally talented writer s battle against a studio into a consideration of nothing less than mortality and judaism it is all the more disappointing , then , that the fresh , eccentric spirit that infused such movies as the freshman and honeymoon in vegas here seems wan and cramped perhaps mr bergman whose broadway play social security , a work of more limited ambitions , was similarly artificial requires the big , splashy canvas of the screen to make his vision come fully alive working title , directed by max mayer , mostly feels like a very wordy treatment for a play it s all high concepts , as the film industry would put it , without the organic sense of character and emotion to make it stick together the title in working title refers to a screenplay by alan teichman \( david chandler \) , an obsessively neurotic writer who is waiting in a long island beach house to hear a producer s verdict on his latest effort alan obviously favors monumental historical themes his last movie , a stinker called madrid , took place during the spanish civil war his new script , tentatively called stuttgart , is about the holocaust the selfdeluding alan claims , in one of the play s better lines , that writing stuttgart has made him feel more like a victim , in a positive way subsequent events which include a tropical storm and a car accident involving a nazi war criminal force him to take a closer , if skewed , look at his identity as a jew alternately helping and torturing alan through assorted crises are his fedup wife \( susan blackwell \) , his older brother \( jerry grayson \) , his babyfaced agent \( douglas weston \) and a loud , philosophizing producer \( john seitz \) , with an entertainingly lopsided view of american history , who has just married an actress \( gia carides \) , with whom alan once had an affair mr bergman brings what is undoubtedly an insider s view to these familiar types but in the wake of many insiders' views of such characters , they remain dispiritingly familiar in his movies , mr bergman makes the outrageous ordinary it becomes their element here , the bizarre feels as unassimilated as a dopey party mask despite some deftly shaped oneliners , the running jokes like one about the designer calvin klein starring in alan s disastrous play almost never take off and a selfconsciously outre plot device , which pairs a fatal car accident with a specific sexual act , has in fact been used before , in john irving s world according to garp none of the actors is bad but there s a tentativeness in both the performances and the direction , as if no one has quite decided what the tone of the play should be this is because mr bergman has n't , either he has said that this play represents an exploration of my own worst vision of myself but as a film maker , he has always demonstrated a generosity of spirit that leavens satire with sweetness here , working in a darker , more cynical vein , he is atypically uncomfortable , and working title itself seems stalled somewhere in the fabled development process it parodies working title by andrew bergman directed by max mayer sets by peter harrison lighting by jeff croiter costumes by laura cunningham sound by aural fixation assistant director , karen ott production stage manager , julie hyman presented by the american jewish theater , stanley brechner , artistic director at 307 west 26th street , chelsea with susan blackwell \( laura teichman \) , david chandler \( alan teichman \) , jerry grayson \( bobby teichman \) , stephen o 'reilly \( donnie dinardo \) , john seitz \( harry crane \) , gia carides \( marie oldam \) and douglas weston \( sandy littweiler \) photo david chandler , left , as an obsessive screenwriter in workingtitle , with susan blackwell as his wife and stephen o 'reilly as a tennis pro \( gerry goodstein working title \)
the agreement was reached in april after nearly two years of sometimes bitter wrangling between mayor giuliani and the city council the mayor was allowed to permanently pull the plug on about a third of the city s 16 , 300 fire alarm boxes , but none in poor neighborhoods , where many residents lack phones now , more than a month after the mayor signed the bill sealing the compromise , the fire department has yet to begin restoring more than 4 , 000 alarms removed last fall , in what was to have been a 45day test , in east new york , jamaica , the south bronx , parts of midtown manhattan and other neighborhoods and many residents want to know why fire officials say they cannot reactivate the alarm boxes because of an injunction issued by judge robert w sweet of federal district court in manhattan in a suit filed by lawyers representing 65 , 000 deaf and hearingimpaired new yorkers the suit had challenged the fire department s initial plan , which called for disconnecting all alarm boxes citywide the fire officials say they need to straighten out some conflicts between what the council wants them to do and what the lawyers representing the deaf people have been demanding before they begin reactivating some alarm boxes and removing others for example , the compromise with the council calls for all remaining alarms to be wired directly into the 911 emergency phone system , but the deaf plaintiffs' lawyers have objected , arguing that it would be safer for the fire alarms to go right to fire dispatchers in each borough , fire officials said but the lawyers representing the deaf new yorkers contend that settling the remaining issues like wiring should not get in the way of restoring the 4 , 000 alarms that were disconnected the injunction is clear that it does n't prohibit the installation of the alarm boxes , said franklin siegel , a lawyer for the center for constitutional rights who is one of the lawyers for the deaf and hearingimpaired plaintiffs he said he was willing to work with the city s lawyers to clarify their concerns judge sweet had ordered the fire department not to continue removing alarm boxes , because , he said , deaf people would be unable to use pay telephones to call for help under the compromise reached in april , the mayor retreated from his original plan to dismantle the entire fire alarm system , which he said would vastly reduce false alarms and save the city about 45 million a year in maintenance costs he agreed with the council to keep in place and modernize some 9 , 900 of the city s 16 , 300 alarm boxes in poor neighborhoods , all boxes would be retained and in the rest of the city , the number would be reduced by about half instead of having one every two blocks , as they have on average now , those neighborhoods would have a box every four blocks msgr john powis of st barbara s roman catholic church in bushwick , who was a plaintiff in another lawsuit filed last year to block the city s plan , said that people have been asking him when the fire department would restore the alarms that had been removed we were really glad that at least in the poorer neighborhoods they were going to keep the fire boxes , he said but the bill was signed by the mayor in may and nothing s happened alan finder photo a disconnected fire alarm box \( chang w lee the new york \)

washington to get to olmec art of ancient mexico , the hypnotic display of precolumbian sculpture at the national gallery of art in washington , you descend underground , leaving daylight far behind the exhibition of 120 works , many of them textbook masterpieces on loan from mexican collections , is installed in the museum s concourse galleries , which wind underneath the east wing the choice of location was a practical one the sculpture that opens the show , a 10ton , 7foothigh carved stone head of an olmec ruler , is the single largest object ever installed in the museum , and only a basement floor , reinforced with steel rods for the occasion , could support it this cavelike space is also , as it happens , symbolically apt most of the objects on view , from a massive basalt altar to a pair of thumbsize jade hummingbirds , are religious in nature for their makers , divine power lay at the center of the earth , from which lifegiving rain emerged and to which their deified leaders returned after death the national gallery s dramatic shadowandlight installation might even be taken as a visual metaphor for the stillmurky state of scientific knowledge about the olmec , who lived in western and central mexico some 3 , 000 years ago and were the first mesoamerican people known to have created a body of permanent images but were the olmec a people , ethnologically speaking \? or does olmec more accurately describe an artistic style that enjoyed a long , productive life throughout much of central america \? \( the name itself , derived from a word for rubber , was in use at the time of the spanish conquest , but its application to archeological finds has always been inexact \) over questions as fundamental as these , scholarly opinion remains divided after all , the olmec , whoever they were , made answers hard to come by they left no written records their social and spiritual beliefs , embodied in spectacular ritual implements , are a matter of guesswork and the identities of the subjects commemorated in colossal stone portrait heads and exquisite jade masks have passed into dust all of which renders exhibitions like this one invaluable another was the olmec world ritual and rulership , a larger show of small objects organized at princeton university last winter \( the washington show , which runs through oct 20 , is organized by the national gallery with the consejo nacional para la cultura y las artes \) accompanied by catalogues with uptodate information , these exhibitions turn a dazzling searchlight on an understudied field and on an art that is , in ideological complexity and beauty , second to none that art was produced by a people whose iceage ancestors had crossed the bering strait from asia and moved down through north america to presentday mexico after thousands of years , the olmec culture emerged a hierarchical society with kings , priests and shamans at its head and an art that served as a template for the great mayan and the aztec styles that followed for all its influence , though , olmec work has utterly distinctive features , beginning with its conception of its central theme , the human body the signature olmec images for modern viewers , for example , are clay figurines of chubby , naked babies they usually sit upright , stubby legs spread as if to maintain balance their outsize bald heads are elongated and flattened , a sign of physical beauty achieved through the practice of binding skulls in infancy the facial features are unmistakable almondshape eyes , fleshy cheeks and sensuous , full lips , often drawn downward as if in a pettish scowl with their puffy and swollen eyes , these mostly male figures often look as if they had just been roused from a deep , dreamhaunted sleep the meaning of the figures is a mystery , but their features recur everywhere in olmec art , not only on figurines , but on the adult faces of the two monumental stone heads included in the show , and on the evocative seated figure in the justly famed sculpture known as the lord of las limas , named after the site of its discovery at a glance , the image might be taken for a beseeching woman carrying a sleeping or dead child in her lap , and it was worshiped as a madonna by the christian indians who found it in fact , the larger figure is male , possibly a priest in the act of ritually offering up an infantile being with a human body and a jaguar s head this composite creature , referred to as a werejaguar , bridged earthly and divine realms and carried immense supernatural power shamans sought to assume its form both through the ritual use of hallucinogenic drugs and through the practice of physically strenuous yogalike forms of meditation a ceramic acrobat in the show , his body contorted so that his feet touch his head , may well in fact illustrate just such a discipline in action and an extraordinary group of figures gathered in a single vitrine trace the shaman s transformation from human to humananimal to divine in a mesmerizing , visionary sequence animals themselves are depicted in both secular and religious objects a tiny blackware ceramic pot in the shape of a fish , found in a grave , and another of an incense burner in form of a duck , are evidence of the detailed and observant response of olmec artists to the natural world that response can be unsettling the huge stone portrait heads , for example , are grimly expressive rather than comely and a small carved figure of an aged , emaciated woman clutching her pregnant belly is a fevered , disturbing idea of nature , in the form of a mother goddess simultaneously dying and giving birth yet in the hands of virtuoso olmec artists , sculptural naturalism can also assume a truly glamorous , otherworldly beauty it is hard to imagine , for example , beings more different from the grotesquely conceived old woman than those depicted in the lifesize jade masks , a dozen of which are installed about midpoint in the show they were apparently intended to be worn ceremonially by the living and by the dead , and some were kept as heirlooms \( examples have been found in the ruins of aztec temples \) in almost every case , breathtakingly refined modeling is used to create deeply felt portraits of individuals , some looking sternly obdurate , but others gently smiling with vivacious , if tentative , joy the vivacity and humanity of olmec art is nowhere more dynamic than in the show s concluding image , the famous figure known as the wrestler , which is on loan from the national museum of anthropology and history in mexico city with his seated body twisted forward , his arms raised as if fighting a strong current , his bearded face resolute but calm , he merges the ideal and the real in human form as surely as any sculpture produced by greek artists centuries later and in olmec art of ancient mexico , his powerful frontrunner pose seems especially apposite it is as if he were pushing centuries of shadows aside and bringing to light the vibrant , foundational , ancient culture of what we so paradoxically call the new world photos a lifesize jade ceremonial mask is among 120 olmec works on view at the national gallery of art a tiny blackware ceramic pot , above , is in the shape of a fish the lord of las limas depicts a priest making a ritual offering of an infantile being with a human body and a jaguar s head \( photographs from the national gallery of art \)
hempstead , li , aug 12 these are tough times for wayne chrebet , the popular jet who made it last season against all odds as the jets' receiving corps has filled up with highprofile draft choices and free agents , chrebet suddenly finds himself returning punts and trying to stay in the mix of pass catchers but chrebet made it with the jets because he refused to be deterred even though he was only 5 feet 10 inches , weighed 185 pounds played for hofstra university here on long island and was the 10th man on a 10man receiving corps the spidery , tough chrebet somehow made the jets and prospered in what otherwise was the worst season in jets history , he snared 66 passes , the fifthhighest number by a rookie in national football league history but today , in addition to catching passes , chrebet was doing another kind of catching in practice snaring punts he could become the jets' regular punt returner it was a role he tried for the first time during last week s exhibition loss to the eagles , and he did remarkably well , averaging more than 15 yards a return on five attempts , including a return of 26 yards chrebet s time returning punts was abbreviated today after he was kicked in the thigh during a return in two preseason games , he has caught more punts than passes he is yet to produce a reception and this is before keyshawn johnson appears in a game i spoke to rich kotite about returning punts , said chrebet before today s practice for saturday s game against the giants and i understand it would be added on to my receiving , not in place of chrebet believes he will remain a key offensive player , that his role will not diminish to return punts means chrebet has to devote practice time when he would otherwise be resting none of the other receivers is being asked to return kicks chrebet remains a firstteam player , along with jeff graham , on the team s depth chart that shows a lineup with only two receivers graham was signed by the team as a free agent from the bears , for whom he set a team record for yardage gained by a wide receiver last season but after getting graham , the jets also drafted johnson as the top pick in the draft they did n't stop there on round 2 they selected another wide receiver , alex van dyke from the university of nevada then , with johnson negotiating his contract well into training camp , the team signed another veteran wide receiver , the free agent webster slaughter whatever they want me to do , i 'll do , said chrebet , but he added , i'm a receiver chrebet in a dual role could enable the jets to cut a player from another part of the roster jeff sydner is listed as the club s no 1 punt returner but even before sydner hurt his ankle against the eagles , the plan was for chrebet to return punts the jets would like to have john hudson as a long snapper he is good at it , but does little else on the club sydner , too , does n't have another role then there is the kicking situation nick lowery will kick field goals , but pat o'neill is challenging long kicker don silvestri and punter brian hansen wherever they can , the jets want to save a roster spot thus , o'neill is challenging two players a double role for chrebet could also let the team drop sydner and keep hudson arthur weiss , chrebet s agent , understands that this shift to punt returning could be sticky , especially if the other receivers move ahead of chrebet this is a business of perceptions , weiss said , and wayne will always fight the perceptions he s this little kid out of hofstra the offensive coordinator , ron erhardt , said today he had no idea where johnson would wind up in the depth chart wayne knows the offense , erhardt said we can put him in , and he knows the plays as far as who starts for the jets , erhardt said that s for television and the writers we really have about 14 or 15 starters sometimes we have three or four wide receivers sometimes we have two tight ends chrebet said he was obsessed about being no 1 or no 2 the feeling i got is they 're not trying to do the punting with me instead of having me catch , he said we often go right in there with three and four receivers i 'll be in there somewhere extra points keyshawn johnson said the cramps he suffered in both calves at the end of his first workout on saturday were the result of rustiness and the change in weather from los angeles especially when you 're out of shape , he said after what he described as the worst game of my life , otis smith is sharing time at right cornerback with the rookie ray mickens the jetsgiants game on saturday at giants stadium will not be televised if it is not sold out by thursday about 14 , 000 seats remain photo wide receiver and \( maybe \) punt returner wayne chrebet with the offensive coordinator ron erhardt yesterday at jets camp \( steve berman for the new york times \)
a new study of efforts to privatize public education concludes that experiments have thus far failed to show any substantial results toward improving education or cutting costs the study , hard lessons public schools and privatization , concludes that privatization efforts dating to the 1970 s show little in the way of educational improvement instead , the report says , they can produce backsliding in terms of social equity and local control of education the study was published by the twentieth century fund , a liberal research group , and written by three education and public policy experts at new york university on the basis of a wide range of evaluations that have already been done , the outcomes and cost reductions that were promised have not materialized , said robert berne , an educational policy expert who is one of the authors the study looked at a broad range of programs , including forprofit ventures in the public schools , school vouchers and the partnership between boston university and the chelsea , mass , public schools other experts say the report reflects the bias of the educational establishment and uses data selectively to make its case where you stand is where you sit , said denis p doyle , a visiting fellow at the conservative heritage foundation let s face it , there are some people for whom public education is the ultimate temple of civic virtue , and to question it at all is unacceptable the report s authors , carol ascher , norm fruchter and mr berne , who is now vice president for academic development at nyu , conclude that privatization has failed to deliver on its proponents' promises that the free market can produce better schools at lower costs than public education bureaucracies the authors examine evaluations of plans to contract out educational services dating to the 1970 s , when socalled performance contracting was a major thrust of educational innovation between 1969 and 1972 , more than 200 school districts contracted with private groups to provide remedial instruction for lowincome students in none of these sites , the report says , did performance contracting meet its promises to improve students' test scores in some cases , its students did less well than corresponding groups of control students the report reviews recent illfated ventures like the unsuccessful attempt by education alternatives inc , a forprofit group , to operate schools in baltimore and hartford it does not review the fledgling edison project , another forprofit venture , because no results on student achievement are available the authors say any efforts to allow private companies to operate public schools for a profit is clouded by a fundamental problem the districts most desperate for new ideas are usually too poorly financed for costs to be reduced , and the districts rich enough for a private company to find ways to cut costs generally have contented parents with no interest in outside management some of the report s conclusions are likely to be disputed douglas a sears , superintendent of schools in chelsea , mass , said the partnership with boston university was not a form of privatization , and he disputed the report s contentions he said the report was based on outdated information , adding , we are showing steady progress in test scores and christopher whittle , founder and general partner of the edison project , which runs 12 forprofit schools in 8 cities in 6 states , said the report drew premature conclusions about the failings of contracting with private groups to provide public education and had looked at experiences that are not comparable what eai did in baltimore , and particularly in hartford , is literally on the other side of the moon from attempting to do partnerships in one school within a system , he said it s like saying a mainframe is the same as a pc
washington , jan 10 denouncing what he called corporate welfare , senator bob dole , republican of kansas , said today that a housesenate conference committee should not approve the big telecommunications bill until the committee changes a provision that would give television broadcasters a chunk of the nation s airwaves worth tens of billions of dollars in a detailed speech from the senate floor , mr dole sent the clearest sign yet that he might block the telecommunications bill , which would overhaul laws for almost every segment of the industry mr dole has indicated that he is prepared to stand his ground against the politically powerful broadcasters the provision would essentially reserve a portion of the crowded radio spectrum for digital television services , like highdefinition television , interactive services or the transmission of as many as six programs simultaneously over a single channel currently , one channel carries one program at a time mr dole said that the federal communications commission had estimated that the broadcasting spectrum that would be made available was worth about 40 billion on the open market , mr dole said the taxpayers would be giving too much to big media companies i question whether telecommunications reform is worth the television broadcasters' price , said mr dole , the senate majority leader who is the leading republican candidate for the presidential nomination let s , for the sake of taxpayers and for the sake of the american consumers , fix this one corporate welfare provision before we have to vote on it , he said mr dole first objected to the broadcasting issue nearly two weeks ago but today s speech was more detailed and carefully prepared , and he delivered his remarks in the televised forum of the senate floor , where he would be sure they would be heard his opposition was the most serious challenge of the provision , which has been the focus of intense lobbying by broadcasters for years walt wurfel , a spokesman for the national association of broadcasters , said he could not comment on mr dole s remarks until he saw them but officials of the broadcasters' association have repeatedly argued that access to the spectrum is crucial to broadcasters trying to enter the digital age , who have said that they would give back their current analog television channels once viewers have made the switch to digital television that change would require either new television sets or converters the fcc is expected to give its stamp of approval later this year to a new broadcasting technology that was originally developed for highdefinition television the technology offers pictures with movielike sharpness but can also be used to send any other form of video or computer data but fcc officials , including the chairman , reed e hundt , have been increasingly skeptical about simply giving every existing television station a second channel for digital services industry lobbyists have pushed hard for language in the communications bill that would take the matter out of the agency s hands in his speech , senator dole said the telecommunications bill did not guarantee that broadcasters would surrender their current portion of the broadcasting spectrum to the public , and that the bill would allow broadcasters to use the spectrum at no charge as long as they used them for advertisersupported free television services let me get this straight , he said america lends broadcasters spectrum so they can increase their profit margins , but they do n't think it s fair to pay rent the provision has long sparked opposition from consumer advocates and many conservative economists who have long argued that the broadcasters would be getting access to licenses worth billions of dollars at the same time that the federal government is selling licenses for satellite and wireless telephone services i say hallelujah the conservative politicians are finally realizing that this is cyberpork , said gigi sohn , deputy director of the media access project , a nonprofit consumer advocacy group that has argued that broadcasters should either assume heavier public obligations or help finance some public broadcasting ventures but the television broadcasters , who own stations in every congressional district and are heavy political contributors through the national association of broadcasters , have until recently persuaded both democrats and republicans to lend them these licenses for a transition period of at least 15 years house and senate negotiators thought they had reached agreement several weeks ago on the telecommunications bill but the final agreements were disclosed only to encounter complaints from many rankandfile house republicans none of the house republicans have complained about the spectrum issue , however , which could prove to be a more difficult battle

perhaps the only word heard more frequently than character in the days leading up to the yankees' inspirational world series comeback against the atlanta braves was the word team never used lightly in joe torre s clubhouse , team was always meant in the familial sense so it was particularly fitting that when the yankees won the franchise s first world series since 1978 , they did so not only as a team but as family players , coaches , the manager , club officials and clubhouse boys welcomed their wives , their children , their mothers and fathers to witness their dance of joy immediately after the 32 victory that clinched the world series at yankee stadium on saturday night there stood torre , the manager who put such a human face on this organization that even the most ardent yankee haters had to pause torre stood , clutching his 10monthold daughter , andrea rae , and talking of his older brother , frank , who on friday had successful heart transplant surgery that s why this feels very good , to win it for joe , the things that he has been going through , bernie williams said , speaking for a team that saw in torre not just a leader , but a mentor and a friend torre had to be deft to make it work he had to masterfully weave so many personalities , nationalities and stars torre let the team ride the emotional waves created by the feisty mariano duncan the manager asked cecil fielder to meet his reputation as baseball s most respected big daddy , and the former tiger first baseman excelled , especially in the series torre also asked the proud tino martinez to understand that fielder had to play martinez , indispensable in the regular season , complied without complaint , exemplifying how this team meshed so well and understood why it had to , just as the amicable backup third baseman charlie hayes and the sometimes parttimer fielder had before him it seems like every player , at some time or another had something to do with an important win for this team , said paul o'neill , who also fell into a platoon in the series but saved the second of his two hits a double to start the winning rally in the yankees' 32 victory over the tough greg maddux in the sixth and final game of the series this is just a wellblended team , said wade boggs , who watched his platoon partner , hayes , snare a foul ball for the final out and set off a celebration that is still rocking the apple and you 've got to have all aspects of the game to win to make such a roster work meant selflessness and an innate understanding of their roles perhaps no one grew into his role more confidently and with greater results than williams the center fielder spoke saturday night in a quiet corner at the lip of the trainer s room , surrounded by his wife , waleska , his mother , rufina , and his younger daughter , bianca as he answered questions , it was hard to tell whose smile beamed brighter as williams s burgeoning charisma easily kept pace with the center fielder s blossoming talents usually unassuming , williams was as giddy as a school boy after the yankees' victory and during his triumphant lap around a raucous yankee stadium i was so emotional , williams said it was just a great feeling to go out there and show the fans that we all had our goal accomplished , especially against such a great club bob watson , the general manager who greeted each of the championships at the lower levels with bittersweetness because of his tortured relationship with the club s owner , george steinbrenner , accomplished a goal of sorts , too he rediscovered his smile after the team he in large part designed won it all hugging his wife , carol , watson did not gloat instead , he remained true to his quiet demeanor , but was less defensive and resigned than he had been in recent weeks it s been a tough , tough road , and i did n't expect it to be any different , he said to win something like this , when you have to scuffle and fight for it , makes it more gratifying my cuban cigar that i have upstairs and the champagne i'm going to sip are definitely going to taste good then there was john wetteland , the most valuable player in the world series the emotions are usually as well padded as the pitcher is when he dons the equipment of a roller hockey player and skates grimfaced to his own drummer in the underground byways of ball parks but saturday , wetteland sparkled the pitcher who set a series record by recording four saves , gushed , thanking his wife and best friend , michele moments before , boggs had stood on the field with his wife , debbie , crying as he looked to the skies above the brightly lit and joyfilled ball park in the bronx and swearing he saw the smiling face of his deceased mother the sight was stunning because boggs s demeanor is usually all business , with very few peeks allowed inside the human hit machine but there he stood , displaying tears that had not been seen flowing in public in 10 years , not since a young red sox third baseman watched from the bench as the 1986 mets celebrated their world series championship over a snakebitten boston club later , boggs displayed nothing but an incandescent grin you always think back and sort of take in what the mets were feeling when they were celebrating and i just wanted to be a part of it , he said the sands of the hour glass were running back and it was so hard getting back in '86 , i thought i was going back , but it took 10 years to get there and in perhaps the most poignant scene , darryl strawberry stood in the middle of the clubhouse , oblivious to the champagne still spritzing about him , his concentration on hugging his wife , charisse , and summing up the moment he once had every right to doubt he might ever enjoy again for the former met , who once danced on the mound at the expense of boggs and the red sox , saw life come apart in the aftermath of this city s last championship saturday night , strawberry , reserved and much more mature , quietly addressed second chances on the field and off , and talked of a life now marked by sobriety and atonement for the years of desperation and drug use , of spousal abuse in a first marriage and convictions for tax evasion i truly understand it , i accept it , i appreciate it more than anything after the things i 've experienced in life , strawberry said of his second series victory just having the opportunity to be back in new york and being able to deal with it and being able to play for a manager like joe torre again , the common theme torre was not to be overlooked joe torre believed in all of the players and none of the players were selfish , strawberry said we all had understood our roles , put it together , worked as a team and it worked out well now , strawberry says , the selfless team and its inspirational manager will get what they deserve , a tickertape parade down the canyon of heroes in lower manhattan tomorrow no one , strawberry believes , can possibly enjoy it more than he will in '86 i was young and my celebration was a little bit wild , he said with a smile now i can celebrate it being sober as the prodigal son prepared for the kind of embrace only new york can give , all around him his yankee teammates basked in their own accomplishments and their camaraderie new york s extended family of champions photos john wetteland and

albany , feb 5 setting the stage for a confrontation with the pataki administration , assembly democrats threatened today to subpoena records from two former officers of the private corporation that raised at least hundreds of thousands of dollars for the governor s lavish threeday inauguration last year charging that the administration had repeatedly rebuffed their efforts to obtain the corporation s records , the democrats also announced today that they planned to hold public hearings next month at which they would try to compel many of the republican governor s closest aides to testify about fund raising for the inaugural maybe they ca n't give us documents , but when called to testify , they could give us their view on how this corporation operated , said assemblyman paul tokasz , a buffalo democrat and chairman of the elections committee , one of three assembly committees investigating the inauguration the private corporation , called inaugural '95 , was formed just after mr pataki s election in 1994 to raise money for his inauguration so that no taxpayer dollars would have to be spent at the time , zenia mucha , the governor s director of communications , said the corporation would abide by state campaign contribution limits and disclose the names of all donors but the corporation did neither , allowing many companies to give more than is allowed under state campaign laws and then , in november , announcing that it would not release a list of contributors or any accounting of its activities last month , the three assembly committees sent letters to over a dozen pataki advisers and republican officials requesting records relating to inaugural '95 mr pataki s aides contend that the corporation , which was dissolved in november , raised about 600 , 000 but the democrats , based on their conversations with some contributors , say the total was closer to 14 million in almost every case , the pataki advisers including three state commissioners as well as the governor s director of communications , counsel and chief of staff either said that they had none of the records or failed to answer at all in response , the democrats today sent a second round of letters to lawrence kalkstein , the inaugural corporation s lawyer , and charles j palombini , the corporation s former chief officer it is imperative that you immediately comply with our requests , the democrats' letter said your failure to do so will render the issuance of a subpoena necessary democratic officials said they would give the two men a week to comply before issuing the subpoenas in an interview today , mr kalkstein declined to say whether he would fight a subpoena in court but he said the democrats had no right to the documents they were demanding i told them they are not entitled to anything , he said we did n't do charitable work or any work that would require public disclosure there is no reason for the government to interfere with the operation of a private client but democrats contend that the corporation served a fundamentally political purpose and should abide by state campaign finance laws ms mucha called the democrats' demand beyond sad ms mucha herself has been asked for records and said that she had none both the board of elections and the attorney general have said these committees have fully complied with the law , have paid their taxes , ms mucha said it s time to move on calls to mr palombini s office were not returned in late december , attorney general dennis c vacco , a republican , said he believed that the inauguration corporation and a second corporation , transition '95 , set up to help finance the governor s transition to the office , had not violated any laws however , state sen richard a dollinger , a rochester democrat who had requested mr vacco s inquiry , criticized mr vacco s findings as partisan and called on him to appoint an independent investigator mr vacco refused ms mucha said in november that the names of contributors had been kept secret not just from the public but also from mr pataki and his advisers so that they would not feel pressured to do favors for donors but democrats charged that mr pataki s aides were actually worried that disclosing donors' names would lead to embarrassing revelations about inaugural contributors receiving favorable treatment from the administration the democrats also expressed doubts that mr pataki s advisers had as little knowledge of inaugural '95 as they have claimed , noting several links between the corporation and the administration mr palombini is one of mr pataki s chief campaign fundraisers mr kalkstein is a partner in the peekskill law firm that the governor s chief counsel , michael c finnegan , once belonged to robert boyle , the corporation s original chief officer , was appointed by mr pataki to be chairman of the jacob k javits convention center and state commissioner of economic development , charles a gargano , was chairman of the committee that arranged many inaugural events mr gargano was also mr pataki s chief fundraiser in the 1994 campaign mr gargano said today that some of his fundraising knowledge might have rolled over into his work for the inauguration but he said he was not an officer of inaugural '95 and had none of its records
for much of its history , the new york city school system has struggled with the question of where decisionmaking should lie at the center , with the chancellor and the elephantine bureaucracy at 110 livingston street , or out on the periphery , with locally elected school boards that would be more responsive to their communities for the last 26 years , much of the power has lodged in the city s neighborhoods community school boards made up largely of people without professional training in education have been choosing superintendents and principals of elementary and junior high schools last night , lawmakers in albany voted to return the balance of power to the center , giving the schools chancellor the power to hire the superintendents of the city s 32 local school districts and giving those superintendents the power to hire principals of the elementary and junior high schools \( high school principals have always been chosen centrally \) with that , the role of the neighborhood school board members has been rendered more advisory it s the effective end of the new york city decentralization experiment , said robert berne , vice president for academic development at new york university and an expert in school governance while local boards existed before decentralization , they were essentially toothless until 1970 , when they gained hiring powers if the community school boards have indeed been eviscerated and all the details were not yet absorbed by educational experts last night critics contended that the change was overdue , given the long record of scandal and incompetence on many boards under the local boards , a school system that was once a national urban model was plagued with schools that year after year could not teach students to read or calculate effectively moreover , many board members engaged in petty thievery and flagrant patronage some school board members stole pianos , protected cocainesniffing principals , hired relatives as school aides and appointed administrators because the candidates paid bribes some boards become key dispensers of legislative patronage as the embarrassments and scandals mounted , impartial panels repeatedly studied ways of overhauling decentralization but the legislature could never agree on any significant changes many legislators , including the assembly speaker , sheldon silver , a manhattan democrat , and state senator guy j velella , the bronx republican who is a sponsor of a senate version of a school reform bill , had political roots in the community school boards that date back to a period of upheaval in the late 1960 s decentralization came after a tumultuous conflict that polarized the city and sent political leaders searching for a compromise that could please both neighborhood groups and the powerful teachers union through much of the 1960 s , minority groups had been chafing at the sputtering drive for integration and the poor record of the schools in educating black and hispanic students demands for community control of schools grew and three experiments were set up , including one in the ocean hillbrownsville neighborhood of brooklyn while the teachers union initally lent its support , it turned against the experiments in april 1968 in a dispute in ocean hill over the transfer of 13 teachers and 6 administrators the battle led to teacher strikes that closed 85 percent of the city s schools for a total of 55 days in the aftermath , the state legislature passed a law that gave 32 elected boards the power to run elementary and junior high schools but the teachers union made sure the law provided strong protections for teachers' jobs the decentralized system has been troubled from the start , but a confluence of circumstances made change possible this year , experts say through a flurry of suspensions , the school boards have repeatedly been put on notice that their days as powerhouses were numbered , but many refused to change their traditional ways of operating schools chancellor rudy crew , in office just over a year , proved a popular leader whose rapid suspensions of board members he accused of corruption carried weight with a wide spectrum of legislators mayor rudolph w giuliani established a genial relationship with dr crew and eventually abandoned city hall s call for a board of education controlled by mayoral appointments that contentious issue , as mr berne points out , had made it difficult for the legislature to compromise the legislators avoided a welter of issues that had paralyzed them in years past they did not tamper with the size of the central board of education or how it was selected they did not eliminate the community school boards themselves or change the method of election legislators focused largely on how the professionals who run the system were selected by letting the chancellor rather than the school boards pick the superintendents , the legislature reversed the thinking of 25 years ago that lay people could make these decisions more responsively than trained educators
test your antibiotics iq have you ever asked a doctor to prescribe an antibiotic when you had a cold or the flu \? do you sometimes stop taking a prescribed antibiotic when you are feeling better , even though there are pills left in the prescription \? do you ever skip or forget to take a dose of an antibiotic or fail to take doses at the prescribed intervals \? have you ever saved leftover antibiotics and taken them the next time you got sick or given them to someone else to take \? have you ever taken antibiotics prescribed for someone else \? if you have answered yes to any of these questions , read on you need to learn some potentially lifesaving facts about antibiotics studies have shown that antibiotics , the miracle drugs that have helped americans achieve a 30year increase in life expectancy in less than a century , are being routinely abused and misused by both patients and physicians patients are not necessarily the primary source of the problem , since doctors must first prescribe the drugs but they have a role in how antibiotics are used and the consequences go beyond the personal as a result of both the use and the misuse of these drugs , more and more infectious bacteria are becoming resistant even to the most potent antibiotics known , and growing numbers of people are now dying of infections that were once readily cured misuse of antibiotics last fall , the american lung association released the telling results of a twopart gallup survey of 1 , 010 adults and 100 physicians although antibiotics are effective only against bacterial , not viral , infections , the physicians reported that 70 percent of patients inappropriately ask for antibiotics when they are told they have a viral illness when asked if antibiotics were effective against viruses , like those that cause colds and influenza , 60 percent of patients said they were many patients also wrongly believe that antibiotics should be taken during a viral illness to prevent complications like sinusitis , bronchitis or ear infection although threefourths of the patients and 94 percent of the physicians surveyed said the importance of finishing an antibiotic was explained at the time it was prescribed , more than half the patients failed to take all the doses of the last antibiotic prescribed for them , and more than half of those said they had stopped taking the drug because they felt better of the patients who failed to finish their prescription , 94 percent said they feared the development of bacterial resistance yet , along with the inappropriate use of antibiotics for infections not caused by bacteria , the failure to take enough of an antibiotic to wipe out a bacterial infection totally is largely responsible for the emergence of resistance threefourths of patients also cited inconvenience as a reason they did not complete their prescription antibiotics like penicillin that have long been available must be taken several times a day for 10 or more days to be fully effective but when patients no longer feel sick , they tend to forget when and how to take do not press your doctor to prescribe an antibiotic when you are told your illness is most likely viral , even if you worry about developing a bacterial infection according to dr michael s niederman , a respiratory disease specialist at winthrop university hospital in mineola , li , in an otherwise healthy person , taking antibiotics in anticipation of a bacterial infection can change the distribution and resistance patterns of microorganisms already present in the body , setting the stage for a future infection that cannot be cured by the antibiotic rather , dr niederman said , antibiotics should be used only when a patient develops a bacterial infection like sinusitis , ear infection or strep throat , when that diagnosis is confirmed by a throat culture however , acute bronchitis is usually a viral infection and may need to be treated with bronchial dilators , not antibiotics preventive antibiotic treatment is reserved for special cases when an acute respiratory illness occurs in patients with chronic lung or bronchial diseases , whose damaged airways are prone to recurrent bacterial infections when immunedeficient patients are exposed to certain bacterial illnesses when people with heart valve abnormalities undergo dental or periodontal treatment , to prevent bacteria introduced into the bloodstream from causing a heart infection after surgery , like a caesarean delivery , in which the risk of a complicating bacterial infection is high after treatment for some animal bites , particularly deep cat and dog bites and bites on the face to suppress flareups in patients prone to urinarytract infections when an antibiotic is prescribed for what the doctor knows or believes is a bacterial infection , it is very important to take all the medicine at the prescribed times a missed dose of an antibiotic that should be taken three or four times a day is less of a problem than it is with a drug that is to be taken only once or twice a day , but it is never ideal skipping doses allows the blood level of the antibiotic to drop , which may result in a temporary setback in your treatment and can encourage the emergence of antibioticresistant bacteria doubling up on a dose when you finally remember to take it usually does not do any good to help you remember when to take your antibiotic , set an alarm or make a chart list the times for all the doses you will have to take and cross off each one as you take it you might also ask your doctor about substituting one of the newer antibiotics that is taken only once or twice a day for five to seven days never save leftover antibiotics or take ones prescribed for a previous illness or for someone else , unless instructed to do so by your physician different bacteria are sensitive to different antibiotics , and the drug you took before may do you no good now besides , you will not have enough of leftover antibiotic to treat a new infection properly make sure you understand exactly how and how often you are supposed to take a prescribed antibiotic should it be taken before or with meals or on an empty or full stomach \? should you avoid alcohol or milk or any other foods \? is it safe to take it with other medications you are taking \? ask ! ask the physician and or pharmacist about common side effects like nausea or diarrhea and what reactions you should call the doctor about tell the doctor about any previous adverse reactions to an antibiotic if you develop a rash while taking an antibiotic , call the doctor right away ask how to know if the drug is working with a correctly prescribed antibiotic , you should begin to feel better in 24 to 48 hours if not , you may need a different medication , or if your infection is viral , none at all drawing
paterson when 1995 started , carlos torres had a 22 , 000ayear job as a supervisor at an auto parts factory in essex county when it ended , he was a charity patient at st joseph s hospital and medical center here , still a little dazed by his run of bad luck first the plant closed then his unemployment insurance ran out then last fall , just after he 'd finally lined up a new job , he fell on a street in paterson and shattered his right arm it still has n't healed properly mr torres s care from the emergency room to the operating room to the recovery room to st joseph s orthopedic clinic to physical therapy and back to the operating room \( for a bone graft \) has cost the hospital thousands of dollars thirtyone years old , unemployed and single , he has no health insurance and has n't been disabled long enough to qualify for medicaid so the hospital has only one way of recovering some of those costs , for him and thousands of other patients who have no public or private health insurance new jersey s 300millionayear program to reimburse hospitals for charity care now , because of a bitter partisan dispute in trenton over how to finance it , the charity program is in danger st joseph s and 80 other hospitals , large and small , got their last checks from the charity care fund on jan 15 , and unless the legislature can agree on how to renew it , there will be no checks on feb 15 so hospital administrators like sister jane frances brady , who runs st joseph s , are scrambling not only to persuade the lawmakers to restore the fund but also to figure out how to get along if it is not restored this is a historic moment , said sister jane , who has run st joseph s since 1972 we 've never come to the place where our cupboard is literally bare we 're really up against it and what we 're going to have to do is cut the sail to fit the cloth perhaps , she suggested , by suspending nonemergency services for some charity patients the state charity payments make up about 7 percent of st joseph s 265 million budget , so their absence will start biting soon the hospital will have no choice but to cut services or pay for charity care from other accounts but even if the financing crisis is resolved \( and there is widespread expectation in trenton that it will be , though no one can say when \) , a much larger problem is looming over st joseph s and other urban hospitals , like jersey city medical center , university and united and beth israel hospitals in newark , east orange general and elizabeth general although the federal budget impasse makes any talk of specific numbers meaningless , it is clear that congress and the clinton administration are planning hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of cuts over the next seven years in medicare and medicaid , the two gigantic programs that pay for care to the aged , poor and disabled the medicaid money may well be distributed to the states in block grants , and republican lawmakers say the states can allocate it more efficiently than washington can but it will still be far less than the urban hospitals have learned to count on , forcing them into what administrators call a vicious circle if new jersey under block grants gets 14 billion less in federal subsidies over seven years than it would have received , what does it do \? asked gary carter , president of the new jersey hospital association , a trade group that represents most of the state s hospitals does the state come up with that much money \? not likely you 'll have to begin cutting services as well not only will the state pay less to insurance companies , who will cut what they pay to hospitals , but the hospitals will also be seeing more people who are n't covered , which means more charity care every hospital in the state is required to treat anybody who needs care , regardless of ability to pay in an era of managed care , when private as well as public insurers are trying to hold costs down , the requirement places burdens on every hospital , urban or not but for urban hospitals like st joseph s , which got 63 percent of its revenue last year from government sources , the state and federal cuts will force a painful reassessment of their mission urban hospitals have few cost areas that can be cut any more than they have been cut , said jim knickman , a vice president of the robert wood johnson foundation in princeton , which finances research into health care even if they take care of few charity patients , it will be difficult for them to cut operating costs , many of which are fixed the real prospect is one of potential hospital closures the hospital from cows to clinics st joseph s hospital had 12 beds when it opened in 1867 , in a small frame house in the fields of south paterson the sisters of charity of st elizabeth , who still run it today , cared for cows as well as patients now the hospital anchors a whole neighborhood , not to mention its city s economy it has 651 beds , making it the state s fourthlargest hospital with more than 3 , 000 workers , it is the largest employer in paterson , a city long since deserted by the brawny textile mills that grew up around the great falls of the passaic river
the culbro corporation has long been a quiet company its premium cigars , led by the popular garcia y vega and macanudo brands , are puffed at wall street gatherings , and it is a big landowner in popular wall street getaways like rural connecticut and florida but with a stock market value of less than 300 million , and with half of its shares in insiders' hands , it has never attracted much attention , despite ties to a fabled tobacco dynasty and a board studded with business celebrities anyone who was curious about this new yorkbased holding company , which also owns a commercial nursery and an industrial packaging company , could consult culbro s annual report , which this year hails the sales growth and rising stock price generated by the link that now exists between premium cigars and wealthy consumers every gathering of cigar smokers is a cause for warm companionship , says the chairman , edgar m cullman , 78 , in his genial letter to shareholders but forget the graceful annual report the really juicy news cannot be found there this year it is all tucked away in the frumpy form 10k filed with the securities and exchange commission last month there , you can read about the 3 , 000 pounds of marijuana seized by customs agents at a company plant in alabama last spring about the internal investigation that stumbled across a crooked invoicing scheme that defrauded the company of about 1 million over four to five years about a senior executive , dismissed last year , who has filed a lawsuit accusing the company of bribing foreign officials and cheating on federal campaign laws in this jawdropper of a report , you can even read the company s prediction that this former employee will himself be indicted soon , and you can learn that since may the sec has been informally looking into trading in the company s shares before culbro announced plans , later dropped , to sell half its general cigar subsidiary to a spanish conglomerate the company s annual shareholder meeting , normally a quiet affair , is scheduled for thursday in new york they will certainly have a lot to talk about this year , one investor said they will indeed since last spring when a customer found a brick of marijuana in a shipment of company cigars executives and directors have been caught up in a reallife mystery that makes wall street s usual fare look tame and their experience offers a warning to all corporate officers and directors who assume that crime could never infect their own tidy , tautly managed companies no one ever thinks it can happen to them , said edgar cullman jr , 50 , culbro s president and his father s chosen successor as chief executive , in an interview last week and he felt confident that his company had taken steps to protect itself ever since my father has been in business , we have practiced the highest possible ethical standards but corporate watchdogs say there is another lesson here beware the ties that blind for as strong as culbro s response has been , these experts say , it is flawed because the board left the investigation to the inhouse counsel rather than putting it in the hands of independent directors one possible reason \? an incestuous web of conflicts that links board members to one another and to the company , said prof john c coffee jr of the columbia university school of law this is less than the textbook example of how you should conduct an investigation of this sort , said professor coffee , an sec adviser and specialist in corporate and securities law mr cullman jr begs to differ maybe it looks better if outside directors run an investigation , he said , but nobody from our board can spend the time that we have spent and will continue to spend to track all of these things down as for the close ties among board members , he said , there is a lot of collegiality , no question about it but that goes two ways they want to see us protected as much as they want to be sure that we are not blindsided he can understand his critics' point of view , he added it may appear to have a certain smell about it , mr cullman jr said but when you get below the surface , you see that these are quality people and it is really a good process he noted that james d harmon jr , a former executive director and chief counsel of the president s commission on organized crime , was hired as investigative counsel at the first sign of trouble last spring , and former federal judge kenneth conboy , a widely respected jurist and now a partner at the law firm of latham watkins , was hired in february to look into the former employee s allegations in addition , the company has tightened its audit controls and has improved security at its operations thomas c israel , a culbro director and chairman of the audit committee , also defended the company s response management feels very free and open , and we discuss everything , he said this is a lot more than a rubberstamp board he added , by knowing senior management as well as we do , we feel very confident that they have paid great attention to detail they are the most moral , highly ethical people in the world we are comfortable that , with the exception of one or two bad apples , everyone is doing what they 're supposed to do it certainly looked that way until the news about these spreading scandals broke last month
at the capital cities abc annual management meeting in february , in what amounted to his farewell address after the company merged with walt disney , tom murphy , the chairman of cap cities , had a message for his troops how can you let those engineers beat us \? mr murphy asked those guys make mri machines those guys are the leaders of the general electric company , which 10 years ago entered the world of network television by acquiring nbc as part of its 63 billion purchase of rca these engineers were once disdained in the world of broadcasting as interlopers without vision , unable to distinguish between turbines and televisions no more the decade since has been marked by the biggest swings ever in the networks' fortunes , with nbc smack in the middle of the turmoil the network dominated the small screen until the end of the 1980 s , before its ratings and profits collapsed , leaving it losses of 60 million in 1991 and just one primetime show in the a c nielsen top 10 rumors swirled almost weekly that ge was about to bail out , selling nbc to paramount , to time warner , or even to one of its stars , bill cosby critics placed considerable blame at the feet of ge its chairman , john f welch jr , and the former ge executive placed in charge of nbc , robert c wright nbc s failure was inevitable , these critics said , because of interference from ge executives who simply did not understand broadcasting but ge did n't sell , and jack welch is still around so is bob wright , now by far the longestlasting head of any network , and the longestserving nbc chief executive since prewar radio days not only that , but nbc has emerged in the last nine months as the undisputed leader of network television , with the five toprated shows most weeks , now that abc s monday night football is over for the season nbc accomplished this through a combination of astute programming strategy , a new team of division managers with a special talent for television production and the experience gained from having made numerous mistakes in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s of course , it also had a dose of the good luck that often seems to pass , at random , from network to network beyond all this , the company is now armed with growing cable assets and is becoming a force in global communications suddenly the connection between nbc and its giant of a parent is being called crucial not just to the network s comeback , but to the vindication of mr wright s oncemaligned strategy of expanding into farflung businesses nbc has grown so strong so fast that there has been a backlash from both network rivals and hollywood studio executives , who say nbc has displayed a grating arrogance the friction has been most intense with disney , abc s new owner , with sniping over professional tactics and personal ethics reaching the top levels of both companies mr welch himself , though far from smug , does acknowledge that recovery is fun , clearly enjoying the industry s aboutface on ge and nbc a short time after mr murphy made his plea for abc to stand up against the engineers , mr welch met him on a golf course and could not resist ragging him here s the locomotive salesman , mr welch said he told mr murphy for mr welch , an engineer himself , who for 15 years has run what is now the nation s most valuable company ge s market value is three times disney s the criticism that he and mr wright faced after they took over the network was a little bit of silliness to him , television s unique mysteries were overrated anyway certainly easier to fathom than the brokerage business , where ge did stub its toe when it purchased kidder , peabody only to have to sell it later at a loss everyone in any business thinks their own business is unique , mr welch said this business has a distribution , like all businesses have distribution it requires revenues , which require a good sales force so the issue is what s new \? the only thing new is this content the programs he did not , he added , have a mastery of other ge businesses , either i do n't know how to build an engine , he said i do n't know how to build a turbine i do n't know how to make a light bulb what you have to do is get people who know how to do that in 1986 , he chose mr wright , a lawyer who was then president of ge capital and previously an executive with cox cable , as the man to lead nbc and while the network was riding high in primetime ratings , mr wright walked in the door predicting trouble if the company did not diversify and get its costs in line that did not endear him to most longtime nbc executives but one who remains said , in essence , that mr wright was right we were fat , said the executive , who spoke on the condition of anonymity costs were out of control our union contacts were too costly there was no accountability the process of paring down cast a harsh public light on mr wright and the new ge management , especially when much of the costcutting flowed through nbc news mr wright said he could never accept the premise that news should be a loss leader the news division was losing 50 million or 60 million a year , mr wright said , and i think they were projecting with a certain casualness that the number could get to be 100 million so he began cutting news bureaus and eliminating jobs these moves branded him in the eyes of critics as a broadcast outsider who cared less about news than about profits
for nine months , the gruesome rumors circulated through the club scene like an echo andre \( angel \) melendez , 25 , a fixture on the downtown party circuit known for his flamboyant costume with fullsize feathercovered wings , was missing his disappearance became the subject of a macabre guessing game was it an abrupt change of address \? foul play \? or perhaps a publicity stunt meant to generate notoriety for a new club \? then , on nov 2 , the city medical examiner s office announced that a dismembered corpse that had washed up on staten island last april was mr melendez s and yesterday the manhattan district attorney charged that the killer was another denizen of the thriving underground club scene michael alig , downtown s bestknown party promoter , whose gatherings at manhattan night spots drew thousands of young people eager to be at the center of the action prosecutors said mr alig , who is 30 years old , killed mr melendez during an argument about money inside mr alig s apartment on west 43d street in early march according to law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity , mr alig beat mr melendez on the head with a hammer , strangled or suffocated him , injected him with a toxic substance , then cut off his hands and legs and tossed the body into the hudson river news of the arrest was the latest shock to the club scene , coming not long after peter gatien , the owner of the limelight and other popular clubs , was indicted on charges that he sanctioned drug dealing in his establishments the accusations of widespread , organized drug trafficking , combined with the violent death of mr melendez , gave the downtown scene a sinister cast in the view of outsiders and sent a shudder even through clubgoers who pride themselves on their place on the cutting edge it s just kind of sad how it came to this , said cathy hawkins , 28 , a clubgoer who has known mr alig for six years the whole club thing was supposed to be about having fun , going to parties and having the freedom to be who you are straight , gay , weird , whatever but it was never supposed to be dangerous investigators would say little about the circumstances of the killing yesterday mr melendez , a colombian immigrant , was a hangeron in the club world and one of dozens of club kids who gravitated toward mr alig mr melendez s brother said mr melendez had considered it glamorous to associate with someone as well known as mr alig my brother liked to be around him and the club kids because it made him feel part of an interesting world , said the brother , johnny melendez although mr alig frequently talked about his use of ecstasy and other socalled designer drugs and his onagain offagain attempts to stop using heroin , investigators would not say whether narcotics played a role in the killing the socalled clubkid subculture one of the latest incarnations of downtown s underground life style was born in the mid1980 s , as clubs offering acid house dance music and drugs like ecstasy and special k became a new haven for teenagers and young adults in search of the latest and the hippest it spawned a handful of successful promoters like mr alig , who were essentially paid to be fabulous , hired by club owners for their power to draw clubgoers mr alig would line up the music , set the theme and make sure that a quorum of beautiful people showed up his offbeat fashion sense and flair for the outrageous made his parties trendy for those who attended and incredibly lucrative for club owners like mr gatien his party invitations were designed for maximum shock value one featured a photograph of mr alig lying on the pavement pretending \( with the help of gory makeup \) that his head was smashed open although members of the glitter set were never charged admission , thousands of clubgoers happily paid cover charges of 20 per person to attend the party of the moment for years , mr alig was the undisputed center of that world , appearing on the cover of new york magazine , and on television talk shows like those of geraldo rivera and jerry springer his wednesday night party , disco 2000 , was a mix of gay and straight cultures , transvestite fashion and recreational drug use to mr alig , who grew up in south bend , ind , where he was treated as an outcast because he was gay , the scene offered both a refuge from middle american disapproval and a social circle in which unconventionality was accepted , admired and flaunted it was great to for him to be in a world where you can be as wild as you want , said lady bunny , a former employee of mr alig and the former organizer of the annual wigstock drag festival mr alig also worked for mr gatien for several years , promoting parties at the limelight , the tunnel and other fashionable night spots but mr alig was arrested several times for drug use , and friends said the chemical abuse had led mr gatien to dismiss mr alig last january daniel j castleman , chief of investigations for the manhattan district attorney s office , said his detectives had been looking into the drug and tax charges against mr gatien when they discovered evidence linking mr alig to the murder mr castleman declined to discuss details of the case , but several clubgoers said mr alig had talked about killing mr melendez in the weeks after the murder johnny melendez spent months in the east village in search of his brother and said he had been stunned to learn that the club scene was awash with people who said mr alig had admitted the crime but despite mr melendez s pleading , most of the selfproclaimed witnesses refused for months to cooperate with the police that was the hardest thing , said mr melendez , whose father flew to new york from colombia to assist in the search for angel all these club kids knew they could see the pain , the agony in my eyes but none of them would help i do n't know who or what they were protecting mr alig has publicly denied any involvement in the killing and as he awaited arraignment yesterday , his lawyer flatly denied that he had played any part in the brutal murder they arrested the wrong man , said the lawyer , william stampur even after mr melendez s disappearance , mr alig tried to continue promoting parties in october , he was host of a party at mirage , which was entitled the honey trap , a reference to federal prosecutors' claims that mr gatien s clubs were a honey trap for drug dealers and users but the party was poorly attended michael musto , the nightlife columnist of the village voice , said the murder and succession of legal problems had thrown the club world into chaos between the limelight closing , the palladium being turned into an nyu dorm and now michael alig being arrested for the death of a club kid , this does n't bode well for the club scene , mr musto said there s not very much to party about photos the body of andre \( angel \) melendez was found washed up near staten island in april he was known around clubs for his flamboyant outfit \( skid photography \) \( pg b4 \) michael alig , a party promoter shown at a club in 1993 , was arrested in

in a verdict hailed as a major strike against the growing influence of russian organized crime in the united states , a federal jury in brooklyn yesterday convicted a man who the authorities say is the most powerful russian mobster in the country after a sixweek trial , the jurors took about five hours to convict vyacheslav kirillovich ivankov , 56 , and three codefendants of extortion charges during the trial , which was so studded with russian names that it evoked a novel by tolstoy , prosecutors outlined how mr ivankov had tried to extort 35 million from two russian emigres who ran an investment company mr ivankov was branded a top mobster who relied on his ability to inspire fear to carry out his schemes we 're glad that an early attempt by the fbi to strike at this group before they really spread out was successful , bridget m rohde , a prosecutor , said the case was unusual in that ivankov had only been here for four years , ms rohde said his tentacles had not spread out russian authorities advised the federal bureau of investigation that mr ivankov formed his criminal organization in russia about 16 years ago after being convicted for his participation in several thefts from the home of wealthy russians , mr ivankov served 10 years in a russian prison the authorities also said that since mr ivankov s release in 1991 , he began to build and solidify his criminal associations in the united states in january 1993 , the ministry of the interior \( mvd \) of the russian federation advised the fbi that mr ivankov entered the united states to manage and control russian organized crime activities in this country , operating from his base in brighton beach , brooklyn mr ivankov was found guilty of conspiracy to commit extortion and attempted extortion he faces up to 20 years in prison when the verdict was read yesterday , mr ivankov , an illegal immigrant , sat expressionless his lawyer , barry i slotnick , said he was shocked at the verdict and would appeal i think the jury unfortunately may have heard the word 'russian' and had some preconceived notions , mr slotnick said certainly the evidence was not there while the authorities said the trial would provide a window into the mechanics of russian organized crime in america , mr slotnick had argued that the real lesson was how greedy nascent capitalists in this case the emigres who the prosecution said were the victims of the alleged extortion plot came to the united states to exploit fellow immigrants with bogus schemes mr slotnick had portrayed his client as being falsely accused by the men who ran the investment company whom he called swindlers after mr ivankov helped arrange a meeting between them and an official of a russian bank that had been defrauded by the company the lawyer described mr ivankov as a freedom fighter for religious and civil rights in russia as mr ivankov was being escorted out of the courtroom , he was heard yelling out several words bitterly in russian but mr slotnick said mr ivankov told him do n't worry you 've done a wonderful job we 'll keep fighting this is america mr ivankov s arrest in new york in june 1995 , along with several associates , followed an intensive investigation by the fbi that was aided by russia s ministry of the interior and the royal canadian mounted police prosecutors had asserted that none of the 35 million demanded was paid because one of the operators of the investment company , the summit international trading and investment corporation , went to the fbi , which secretly taped conversations that implicated mr ivankov in the shakedown mr ivankov was arrested in his girlfriend s apartment in brighton beach , the center of the russian emigre community in america but mr slotnick said the two principals of summit international , vladimir voloshin and alexander volkov , were not victims of what the prosecution called a sevenmonth extortion plot in late 1994 and 1995 instead , he argued , they went to the fbi because the pyramid scheme he insisted they were operating was about to be exposed and they sought to escape the consequences by picturing themselves as victims two codefendants , sergei ilgner and valery novak , were convicted of conspiracy to commit extortion and attempted extortion vladimir topko was convicted of conspiracy to commit extortion but was acquitted of attempted extortion the defendants face up to 20 years imprisonment and a 250 , 000 fine on each count of conviction as well as deportation the trial was closely monitored by reporters from russia and yesterday , many of them said that they , too , were stunned by the verdict , because they believed the government s case was weak some court spectators suggested that the trial brought into sharp focus how former communists and new businessmen have done business since the fall of the soviet union , but not so much how mr ivankov is the russian mob s equivalent of john gotti it s definitely a big win for the government , said stephen handelman , the author of comrade criminal russia s new mafia \( yale university press , 1995 \) photo vyacheslav kirillovich ivankov \( the new york times \)
qana , lebanon , april 18 the israeli army fired an artillery barrage into a united nations peacekeeping camp today , killing at least 75 lebanese civilians and wounding more than 100 the attack , which israel said came in response to rocket and mortar fire by guerrillas near the base , was by far the deadliest yet in the eightdayold offensive in southern lebanon the civilians were among hundreds of local people who had taken refuge in the camp , the headquarters of a fijian infantry battalion most died when the shells set a recreation center and two prefabricated buildings ablaze israel said the attack on the base was a grave error it prompted worldwide outrage and a rapid intensification of diplomatic efforts to bring a halt to the conflict for hours after the midafternoon attack , smoke and smoldering flames continued to pour from the shattered camp , and fijian officers who pulled the dead and wounded from the wreckage described a scene of carnage , with many dismembered bodies israel had warned civilians here and across much of southern lebanon to flee or risk being caught up in its attacks a united nations spokesman said hezbollah guerrillas had launched katyusha rockets and mortar rounds toward israel from a site near the camp only minutes before the israeli bombardment began but the spokesman , mikhal lindvall , said he could see no excuse for hitting the wellmarked united nations compound , where officers fired red warning flares in vain before taking shelter when the shells began to fall about 2 pm i never thought i would see a massacre like this , mr lindvall said today in tyre it s bad enough when it takes place in a lebanese village , but to see it in a united nations camp is truly a tragedy fijian officers said many howitzer shells landed in or near the base over a period of about 90 minutes that attack was among dozens of strikes that israel launched today in its bid to suppress the guerrillas of hezbollah , or party of god , whose rocket attacks on northern israel have left thousands of settlers there in a state of terror one israeli air strike today in the village of nabatiye alfawqa tore into an apartment building and left 11 lebanese civilians dead , including a 4dayold infant and 6 other children , according to the lebanese army shelling from offshore israeli warships at targets nearer to the coast shut down most of the remaining traffic on the allbutdeserted highway along the mediterranean , even as ambulances screamed southward from beirut to assist in evacuating the victims from qana the village of qana sits atop rockstrewn hills about five miles east of the tyre , lebanon s southern port at the city s largest hospital , where the wounded were taken by ambulance , united nations helicopter and private vehicles , blood spattered the entryway and emergencyroom floors doctors who had worked through israel s 1982 invasion of lebanon and its offensive here in 1993 said they had never seen so much suffering i saw my sister burning with her child in her arms , said laila atwe , a 22yearold woman who survived the attack but said she had lost 12 family members , including her parents , grandparents and uncles there were various accounts of the number of civilians killed and wounded in the attack fijian officers said 45 lebanese had died at the camp itself , while others died on their way to hospitals or while being treated there none of the fijian peacekeepers were killed , and only four were wounded many were out on patrol the remainder were in underground bunkers that they shared with some of the refugees but officers said the bunkers were too small to allow most of the 850 civilians in the camp to take shelter maj joseph sabua , second in command of the 500man battalion , said many of those killed and wounded had fled instead to the prefabricated buildings and to the recreation center , a 45by90foot wooden structure built in a traditional fijian design major sabua and other witnesses described their shock at emerging from their bunkers at about 3 30 pm to find the buildings ablaze and dead bodies littering the ground to tell the truth , most of us now believe it is time to go home , the fijian officer said of his battalion , which is part of the 4 , 500member united nations interim force in lebanon that was set up in 1978 as a buffer between the two countries we do n't think we are of any use here after what happened today , the officer said across southern lebanon , as many as 5 , 000 civilians are now encamped in united nations compounds , united nations officers said scores of thousands of other lebanese have heeded the israeli warnings and fled the region altogether united nations spokesmen said that many of those who sought refuge at the base had done so because they feared that they had waited too long to leave the area safely qana was all but deserted tonight , but the bright headlights of white united nations armored vehicles illuminated the posters of proclaimed hezbollah martyrs that are displayed along the streets they vividly illustrate the sympathies of a population that like that in the rest of southern lebanon is overwhelmingly shiite muslim my neighbors were all killed , said moussa haidar , a middleaged man who survived the attack from inside the camp and was walking the streets in a daze behind the high gates and barbed wire of the united nations compound , fijian troops wore expressions of shock many sang mournful hymns at a nightly chapel service that had assumed a very somber air it was chaos , said capt blake tuitubou , the battalion s engineering officer everything was haywire a few miles down the hill in tyre s hospitals tonight , some of the wounded lay awake in shock , their limbs broken , bandaged or severed still others had suffered severe burns to their bodies or faces doctors said that about half of the wounded were children , some of whom lay in bed moaning softly for their parents among them was ibrahim ismael , a 7yearold whose arm had been fractured and who had suffered severe burns on his face , neck and ears he keeps asking for his mother , a nurse by his bedside said i told him , 'do n't worry , she s coming , she s coming' the nurse later said privately that the boy , along with at least a half dozen other children in the hospital , had been orphaned in the attack photo a lebanese boy crying out for help from beneath the ruins of ahouse in nabatiye alfawqa that was bombed yesterday by an israeli warplane in the most devastating assault

the biggest maker of pants and the biggest maker of shirts are shaking up their wardrobes in a big way levi strauss company is bringing out a line of men s dress trousers intended to fill a perceived wardrobe gap between khakis and designer dress slacks or suit pants and in the process become the third major levi strauss brand in the company s 140year history , after levi s jeans and dockers casual slacks the new line , named slates , will be peddled in an elaborate advertising and promotional campaign scheduled to begin sept 2 and run through november the budget for television commercials , outdoor posters , displays in stores and other retail programs is estimated at a hefty 20 million and the arrow company is testing in five markets across the country a humorous television spot that pitches casual shirts for men rather than arrow s traditional dress styles those moves are indicative of how apparel makers are scrambling to meet changing consumer needs , particularly as men continue to demand casual fashions the 'casualization' of america has really changed the way men dress , said nancy friedman , marketing director for the slates brand at levi strauss in san francisco as suits decline , men say they need more options , more alternatives , because they do n't know what to wear phil molinari , president of the arrow division of cluett peabody in new york , which is owned by bidermann sa , agreed there s confusion , he said , because all these businesses have said 'you can dress casual' but what do you do in a culture like ibm s where you were told to wear navy blue suits for 100 years \? they do n't have anything in their closets that muddle , however which has men coming to work in everything from threepiece suits without ties to holey tshirts and cutoff denim shorts carries difficulties as well as opportunities for men s apparel marketers levi strauss has tried selling dressier slacks under several brand names including dress dockers , which , ms friedman said , is being discontinued to focus on slates and arrow has been a company so identified with the classic , basic white dress shirt , said ken mandelbaum , chief executive and executive creative director at mandelbaum mooney ashley in san francisco , the arrow agency , that the test campaign must convey that we 're making other shirts to succeed to give slates a leg or two up in a market now dominated by brands sold by farah inc , the haggar clothing company and the banana republic unit of gap inc , levi strauss spent 18 months planning its debut slates , which will be priced from 50 to 80 a pair , was given development , sales , marketing and merchandising staffs separate from those working on levi s and dockers the goal is for slates to become a 1 billion brand in a decade a tall order indeed given that it took dockers 10 years to achieve that milestone in a somewhat larger market annual sales of men s casual pants , according to the npd group , a market research company , are 28 billion , compared with 19 billion for men s dress pants but levi strauss executives are optimistic , citing what ms friedman called our strong relationship with the baby boom generation at which slates is aimed there are 30 million men in their 30 s and 40 s , she said , and we feel we understand them what we kept hearing from them in research was that they want more choices we want to change their mindset that dress pants are something they have to buy , she added , to maybe something they 'd want to buy so slates will be marketed winsomely but aggressively in a campaign by the san francisco office of foote , cone belding , the longtime levi strauss agency , as offering solutions to perpetual problems the campaign carries the assertive theme these are those pants for instance , in one commercial , a business traveler looking for a telephone in a hotel wanders from one ballroom to another he deftly handles himself , in quick succession , at a political rally , an awards luncheon and a wedding you know those pants that always fit \? an announcer asks these are those pants in another spot , a man on his way to a party avoids crosstown traffic by crawling out his office window and climbing nimbly from one roof to another you know those pants that go from work to after work without missing a beat \? the announcer asks these are those pants the idea of the campaign is to create some excitement in what a lot of the guys in our target told us was a boring category , said jeff iorillo , a copywriter and creative director at foote , cone san francisco , which is a unit of true north communications there s a big black hole in their hearts and minds when it comes to dress pants , he added their favorite brand is 'none of the above' mr iorillo s partner , corey stolberg , an art director who is a senior vice president and group creative director , said there are a lot more places and times for men to wear dress pants versus suits per se , but it s a bit of an educational process you have to answer questions like 'how do you want me to wear this \? ' and 'how does this fit into my life \? ' the campaign for arrow also seeks to answer those questions , not only through a humorous commercial but also with promotions cosponsored by department stores in the test markets there will be special sales help on the floor to talk about the product , mr molinari said , to discuss how to wear casual shirts at work , and our people worked on special displays for the stores the participating retailers and the markets are younkers in des moines gottschalks in fresno , calif mcrae s in jackson , miss proffitt s in knoxville , tenn , and carson pirie scott in milwaukee the arrow test , which continues through sept 1 , has a budget of 500 , 000 it is separate from a national print campaign by mandelbaum mooney , with a budget of 5 million , featuring arrow shirts worn by celebrities like the magician david copperfield and the basketball player david robinson if the test proves successful , mr molinari said , we 'll expand to additional markets the commercial depicts a mob boss who gives his henchmen casual arrow shirts , which he now wears , he says , because his dressshirt collar was choking me to the point where i put out joey the roach s eye with a cocktail fork even joey a patch over one eye , in a mobster version of the hathaway man gets a new arrow that looks as sharp as any cocktail fork photo in a commercial for levi strauss s new line of men s trousers , slates , a man wearing the trousers uses a fire escape to sidestep traffic problems \( levi strauss co \) \( pg d7 \)
when the cognoscenti argue about the identity of the world s best individual player , they usually focus on americans , mentioning bob hamman , bob wolff , jeff meckstroth and eric rodwell , with some support for the cosmopolitan pakistani , zia mahmood but recent evidence suggests that the title should go to a 26yearold norwegian little known on this side of the atlantic his name is geir helgemo , and he not only won a bunch of junior titles but helped his country to its best performance at world level , silver medals at the 1993 world team championships this may in paris he not only won the generali masters individual , in a field of 52 of the world s best players , but also won by a big margin , 2 percent ahead of the runnerup after playing two deals with each of the other contestants this can be considered a pure test of bridge ability , since factors like systems , partnership and teammates are eliminated standard bidding methods are used on the diagramed deal , helgemo made a play that hardly anyone would think of , and in practice none of his rivals in paris did think of after the lead of the diamond queen against three notrump , the other declarers won and played the ace and king of clubs the contract was now unmakeable , for if a heart was led east would win and play a second diamond , leaving the defense in control helgemo , however , led the club eight at the second trick when west played low , he called for the six from dummy and the eight won the trick now a second club lead uncovered the club split , and helgemo had a choice he could have cashed the remaining club winner , entered his hand with a spade lead and surrendered a club but he took a very small risk and did even better by leading a heart east put up the king and led a diamond , which was ducked the declarer emerged with an overtrick , since the defense could only manage two heart tricks and one diamond the play of the club eight could never lose but was due to gain only if east held a singleton seven , which proves that helgemo is lucky as well as skillful the defense would have had a better chance if west had covered the club eight south can still prevail by crossing to the spade king and leading another club with the idea of finessing the six , but it is much more difficult diagram
the name of one of the best known , most honored copywriters in advertising is regaining a place of prominence more than a decade after disappearing in an agency merger theodore f macmanus , whose advertisement for cadillac , the penalty of leadership , is still quoted 81 years after he wrote it , will be lending his name to d'arcy masius benton bowles , the 12thlargest agency company in the world , with billings of more than 57 billion at a meeting yesterday , the board of dmb b voted to adopt a new name , the macmanus group inc the change is being made as part of plans announced last month by dmb b , which is based in new york , to acquire adcom investors inc , owner of the venerable but troubled agency n w ayer partners the acquisition is scheduled to close in early fall in the meantime , the ownertobe is scrutinizing ayer s operations as part of due diligence proceedings before the deal is completed a decision has been made to close the ayer office in los angeles and to transfer the accounts there to the ayer headquarters office in new york and the los angeles office of highway one communications , which is an affiliate of dmb b macmanus , who was born in 1872 and died in 1940 , founded an agency , macmanus inc , that specialized in automotive advertising he helped introduce the chrysler and dodge nameplates among other brands he handled were desoto , hupmobile , maxwell , overland , packard , pontiac and studebaker the penalty of leadership , which ran only once , in the jan 2 , 1915 , issue of the saturday evening post , helped create an image for cadillac as a prestigious marque dmb b , the descendant of macmanus inc , still handles the cadillac account and pontiac , too macmanus inc eventually became d'arcy macmanus masius , which joined with benton bowles in 1985 to form dmb b minus the macmanus d'arcy masius benton bowles sounded better than d'arcy macmanus masius benton bowles , said roy j bostock , the chairman and chief executive of dmb b , who will continue in those posts at the macmanus group the primary reason for the renaming , mr bostock said , is to minimize confusion when dmb b begins operating two separate , autonomous agency networks , ayer and d'arcy masius benton bowles advertising that step is similar to one last year by the saatchi saatchi company , which was renamed cordiant plc to distinguish the parent from its two agency networks , saatchi saatchi advertising worldwide and bates worldwide initially , 10 or 12 new names were considered , mr bostock said , but none of us liked any of them they were all madeup names that , of course , has been the trend on madison avenue cordiant , true north communications , omnicom group instead , we thought we should look at our own history , mr bostock said ted macmanus was one of the great creative leaders of our industry , he added , and the name is appropriate because all of our businesses are in the business of creativity in addition to the dmb b agency , the macmanus group will include shops specializing in direct marketing , health care accounts , media services and public relations as due diligence involving adcom proceeds , mr bostock said , one focus is reducing liabilities , particularly an expensive lease at worldwide plaza in midtown manhattan the fate of the ayer chicago office is still up in the air , he added , while media edge , the ayer media services agency in new york , is being sold separately by w y choi , the owner of adcom the daily fax edition of advertising age reported yesterday that young rubicam inc in new york would buy media edge other ayer operations include an office in detroit the renaming of dmb b for a person might be indicative of a trend lou tripodi , a spokesman for the ddb needham worldwide unit of omnicom in new york , said his agency is emphasizing ddb more as part of efforts to promote the heritage of bill bernbach inside and outside the agency his reference was to the cofounder of a ddb needham predecessor shop , doyle dane bernbach , who like theodore macmanus is a member of the advertising hall of fame leo burnett , the founder of the leo burnett company and another hall of fame member , once declared the penalty of leadership to be the ad i 'll always remember the ad began in every field of human endeavor , he that is first must perpetually live in the white light of publicity whether the leadership be vested in a man or in a manufactured product , emulation and envy are ever at work the last line of the penalty of leadership takes on an added meaning in light of the vanishing , and sudden return , of the macmanus name that which deserves to live lives
two crucial communications tools for business travelers are the laptop computer and the public telephone so why do they not talk to each other \? millions of people carry laptop computers through airport concourses and hotel lobbies filled with public telephones many of these telephones have been equipped with data ports , those little receptacles that look like the familiar telephone jacks found in homes or offices but the data ports are not really like those jacks as a result , many people cannot figure out how to use the pay phones with their computers certainly there are times when i'm in an airport and i 'd like to send or download some material it would be great to have the ability to do that , said one communications specialist who travels with a laptop , walter greenwood but i would n't know how to do it mr greenwood , who is hardly unusual in his skill level with these two communications devices , is a spokesman for lucent technologies , the successor to bell labs the problem for mr greenwood , and nearly everyone else , is that most of the data ports are dead until the call has gone through that means that the laptop user must make the telephone connection by punching numbers on the keypad of the phone , not by clicking with a mouse and letting the laptop dial the call but once the call is connected , some of the most common software packages refuse to let the laptop connect others will permit such a connection but only with an awkward command if you happen to carry that thick manual with you , you can do it , said fred hawkes , vice president of marketing at elcotel , a maker of pay phones in sarasota , fla there are exceptions one is the att public phone 2000 , the one with the big video screen covered with text instructions a caller can turn on the data port in that phone by taking the handset off the hook but that takes suppression of the user s natural instincts , because , as an engineer at a competing company , martin peek of motorola , put it , home computer users know from years of experience that if they have hooked up to compuserve or the office mainframe , if someone else in the house takes an extension phone off the hook , the computer connection is broken why can pay phone data ports not work like the data ports in a hotel room , or the familiar jack at home or in the office \? the problem is not billing calls cannot simply be billed to the line as they are in a hotel room or a home , but a modem user can enter a creditcard number over the modem and often a user does not need to pay because the computer is calling an 800 number the problem , according to experts , is that most of the industry has not determined how to make a pay phone fraudresistant without also making it userhostile the reason is the structure of the telephone keypad , which ordinarily produces signals called dual tone multifrequency , known as dtmf the keypad can produce eight tones , and pushing any button causes two of them to sound , like two notes on the piano played at once the keypad itself is shaped like a tictactoe board , and each row has its own tone , as does each column thus each button has a singular combination of a row tone and a column tone the designers' idea was that with access to only those buttons , the caller could do no more than enter a telephone number or a credit card number , or , for some specialized purposes , the or keys the phone system , though , carries other tones , outside the dtmf vocabulary , called interoffice signaling tones some of these tones , for example , tell the system that a quarter , a dime or a nickel has dropped into the coin slot experts fear that a smart computer user could pump tones into the phone system far more complicated than the ones made on the keypad , opening the possibility of fraud a computer user , manipulating these tones , could fool the phone by making it appear that coins had been placed into the slot when none had been if someone did so on a home phone , or a phone in a hotel room or office , that user would be identifiable to the telephone company but a pay phone user is anonymous mr hawkes said any freshman college student could build a little device that a laptop computer could command to make such interoffice signaling tones because many computer calls are made to tollfree numbers , many owners of pay phones have not had much financial incentive to solve this problem , because they did not stand to make much money off the calls but under a federal communications commission ruling in november , pay phone owners get a payment of 4585 a month per phone from the companies that offer 800 service beginning next october , when hardware and software changes allow it , they will collect 35 cents for each call made from their phones to an 800 number even some individual pay phones owned by landlords or other nontraditional providers pose problems , too they are often smart phones , heavily computerized , that figure charges and validate credit card numbers themselves , rather than leaving that job to a computer or an operator at a central station a data port that allowed a caller to bypass the internal circuitry of the phone would leave the phone owner open to big charges some experts think users will simply continue to think of public phones and laptops as unrelated devices , at least until new generations of each bring them closer together it s sort of like looking at the incompatibilities between computers and televisions , mr hawkes said
carlstadt , nj , feb 8 like dozens of northern new jersey communities , this small town up the hill from giants stadium was on edge today schools were darkened , 911 lines clogged , and elderly residents nervously gauged the steam levels in their heating systems the 5 , 700 people of carlstadt were among thousands in the region enduring a second day with little or no water after the rupture

and locusts , mr roseman , 35 , said , waving off compliments from various department chiefs who called his unkempt beard a perfect example of water conservation what conservation \? there is no water to conserve city officials found themselves immersed in unaccustomed chores we have been busy trying to figure out the most strategic locations around town for 10 portable toilets , said trudy hackenburg , the coordinator of the emergency management office carlstadt was not alone in teaneck , surgeons at holy name hospital used bottled water to scrub down , and dialysis patients were transferred to other hospitals the town s firefighters brought water to a woman who was housebound after just being released from the hospital and needed liquids to swallow her medicine rachel kashi , an englewood resident , dispatched her housekeeper to scour the town for water , and after taking a bath with hot water from the teakettle , debated escaping to a new york city hotel with her husband at the cnbc television studio in fort lee , the airconditioning system could not function , and temperatures soared a skeleton staff remained on hand while 270 personnel were moved out of the building eventually all broadcast operations shunted to new york in carlstadt , there was a stampede for water in any form jim h lemanowicz , owner of the daily deli , stocked 60 onegallon bottles of water in the morning and by midday had just 2 left he said he might have stocked more , but one distribution company had jacked up the price to 580 per case from 380 everybody is desperate for water , mr lemanowicz said well , perhaps not quite everyone at maggie s irish bar and restaurant , a bartender , sean byrne , said that a few of his patrons barely noticed the crisis one guy told me that he had a refrigerator full of beer , so he did n't care if the water never came back on others could not afford to be quite so sanguine with dishwashers full , there was a minor run on paper plates and disposable cutlery baby wipes were leading contenders for the most popular consumer item and suddenly residents discovered that they did n't mind all the snow , after all many packed it into large buckets or spaghetti pots and carted it indoors to melt then they could use the water to flush no one contemplated drinking the stuff all drinking water was strictly bottled or well water even for pets this one s a princess , said joan rogers , indicating her dog casey , adopted from a local animal shelter the dog , along with the rest of the family , was drinking spring water drawn for a well at a local monastery but still you feel like you ca n't really do anything because you might get dirty it was the kind of predicament someone might expect in a combat zone some disasterprone place like , say , new york city but it seemed something of a large blot on the reputation of the suburban idyll it s strange in america that something could happen like this , said richard kedzia , an immigrant from poland who said his family had filled up all available containers and was eating a lot of chinese food but i guess it shows that things can happen anywhere emergency crews were actually hoping nothing happened chief paul j stabile sent his firefighters out to check the pressure in hydrants and found almost none nervous , he had an 18wheel tanker holding 6 , 200 gallons backed into the parking lot of the municipal building employees took souvenir photographs the fire crews were also bracing for the expected return of the water , when the sudden rush through dry sprinkler systems was expected to trigger hundreds of false alarms there were also fears that backedup sewer would flood in the emergency management office , stuart b cooper was warning callers that full pressure might not be restored until saturday but as the day progressed with no real disasters in sight , residents seemed to become fixated on things scatological the board of health distributed a flier suggesting that unflushed toilets be filled with bleach fire department vehicles with loudspeakers circulated to announce the arrival of the portable toilets , prompting one resident to call city hall to inquire whether they came equipped with toilet paper \( they came equipped \) residents politely knocked on the doors of the portable toilets before using them , and wondered afterward whether heated ones might be available the next time around it s disgusting , said robin c dixon , 12 , whose mother dispatched him four blocks on his bicycle to use a portable toilet outside the school it smells back at

when the prized hartford collection of the hartford public library reopens formally in refurbished space this week , there will be one big new piece not yet open to the public the files of the hartford times , once connecticut s largest daily , which have returned to hartford 20 years after the newspaper published its last issue on oct 20 , 1976 the return of the morgue , as a newspaper s clipping and photograph files are known , to the city whose life the newspaper chronicled , has left many people gleeful , but none so much , perhaps , as stephen b goddard , who was chairman of the hartford public library directors when the final agreement to transfer the files was made mr goddard , a lawyer , was a times reporter in the 1960 s the times' morgue had languished for years in the hot , inaccessible basement of engleman hall on the campus of southern connecticut state university in new haven a gift to the school s journalism department by the jackson family , publishers for many years of the new haven register and , at the end of its 159yearrun , of the hartford times founded as a weekly in 1817 , the times became a daily in 1841 it was always considered a metropolitan paper and focused most of its coverage on city issues as late as 1969 it said it reached 73 percent of hartford homes while its crosstown rival , the hartford courant , only claimed 48 percent officials at the university agreed there had never been money to document and organize the newspaper s files properly they had remained jumbled and unused in new haven they had no business being in new haven , said cliff bloomquist of west hartford , who was assistant city editor at the newspaper when it ceased publication don noel , now a political columnist for the hartford courant , who had been an assistant managing editor at the times , said , we need to make these accessible to the public it is history on the hoof mr noel oversaw the installation of a special automated retrieval system in the times morgue in the 1950 s and said that while research in new computerized files at a newspaper may be efficient , lt does n't have the fun of pawing through those old yellow clips william p pike of canterbury , managing editor of the times when it closed , said the files provide a written , if disjointed , history of the city of hartford and are an invaluable resource for those interested in what hartford really was like mr pike said he plans to donate to the hartford library an original drawing of the hartford times building by the hartford artist richard welling , as well as two monographs on the history of the newspaper by former times editors janice mathews , the new and first fulltime curator of the library s hartford collection , said what s so wonderful about the hartford times files , is that it will allow us to index the paper while every edition of the newspaper was kept on file , and is now on microfilm , at the public library , she explained , it was hard to find a particular story , or do research on a specific topic , unless exact dates were known in the times morgue , by contrast , clippings and photographs were grouped in subject and biographical files there is also an obituary file the files have found a new home back where they came from the old hartford times building on prospect street in downtown hartford , now owned by the city and known as the city hall annex it is the building from whose portico presidents addressed crowds below dwight d eisenhower , harry s truman , lyndon b johnson and , on nov 7 , 1960 , the day before his election , john f kennedy they 're probably not more than 50 feet away from where they were originally , said mr goddard as he and ms mathews pored through the old metal file cabinets in their new airconditioned and carpeted home it will be some time before the files are reorganized , placed in acidfree document boxes and made available to the public for research although ms mathews said she hoped to have an exhibition of photographs in the main library , which is near the former times building , within the next year sandy wheeler , the staff archivist for the hartford studies project at trinity college , who is helping with the times project , said the hartford studies project has been documenting the city s life by rephotographing and bringing together images of the city from several sources , including the connecticut historical society and the connecticut state library but the times s photographs of everyday life , particularly in hartford s neighborhoods , admirably fill in some notable gaps , ms wheeler said we do n't have puerto rican community photos from any other source , she explained , adding that the images of the latino community especially those taken for two series done by the newspaper in the 1950 s and 1960 s are stunning there are also photographs of the demolition of the old italian neighborhood on front street \( to make room for constitution plaza \) and of the race riots and antiwar demonstrations of the 1960 s \( first filed under the heading disturbances \) , the flood of 1936 , the hurricane of 1938 and the hartford hospital fire in 1961 photographs of hartford s africanamerican community , of its immigrant neighborhoods and of its onceteeming downtown streets are all there we forget how many people were on the streets , said ms wheeler the newspaper files have arrived just as the hartford collection a separate chronicling of the life of hartford will be formally opened to the public in a refurbished , climatecontrolled room on the second floor of the hartford public library building at 500 main st a ribbon cutting is planned for tuesday the hartford collection houses some 50 , 000 items including original signed volumes of books by many hartford authors from mark twain and harriet beecher stowe to brendan gill and mr goddard , the author of a 1993 book on the history of railroads in america there are also more than 90 pamphlets from lexicographer noah webster s library , beforeandafter photos of hartford roads being paved , posters and photographs and city park plans from city department of engineering files the room has been open to the public from noon to 5 pm on weekdays since midseptember , when new red oak tables and tapestrybacked chairs were installed , along with ultravioletresistant shades and walltowall deep green carpeting the refurbishing was accomplished after more than 850 , 000 was raised , mostly from private donors at the formal opening , a newly produced film about hartford , beating the odds , will be shown the film chronicles the life of the city from its origins in the 17th century to the present some images from the hartford times file photographs were used in its making mr goddard wrote the script louise blalock , chief librarian at the hartford public library , noted that for years the hartford collection had been spread out in five different sites in the library , some of it in boxes that were rarely , if ever , opened the new accessibility is important , she feels i think it is valuable to everyone who lives in the city of hartford and wants to find themselves in relationship to the people in hartford we have 102 ethnic groups living in the city today they can see themselves in the people who preceded them , said ms blalock as for the hartford times morgue , she said , the stuff is very rich the images are great this was a paper dedicated to the city of hartford photos it was n't all grim in the flood of '36 , as is evident by the news

the myth is that manufacturing in connecticut is dead the fact is that while large military contractors and older , heavy industries have lost thousands of jobs , small and mediumsized manufacturing companies are growing in fact , their growth is being held back by a shortage of skilled workers , according to the connecticut skilled trades coalition , which represents small and mediumsized manufacturers it s the bestkept secret in the state , said james jackson , chairman of the coalition and president of jackson associates , a consulting firm small and mediumsized manufacturers those with an average of 60 employees each number nearly 6 , 000 in connecticut a survey of 115 businesses conducted last year by the coalition found an average of 19 skilled trades positions per company there were 351 openings in jobs like precision machining , tool and die making , plastics and precision sheet metal manufacturing and general machining business owners indicated they expected about 2 , 500 job openings in skilled trades during the next decade , which represents about 22 per company the numbers may not be large , but machinery is moved into storage and sales staffs cut , because manufacturers are unable to find skilled workers , according to the coalition they say training for this kind of work no longer exists in connecticut business owners also say that manufacturing jobs are no longer dull , dirty and dangerous the noisy , dingy factory has given way to clean , welllighted , airconditioned shops employees who clock in , work like robots on an assembly line and clock out at the end of the day are gone , they say in their place are people who are expected to solve problems , make decisions , adapt quickly to new technologies and processes and work in teams a job in one of the skilled trades pays about 30 , 000 at the start and 45 , 000 to 50 , 000 for 40 hours a week after several years of experience pay can increase to as much as 70 , 000 a year with overtime , said murray gerber , president of prototype and plastic mold company in middletown jobs are available immediately after high school , and most companies offer some tuition assistance the 81 employees at prototype and plastic mold make plastic molded parts for a variety of manufacturers , including the aircraft and aerospace industries computers control the plant s milling and injection molding machines and optical inspection systems yet , most high school graduates who apply for jobs at the plant lack the math and science skills they need , said mr gerber furthermore , they have no work ethic , he said they do n't understand about coming to work on time they think that in three months , they 'll be vice presidents and a year later , company presidents the state s education system has many flaws and is far from producing the educated people needed in an industrialized society students who are not interested in college are not given as much attention and encouragement as those in college preparatory courses parents assume that a college education is the key to their children s career success , and going to college is seen as a measure of achievement , noted larry mchugh , president of the middlesex county chamber of commerce that has to change , he added we have to start getting kids ready for jobs immediately after high school the connecticut business and industry association promotes collaboration between schools and businesses in order to prepare students for work brian beaudin , senior vice president of the association , said word must get out that manufacturing is the only industry where you can support a family out of high school with no college degree it s tough to support a family on a bank teller s wages members of the middlesex county chamber of commerce who responded to a survey ranked attendance and dependability highest among the traits essential for employees ability to work as a member of a team came next , followed by skill in reading , writing , general math , blueprint reading and problem solving the chamber of commerce , which runs job training programs , plans to start another training course to meet the needs of its members as the number of workers in manufacturing has declined , apprentice programs have dwindled and failed to keep pace with technology , said mr gerber companies that set up apprentice programs , he said , should receive tax incentives , and advanced courses should be offered in locations across the state so employees do not have to travel long distances to attend classes after work the state s vocationaltechnical schools trained many students in manufacturing technologies until large companies started downsizing then the apprentice system , the traditional feeder for skilled workers , died out , and enrollment in the schools dropped last spring , only about 400 students out of 9 , 500 were enrolled in manufacturing courses , said dominic spera , assistant superintendent of the vocationaltechnical schools mr spera said he blames the students' lack of interest in manufacturing on continuous publicity about downsizing
detroit , aug 28 the canadian automobile workers union announced today that it had chosen the chrysler corporation as its primary target for labor contract negotiations and a possible strike this autumn , the latest step in a strategy closely coordinated with american autounion leaders basil e hargrove , the president of the canadian union , said in toronto that he had little choice in selecting chrysler the canadian union has its biggest differences with the general motors corporation , but talks with gm have shown little progress leaders of the united automobile workers , the union s huge american counterpart , tentatively decided here on monday to pursue simultaneous talks for a while with gm and the ford motor company the canadian union has made a point of never negotiating with the same company at the same time as the uaw , for fear that the auto maker would ignore it as a much smaller union the goal of the negotiations in canada with chrysler will be to win a national labor contract that gm and ford will later be forced to accept , mr hargrove said he emphasized that he was not seeking a strike against chrysler , which has been the only auto maker that has not backed tough labor laws being drafted by the provincial parliament of ontario this is not about a declaration of war against chrysler , this is about selecting a target , mr hargrove said we have no desire at all to take a minute s production out of chrysler s operation chrysler , which depends on a factory in windsor , ontario , for half of its highly profitable minivans , issued a statement signaling that it was not prepared to make concessions that might undermine its ability to compete with rivals we look forward to this opportunity to work together to negotiate an agreement which will insure the longterm strength of our company and our ability to effectively compete in north america and globally , said kenneth r francese , vice president for human resources at chrysler canada ltd , in the statement the canadian union s decision coincided with signs of some differences of opinion at the uaw people close to the american union said that many presidents of union locals wanted to confront gm immediately over its efforts to sell or close some of its autoparts factories and buy more parts from outside , nonunion suppliers in a dozen separate interviews last week with local union leaders at a uaw gathering here , most expressed a desire to tackle gm first no one then mentioned ford , with which the union has few grievances but some leaders at the uaw s national headquarters here , including stephen p yokich , its president , are deeply committed to the reelection of president clinton they are wary of risking a nasty strike at gm before the election on nov 5 one that could leave voters upset with labor unions and democrats alike , people familiar with the divisions within the union said if the uaw cuts a deal first with ford and then with chrysler , and takes a while to ratify each pact , it can postpone a strike at gm until after the election mr yokich dismissed the importance of the elections at a news conference last week , quipping that he and his colleagues were not candidates but several people close to the uaw said that while the union did not want to dilute its bargaining power by acknowledging the role of the elections , the uaw s leadership remained very interested in helping president clinton another advantage of negotiating with ford is that mr yokich has a close relationship with ford executives , having served as the uaw s vice president for ford issues from 1983 through 1989 a disadvantage is that the uaw started its last round of labor talks in 1993 at ford , and many midlevel union officials believe in giving each company a turn as the strike target there have been only a few previous cases of the uaw selecting the same company twice in a row the result of this disagreement has been an impasse , during which negotiations proceed with both gm and ford uaw officials at the national headquarters hope that either gm will signal a willingness to make concessions without a strike or that local union activists will decide to temper their impatience , a person close to the union said another person close to the union said that whatever decision was made by mr yokich , the uaw s tradition of centralized bureaucracy would make sure that the overall union supports it steve s in control , said the person , who insisted on anonymity mr yokich met today with the uaw s top officers to review strategy , but did not call a meeting of the union s board , people close to the union said by contrast , the board had a conference call on monday to approve the officers' decision that morning to leave chrysler for later in the fall mr yokich has retained the authority to reverse any decision at any time autoindustry officials said today that the big three were developing new proposals to deal with the issue of parts purchases from outside vendors the proposals call for paying considerably lower wages to newly hired parts workers under their provisions , such new workers would perform tasks previously contracted out to other companies , or would be hired only if a company s employment remained at least at its current level , officials in or close to the companies said uaw workers earn close to 20 an hour plus substantial benefits , while partsindustry workers are commonly paid half as much , with fewer benefits the uaw opposes anything resembling a twotier wage structure some auto executives are now studying whether lowpaid workers might be allowed only at new factories , so as to avoid friction with highpaid workers and to reassure the uaw that the companies are committed to investing in factories in the united states , rather than overseas all the proposals are still in the development stage , and none has yet been presented to the union , a person close to the manufacturers said the big three auto makers' current , threeyear labor contracts with the canadian and american unions all expire at midnight on sept 14 , a saturday mr hargrove set sept 17 , a tuesday , as the deadline for a deal at chrysler a failure to reach a deal punctually then would result in an immediate disruption of production , while a failure to reach a deal on a saturday night would have little effect because most factories are closed on sunday , anyway the more militant canadian union split away from the uaw a decade ago and has remained independent since the canadian union represents 53 , 000 autoindustry workers while the uaw represents about 400 , 000 american auto workers
stravinsky and the russian traditions a biography of the works through mavra by richard taruskin illustrated two volumes 1 , 757 pp berkeley university of california press 125 175 after dec 31 this is a staggering achievement richard taruskin reminds us in what is , for him , a rare example of truism or received opinion that igor stravinsky is the most famous composer of the 20th century but he reminds us too in the same breath that we have hitherto been ignorant , in many central respects , of where stravinsky s music came from , and therefore of what it is stravinsky himself is partly to blame once in the west , he was at pains to disguise or disclaim what he owed to his homeland better to assert , even in flat contradiction of his own esthetic of creation through and against limitation , an unwilled spontaneity than to admit to membership in the rimskykorsakov school and to close acquaintance with folk music here mr taruskin , a professor of music at the university of california , berkeley , offers the key to understanding the composer s many later recollections in print their disinformation and selfcontradiction should not be blamed on ghostwriters what stravinsky had led us to forget is what this study lays before us stravinsky and the russian traditions at first , mr taruskin s title reads a little oddly , but by the end of his two mighty volumes it feels right the plural is necessary because of the variety of traditions threaded into the picture art , music , folklore , popular song , liturgy , painting , design , choreography , literature , class , politics there surely cannot be any more of russian culture to be called to witness the range of mr taruskin s reference , and the command across that range , compel respect , indeed awe his polymathy is equaled by the acutenesses of his ear and of his analytical eye the virtues of knowing the obscure the songs of mikhail gnesin or the artists who worked at savva mamontov s estate of abramtsevo or the folksong research of yevgeniya linyova or the emigre russian cabaret in paris known as the theatre de la chauvesouris are not wasted in vacuous correspondences but made to work stravinsky s description of tradition in his 193940 harvard lectures as a living force that animates and informs the present was surely meant to situate his 1922 opera mavra in an antiwagnerian current that included aida , carmen and , heaven help us , andre messager s veronique this selfimplanting always seemed a bit factitious , and now we can begin to comprehend why in deep details stravinsky s music was always russian , animated and informed by living forces from russia , pervaded by russian attitudes and stories \( and the particular story behind mavra , relating to that parisian cabaret , is new , fascinating and , as mr taruskin suggests , crucial for stravinsky s neoclassicism , whose beginning he places here , in a musical escapade spilled across mirrors of irony \) necessarily , mr taruskin s study belongs within traditions of its own , and he scrupulously footnotes his debts but there is no parallel in musical scholarship for his compendiousness , and almost none for the verve of his writing harmonic analysis , whose cumbersome terminology is normally the death of style , springs to life the quest for stravinsky s sources becomes , time and again , a detective story it begins with an exhaustive study of the music stravinsky wrote , and heard , during the years before the success of the firebird in 1910 this prediaghilev period in the composer s life is normally regarded as a kind of dormancy , and it comes as a surprise to reach page 400 here and still have come no farther than the lost funerary chant written on the death of rimskykorsakov in 1908 not that one has been regretting the progress there is illuminating material here on the career of the composer s father , fyodor stravinsky \( who might have been as well known to us as his fellow bass chaliapin if he had survived into the age of recording \) on the classicizing influence the patron mitrofan belyayev had on russian music around the turn of the century and , most especially , on the symmetrical pitch groupings notably the octatonic scale , of alternating whole tones and semitones whose disruption of harmonic normality was relished by rimskykorsakov and transmitted to his pupil stravinsky nearly 1 , 300 pages later we will discover , movingly , stravinsky remembering this aspect of his heritage when he came to write a funerary chant for himself , the requiem canticles of 1966 but as a young man , he was in an academic byway he knew little folklore , and probably wanted to know even less diaghilev s commissioning of the major novelty for his paris season from such a composer in 1910 when that composer had hardly more to show for himself than the brilliant but tiny fireworks is an amazing instance of foresight or luck or desperation \( mr taruskin suggests that stravinsky might have been fifth choice for the firebird \) but the seeds were there , in the acquaintance with rimskykorsakov and other russian music of the period those of us who know little rimskykorsakov are wont to hear the firebird in terms of sheherazade , but mr taruskin shows us that the real connections are with rimskykorsakov s operas and with works by glazunov , lyadov , balakirev , scriabin and tchaikovsky
as a place for artists and their doings , long island is an extension of the city you wo n't find much that ca n't be seen in manhattan yet the island still retains a local charm , reflected in the east end landscapes of jane wilson , on view at the parrish art museum in southampton , and in a number of works by long island artists in the current flower show at the heckscher museum of art in huntington there is also the pleasure of seeing art in different , maybe warmer , settings smalltown museums or galleries surrounded by trees , grass and village life or , occasionally , as in the

language not quite abstract , they are rife with body and sexual references , and they are cued by , among other influences , cartoon imagery , television graphics , primitive glyphs , children sbook

al aroub , west bank , oct 3 a group of teenagers wearing old jeans and dirty sneakers clambered up to the rooftops early this morning to let the israeli soldiers below know what they thought of the summit meeting that ended the night before in washington bottles filled with gasoline and topped with burning rags flew in graceful arcs toward the lonely ribbon of asphalt in this community , officially designated a refugee camp by the united nations , in a zone still patrolled by israelis as the gasoline bombs rained down , a halfdozen israeli paratroopers wearing helmets , hugging either side of the street , pointed their m16 assault rifles , equipped with bulbous grenade launchers under the barrels , toward their attackers the young palestinians , experienced street fighters , ducked , crouched and scampered to avoid detection until the troops let loose with a warning volley the palestinian youths melted away no one was wounded and the confrontation ended as suddenly as it had begun frightened families slammed their shutters tight children let out wails of fear and the troops pulled back behind some trees , anxiously scanning the maze of concrete hovels for any movement there was none the refugee camp fell still and silent the minibattle , recounted in detail by israeli troops and camp residents minutes after it ended , could have been lifted from the sixyearlong palestinian uprising known as the intifada that started in late 1987 but , deep below the surface , the differences were profound and bode ill for any future conflict that might erupt if the faltering peace process sputters out the young men who carried out this assault have little schooling , no jobs , no hopes of getting any jobs and a future so bleak that confrontation has become a vocation it would be easy to say they have become islamic radicals they all say they are believers but in fact they seem to have little ideology , saying that they will back anyone , whether it is yasir arafat s 30 , 000strong palestinian police force , or the militant islamic group hamas , willing to kill jews the moment the palestinian police opened fire on the jewish troops last week they became our brothers , said jamal abu mohammed , a teenager , as he stood at the edge of the camp before that they had been israeli rentacops in arab uniforms but now they have proved that they are with us we are all one now we will together drive the jewish occupiers from our land al aroub refugee camp , about seven miles outside of hebron , is a squalid warren surrounded by a chainlink fence patrolled by israeli paratroopers in red berets , several of whom said they did not particularly like their job there are no trees , gardens , patches of grass or even flower boxes to offset the hard , dusty rocks and gray concrete blocks that make up the walls of houses that see six or eight people packed to a room the camp , like the city of hebron , remains under roundtheclock curfew , and the confrontation this morning ended any hopes of the 5 , 000 people trapped inside that they would get an hour to go buy food the sixyear uprising of the late 1980 s and 1990 s , which finally drove the israelis to negotiate a peace accord with mr arafat , was carried out by young men whose parents had often proved docile and compliant under israeli occupation many took to the streets in 1988 because they saw their parents , who had lost their homes and their businesses , humiliated day after day by the israelis those that began that uprising are now in their 20 s some have joined the palestinian police , others have started families and work at menial jobs they can still recall , from before the previous uprising anyway , lives with stable homes , traditional ties , enough income to survive and the driving ambition that once made the palestinians the besteducated arabs in the middle east all that has changed , especially with the loss of the hundreds of millions of dollars in remittances that once poured into the west bank and gaza from palestinians who worked in the persian gulf before the iraqi invasion of kuwait now , a generation is growing up knowing curfews , shootings , closed borders with israel and grinding poverty many had older brothers who were crippled or killed by israeli gunfire and fathers who lost their jobs few spent much time in school the old uprising was carried out to establish our own state , said abu ahmed but if the violence begins again , it will lead to a war where our goal will be to exterminate the jews a year after selfrule was extended to parts of the west bank and gaza , nearly all palestinians find themselves banned from israeli territory , an edict that took force after a series of suicide bombings in israel in february and march the economy has ground to a halt palestinian cities lie ringed by israeli tanks and armored vehicles , severing ties between 450 towns and communities and israeli troops have blocked off dozens of roads leading into israel with concrete barricades interviews here suggest that if prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel refuses to push ahead with the oslo peace accords , he will face a different foe than the one israel grew accustomed to in the past , one far readier to die most palestinians interviewed today said mr netanyahu had one last chance to salvage the peace process when talks begin at the edge of the gaza strip on sunday if that fails , they said , there will be no holding back the volcanic rumblings of hatred and frustration that fuel many young and desperate palestinians there is a terrible fury brewing here , said hama abu ghoush , 32 it frightens even me we are hanging by a thread if the talks on sunday fail , if we are convinced that the peace process is dead , then it will kill all our hope for a better life many people , already depressed , are too tired to fight but there is a whole generation with nothing more to lose they want only vengeance

christmas week might not seem the best time to open a movie that celebrates a millionaire pornographer as an american folk hero but in its own way , the people vs larry flynt , milos forman s raucous hymn to the first amendment , belongs to a season when the sacred and the crass are served up in one flamboyant pudding of consumer excess and sentimental redemption if america has a civic religion , as the harvard scholar henry louis gates jr has observed , the first amendment is its central article of faith and the czechborn mr forman , with the gusto of a convert , is offering us an unabashed smut peddler as its patron saint , draped in all the starspangled iconography that hollywood can muster the movie , shown to acclaim at the new york film festival this fall and opening in theaters on friday , has been critically embraced not only as an artistic tour de force but as a kind of democratic morality play but to some first amendment legal scholars and practitioners , it all sounds a little too pat , if not too pious they know that like any sacred doctrine , the first amendment is subject to the conflicting interpretations of its true believers and even with a united states supreme court decision to his name , larry flynt stands for only one version a lot of the press reports have treated this as though larry flynt , for all his flaws , is kind of a hero of the first amendment , complains cass sunstein , a professor of law at the university of chicago and a first amendment specialist it s as if there are these evil people who are really moralistic and punitive , and then there are these freedom lovers that s a really selfcongratulatory , complacent way for movie makers to see the conflict even burt neuborne , the civil liberties lawyer who in the movie is cast against the grain as the selfimportant counsel to the rev jerry falwell , worries that the people vs larry flynt is onesided preachy is the word he used to describe some of the proflynt courtroom speeches taken directly from court transcripts can it be that a movie that features a cartoon of a sexually aroused santa claus is not too raunchy but too reverent about free speech to do justice to the first amendment \? i would have loved to see somebody in that movie make the case against the first amendment position , said mr neuborne , a former legal director of the american civil liberties union and now a law professor at new york university the pitch was always free speech against narrowminded bigots what you never heard was a more thoughtful voice in fact , civil libertarians agree , a long tradition of first amendment case law relegates sexual expression to the very fringes of constitutional protection while jealously guarding political speech even at its most hateful the free exchange of political ideas , no matter how offensive , has been enshrined as essential to the very purpose of the constitution selfgovernment by the people obscenity in theory , at least remains one of the few categorical exceptions to the first amendment , like libel , fighting words and falsely shouting fire ! in a crowded theater flynt is n't basically a political dissident he s basically a pornographer , mr sunstein said while it may be permissible to publish materials that portray human beings as dehumanized objects for other people s masturbation , he added , people who think that s not protected by the first amendment have got an argument , and they 're not puritanical people who are trying to oppose freedom but the movie gives us larry flynt \( played to the hilt by woody harrelson \) as the lovable enfant terrible of the constitution , his redneck vulgarity not just the price of a free society but a bracing antidote to the social pretentions of scoundrels he is the horatio alger of the sexual revolution , a poor kentucky boy who parlays a string of seedy ohio strip joints into a porn publishing empire , getting rich and having fun while thumbing his nose at the establishment what could be more american \? to underline the point , mr forman , who came to the united states in 1968 as a refugee from communist repression in czechoslovakia , is lavish in his use of red , white and blue in one memorable sequence , flynt appears against a night sky filled with fireworks , flanked by drummer girls and a statue of liberty , like some ruritanian vision of a yankee doodle dandy the occasion is a bicentennial party at his first mansion , where a hot tub orgy becomes the prelude to his marriage proposal to althea leasure \( played by the rock star courtney love \) , an underage dancer with a keen bisexual appetite and the provocative business sense to propose a wizard of oz cartoon with an anatomically correct tin man in another scene , we are treated to a flagdraped chorus line strutting to the battle hymn of the republic , and we see flynt preach his gospel of unlimited sexual expression before a giant slide projection of waving stars and stripes what is more obscene , sex or war \? he asks as gentle porn is intercut with scenes from my lai and hiroshima and when he is shot down and paralyzed by an unknown sniper on the steps of a georgia courthouse , the movie suggests that he has been martyred by all the nation s darkest forces , deprived of his manhood , as he puts it , by an establishment that outlaws sexual release but celebrates violence
in an unusual move tantamount to approving a new drug , the food and drug administration plans to publish in the federal register a notice that says ordinary oral contraceptives can be safely and effectively used as morning after pills , according to a top agency official at a hearing on friday , the reproductive health advisory committee of the federal agency unanimously declared that birth control pills could be used to prevent pregnancy up to 72 hours after unprotected intercourse but because of concerns about not only liability litigation but also antiabortion protests , no manufacturer has been willing to market the pills specifically for such postcoital , or emergency , use and without an application from a manufacturer , the food and drug administration cannot formally approve the new use , said the official , mary pendergast , the deputy commissioner we 're trying to pave the way for greater access to emergency contraception , and this is as far as we can go without a new drug application , ms pendergast said in an interview yesterday we hope the notice in the federal register will calm people s anxieties about using oral contraceptives as morningafter pills and we 're still hopeful that someone will come forward to market them she added , once we 've declared that they 're safe and effective , the approval process for a manufacturer would be very simple , just a matter of making sure that what they 're selling is the bioequivalent of what we 've approved birth control pills have been used to prevent pregnancy postcoitally for more than a decade in countries including britain , new zealand , switzerland and france , where the pills are sold in special packages for such use and in the united states , college health specialists , rape crisis centers and some reproductive health clinics have increasingly offered oral contraceptives for postcoital use to women who were raped , whose method of birth control failed or who reported that they simply failed to use contraception in late 1994 , the center for reproductive law and policy , a new york advocacy group , petitioned the federal agency to require companies that sell birth control pills in this country to label them for use as a postcoital contraceptive for such use , the first dose of two or four pills , depending on the strength of the pill , must be taken within 72 hours of intercourse , and a second dose , the same size , must follow 12 hours later used properly , oral contraceptives have been found to prevent pregnancy postcoitally 75 percent of the time we told the fda that the pharmaceutical companies are providing misleading information when they fail to tell women that these pills can safely be used this way , said janet benshoof , the center s president , who filed the petition on behalf of clients including planned parenthood of new york , the american public health association and the american medical women s association this is not really an offlabel use , ms benshoof continued in an interview yesterday it s another contraceptive use at a different dosage but because it s birth control , and everyone is so worried about liability , some doctors have been hesitant to use it that way at rape crisis centers , though , it s become so much the standard of care that there was a malpractice case in california based on failure to offer emergency contraception to a rape victim besides the concerns about litigation , manufacturers and doctors are wary of becoming embroiled in abortion politics the agency considers morningafter pills a form of contraception since they block the fertilized egg from implanting into the uterine wall implantation , not fertilization , marks the beginning of pregnancy by the health community s definition but the roman catholic church and some other opponents of abortion believe that life begins when sperm and egg unite and therefore oppose postcoital contraception at the hearing on friday in washington , rebecca lindstadt of the american life league said postcoital contraception was killing an unborn child before its life is even begun the family research council , which also opposes postcoital use of the pill , said that if relabeling occurs , girls and women may forgo other forms of birth control and simply choose to consume larger doses of the pill after sex a spokeswoman for the conference of american catholic bishops has said in the past that although catholic hospitals can provide the pills for rape victims if a doctor suspects that conception has not occurred , the church disapproves the use of the pills after consensual sex the possibility of using birth control pills as morningafter pills is well known to doctors in this country indeed , in a 1995 survey of 300 obstetriciangynecologists conducted by louis harris associates for the kaiser family foundation , 775 percent reported that they were very familiar with postcoital contraceptive pills and 22 percent said they were somewhat familiar with them but most said they did not prescribe pills for such use unless women specifically asked for them and a related survey showed that most women were unaware that morningafter pills were available planned parenthood of new york recently began advertising the availability of postcoital contraception
washington , dec 21 struggling to limit the effect of recent ballot initiatives in california and arizona that relax restrictions on the medical use of marijuana and other illegal drugs , federal officials say they plan to prosecute and strip prescription licenses from doctors who help supply such drugs to even seriously ill people the officials said that after an intense and sometimes unwieldy debate over the past six weeks about how the federal government should respond to the new state laws , the justice department has decided against filing suit to try to block either of the measures in court instead , officials said , the clinton administration will undertake a publicrelations offensive to reiterate the health dangers of illegal drugs , leave it to state and local police to arrest people for marijuana possession , and focus federal lawenforcement efforts on the doctors who help to provide otherwise illegal drugs and the dealers who distribute them i think we are going to end up with a smaller group of these physicians than we ourselves once expected , the head of the drug enforcement administration , thomas a constantine , said in an interview and we are going to take very , very serious action against them the plan to move against the doctors both by revoking the drug enforcement administration registration they need to prescribe controlled drugs and , in more serious cases , by prosecuting them is the centerpiece of a package of measures that were recommended to president clinton on friday by his drugpolicy chief , gen barry r mccaffrey , officials said the plan was based on the recommendations of a halfdozen cabinet departments a formal announcement of the administration s approach is not expected until early january but while mr clinton has yet to approve the package , several officials involved in its creation said some basic elements of the federal response to the state measures were almost certain to go ahead as proposed general mccaffrey and other administration officials contend that the two initiatives represent a significant threat to the nation s drugcontrol strategy they complain that at a time when drug use among teenagers is rising sharply , the state laws send a resonant message that marijuana is not only less than harmful , it may be medically valuable i would have preferred to see a straightup vote on legalization , because it would not have won in either state , general mccaffrey said when it came up under the guise of the 'compassionate use' of marijuana , we got the worst of both worlds the arizona law , which opponents are vowing to amend or repeal in the legislature next year , allows sick people to receive illegal drugs for pain relief or the treatment of certain illnesses if two licensed physicians concur on its use and offer scientific research to show that it is appropriate the california measure , which is at once less precise and more difficult to overturn , decriminalizes the possession of marijuana by patients and care givers if its use is recommended by a physician it sounds like they are retreating , sam vagenas , coordinator of the campaign for the arizona measure , said of the federal plan barry mccaffrey has been saying that the arizona initiative was in conflict with federal law now they 're saying they 're not going to file suit against it , and they 're not going to go after people for possession we consider that a major victory lawenforcement officials said the government also will not challenge other key parts of the arizona initiative , proposition 200 , which , if fully implemented , would limit the prison sentences that can be applied to certain drug offenders officials familiar with the memorandum sent to mr clinton on friday by the general s office of national drug control policy said it did call for the department of health and human services to wage a campaign to discredit the notion that smoking marijuana has medicinal benefits a campaign for which they said there is ample scientific evidence also , the officials said , general mccaffrey s office recommended that government agencies remind americans that the medical use of marijuana and other drugs will not be accepted as an excuse in the application of drugtesting laws to airline pilots , truck drivers , members of the armed forces and others transportation secretary federico f pena issued the first such warning last week but some lawenforcement officials say that the planned message is unlikely to be forceful enough no one in the government is drawing a conclusion from all of this , a sound bite to argue , and that s where they beat us , said a senior lawenforcement official referring to general mccaffrey , he added this is a debate that he s going to have to take to the american people officials now acknowledge that the two initiatives , which the voters approved in november by comfortable margins , took the clinton administration largely by surprise while wealthy supporters of the measures poured money into television advertisements that emphasized compassion in california and policy reform in arizona , state and federal officials opposed to the propositions admit that they campaigned only intermittently and , for the most part , ineffectively i'm not sure anyone really recognized how these laws developed and what their impact would be , mr constantine said
tarrytown the sun is setting on the sunset serenades this popular concert series , held outdoors at lyndhurst here on saturday evenings at dusk since 1987 , has ended because of a lack of money no more will music waft through the summer air while in the background the sky explodes in a pinkgold crepuscule and the river runs silver no more will hundreds of people spread blankets on the rolling lawns and unload picnic hampers filled with homemade goodies and bottles of wine the activity was costing lyndhurst too much we are a nonprofit institution , and we cannot afford to lose money , said susanne brendelpandich , lyndhurst s director unfortunately , the series cost 80 , 000 to produce each season funds , she explained , come from admission \( 9 children younger than 16 , free 2 a car for parking \) and corporate sponsorship recently , corporate support dropped badly and the weather is also a factor if it rains , you must still pay musicians and sound technicians , but , of course , no one comes to hear the music corporate support has plummeted because of downsizing , ms pandich said one company s contribution went from several thousand to several hundred dollars what is more , lyndhurst , with its striking gothicstyle mansion , vast manicured grounds and national trust historic site status , can generate far more income by being available for weddings and other catered affairs two weddings have already been booked for saturday nights in july next year none of which consoles those who love to listen to music while breathing fresh air instead of airconditioned air ,

studied , she said mrs jones lamented the end of the series , saying , it s such a shame maybe someone will come through with more support maybe something will turn it around lyndhurst was built in 1838 and has been called one of america s finest gothic revival mansions among its occupants were mayor william paulding of new york city , the merchant george merritt and the railroad baron jay gould lyndhurst was gould s country home until his death in 1892 his descendants owned it until 1961 when the 67acre estate passed to the national trust for historic preservation the first concerts were held in the 1960 s shortly after the national trust opened the house as a museum steven simon , a member of the annenberg family , conducted the 8 pm concerts , which were held on the rear lawn under a tent and were often followed by fireworks after several years , and several rain cancellations , however , the annenberg family decided to stop sponsoring the events in the 1980 s , richard kapp , director of the philharmonia virtuosi , suggested the new format concerts would be held on the front lawn at 6 pm to encourage picnicking , and children 16 and younger would be admitted free families could bring great food , he reasoned , get a fine view of the strikingly angular gothic roof line , which is reflected in the shape of the surrounding evergreens , and hear a variety of music concerts this season were to include not only free performances by the philharmonia virtuosi playing mozart , tchaikovsky and vivaldi but also the stan rubin big band and cruz control , a salsa band \( stan rubin and cruz control were both rained out \) mr kapp is not at all happy with the decision to end the series after his orchestra played works by mozart and haydn , he joined friends in the audience and spoke about the future i'm angry , he said i cannot believe we live in a society which ca n't find a way to support something like these concerts something which provides a qualityoflife experience for so many people look he gestured toward the crowds lingering on the lawn people do n't even want to leave among his friends were rick dolan , violinist for the philharmonia virtuosi , and his wife , sandra ruggles , who sings with the metropolitan opera and the new york city opera mr dolan and ms ruggles had prepared an elaborate picnic as they and their friends shared indianstyle chicken , mexican rice , bakedbean casserole and pasta with capers and artichokes , they spoke about the demise of the sunset serenades , echoing almost exactly the words others had said it s a shame it s such a wonderful thing , ms ruggles said look she kicked up a foot i can hear mozart and be barefoot at the same time mr dolan added people want to come for the outdoor experience mozart himself heard his music played in courtyards , at festivals , at special events , even on barges but i'm not giving up hope i'm betting my wages that somehow , someone , some other corporation , some miracle worker , will come to the rescue i would truly hate to see this end photo at final sunset serenade at lyndhurst , richard kapp , conductor of the philharmonia virtuosi , said he was angry that the

san francisco , oct 2 there are drug wars , and there are drug wars and then , it appears , there are the prettymuchsymbolic drugrelated spats marching bravely into the cultural swamp where dan quayle once bogged down in combat with the television single mother murphy brown , california s attorney general , dan lungren , has taken his fight against the medical use of marijuana to zonker harris , the laidback hero of the comic strip doonesbury in a series of cartoons being published this week , mr harris \( if he can be called that \) muses sympathetically about a proposition on california s november ballot that would legalize the possession of marijuana for people suffering from illnesses like cancer and aids and he gasps in horror upon hearing of the raid by state narcotics agents last august on an illegal san francisco emporium where the drug was sold to thousands of people who said they were sick what \? zonker demands what country are we living in germany \? russia \? idaho \? mr lungren , who ordered the raid that shut down the cannabis buyer s club here , was not amused hours after the strip appeared on tuesday identifying him with some exaggeration as the man who sent 100 heavily armed narcs into the marijuana bazaar with a battering ram , he called a news conference at the capitol in sacramento no one should be laughing , said mr lungren , asking newspapers in the state to censor the rest of the week s cartoons as a public service make no mistake about it these strips contribute to the national winkandnod attitude toward drug use mr lungren , a politically ambitious republican who has been an outspoken opponent of the ballot measure , heatedly denied that his own interests were mixed up in his pique at doonesbury s author , garry trudeau the problem , he insisted , is a climate of growing political and social tolerance about drugs and its correlation with the recent rise in marijuana use among american teenagers i appreciate political satire , the attorney general said but i think i know when a line has been crossed like the former vice president , however , mr lungren appeared to have underestimated his adversaries' capacity to make fun , at least of him asked his feelings about the dispute today , the founder of the defunct san francisco buyers' club , dennis peron , said i'm doing great ! great ! it s too bad crybaby lungren is n't doing as well as i am ! i think he s just gone off the deep end waaa ! mr trudeau did not return telephone calls today asking for his thoughts on mr lungren s complaints an editor for universal press syndicate , which distributes doonesbury , said none of california s newspapers appeared to have heeded the attorney general s request that they pull the cartoons the strip is satire , said the editor , elizabeth andersen he makes fun of patients who want marijuana for hay fever he makes fun of democrats and republicans mr lungren s raid and a subsequent court injunction shut down mr peron s busy , fivestory outlet after two years in which the united states attorney in san francisco and the city s district attorney had both declined to prosecute it san francisco s board of supervisors had also resolved that sales of marijuana for medical use should be considered of the lowest priority by the city s police , arguing that the drug eases the nausea and stimulates the appetite of some sick people but over a period of months , undercover state agents gathered evidence that the control of sales at the buyers' club was extremely loose , at best at his news conference on tuesday , mr lungren displayed blownup photographs that he said showed teenagers buying marijuana at the club , an accusation that mr peron denied state officials have also said that marijuana prescriptions were sometimes scrawled on napkins , that anyone complaining of a headache was generally served as a legitimate customer none of that , however , impressed the powers in san francisco never minding the narcotics laws , the city s famously liberal district attorney , terence hallinan , said the state had overstepped its authority by not consulting him before the raid the mayor , willie brown , compared mr lungren s tactics to those of the nazi gestapo although a smaller buyers' club was raided last month in west los angeles , others continue to operate in oakland , santa cruz and hayward , mr peron said and in san francisco , a medical foundation has joined with several local churches to distribute small amounts of marijuana to patients who are now more carefully screened i do n't think this is a joke or anything , mr hallinan said today , applying his standard contrarian view to mr lungren s contretemps but it seems strange that a politician like that would have such thin skin this goes with the business compared to some of the things they 've said about me photo cartoon attorney general dan lungren of california on tuesday displayed an undercover photograph of a teenager smoking marijuana at the cannabis buyer s club in san francisco \( dick schmidt the sacramento bee \) while defending himself against the doonesbury comic strip \( universal press syndicate \) for ordering a raid that shut the club
vancouver , british columbia , jan 21 please , give me some room , don nelson said , a hint of irritation in his voice it was late saturday night here , and he was standing in a narrow arena hallway , his appearance more than slightly disheveled he was moving those annoyingly close microphones away from his barrel chest for the second time in a week the inquisition had begun , and though the knicks' coach was succinct and pointed in his answers , he was also in no mood to stick around and have his strategy in the final seconds questioned the strain above his brow was as visible as the brilliant hues of blue and gold in his silkpatterned tie ok , thank you , he said moments later , walking briskly into the visiting team s locker room before he could be asked or would explain the knicks' late breakdown on offense don , the last play , did you want a 3 or a 2 \? what were you thinking \? why \? nelson kept walking quickly , like a guard trying to make sure he passed halfcourt before his 10 seconds expired today , a day after the knicks could not beat one of the league s worst teams and two days before they faced its best team , the monday morning point guards were hounding him in the backcourt again when the expansion grizzlies show more poise and focus than the knicks in the final minute , as they surprisingly did during an 8480 upset victory at gm place saturday night , the scrutiny is bound to happen but the last time nelson received scrutiny such as this for a 2414 team is never , and his close friends in the business have seen the change in him that is now taking place even before he went to new york , i think with what happened at golden state he could sense the callousness starting to creep in , seattle coach george karl said last week and now , with all the craziness in new york , it is harder to get into his shell my advice to nellie is to find out how much he still loves the game because where he is , you have to deal with that kind of pressure at a totally different level nelson , who , until his celebrated confrontation with chris webber last season , never endured much questioning in the press , is coping but as several scenes over the past week have shown , he is genuinely sensitive to criticism , a spare and fussy man who would die happy if he never came across in print as the culprit that led to his team s shortcomings in saturday night s loss , he called for a twoman game between patrick ewing and anthony mason with the knicks trailing the grizzlies by 8380 and time running out byron scott had just made a difficult 15footer with 155 seconds left , but the knicks still had a chance nelson , knick players said , elected to quickly go for 2 points instead of 3 , with the hope that the knicks could then foul the grizzlies and get the ball back for one more shot but the play broke down as mason was surrounded ewing , who finished with 23 points and a seasonhigh 23 rebounds , ended up missing from 17 feet away on the right baseline derek harper , john starks and hubert davis were in the game at the time , all capable of loading up and firing a 3pointer in a pinch but none of them got a chance i'm the new guy on the block , but there have been several letdowns so far this season when we 've played poorrecord teams , nelson said afterward whether that has to do with the people in there taking things for granted , i do n't know but we should n't , because there is n't anybody in the league that ca n't beat us if we 're not prepared to play and there is n't anybody we ca n't beat when we are that s the way i look at it last monday , he defended his decision to have ewing take a 3pointer in the final seconds of the game with the knicks trailing at home by 3 against milwaukee when ewing took the shot , the team s most reliable and hottest 3point shooters davis and doug christie were sitting on the bench ewing was fouled while attempting the 3pointer , made only 1 of 3 three free throws and the knicks went on to lose nelson laughed about the commotion over that decision the next day , saying it was the first time anyone had criticized him for a play that had worked after all , he said , he had put his best player a 75 percent foul shooter at the line with a chance to tie the score was n't that enough \? he asked that issue and that game were behind him by the time the knicks had arrived for their morning shootaround against the supersonics on friday at key arena , fresh off a victory over the clippers in los angeles but nelson brought up the subject again , poking fun at the new york press corps for taking him to task over the milwaukee game when one observer said he could understand the strategy against milwaukee if davis had at least been on the floor , nelson responded that it would have been useless to use davis as a decoy , because as karl said , the body language on some of them tells you they 're a decoy over all , the exchange between nelson and the reporters was in good humor , never anything more than a polite debate nelson , though , was clearly trying to get his point across ewing had gone to the line the knicks had ended up with a chance to tie milwaukee and eventually win in basketball s great morality play , he had been right again on the other hand , unpredictability is not only nelson s calling card , it has also become an unwelcome part of the knicks' character the knicks had every reason to return from their west coast road trip with three straight victories , but they simply toyed with a bad team too long nelson said after saturday night s loss that he should have inserted a smaller lineup in the game earlier in the first half against vancouver , instead of trying to merely wear down their front line meanwhile , mason did not want to comment on the design of the final play , the one that ended with ewing s missed 2point shot if you want to be a pessimist and look down on it like the whole season s done because you lost this one , then that s the type of person you are , mason said when you get a win like the one in seattle , then you can be an optimist and you can look outside the stuff and say , 'if we play ball , we can do it' we can beat anybody on any given day but the knicks seem to be taking the most difficult route to learn that lesson in one respect , it s good to get two out of three , but we definitely should have gotten out of here with three wins , davis said of the road trip especially with the great win we had friday it reminded me so much of the old knicks it was great now the knicks are back home , with 343 chicago and michael jordan in town on tuesday as to which knick team will show , no one knows for nelson , that and the criticism are hard to take rebounds derek harper blamed himself for saturday s loss i'm embarrassed for my performance honestly , i am he scored 6 points in 31 minutes on 3of8 shooting , but was sitting down for a long stretch in the first half charles oakley made a surprise start on saturday after missing the past two games because of tendinitis in his left achilles' tendon he scored 9 points and grabbed only 4 rebounds in 27 minutes before being ejected in the fourth quarter along with the blue edwards of the grizzlies charles smith \( bruised right hip \) sat out the game but said he should be able to play on tuesday in two games against the knicks this season , former knick point guard greg anthony has scored 32 points he had 14 points , 3 rebounds , 4 assists and 4 steals saturday night photo patrick ewing arguing with an official after his teammatecharles oakley was ejected during the knicks' 8480 loss saturday night in vancouver \( associated press for the new york times \)
it has been more than a decade since marcy benstock slew her dragon , westway , the superhighway , park and luxury real estate development that was to be built on land dumped into the hudson river it is an achievement the historian robert caro calls one of the great victories in the history of new york in the 20th century the dragon is dead and buried , but the fight goes on the enemy is now a park an emerald sliver to replace five miles of industrial riverfront desolation that many of ms benstock s allies in the westway wars favor some of them wonder why she ca n't just declare victory and move on she s now fighting her friends , said state senator franz l leichter of manhattan , who has been allied with ms benstock in many battles she s opposing the very things we always thought she was for in a certain sense , it s a personal tragedy in manhattan s leftish political circles , ms benstock s soft , clear voice and takenoprisoners intensity made her the personification of the westway opposition and of a distinctively new york style of environmental activism now she has become a more ambiguous symbol , of the power of opposition as an end in itself it would be nice to have her on your side , said former mayor edward i koch , who said that he thinks the demise of westway cost the city billions of dollars in economic development for ms benstock , being a living symbol has had a price she works 12hour days , has never married and lives on the 25 , 000 a year she earns as sole employee of the clean air campaign , the environmental group she founded but friends insist she is not onedimensional they describe her as warm , funny and there when they need her one friend , bunny gabel , recalls repeated visits ms benstock made to her and her new baby in the hospital at the height of the westway wars but it remains a fact that friends feel the need to say ms benstock is more than her cause she has other things she cares about and they are the normal human concerns , said dr harold varmus , now the director of the national institutes of health and a friend of ms benstock s since she was 19 she is a complex human being with tremendous attractiveness from many points of view but her intensity is a roundtheclock proposition , indicated by her habit of sometimes grabbing the phone she has no secretary , and it might be the governor and shouting , do n't bother me ! i'm too busy ! her knowledge is such that public officials call her for information on hudson river issues even late at night she takes the subway rather than cabs , reflecting her small income as much as her frequently expressed commitment to mass transit commitment keeps you going , said ms benstock a radcliffe graduate once known as the soot lady for organizing west siders to fight air pollution in the early 1970 s this grew into the clean air campaign , which now has 600 members ms benstock , who has strands of gray in her jetblack hair and says she is over 50 , comes across as an articulate businesswoman she giggles before she gets to her own punch lines but her view of the world is as dark as midnight powerful businessmen use campaign contributions to push needless , environmentally deadly projects , then trumpet them with sophisticated public relations to ms benstock , governments are rife with secret agendas , slush funds and blind arrogance her contention is that the hudson river park , the latest in a long chain of park proposals , is the subsidiary of a public authority , the empire state development corporation , which can do anything it wants in the way of development despite the fact that the subsidiary has its own board sometimes she accuses her enemies of plotting to pave the river , other times of planning to build pyramids there the point , she insists , is to preserve it as is in that case , delay can equal victory every year that the critical hudson river is left in its natural state is another year for this extraordinary east coast ecosystem , she has said issues shift , but fight continues her persistence provokes some people to use words like saintly to describe her , and others , words like crazy can marcy benstock compromise and work toward a solution \? critics , even friendly ones , suggest that the fighttothedeath approach of 1960 s environmentalism is no longer relevant , particularly since the issues along the waterfront may have basically shifted against big development she counters that the fight is the same , the difference being that her bigbucks enemies have become stealthier the proposed hudson river park is meant to be for the 21st century what central park was for the 19th a place of refuge and a spark to development in adjacent neighborhoods planners envision the refashioning of 13 rotting piers into recreational and cultural meccas that would include ballfields , playgrounds , boating facilities , lawns , fountains and a broad bikeway , all in an area presently dominated by razor ribbon moreover , planners say that private concessions at three points comprising less than 10 percent of the park s 160 surface acres will enable the park to pay for itself at a time when state and city parks agencies are strapped for cash this vision is sufficiently appealing to have struck some longtime benstock allies as reason to consider dropping their opposition to development along the hudson there are many people who will less automatically agree with what she says , said richard n gottfried , an assemblyman representing the west side who regards ms benstock as a genuine civic hero
it s a spring sunday afternoon in a faux lawyer s office on an abc television set , and barbara walters , as usual , is working her charm is bearing down on robert shapiro , o j simpson s former lawyer , who sits opposite her in uneasy anticipation of an interview that will be shown on the abc newsmagazine program 20 20 mr shapiro is promoting his circumspect new book on the simpson trial ms walters needs him to say something more interesting , and new a nice tension fills the air sit up straight , ms walters tells mr shapiro and then , intensely i know you do n't want to trash anybody on the other hand , you do n't want to do an interview that s so bland that nobody cares the taping begins , and she jumps in quickly mr shapiro , in your heart of hearts , as a man , not a lawyer , are you convinced that o j simpson is innocent \? mr shapiro sidesteps only later does he give up some jewels he will never again speak to his longtime friend and fellow dream team defense lawyer f lee bailey , for one before the 90minute taping is over afterward , ms walters s producers swarm in , prodding her to ask more questions you ca n't ask everything in the entire world , she says , exasperated after 35 years in the business , she has been at this far longer than her producers , and she knows that cutting the tape to a 19minute segment will be hard as it is do you have any idea how you 're going to edit this \? she asks a producer mumbles that yes , he does good , she says testily god knows i do n't there is more back and forth mr shapiro is watching , amused as ms walters dismisses most of her producers' suggestions i do n't know whether we really want to retry the whole case , she says briskly finally , she agrees to ask a few more questions i'm going to make my own dream team happy , she tells mr shapiro the producers retreat to the control room george paul , the 20 20 director , who has watched the whole drama unfold , is waiting for them well , that was successful , he says dryly at 64 , barbara walters is the reigning diva of american television news , a superstar who has interviewed the most important news makers of the late 20th century many , in fact , made news in front of her camera many are now less famous than she is but all of them , from presidents to murderers to movie stars , have participated in what has become an event the barbara walters interview \( nobody calls it the 'peter jennings interview , ' says mr jennings , the abc news anchor \) with an idiosyncratic onair style that is toughminded , intimate and fawning , ms walters always manages to extract from her subjects at least a few things they never meant to say people love her or hate her she s been an extraordinary journalist , and an extraordinary force in television , says her boss , roone arledge , the president of abc news but the writer david halberstam , a longtime critic of ms walters , says as this society becomes the celebrity society , she is the progenitor of that it is not who has an effect on our lives in a complex sense it is who is a star' either way , it is difficult to ignore her certainly , no one can deny that barbara walters has had a very good year in the last seven months alone , she has brought in a string of big kahunas colin powell , hillary rodham clinton , the o j simpson prosecutor christopher darden and christopher reeve , the actor paralyzed in a riding accident now she is talking to the white house about an interview with president and mrs clinton together this year is also ms walters s 20th anniversary at abc , the network that nearly destroyed and then helped rebuild her career with an eye to ms walters s phenomenal viewership , 20 million people on average , abc news will broadcast on may 1 early in an important ratings sweeps period a show celebrating ms walters s two decades at the network as the show tells it , barbara history began on oct 4 , 1976 , her first night on the air as a 1 million coanchor with the cranky harry reasoner no one had ever made so much money in network news , and certainly no woman and no one could watch her and think of anything else during a live interview that first night , president anwar elsadat of egypt blurted out to ms walters how do you like a milliondollars job \? you know the salary of my job , it is 12 , 000 only and i am working day and night , barbara twenty years later the cameras are at the white house , where ms walters is talking to mrs clinton , this time in an interview many critics will dismiss as too soft i think i could have been tougher on her , ms walters says now the special is irresistible in that it highlights not only ms walters s wellknown coups her groundbreaking 1977 interview with both president sadat and prime minister menachem begin of israel , for example but also her most famous moments of ridiculousness viewers will see her ask katharine hepburn what kind of tree she would be \( a followup to a remark by ms hepburn that she felt like a tree , ms walters points out \) and also tell presidentelect jimmy carter to be wise with us and be good to us at the close of a 1976 interview \( why could n't i leave well enough alone \? she asks in the special s voiceover \)
cleveland , march 23 he slept right through it , that terrible night more than 40 years ago when his mother , marilyn sheppard , was bludgeoned to death in her bedroom sam reese sheppard was only 7 years old when his uncle woke him the next morning and hustled him downstairs , past the policeman standing outside the bloodspattered room where his mother lay dead it was july 4 , 1954 , and his father , dr sam sheppard , was in the cuyahoga county jail in cleveland , about to become the defendant in a murder case that transfixed the nation although dr sheppard said he had been overpowered by a bushyhaired intruder that night , he was convicted of seconddegree murder and sent to prison for life twelve years later the supreme court declared the trial had been a carnival in which reporters and television cameras trampled on his rights , and ordered a retrial at which , , with a young lawyer named f lee bailey at his side , dr sheppard was acquitted over the decades , the sheppard drama never went away , inspiring the television series and movie the fugitive but nobody was ever brought to justice for the murder and many in cleveland still think dr sheppard did it now , sam reese sheppard , 48 years old , believes that with the latest forensic methods , newly revealed evidence and a fresh suspect , he can finally solve the mystery and the cuyahoga county prosecutor s office , which had fought for dr sheppard s conviction , now thinks his son may be right but may never be able to prove it under a court order obtained by mr sheppard , the prosecutor s office earlier this month took a blood sample from richard eberling , the sheppard s window washer , who is in prison for the 1989 murder of an elderly woman tuesday , also under the court order , the county coroner s office is to give the prosecutor and an attorney for sam reese sheppard an inventory of evidence it holds on mrs sheppard s killing among the items sam reese sheppard hopes the coroner s office still has are scrapings from under his mother s fingernails , hairs from the murder scene , a piece of a rocking chair from her bedroom , and several wood chips with blood on them , taken from stairs in the house none of the blood was tested at the time , so it is not known whether it was mrs sheppard s or her killer s together with a spot of blood from a wood chip that dr sheppard managed to retrieve from the coroner s office before his own death in 1970 , sam reese sheppard hopes these slivers of evidence can provide enough material to conduct dna tests that will prove mr eberling was the real killer carmen marino , the first assistant county prosecutor , said , i do n't think sam sheppard killed his wife there should have been more of an investigation at the time but now , so many years later , with many of the principals in the case dead and the files of both the cleveland police and the county prosecutor missing , it may be impossible to finally settle the mystery it seems farfetched to me now that sam did it , mr marino said but i do n't know that there will be enough evidence to declare him innocent or convict anyone else the outcome of the new investigation is critical to sam reese sheppard , an unemployed dental hygienist from oakland , calif the murder destroyed my family , he said in a telephone interview not only was his mother beaten to death with 35 blows , but his father drank heavily after being freed and died of liver disease , and two of his grandparents , distraught over the slaying , shot themselves to death out of fear of publicity , sam reese sheppard lived for years like the fugitive , not revealing his past but since 1989 , mr sheppard , has worked with a writer , cynthia l cooper with whom he has published mockery of justice the true story of the sheppard murder case \( northeastern university press , 1995 \) and private investigators to reverse the verdict of fate under an ohio law , he is suing the state for wrongfully imprisoning his father for 10 years to win , mr sheppard must first get a local judge to declare his father innocent and then he can seek damages in state court under the law , mr sheppard could win 25 , 000 plus interest for each of the 10 years his father was incarcerated and he might be able to claim the financial losses his father suffered from losing his practice as a prominent osteopathic surgeon the total could run to more than 1 million but mr marino is skeptical that mr sheppard will prevail first there is the issue of whether sam reese sheppard has legal standing to sue the ohio law on wrongful imprisonment was designed simply as conscience money to be paid to the victim , mr marino said , not to his descendants then there is also the question of how long the statute of limitations lasts terry gilbert , mr sheppard s lawyer in cleveland , acknowledges that the effort to win any actual monetary settlement may be protracted because the legal issues are unusual but , mr gilbert said , we are thankful we have gotten this far , with even the prosecutor now believing dr sheppard is innocent
washington , june 3 the los angeles federal reserve bank branch appears to have had trouble counting its money , and a report published today said that cash reports sent to washington had been doctored to conceal discrepancies totaling tens of millions of dollars the alteration of the documents , disclosed in the wall street journal today , was confirmed , the journal said , by an executive of the san francisco fed bank , which oversees the los angeles branch the executive said the discrepancies were being investigated internal documents showed that in the 1995 fourth quarter , employees were forcing balances that did not add up , so that the reports sent to the fed board would appear correct current and former employees say the practice has been going on for at least a year in the cashhandling operation and that far larger discrepancies may have occurred over time the los angeles branch runs one of the largest federal cash vaults , putting money into circulation and destroying old currency but none of the people familiar with the situation said there was evidence that cash was missing the apparent management lapses in one of the fed s most basic and important functions may prove an embarrassment for the central bank at a time when it is already under fire from the general accounting office for its spending and management practices , particularly at some of the fed s 12 district fed banks although there was no evidence that other branches had problems akin to the los angeles branch s , the incident may renew questions about fed bank management as its chairman , alan greenspan , awaits senate confirmation for a third term on friday , representative henry b gonzalez , a texas democrat and longtime fed critic , asked the government accounting office , an investigative arm of congress , for an emergency audit of the los angeles cash unit he asserted that senior managers in los angeles had known of deliberate falsifications of the cash reports the chief operating officer of the san francisco fed , john f moore , confirmed that there were some reports that contained inaccuracies that were identified by management in january there were months when the report had to be completed before deadline when they sent it up without substantiating certain numbers , mr moore said the fed board uses cash reports from district banks to track the level of currency in circulation , to order new cash from the united states mint and to monitor how much has been destroyed and for other statistical purposes according to an internal compliance report prepared in january by the staff at the los angeles branch , discrepancies varied sharply from month to month in november 1995 , for example , the report sent to the fed board claimed 618 million more than it should have in december , the figure was too low by 1111 million
dancing sways the soul before the brain can get a word in it is the perfect language of seduction choreographers have always known this , but film directors are increasingly discovering dancing social dancing as a sure way to steer couples into the bedroom stirring and exposing feelings so quickly , dancing preempts the brain s job of weighing the evidence and making judgments if they had second thoughts , the guntoting police detective and the amish woman in witness would never dare to fall in love nor would the married woman and the roving photographer in the bridges of madison county but dancing precludes second thoughts for these couples , as it does for the abouttobedivorced twosome in something to talk about in these and several other recent films , including the new white squall , dancing is not choreographed by the likes of an astaire rather , it is arranged by the director as a means to an end with the exception of something to talk about , none of the recent films make dancing paramount camera work can transmit a romantic message as forcefully as the dancers' steps , and the steps themselves are rudimentary you and i could do them , with perhaps just a lesson or two at arthur murray under our belts in the american president , the widowed president and the lobbyist he might woo clinch their love pact while waltzing around the white house dining room during a state dinner , but the camera whirls even faster than they do it s the camera s dancing that creates the heady feeling of romance , and it s the camera s close scrutiny of the couple s faces that creates the slightly dangerous sensation of romance unfolding in a fishbowl in the 1985 film witness , starring harrison ford and kelly mcgillis , the detective guides his damsel in a stopandstart lindy in a barn , while a golden oldie plays on the radio the jumpiness of the camera expresses their sexual tension more than the conventional closeups of the actors' tremulous faces the dancing couple in the bridges of madison county simply sway , while in waiting to exhale the bodies of the woman looking for love and of the man who wo n't give it are absolutely static except for their hands in this nondance dance scene in a cocktail lounge , all we see are her hands slipping around his neck and his hands pressing into her lower back although it s hard to find a justification for this extreme camera angle , the scene does define what dancing is in the movies it is people touching with music and without speech speechlessness is , of course , normal in concert dance , but in the movies it is out of the ordinary and thus a powerful ally of seduction in the bridges of madison county , robert kincaid and francesca \( clint eastwood and meryl streep \) at first exchange intimacies by exchanging stories about their past robert protests the effort to reveal himself with words they do much better at the intimacy game by swaying together in a tight hug alongside the kitchen table while johnny hartman croons on the radio there is no talk there are just their heads buried in each other s neck and the camera hugging them as they hug each other out of these images comes the summation of the movie s theme about a love so hermetic that it can survive death when this love is unearthed by francesca s children , it is like a perfectly preserved archeological artifact that transforms their lives the dance scene in something to talk about , a movie released last fall , is as raucous as the one in bridges is hushed eddie \( dennis quaid \) , the twotiming antihero , wants to reconcile with his wife , grace \( julia roberts \) he s about to go into a long explanation about how the lunch with his divorce lawyer was all a mistake , then he chucks the narration come on , baby , let s dance , he bellows at grace and , dragging her by the arm onto the clubhouse dance floor , seduces her into a reconciliation by dancing her down memory lane at first , grace resists twirling under his arm and is embarrassed by his loose , goofy moves but she ca n't resist the power of muscle memory she twirls then he leads her farther back in time , to the happy days when they practiced dance routines in the den onetwothreekick , right knee up , left knee up whether she likes it or not , here is grace moving in instinctive harmony with the man she loathes now the dance moves into freer territory taking off his jacket and warmed by champagne , eddie spins her and throws her and dips her to the ground they dance solo , roaming into freeform , noman sland soliloquies and couple up again by now , grace does n't know what has hit her , and she does n't much care she just rolls with the punches and , supported by intuition and practice , stays in step by dancing , grace discovers that she and eddie are still very much married seduction is the most natural use of dancing , but in several films dancing serves different ends in white squall and in the 1992 film scent of a woman , for example , the directors use it to show the audience a new aspect of the protagonists' character

louisville , ohio , july 19 for two decades , the federal government s section 8 housing subsidy program has helped poor working people like wanda schott get off welfare after spending two years on a waiting list , ms schott , a divorced mother of two boys , became eligible for one of those precious section 8 vouchers and , in 1994 , used it to rent a trailer in this suburb of canton not long after , she got off welfare , taking a 25houraweek job in the bakery at the iga supermarket in the buckeye village shopping center a few afternoons a week she works a second job , for a lawn care service then , in april , the county housing authority determined that the trailer no longer met federal housing standards ms schott had 90 days to find another apartment that would accept her section 8 voucher she was not able to , though she searched frantically , visiting 20 apartments a month i looked everywhere , ms schott said i can prove it with my tiredness recent federal budget cuts have lowered the payments to landlords , causing apartment owners here and across the country to withdraw from section 8 , threatening the nation s biggest housing program for the poor for now , she has moved her two boys in with her mother , but there is no room for her so ms schott sleeps in her '72 ford truck , which she keeps parked in her mother s driveway , filled with pillows and cushions and a windup alarm clock to wake her for work at night i climb in and throw the cushions over me , she said , i put up this here curtain so i have privacy even in a time of relative prosperity and in a community like stark county with a strong tradition of volunteerism , a place where the republican mayor of canton , richard watkins , has opened a free medical clinic for people without health insurance , there is evidence that the government s safety net for the poor is unraveling the county s 300 homelessshelter beds are full year round federal transportation cuts have meant that the public bus system , which serves mainly the elderly , the working poor and the handicapped , has had to reduce service on most routes to once an hour , shut down after 6 30 pm and may close altogether next year recent federal cuts for the legal services corporation , the primary program providing legal aid for the poor in civil matters , have reduced the local office from eight lawyers to five next month the poor will no longer be able to get a legal aid lawyer to represent them on certain child custody matters because of cuts in federal emergency management agency money for the homeless , a canton soup kitchen at the jr coleman outreach center had to close this month none of these developments has become a political issue in this place that mirrors national politics not even among democratic politicians it s not a question that is being talked about , said carol duncan , an advocate for the homeless it just does n't appear when president clinton speaks like a republican , calling for a twoyear limit on welfare , he is playing to conservative communities like stark county , where the sentiment against taxes and welfare is strong , even among democrats in the 1980 s , many democrats here deserted their party s presidential candidates for being too liberal , returning in 1992 to help mr clinton carry stark at a time when the national political agenda has been set by the republicans , conservative talk is not going to cost mr clinton many votes here liberals like ms duncan have no one else to turn to he does the best he can with the republican congress totally opposed to what he wants to do , she said in the case of the federal department of housing and urban development which many conservative republicans would like to abolish outright doing the best he can has meant watching the agency s annual budget shrink from 252 billion to 195 billion during his administration \( for 1996 mr clinton requested 21 billion the republican congress appropriated 195 billion \) several cuts last fall have had a particularly harsh impact on section 8 , a program , begun in the nixon administration , that provides housing assistance for 36 million poor americans across the country landlords are being driven away , says julio barreto , director of legislative affairs for the national association of housing and redevelopment officials we 'll be left with landlords who do n't have the housing you want people to have the section 8 program provides a certificate or voucher , which the renter can present to any landlord who is willing to take part tenants pay 30 percent of their monthly income toward the rent and the federal government makes up the rest in return , the landlord agrees to follow section 8 rent guidelines in canton that means charging no more than 359 a month \( plus utility costs \) for a twobedroom apartment in time , as a tenant like ms schott , 30 , earns more money , she pays a larger share of the rent and the federal subsidy decreases tenants appreciate being able to use the voucher anywhere , blending anonymously into a neighborhood rather than living together in a public housing project there are 150 , 000 on the

of all the great themes for a writer to explore , there can be none so noble as the true meaning of christmas imagine to be part of a literary tradition that goes straight back to the bible to take as one s inspiration the questions that lie at the very core of our existence and , more to the point , to make a whole lot of of money if you can hit the nail on the head , if you can capture people s hearts with just the right twist , just the right amount of pathos , just the right moral then , my friend , you will be on the receiving end of a reallife christmas miracle last year s winner was a man named richard paul evans , who wrote a little christmas fable entitled the christmas box it sold a zillion copies and was a wild success , so much so that it has triggered an onslaught of christmas box wannabes , novellas with the print very widely spaced and the covers very prettily embossed looking at them , a cynic may register nothing more than cute , useless gift in the 10 15 range but not me i see a writing challenge in fact , i 've started work on my own book i call it a turkey for christmas the christmas fable is a form that anyone can try , and this year it seems that anyone did one woman admits to writing hers to make a mortgage payment there are books by famous authors , books by firsttimers and books by many people who use three names it is a field , i must warn you , with a special attraction to those in the advertising business it also draws partnerships , which to me is always a tipoff that there s something rather calculated going on i mean , how many people does it take to put together a 100page novel \? but if you have any writing talent whatsoever there s no reason you should n't jump in you will not be out of your league , believe me a certain innocence , a certain naivete helps this is truly a field where the principle of beginner s luck is operative i find it curious that even after reading all these books , i have no idea which one , if any , will catch on to me , the strangest thing about the christmas box is that it is no better and no worse than the competition in case you decide to write your own christmas fable , i 've compiled some guidelines , which \( in the christmas spirit \) i 'll generously pass along follow them carefully and i guarantee that you 'll come up with , if not a christmas box , at least a viable manuscript 1 pick a meaning any meaning it does n't have to be original it does n't even have to be accurate in the christmas box , the true meaning of christmas turns out to be a parent s love this was a new one on me other interesting meanings coming to terms with your grief , showing kindness to strangers and winning the pga senior open \( more on that later \) 2 make sure you include a dying child if there s a major flaw in this year s crop of books , it s that it does n't have enough dying children i do n't mean dead children there are plenty of those but hardly any dying ones what s wrong with these people \? have n't they read their dickens \? it s tiny tim s medical condition that propels a christmas carol , not that stupid stuff about the ghosts give them updates ! give them bulletins ! the best dying child book this year is probably the angel doll a christmas story \( down home press , box 4126 , asheboro , nc 27204 , 1495 \) , by jerry bledsoe it concerns a pathetic 4yearold named sandy , a victim of both poverty and the great polio epidemic , who is utterly devoted to her older brother , whitey i found the dying a little too offstage for my tastes and i'm sorry , i thought the angel doll , the actual doll as illustrated in the book , was ugly still , if you insist on a dying child this season , the angel doll may be for you 3 make them cry at least once , preferably three times but stop there who wants to cry all the way through a book \? it s too upsetting , and if you 're in an airport it can quickly become a nuisance this is what happened to me with papa s angels \( new world library , 17 \) during a long layover in charlotte , nc the book s authors , collin wilcox paxton and gary carden , really stack the deck there s a dead mother and all sorts of brothers and sisters , one of whom stutters and one of whom is mute there are bullies in the neighborhood and the father drinks and it s set in appalachia all i can say is , do n't read this book in public 4 any premise is possible , at least in theory this brings us to one of the odder of the season s entries , miracle on the 17th green \( little , brown , 1695 \) , by james patterson and peter de jonge it s about an advertising executive who s getting fired , whose marriage is collapsing , whose children are alienated while playing golf on christmas morning , he has a zenlike moment , when he can see the line and finally learns how to putt in fact , his entire game improves to the point where he s on the pga senior tour , hanging out with lee trevino and winning enough money to buy his wife a 135 , 000 diamond ring from harry winston whoops , i was n't supposed to tell you that oh , well just remember that this book has much more to do with the mindset of a middleaged golfer , his hopes , his fears , his moral dilemmas , than it does with the true meaning of christmas , and that if you are n't a middleaged golfer wallowing in these kinds of concerns , you may find yourself fighting a tendency to snicker
scientists have found stunning new data showing that a third human species apparently coexisted on earth with two others as recently as 30 , 000 years ago in research that could redraw the human family tree and is certain to be controversial , the scientists reexamined two major fossil sites along the solo river in java and found that an early human relative , homo erectus , appeared to have lived there until about 27 , 000 to 53 , 000 years ago writing in today s issue of the journal science , the scientists said the new dates were surprisingly young and , if proven correct , imply that h erectus persisted much longer in southeast asia than elsewhere in the world confirmation of the new dates would mean that at least in java , this archaic species , which evolved 18 million years ago , survived some 250 , 000 years after it was thought to have become extinct this surviving population of h erectus in indonesia would have been alive at the same time as anatomically modern humans homo sapiens and also neanderthals , whose exact place in human evolution is a subject of endless debate the neanderthals , who lived in europe and western asia for some 300 , 000 years , appear to have made their last stand 30 , 000 years ago in southern spain by then , modern h sapiens , who are widely thought to have evolved in africa 200 , 000 to 100 , 000 years ago , had spread all over africa and eurasia , as far as australia it is not known how much contact the three species had , or if they could interbreed in any case , specialists in human evolution noted , the new findings suggest that the present phenomenon of a solitary human species on earth may be more the exception than the rule until about a couple of decades ago , scientists conceived of the human lineage as a neat progression of one species to the next and generally thought it impossible that two species could have overlapped in place or time another implication of the more recent date for h erectus is to undercut a pillar of the multiregional theory for the origin of modern h sapiens as the most advanced known representatives of h erectus , the java fossils have appeared to be a clear intermediate step in the evolution of h erectus in southeast asia to the first australians , who were modern h sapiens this has lent support to the idea that modern humans emerged gradually out of h erectus in many parts of the world the alternative and more favored outofafrica theory holds that modern humans evolved in africa less than 200 , 000 years ago and displaced h erectus as they migrated to the ends of the earth the team of scientists , led by dr carl c swisher 3d of the berkeley geochronology center in california , concluded that it was no longer chronologically plausible to argue that the java h erectus evolved into asian h sapiens from earlier fossil evidence , australian h sapiens are at least 30 , 000 years old , and could be much older , judging by rock art the multiregionalists will have to do some fast talking to explain this , said dr philip rightmire , a paleoanthropologist at the state university of new york at binghamton it s quite a blow for them to absorb but neither side has won the day yet in this theoretical battle dr milford wolpoff , a paleoanthropologist at the university of michigan who is an outspoken leader of the multiregional theorists , questioned both the accuracy of the dates and the identification of the skulls at the java sites , contending that they were h sapiens and not h erectus dr wolpoff said these questions should have been answered more convincingly before the team published its report as one who has studied the skulls at ngandong , one of the two sites , and compared them with early australian h sapiens , dr wolpoff said the idea of an ancestral link between them is incontrovertible in an accompanying article in science , dr alan thorne of the australian national university in canberra , one of dr wolpoff s allies , said , there is a great long list of characters that are the same in the solo skulls and the earliest known human people from australia even if the java fossils are indeed relatively young , dr thorne added , they look so much like the australian fossils that the two species may have shared a recent ancestor both dr rightmire , an authority on h erectus , and dr susan c anton , a paleoanthropologist at the university of florida who was a member of dr swisher s team , said they were satisfied that the java specimens were h erectus , though the skulls did show signs of their having evolved a somewhat larger brain than earlier members of the species that h erectus and h sapiens now appear to have overlapped , dr anton said , raises the possibility of gene flow between the two lines the java fossils were discovered in the 1930 s by dutch geologists over the years , various efforts to date the specimens have yielded ages of as high as 300 , 000 and 250 , 000 years and , recently , as low as 100 , 000 years the most reliable means of dating such ancient material is to determine the age of volcanic ash in the sediments , but none is associated with the solo specimens similarly , a number of other techniques were not suitable , and the skulls themselves could not be dated because they would have been damaged dr swisher explained in an interview that he had dug a test trench at the ngandong site , on a terrace at the bend in the solo river he noted that the layer of sediment where the skulls had been found also contained teeth of water buffalo the teeth were analyzed through two techniques for measuring the radioactive decay of uranium that the teeth had absorbed from the soil this indicated how long the teeth had been buried to assure themselves that they were sampling the same sediment layer where the h erectus skulls had been excavated , the scientists said , they compared and dated similar water buffalo teeth collected by the dutch geologists at the time of the original discoveries the specimens are kept at gadjah mada university in yogyakarta , indonesia the dating analysis was conducted at mcmaster university in hamilton , ontario some scientists said they were still concerned that erosion and river currents could have mixed up older h erectus skulls with younger water buffalo teeth , but dr swisher said this was unlikely to have occurred in the same way for 12 different skulls at two widely separated sites if the dates are right , as dr swisher s team noted at the conclusion of its report , the temporal and spatial overlap between h erectus and h sapiens in southeast asia is reminiscent of the overlap of neanderthals \( h neanderthalensis \) and anatomically modern humans in europe photo dr susan c anton , coauthor of the new research , and

as thoughts of tourism intensify with the season , elaine summers is front and center ms summers was named last summer the executive director of the connecticut lodgings and attractions association \( formerly the hotel and motel association \) , with almost 300 members from lobbying the legislature to reduce the special 12 percent sales tax on hotel rooms to promoting the industry to the general public , she is the advocate for the state s hospitality business a new jersey native , ms summers graduated from the university of hartford and earned a degree from western new england law school as a lawyer she handled personal injury , product liability and negligence cases before becoming general counsel for the hartford police department ms summers discussed the association and some of its objectives during a recent interview at her office in the farmington marriott hotel following are some excerpts from that conversation q how large is the tourism industry in connecticut \? a it s over 4 billion a year , and for the last four years we 've been growing faster than the rate of inflation , about 2 percentage points a year people tend to think our tourism is all in the summer , and it s families going along the coast but that s really not true a little bit over 50 percent of our guests are actually business travelers q how much growth are you predicting for tourism \? a nationwide , there s more than 40 percent growth predicted for the industry by the year 2005 it s definitely the fastestgrowing industry in the united states tourism is the no 2 industry in connecticut , second only to manufacturing q do you want to see it ahead of manufacturing \? a i think it can get there it depends on having cooperation between private and public entities there s still a strong antitourism sentiment throughout connecticut , and new england but i think that any economy that is stable and sound has got to have a base of manufacturing so i think we need to accentuate the benefits of having a very large core of industry q is n't it easy to see your members as a nuisance because of the traffic they generate \? a people are forgetting about the tremendous ripple effect we 're not just talking about wages , although that is very important because we have more than 40 , 000 people employed in the state , but we 're talking about the things our members buy at the local stores , and over 140 million a year that we pay in local taxes there are all kinds of businesses that depend on our members the companies that print hotel and attraction brochures , snow plowing companies , laundry services , housekeeping supplies , plumbers , electricians there are more dollars spent by tourists in stores and in restaurants than in hotels , motels and bed and breakfasts that s why a local city or town can be so impacted when one of our properties closes i do n't think even a lot of our elected officials understand the positive impact of tourism q when it comes to jobs , though , does n't tourism typically generate lowpay positions \? a the tourism industry , and i include restaurants in that category , is able to provide jobs and training to people who are trying to enter the marketplace with no prior experience , and no particular skills we have young people who are getting their first jobs , who develop a work ethic and skills that they can put in a resume , and we give them references that they can cite when they transfer to another industry but we also have jobs in accounting , and computers , security , engineering , carpentry , electrical , plumbing , clerical and administrative we run the entire gamut q do you see any disadvantages to promoting tourism \? a no none at all it s a clean industry it creates employment opportunities we add to the tax base in fact , it allows us to bring in dollars from out of state q but do n't you need a yearround hospitable climate to build tourism \? a that depends what you mean by hospitable if you use the word hospitable in terms of friendly , that we have but i think what draws a lot of people to connecticut really is the change in the seasons , and that s something that orlando and palm beach will never have our peak season , actually , is in the fall q what kind of things can you do to promote tourism more \? a marketing connecticut outside of the state i sit on a committee that works with the departments of economic development from the southern new england states and tries to market them to europe in an attempt to bring international dollars to new england we also need to look at how to market connecticut within the state i would venture a guess that a majority of people living in connecticut have not even been to a third of our attractions people who are disturbed that groups they are involved in are going out of state for conferences some of them are even funded , at least in part , by the state q why did the association decide to change its name \? a because they decided to expand the membership we came to realize is that connecticut was not being viewed as a destination , it was being viewed as a passthrough state so the board of directors decided to provide a reason for people to stay longer even if people are here on a business trip , if we can show them what else we have here they might either extend their business trip , or come back sometime with their family

moscow , dec 25 it is 4 pm at the hotel tourist , and the fuse boxes in block 5 are going haywire more than 300 residents , refugees from the 1988 ethnic violence in azerbaijan , have fired up their kettles and soup pots all at once , taking advantage of their daily ration of electricity in the municipal hotel where they have been unwanted residents for up to seven years because they have not been registered by the city s migration service yet this year , most are afraid to leave the hotel for fear that they will be picked up by the police and harassed , fined or worse we are under house arrest , said raisa allakhverdova , who escaped with her family from baku , azerbaijan s capital , in 1989 in a wave of 60 , 000 ethnic armenians who fled the fighting we 've appealed to everyone we can think of , and no one can help i do n't know what else to do the refugees came to moscow as soviet citizens a few years later , as the soviet union fell apart , they were suddenly foreigners , one struggling group among the estimated nine million displaced people the refugees include millions of ethnic russians who had been stranded on newly foreign turf about 35 million of the 9 million escaped civil war and persecution many who have no friends or relatives to house them end up in train stations or on the street the lucky ones receive temporary housing from the government anywhere from trailer parks to cheap hotels like the tourist in many ways the armenians in this hotel are lucky they are housed , and most are working , hawking goods at local markets but their problems are typical of those faced by the refugees in russia they are guaranteed either forced migrant or refugee status by the russian constitution , but they find themselves subject to a welter of local laws that often leave them with no official status at all the hotel administration says crippling bills have made it necessary to regulate electricity and water indeed , the bills for the sovietera complex are high , and the paltry fee the hotel gets from the city as compensation is not much help but no one is fooled by the hotel s often dangerous tactics fire exits are permanently locked , and the refugees say ambulances have been denied access to the grounds the refugees are being pushed out , and the city officials are watching it happen the activities of the moscow government contradict the constitution , said a federal migration service spokesman , yevgeny chernetsov but what can we do \? the armenians are not our problem moscow immigration officials do not deny that their methods are sometimes less than legal i think it s perfectly understandable , said vera milai , deputy director of the moscow migration service we must provide safety for the capital we cannot take in big numbers of migrants , because they cannot be kept under control adriano silvestri , legal officer for the united nations high commissioner for refugees in moscow , said in some cities you ca n't get permanent residence registration unless you have refugee status but you ca n't get refugee status without residence registration it s a huge problem many of russia s biggest cities still operate with the outmoded and contradictory soviet pass system none are worse than moscow , which has been criticized by human rights groups for requiring residents to carry documents proving that they can work , that they send their children to school and that they are entitled to social services the police in moscow often use document checks as an excuse to harass ethnic caucasians , who are blamed for much of the city s crime if you 're darkhaired , you 're in trouble , mr chernetsov said if you 're blond , you 're exempt though many are working not quite legally and not paying taxes , caucasian refugees do n't make criminal problems , he said that s nonsense yelena lukianova , deputy director of the tourist , describes her wards as rich , boorish ingrates who are destroying the hotel these people have used up their refugee status , said mrs lukianova it s like when you spoil a child you ca n't then turn around and simply call it spoiled the child has become insolent they have lived so long for free that they no longer understand the value of money mrs lukianova also complained that the armenians had refused housing offers in other cities , waiting for openings in either moscow , st petersburg , or america refugees who were interviewed conceded that they had turned down alternative housing , saying the remote towns offered to them are places where people had not been paid for months and where they feared racism
sapna , bosnia and herzegovina , jan 18 there were strange sounds in this small mountain village today the sounds of life hata smajlovic shoveled through a foothigh pile of rubble in what had been her kitchen before a shell tore through the house she has not seen in four years out front , hired hands slashed at 10foot weeds , making a respectablelooking hedge again across the street , on a day when the sun took the sting out of freezing temperatures , children laughed and shouted as they kicked a soccer ball on the hardtop playground in front of their bombedout school i could n't before because of the shells , said safet omervic , 12 , who was wearing a mickey mouse club sweatshirt he and his friends pointed up to a rocky ridgeline not 200 yards away from which the serbs had pummeled this muslim village the shooting stopped months ago the resurrection had to wait rahmo kahrimanovic , a construction engineer , said , a week ago people could not even think about this he was patching up bullet holes , putting glass in windows and painting the charred interior of the temporary municipal headquarters indeed , visitors here a week ago encountered only a spooky silence what changed \? ifor is here , said meho sinanovic , referring to the nato peacekeeping force mr sinanovic returned home two days ago after four miserable years in a crude shelter in the woods it is the greatest joy in my life , his wife said as she gathered kindling in their front yard , where a small black and brown puppy they had picked up on the way home frolicked with the chickens the people of this frontline village were driven out by fighting , but to come home they did not have to cross the lines friday marks the first month for nato forces in bosnia a week ago they ran their first armored patrol down the single street through the village under the dayton , ohio , accord , by midnight on friday all sides must withdraw 2 kilometers \( 12 miles \) from their former positions and provide nato with maps of all minefields we expect 100 percent compliance , said maj tim dunne , a nato spokesman in tuzla whatever superlatives nato commanders might use to describe their mission so far a screaming success has already been used their words cannot match the reality of the burst of life in sapna but it also contains the ingredients of what is ahead for the civilians villages will have to be rebuilt , so people have homes to return to and the men who led the war will have to be prosecuted by the international war crimes tribunal whoever committed crimes , no matter on which side , has to be punished , mr kahrimanovic said it is important so ordinary people believe there is justice in the world otherwise , he said , the hot heads will rekindle the war the conventional analysis is that this has been the easy time for nato in the last four years the fighting has subsided in winter , and once spring comes , wellrested combatants renew the carnage this time that analysis may be wrong however good the armies are at killing civilians , they are unlikely to be suicidal enough to take on nato s 70ton tanks , attack helicopters and stinger missiles it is hard to convey the depth of the warweariness in bosnia not just from the residents of besieged sarajevo , or the families that have been torn apart , but also from hardened soldiers we 've had enough , all of us , said mr sinanovic , 46 , who fought with the bosnian army until he was wounded if we have another two or three years of war , everybody will be killed since the dayton accord was signed , sentences like four years is enough , we must have peace and i just want to go home , have been heard over and over again from soldiers on all sides international civilian agencies have a year to make the peace last off to a slow start , however , they have failed so far to begin any major reconstruction programs and are talking about delaying elections the estimates for repairing bosnia range from 5 billion to 6 billion it sounds like a staggering amount , but driving around this country leaves the feeling that it is too low how much will it cost to repair sapna \?

maurice milton feldman , one of the cadre of highly educated depressionera recruits who ran new york city s municipal services with rare professional distinction for decades , died on saturday at roosevelt hospital he was 81 and had been an acting sanitation commissioner and a commissioner of water resources his daughter , naomi collins , said the cause was complications from an inflamed ulcer they called them the depression virtuosos , and the name was as well chosen as the range of their talents in one of those perverse proofs of the law of supply and demand , the depression , so ruinous for the national economy , was a personnel bonanza for new york city government it was a grim index of the imbalance between the supply of labor and the demand for workers at the time that when the city advertised some openings for 840ayear clerks in 1935 , 14 , 000 applicants showed up to take the civil service exam and of the 3 , 000 who received qualifying grades , 2 , 000 were college graduates one was a city college chemistry junior who had been blithely working his way through school by playing the bass violin when he concluded that his dream of using a college degree to rise above his lower east side tenement beginnings was a chimera the unemployment rate for chemists with bachelor s degrees , mr feldman recalled years later , was about 95 percent mr feldman , who spent most of his career with the sanitation department , rose steadily and rapidly through the ranks , thanks in part to his testtaking abilities he calculated that he took 20 promotion tests between 1946 and 1950 by then , the senior ranks of city agencies were thick with depressionera recruits at the very time mayor john v lindsay was upgrading the corps of city managers by hiring respected industry executives and retired military officers , the homehoned mr feldman was holding down three highlevel jobs deputy sanitation commissioner in charge of engineering , deputy general manager in charge of water pollution control for the department of public works and , for a heady six months in 1968 , acting sanitation commissioner mayor lindsay , who gave mr feldman the temporary additional assignment in december 1967 , after the retired navy man he had picked for the job fell ill , was so impressed with his quiet , unassuming efficiency , especially in the aftermath of a 19day sanitation strike , that he tried to persuade him to accept the post permanently mr feldman would have none of it i'm an engineer , he said they might as well make me ambassador to china mr lindsay relented in june , he named mr feldman commissioner of the newly organized department of water resources , a precursor of the department of environmental protection mr feldman held the post until his retirement in 1971 besides his daughter , who lives in bethesda , md , mr feldman is survived by a son , eugene , of granby , conn a sister , mae reisman of lakehurst , nj , and four grandsons
when john t dorrance 3d , grandson of the founder of campbell soup , sold 720 million of the company s stock in october , it was the seventhbiggest trade ever on the new york stock exchange but it was hardly typical of these giant deals in fact , of the top 10 trades in dollars in big board history , mr dorrance s sale of 4 percent of campbell stock is the only one involving the heir of a company dynasty two of the other nine are related to failed takeover bids , one is an oil company s sale of another oil stock , and the remaining six are moves by big institutions to capture the dividends of highyield stocks both of the raiderrelated trades were the work of carl c icahn , who had taken on the managements of usxmarathon oil and texaco in long , costly battles for control in june 1989 , in the no 1 trade , mr icahn sold his entire texaco stake to salomon brothers , shearson lehman hutton and goldman , sachs the sale , more than double the next largest , involved 423 million shares and , at 49 apiece , was worth more than 2 billion but the record selloff was a sad affair for mr icahn it ended his twoyear pursuit of control of the company market analysts expected him to use the texaco cash for a run on another target , and that is exactly what he did , going after usxmarathon oil but he lost again , and in may 1991 , in the exchange s fourthbiggest deal , he sold off his 133 percent interest in usxmarathon for 848 million mr icahn is the only corporate raider to have made the top 10 at all let alone twice but other raiders have done almostasbig deals or at least spurred them the no 19 deal , for instance , was a defensive maneuver against t boone pickens , who was locked in a battle for control of newmont mining the september 1987 purchase of five million newmont shares by first boston which represented consolidated gold fields , a newmont ally was a 495 million attempt to keep them from mr pickens such power plays which mostly took place in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s are over those kinds of trades were somewhat unique to the era , said richard rosenblatt , a veteran floor broker there are still plenty of mergers , but we do n't have the almostviolent competition anymore with it went the excitement , too , because traders had to work fast and quietly to prevent disruption in these raiderrelated deals orders were so much fun , said another floor trader , who spoke on condition of anonymity it does n't happen that way now compared with deals by swashbuckling raiders , the largest number of top10 trades are mundane regulationdriven ploys to capture dividends the sellers in these trades nos 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 10 were multiple parties assembled by brokerage firms the buyers were large japanese insurers or american corporations or other institutions their motives in japan , insurers had to pay certain policyholders yields that came from dividends , not capital gains and in the united states , corporations could deduct 85 percent of dividends from taxable income in these deals , the institution would buy a stock on the day its shareholders were entitled to dividends , and then quickly resell it the stocks involved were high yielders , including those of utilities like southern california edison although the dividend capture tactic was common in january 1988 it accounted for 101 percent of all activity on the new york stock exchange it was criticized politicians called the deals the antithesis of the kind of investments that companies should be attracting , and some japanese companies were accused of using margin trading and other tactics to buy and sell more shares than were physically available that pressure and other forces eventually curtailed the strategy japan changed its law to allow insurers to pass on to investors more returns in capital gains moreover , a stronger dollar made the insurers' returns from treasuries enough to satisfy their dividend need without highyield capture ploys in the united states , institutions were discouraged by the adverse publicity and saw the portion of dividends they could shield from taxable income gradually decline , to 70 percent today the seller in the remaining deal in the big board s top 10 no 6 was pennzoil , which unloaded 726 million in chevron stock in 1993 pennzoil had begun buying chevron shares in 1988 , with some of the 22 billion it had won in a lawsuit against texaco pennzoil sold to pay some taxes on the texaco payment and to avoid an anticipated market downturn did these big sales called huge prints because of the length of the ticker tape recording them push down the stocks' prices \? mostly , the stocks finished lower on the day of the trade than they did the day before , although other market forces might also have been at work did the sellers time these huge deals well \? that s a mixed picture , with about half the stocks selling higher six months later , and half lower despite the huge dollar sizes of these deals , none was the biggest in number of shares that honor goes to an exchange of 488 million shares in april 1986 , when international harvester was reborn as navistar international but , at 10 a share , that transaction amounted to just 488 million chart just imagine the commission lists top 10 stock trades , by dollar value , ever conducted on the new york stock exchange \( source bloomberg financial markets \)
tokyo , dec 26 japan s main opposition party crumbled a bit more today when one of its founding members bolted to form a new party former prime minister tsutomu hata led the split , taking 12 members of parliament with him from the opposition new frontier party to form the new sun party while the new party is not expected to be a major force any time soon , the breakup underscored the instability in national politics and in particular the travails of the opposition japan has never really had a twoparty political system , and while a political realignment may be under way there is not much sign that a twoparty system will result for now , by far the strongest political force in japan is the governing liberal democratic party , which is headed by prime minister ryutaro hashimoto and has led japan for most of its postwar history while mr hata said the sun party would cooperate at times with other opposition groups , the split will make it easier for mr hashimoto to preside over the government without having to look over his shoulder for now the focus of attention is on conflict within the opposition , rather than confrontation between the opposition and ruling camps we chose the party s name because we aim to be the nucleus of the opposition camp , tenacious and bright , mr hata said today this is a little bit painful , he added , referring to splitting from the new frontier party , which he helped found but our intention is to form a separate party to promote further progress , and i would like to make this an opportunity for japanese politics to function better the next question is whether the new frontier party will splinter further in the coming months some key members had already left in september , to form the democratic party , and now there is talk of other possible splits some analysts expect to see the defection from the new frontier of another former prime minister , morihiro hosokawa none of the wrangling has much to do with party policies rather the main source of tension has been the strong leadership or autocratic style , depending on who is speaking of the new frontier s top leader , ichiro ozawa mr ozawa is widely acknowledged as a brilliant election strategist and a master of backroom maneuvering but as a party boss , he seems unable to look at feathers without ruffling them , and the result has been a series of internal power struggles the liberal democrats won national elections in october in large part because the opposition was already divided among the new frontier , the social democrats , the democratic party and the communists after the split , the new frontier party is left with just 139 seats in the 500member house of representatives
george bush had a problem with the vision thing , which helped seal his fate as a oneterm president economists have a similar problem , contend robert heilbroner and william milberg , colleagues at the new school for social research and authors of the crisis of vision in modern economic thought \( cambridge university press \) and while the voters have n't specifically been asked what they think of economists , they have indirectly expressed their views on the subject by bolstering the fortunes of pat buchanan and steve forbes , republican candidates who have made campaign issues of their contempt for mainstream economics many practitioners see their point the annual meeting of the american economic association last month was dominated by existential handwringing , only partly induced by the decline in undergraduate economics majors and the collapse in demand for newly minted economists in both business and academia it is far from clear , though , that many would agree with the heilbronermilberg prescription for redemption an acknowledgment that economics is less a science than a running dog to capitalist ideology , along with a new focus on making government work as the defender of capitalism from its own excesses macroeconomics , the study of what makes whole economies tick and what the public generally identifies as economics , is plainly in trouble fiscal finetuning to keep the economy on an even course , built around the ideas of john maynard keynes , reigned supreme in the 1960 s it was richard m nixon , after all , who said we are all keynesians now but the failure of the economics establishment to cope with the oil shocks of the 1970 s and the subsequent bouts of stagflation opened keynesianism to challenges from which it has never recovered in what at first appeared to be a drive for a new grand synthesis , economists led by robert lucas of the university of chicago tried to reconcile beliefs about the causes and cures for unemployment and inflation with the likely behavior of individuals and businesses what they ended up with was a recipe for nihilism in some cases rational expectations models predicted that the private sector response would fully offset government policy initiatives a tax cut today , for example , would lead individuals to save more to cover their share of the higher taxes needed in the future to pay interest on the federal debt in other cases , rational expectations models suggest that the private sector response could even be perverse , exacerbating a problem that government policy was designed to solve consider the implications if the reactions of private markets to government intervention are inherently fluky , there was little basis for predicting the future and virtually none for finetuning the economy they destroyed macroeconomics , concludes james tobin of yale , who , like robert lucas , won a nobel prize for investigating the keynesian framework to mr heilbroner and mr milberg this is cause for abandoning the pretense that economics is a science and accepting the role of pragmatic guardian of the system what they call a general recognition of the need for expanded public intervention to protect the capitalist order from the difficulties and dangers with which it will have to contend but to mr tobin , one does not follow from the other while he agrees that it is reasonable for economics to serve as the superego of capitalism , there remains a conventional job to be done a job that depends on economists using scientific methods to make decisions about what sort of intervention works , when and while many academics and the journals they write for are deep into navelgazing , economists at the congressional budget office , the white house and the federal reserve still have to come up with forecasts and recommendations for government policy , mr tobin says , and they still must use modified keynesian models to do it what s more , he argues , the predictions do a whole lot better than a roll of the dice the world s opinion of economists has certainly changed since the heady days of the 1960 s while it was tempting to think of economics as an exact science in the making , macroeconomics is , and always was , a messier matter policy economics is a compromise guesswork educated by theory and statistical evidence but there is a curious symbiosis between critics of the right , who see the limitations of keynesian economics as a rationale for abandoning interventionist policy , and critics of the left like mr heilbroner and mr milberg , who see them as a rationale for abandoning economists' pretense to objectivity and worship of science economics is a tent big enough to accommodate both robert lucas and robert heilbroner but the center ring is still occupied by economists who worry about the implications of lower interest rates or bigger budget deficits , and advise accordingly drawing
montclair , nj , nov 15 peter appelbaum spent three years scouring the school systems of north jersey , hoping to find one so impressive that he would have no qualms about enrolling his children he settled on montclair for many reasons , but one , he says , stood out the free , racially integrated prekindergarten program that the public schools have run for nearly three decades mr appelbaum moved his family to town 15 months ago , but now it looks as if the program that helped lure them here will soon be transformed , if not eliminated in september , the montclair board of education decided it could no longer afford prekindergarten , which costs 15 million a year a total of 335 4yearolds are enrolled board members said the school district is losing state aid , crowded schools need the rooms now used by the program , and taxpayers should not have to pay for an optional program the decision has set off debates of volcanic proportions in montclair , and hundreds of residents have signed petitions in protest the uproar has been so intense that last month , the board of education promised to keep the program running , somehow , for at least another year as the community explores alternatives for the future , like charging tuition on a sliding scale montclair s decision comes as educators around the country are calling for more affordable , highquality preschool programs , which they say improve chances for academic success a week after the board of education voted to end prekindergarten here , the carnegie corporation , the national nonprofit research organization , released a report saying publicly financed programs like montclair s should be available to all 3 and 4yearolds montclair has been a real pioneer , said michael levine , the earlychildhood program officer at the carnegie corporation our report suggests montclair s program is the kind of model we need a lot more of montclair s mayor , william farlie , and herman white , president of the school board , say they would like to keep prekindergarten in the schools , but do not have the money gov christine todd whitman s schoolfinancing proposal would provide an extra 288 million for early childhood programs , but only in districts where more than 20 percent of the students are poor in montclair , which has 38 , 000 residents , 18 percent are poor for the first time , we 're having to look at the difference between things we 'd like to do and things we can afford , mayor farlie said we 're being pressed against the wall by the state , and prek is a nonmandated program in new jersey and nationwide , public prekindergarten programs are rare in 1992 , the latest year for which figures are available , 32 states spent a total of 665 million on preschool programs , serving 290 , 000 children but almost all those programs are limited to lowincome children , and most serve only a fraction of the families eligible , said gina adams , a senior childcare specialist at the children s defense fund of new jersey s 600 school districts , 110 offer prekindergarten , and about a third of those programs are paid for by state and federal governments because they serve lowincome populations middleclass and wealthy districts that offer prekindergarten must pay for it themselves , and although several dozen in new jersey do , most offer only halfday programs that serve far fewer students than montclair s the town s program is for six hours a day montclair s program is one of a kind , residents say the school system , desegregated after a federal court order in 1968 , has specialized magnet schools that insure racially balanced classrooms , and the preschool program was started as a way to bring white children into schools with large minoritygroup populations the town , whose population is 65 percent white and 31 percent black , used to receive extra money from the state for desegregation efforts , but this year it got none mayor farlie has appointed a task force to try to save the program or plan an alternative for next year the most likely compromise seems to be a semiprivate program with a slidingscale tuition , housed outside the regular school buildings but that would not satisfy parents like mr appelbaum , whose daughter will be ready for prekindergarten next fall this program was a symbol of the school district moving in great directions , said mr appelbaum , an education professor at william paterson college there s just no way any private place could equal the program in the public schools miriam silver , a professor of early childhood education who has worked with the montclair program for years , said it has stayed fully integrated because it is free and has a good reputation teacher salaries start at 32 , 000 , almost double in many private programs this draws top teachers , said dr silver , who teaches at montclair state university the people who come very well prepared expect to be well paid , so the public schools are their first choice , she said a program that charged tuition for the wealthiest , it could be several thousand dollars a year could quickly lose its racial and socioeconomic balance as wealthier families transfer children to private nursery schools , supporters of a free program said the tuition program will start out not integrated , said lisa lorms , a mother of three who helped form citizens for public prek , a group that has been fighting the board s decision the board of education has been struggling for several years to keep prekindergarten , and it charged tuition once before , during the 199495 school year but that year , one black resident , david herron , said it was discriminatory and filed a legal challenge leo f klagholz , the commissioner of education , sided with mr herron , and about 500 , 000 in tuition money remains in escrow while the board appeals mr herron , whose youngest child is in the program , is now fighting to save the free program , saying a slidingscale tuition would only cause parents who pay more to resent those who pay less the perception becomes that all the minority students are coming on a freebie , he said , and that s not healthy at all but mr white , the school board president , said prekindergarten should not get tax money when other programs sorely need the money reading levels need to improve in every grade , he said , and class size 25 , on average should come down he said the prekindergarten program had its highest enrollment ever the year it charged tuition , suggesting that parents asked to pay in the future would not jump ship if i have to assign a priority , he said , i would say there is a big responsibility to support the 5 , 800 kids in the k12 program before the 300 in prek mr herron argued that in montclair , integration at every level should be the most important component , and it cannot be achieved without free prekindergarten if the board decides to remove the program from the school system and charge tuition , he said , it will be abandoning a crucial desegregation effort he is waiting to see what happens , he said , but he has not ruled out another legal challenge they are dismantling a desegregation program that they do not have the authority to touch , mr herron said it is not theirs to change photo the montclair , nj , school system has offered free preschool classes for 4yearolds since 1968 , but it fears it can no longer afford them prekindergarten pupils at mount hebron school did woodworking yesterday \( monica almeida the new york times \)
live by the bullpen die by the bullpen joe torre must be counting the hours until his closer , john wetteland , comes off the disabled list that will be wednesday in seattle and that will be none too soon for torre a day after the yankee manager was able to squeak out a victory in wetteland s absence with a makeshift corps of relievers , torre had to watch helplessly as jeff nelson continued his seasonlong struggle on the mound mariano rivera was available to torre yesterday , unlike saturday night , but the yankees never got a chance to use him instead , nelson \( 44 \) surrendered a leadoff pinchhit home run to matt stairs in the top of the ninth inning yesterday that broke a 44 tie and propelled oakland to a 64 victory mark mcgwire , who had earlier hit his 44th home run of the season , added a little insurance with a runscoring single off dave pavlas as a result the yankees ended up with a disheartening 46 homestand and packed their bags and their sixgame lead in the american league east and took off for a crucial 10game west coast swing that begins tonight in seattle for one fleeting moment yesterday , tino martinez looked as if he had saved a day in which the yankees had unveiled a fourth monument to their storied past , this one commemorating the late mickey mantle with 50 , 808 customers in the house for the ceremony martinez gave the yankees new life by unloading a twoout home run off the oakland lefthander mike mohler to tie the score at 44 in the bottom of the eighth but nelson , who had pitched a scoreless eighth despite issuing a pair of walks , could not hold the athletics one more inning and give the yankees a chance to win the game and get a weekend sweep stairs , the pinchhitting specialist who had nearly tied saturday night s game with a ninthinning shot that right fielder paul o'neill stabbed out of the air , made sure nobody would catch up to this one stairs drilled a 21 nelson sinker without much sink over the centerfield fence some 416 feet from home plate for the lefthandedhitting stairs , it was his seventh home run of the season for the yanks and their fans , it was one more unhappy event in a month that has been full of them you ca n't fall behind hitters and expect good things to happen , torre said of nelson , whose first two pitches to stairs were balls when you fall behind , you eliminate all the guessing in hitting when tino ties it up , i want to go out there and get our guys in the dugout as fast as we can to try to win it , said nelson , who was trying to throw his sinking fastball away from stairs on the home run pitch i had confidence in getting the guy out when i saw it go over the fence , it was frustrating this is not the way i 've thrown in the past nelson , whose earned run average has ballooned to 475 , has been something of an enigma since the yankees acquired him as part of the trade that brought martinez from seattle last december we have to try to get him straightened out , said torre , who met with nelson this weekend to try to shake him out of his funk instead , nelson , whose third walk of the game also led to the athletics' final run of the game , appeared to be a little shaken up i'm a guy that goes out there and does a good job most all the time , nelson said and the boos \? nah , it does n't bother me , nelson said when i'm getting behind guys like the last time and today , i 'd boo myself , too torre could have opened the ninth with a lefthander to counter stairs but oakland manager art howe still had the dangerous terry steinbach , who bats from the right side , on the bench i just decided to stay with nellie , hoping he could at least get the sinkerball over , torre said stairs swings the bat hard but there are other things to do besides hit a home run a single would n't upset me so much actually , there was plenty to be upset about yesterday andy pettitte , who had begun the day a perfect 110 in afternoon starts this season , held a 31 lead entering the sixth inning on the strength of a cecil fielder runscoring single , a darryl strawberry solo homer and a jim leyritz single the only run pettitte had allowed was a mammoth 446foot secondinning blast to mcgwire his 44th homer of the season landed in the yankee bullpen , not far from the monument to mantle but in the sixth , everything fell apart tony batista and jason giambi opened the inning with singles one out later , up stepped mcgwire , who worked the count full and then tattooed a foul down the leftfield line mel stottlemyre , the yankee pitching coach , went to the mound to reassure pettitte whatever he said did n't work mcgwire doubled to the gap in leftcenter on the next pitch and the score was tied at 33 brian lesher , who was making his first major league start , then collected his first career hit and run batted in with a flare over first base and the yankees trailed , 43 as a starter , my main concern is staying out of a big inning , pettitte said i did n't do a good job i had the lead and i blew it as for mcgwire \?

if times are tough now for foreignlanguage films in the united states , they are almost impossible for eastern european movies that fact would probably be little noticed or lamented except that a handful of this year s most critically acclaimed films , works that were discovered at the cannes , montreal and toronto film festivals , were made in russia and eastern europe most of them have not found american distributors many in the artfilm world say the situation is particularly regrettable because this could be the time for eastern european films to burst upon the american consciousness , much as chinese films did six years ago you know why these films are so great , said jonathan weisgal , executive vice president of fine line the film makers have real material that inspires them the cap s been on the bottle for so long , and now it s open incredible stuff is coming out but how do you build a market for that \? prisoner of the mountains , a new film by the russian director sergei bodrov about two russian soldiers who are taken captive by chechnyans , won a number of prizes at cannes and was shown at the toronto international film festival , which ended two weeks ago but there has been only one offer , from orion pictures , for less than 200 , 000 for american and some canadian rights eastern european films traditionally have been harder sells , because of their nature and content , said bingham ray , a senior executive at october films american audiences are not that well versed in what s going on over there they just do n't care piers handling , the director of programming for the toronto festival , echoed those sentiments it will be a challenge for any small distributor to sell a russian film , he said there s extreme resistance to seeing a serious film about chechnya or politics he noted , however , that one film about bosnia was picked up at the recent toronto festival , jeanluc godard s for ever mozart dan talbot , of new yorker films , bought distribution rights to the french film , a complex meditation on art and politics set in sarajevo brave move for dan , mr handling said mr bodrov , who was born in eastern siberia but now lives in los angeles , has made five previous films , none of which have been distributed in the united states we discovered bodrov a few years ago , said serge losique , the director of the montreal world film festival mr bodrov s film freedom is paradise , about a teenage boy in a stalinist reform school , won the top prize at montreal in 1989 it was distributed in canada , mr losique said but in the us , no mr ray also noted the lack of an american buyer at cannes for vaska , a hungarian film fable set in sovietera leningrad , as well as the difficulty that ciby 2000 , the french independent production company , is having in finding an american distributor for underground , the 1995 film by the bosnian director emir kusturica underground is to be shown on oct 12 as part of the new york film festival next month , the walter reade theater will begin a series of eight films directed by russian women none of the films have ever been distributed in the united states , although a 1976 movie about two russian soldiers on the run in nazi germany , the ascent , by larisa shepitko , was honored at the berlin film festival even eastern european films that do find distributors , like before the rain , by a macedonian director , milcho manchevski , often fail to find audiences before the rain , a 1994 film about ethnic strife in macedonia , made less than 1 million at the box office for its distributor , gramercy pictures , despite an oscar nomination and strong reviews burnt by the sun , the russian movie , was hailed as a masterpiece and won the oscar for best foreignlanguage film in 1995 that oscar , however , did not help the film , distributed by sony pictures classics , as much as academy awards had for sony s films the two previous years indochine , a french film , made 7 million at the box office , and belle epoque , from spain , made 6 million but burnt by the sun made only 33 million what was difficult about marketing 'burnt by the sun' was that every review referred in the first paragraph to the stalinist purges , said michael barker , a copresident of sony pictures classics there s a lot of major talent coming out of eastern europe , but all those films have deep , dark themes in a recent issue of the weekly variety , the critic emanuel levy almost dared american companies to pursue a film shown at the montreal festival , srdjan drogojevic s pretty village , pretty flame , about a marauding group of bosnian serb soldiers who are trapped by muslim militiamen in a tunnel on the road between zagreb and belgrade calling it one of the most audacious antiwar statements ever committed to the big screen , he wrote that an adventurous distributor should grab this eccentric film , and that it could become one of the high points of the cinematic year

stumbling across a stubbled cornfield in the predawn murk in sheffield , mass , behind the shadowy , 6foot5inch form of my turkeyhunting host , willard weeks , i marveled , as i always do , at how the fierce anticipation of the night before could have so precipitously dwindled at the woods at the southwest end of the field , weeks paused , and said , you ought to set up somewhere close to that birch , wished me luck and departed i spent a considerable amount of time deciding where i would sit , knowing that i would be anchored there for more than four hours i chose a fallen tree with the birch as a backrest , pulled a hood of camouflaged netting over my head , lit my pipe something one probably should n't do when turkey hunting and concentrated on listening i thought i heard one distant gobble , but the background sound of a little brook that tumbled through a ravine below me left me uncertain and even if the gobble was n't imagined , it had come from the direction where two other members of our party were located and the bird was therefore theirs , rather than mine , to importune the others were carl carlozzi and his soninlaw jonathan tucker , both of amherst , and both frequent visitors to the nearby 1799 farmhouse owned by weeks and other members of his clan weeks , whose home is also in amherst , manages 200plus acres of land surrounding the farmhouse , which was bought by his grandfather early in this century , and it is used , among other things , by weeks and his buddies as a base for deer and turkey hunting weeks had already taken the one gobbler , or male turkey , allowed during last month s massachusetts spring season , so he was afield with camera rather than gun having finished my pipe , i slipped a diaphragm call into my mouth and every five minutes made sounds that i hoped were a reasonable approximation of a hen turkey seeking the attention of a male if a gobbler had responded , i would have altered the timing of my yelping according to the speed of his approach as a general rule , minimal calling is best when a tom is moving in spring turkey seasons are limited to the bearded birds , almost always males , and come at a time when most hens , already impregnated , are on their nests shortly before 7 am i began to shiver , but convinced myself that the shivering was adding an appealing vibrato to my calling shafts of sunlight began to penetrate the partially leaved hardwoods enabling me to see a bit deeper into the forest at about 7 10 , i discerned movement in a thicket about 60 yards away , but it proved to be a gray squirrel a moment later there was more movement in the same spot and i thought that i glimpsed part of the outline of a turkey i was easing my shotgun into a better position when a turkey appeared below me on the opposite side of the brook about 35 yards away it was moving rapidly , but not too rapidly for me to see its entire form i could n't tell if it had a beard , but it was clearly a female , a small bird with no red on its head slinking along and striving to be inconspicuous , not strutting into view displaying its tail feathers and dragging its wingtips on the ground as would a lusty tom i resumed calling , but at 9 o'clock , i happened to look over my shoulder at the cornfield and saw carlozzi departing i waited half an hour and followed back at the farmhouse i learned that tucker had heard at least one gobbler , but had seen nothing carlozzi had enjoyed an exciting quarter of an hour when a flock of turkeys that had apparently been feeding in the cornfield took wing one of them , a gobbler , landed in a tree within shotgun range the only problem was that there was another tree between carlozzi and the bird he got brief glimpses of it as it shifted its footing on its roost , but never had a chance to shoot he thought of shifting to one side or the other to get a clear shot , but knew that the gobbler turkeys have incredibly sharp vision would spot such a move and depart the standoff ended when the bird joined another that was flying past during the remainder of that morning and part of the afternoon , weeks and i hiked substantial portions of the farm s acres , most of which is mixed hardwoods , ash , shagbark hickory , maple , red oak , white and gray birch and a few white oaks hemlocks were common and there was also a stately stand of mature red pines that he , as a boy , had helped his grandfather plant turkey and deer signs were abundant nearly 30 turkeys have been taken at the farm since hunting for them began in 1984 , and weeks and his friends have shot 78 deer on the old homestead clearly imbued with deep affection for the land , weeks is also an accomplished amateur naturalist , breaking stride to point out various shrubs and earlyblooming wildflowers , the latter including trilliums and trout lillies my second and final morning at the farm , weeks offered to call for me from the base of his favorite turkey tree immediately after arriving , we heard five different gobblers , but none was sufficiently impassioned to come our way i knew that we were wellcamouflaged , however , because one of a pair of wood thrushes having a territorial dispute actually flew into my left shoulder i left without firing a shot , but was content i had made new friends and had an invitation to hunt deer at the old homestead

we kind of liked 'the godfather' and those scorsese movies , and we started out trying to do kind of a gritty movie , explained owen c wilson of the script that five years later became the movie bottle rocket then reality bit we were n't tough guys , mr wilson cheerfully acknowledged , referring to himself and his fellow texan , wes anderson , with whom he wrote the script we did n't have the backgrou 'd to do a toughguy movie so they made bottle rocket instead bottle rocket has all the components of a hardtogetmade , hardtorelease , independent first feature but looks can be deceiving the film s executive producer is james l brooks , the oscarwinning writer , director and producer of terms of endearment and broadcast news and bottle rocket is being released by columbia tristar motion pictures the studio had planned to open the film this friday in 30 theaters but decided last week to delay the opening until feb 23 , which will help it steer clear of broken arrow , a multimilliondollar john woo action film starring john travolta that opens on friday and is expected to attract huge audiences normally a studio the size of columbia would not be fretting over the best date to open a movie in 30 theaters but bottle rocket , a virtually starless little movie with an impossibly low 5 million budget , has managed to get and to keep columbia s attention over a long gestation period bottle rocket , which stars mr wilson , 27 , and was directed by mr anderson , 26 , follows a trio of misguided , middleclass fellows who , under the tutelage of a mentor in crime , try to pull off a petty heist their aim is modest , and they make more noise than anything else , hence the title bottle rockets are these cheap little fireworks that only go about 40 feet pp , and they make a little pop , mr anderson said but that s all you expect from them the movie , set on mr wilson s and mr anderson s home turf of dallas , is a comedy caper with generation x overtones , yet it flies none of the usual popculture flags that such films usually wave there is no sex or real violence and no star power in the lead roles its angst is coddled rather than hardboiled a la tarantino mr wilson plays dignan , the group s flamboyant leader , who fills a notebook with improbable schemes and plans for the next 50 years mr wilson s younger brother , luke , costars as the more quietly introspective anthony , who is first seen breaking out of a mental hospital to keep things almost all in the family , the older wilson brother , andrew , also has a small part and bob , the third member of the criminal trio , is played by robert musgrave , a close friend of both the wilsons and mr anderson \( lumi cavazos , the star of like water for chocolate , is anthony s unconventional love interest \) dignan , anthony and bob are not the kind of guys to sit in front of the tube inhaling life lessons from friends they would idolize the guys in 'heat , ' owen wilson said , except they had n't seen the movie yet it was enthusiasm , energy and vitality , much of it naively misplaced , that turned bottle rocket into a short film in 1992 mr wilson and mr anderson , who had met in a playwriting class at the university of texas at dallas , were sharing an apartment when they decided to make a movie their original plan was to shoot a 16millimeter blackandwhite feature thirteen minutes of film and 10 , 000 later , they were broke so they decided to call what they had of bottle rocket a short and submit it to the sundance film festival , where it was shown in 1993 people seemed to like it and think it was funny , mr wilson remembered but nobody handed over cash to help them make a fulllength movie they returned to dallas , wondering what was going to happen next enter hollywood in the person of polly platt and mr brooks the screenwriter l m kit carson , a friend of the wilson family , had sent the bottle rocket script and a video of the short to the producer barbara boyle , who in turn sent the material to ms platt ms platt , a successful producer and production designer , was then the executive vice president of gracie films , mr brooks s production company under an arrangement with columbia pictures , the studio had agreed to finance a lowbudget feature of mr brooks s choice when ms platt found bottle rocket , she knew she had the movie i had never read anything like it , she said it was filled with such wry , selfdeprecating humor i shoved it in jim s face then he looked at the short it was a miracle he shared my enthusiasm mr brooks said it had rhythms i had never seen before it just broke me up it had such a sense of the ridiculous and it had such a great selling point you never saw any of these guys before so mr brooks and ms platt flew to dallas to meet the two young men behind it he came by our apartment , and i think he was shocked by our living conditions , owen wilson said of mr brooks i think that actually helped us i think he thought 'if i do n't make this movie , what s going to happen to these guys \? they 're hanging by a thread'
we launched at catskill , ny , from a public park just below the rip van winkle bridge , in the dense , warm air of a fog lifting at dawn there , about 30 miles south of albany , the hudson river , its sleepy girth about 1 , 000 yards across , moved lazily southward , and we were grateful for its laziness , neither of us \( i had solicited the aid of a friend for the occasion \) having been in a canoe in some years the water was bath warm , and we were grateful for that , too our first few strokes were awkward , and the nose of our borrowed canoe wandered back and forth across the longitudinal center for a while as i , in the stern , steered us uncertainly around the mouth of catskill creek and into the main current , toward new york city how did this happen to a couple of landlubbers like us \? it was my fault when a river runs by the house , i want to hitch a ride on it i ca n't help it all that movement , from somewhere , to somewhere it s piquing so what is it about the hudson , the huge beckoning thing that most new yorkers ignore \? like the purloined letter hidden in plain sight , it has been flowing within view of my windows \( well , some of my windows i 've moved a lot \) for 20 years now , but until i decided to solve the situation recently , i 'd never been out in it not on my own steam , anyway the circle line ferry does n't count besides , the imagery in my head was irresistible me in a tiny canoe , paddling home from the far north , finally riding the lethargic current under the george washington bridge and down the west side of manhattan to the west , the palisades , with the late afternoon shadows being cast over the water by the sun fading over new jersey to the east , the rushhour traffic heading up along the west side highway toward the bronx as i pull ashore at battery park , the statue of liberty waves at my back in this fantasy , i'm wearing fringed buckskin , a primitive discovering the city it is possible to do this , i learned , buckskin or no , but for me it did n't work out quite that way , there being problems in reconciling the imagery with my ambition of a mere weekend s worth of paddling and the logistics of undertaking such a journey with rusty skills and , crucially , no canoe it was john cronin , the executive director of the hudson riverkeeper fund , an environmental watchdog group , who pointed out that though the hudson is a fine and underused venue for paddlers , the closer you get to the city the less accommodating the riverbanks become places to dock safely are few leaving the canoe becomes a problem , and motels are n't particularly easy to find or get to \( as it turns out i'm not much of a primitive when it comes to sleeping out at night \) it s adventurous , but in lower westchester and new york city you 've kind of stranded yourself , mr cronin said nowhere , in fact , mr cronin added , does the hudson have a terribly booming riverside culture that would encourage precisely the kind of endeavor i 'd proposed in the end , he recommended the catskill region , where the river is peaceful and wide and scenic , generally crossable in a canoe without overt danger from windwhipped whitecaps or ships churning up a threatening wake , and with reasonably accessible amenities on shore the lower hudson , mr cronin reiterated , is great for canoeing , but canoeists do n't use it much perhaps , he said , this is because it is dominated by motorcraft , from jet skis to pleasure yachts to the occasional tour boat and barge he did n't , in any case , know where i could rent a canoe , and neither did anyone else i spoke with you can rent canoes on the upper hudson , way to the northwest above albany in the adirondacks , where whitewater enthusiasts are challenged by a 14mile sluice between the indian and boreas rivers known as the hudson gorge you can rent canoes on the delaware , to the southwest , but none of the outfitters i called were willing to cart a canoe several hours to the catskills for me , and i did n't even ask if they 'd let me do it myself the tourist board for greene county , where catskill is , could n't help me , either why do n't you come up here and go golfing \? the woman at the tourist board suggested on the phone we have plenty of that a marine yard in catskill was willing to sell me a new aluminum canoe for 700 and then buy it back from me after the trip for 500 but for a trip such as mine , i was advised , an aluminum boat would be about as comfortable and sleek as a bathtub in the end , happily , i was able to borrow a canoe , and it was a beauty made by wenonah , it was a twoseat , 17foot boat made of lightweight kevlar and it was painted a nifty , woodsy color i came to think of as hiawatha green we outfitted ourselves life jackets , paddles , waterproof baggage toters and map covers at cold brook canoes , a garagebased business in boiceville , ny , some 16 miles off the thruway , where the proprietor , ernie gardner , would n't let us go without being assured we knew what we were doing \( we lied a little \) , and without suggesting that we pay 25 to join the hudson river waterway association , a group of boaters and environmentalists who promote the river as a recreational site it was n't the association mr gardner was touting with the membership comes the hudson river waterway guide , a milebymile description of sights on the river between troy and the battery , along with suggestions of places to rest , swim , camp or store your canoe for the night while you 're off in search of a motel it was invaluable waters in motion
al and i went out to dinner the chef was from the pileiton school of cooking i 'll have some shrimp , i said do you want our shrimp wrapped in bacon and served on a chilled bed of pureed green beans with a dash of sea salt , cooked in a combination of vintage muscatel and extra virgin olive oil \? the waiter asked or do you want our shrimp petite vache \? shrimp with a petty cow \? the chef sautees the shrimp on a veal chop which has been marinated in a sauce of cumin and oil of cloves , then seared over a hickory fire and garnished with thinly sliced tangerine peels and tiny bits of aged spruce bark actually , i said , i 'd like something a little simpler just some plain boiled shrimp , i think that is impossible , said the waiter the chef could have his diploma lifted if gourmet authorities should learn that he had perverted his art by serving just plain boiled shrimp i'm sorry , i said if word of this gets back to the chef , please tell him i was just kidding if i may suggest said the waiter of course why not have our shrimp a la old virginny \? eight succulent crustaceans are served nestled on a moist bed of green linguini that has been seasoned with just the slightest touch of nutmeg the entire dish is cooked in a cheesecloth wrapping from a cured virginia ham still cloaked in its original mold i asked al to go ahead and order while i studied the menu al said he 'd go for the pork chop excellent choice , said the waiter uh oh ! here was trouble the man was obviously a seasoned critic of his customers' tastes i had been thinking of maybe asking for some fried chicken , but now i was worried that the waiter might give my choice a bad review he was describing al s pork chop it is cooked in a thick crust of stilton cheese and served under a mound of wild rice which has been boiled in genuine oldfashioned percolator coffee three pockets carved into the sides of the chop are stuffed with , respectively , ground bluefish , crushed cinnamon sticks and eggplant ravioli the dish is topped with a maraschino cherry al said he would take it if the chef was willing to risk his reputation by leaving off the maraschino cherry that s out of the question , i'm afraid that s all right , i told al i 'll eat the maraschino cherry for you i love 'em ah ! cried the waiter in that case let me suggest one of the chef s specialties maraschino cherries de mer a la soupe du jour i 'll take it , i said , if you 'll let me keep my sidearms and horse for the spring planting a splendid choice , he said you are about to dine on a dozen chilled maraschino cherries served on a bed of batterfried mussels topped with two layers of souvlaki , a spicy italian sausage , and thin slices of palm frond , the entire dish floating in a tureen of piping hot soupe du jour and what may i bring you to drink \? i said how about a bottle of liebfraumilch wrapped in filets of smoked alligator breast lightly seasoned with cilantro and topped with marzipan corkscrew an excellent choice ! said the waiter as al and i applied knife and fork to the chef s gustatorial excesses we talked politics he had been uncertain whether to vote for dole or clinton now he had decided clinton , he said clinton is a man who thinks small his vision of the office is one where you can get kids to wear school uniforms and persuade people to volunteer to teach kids how to read none of that shakeyourfistattheworld grandiosity about clinton , i agreed he keeps it small your muffler s noisy , he s going to make it easier to get it fixed your cat wo n't eat food that s good for his urinary tract , clinton s going to get that food improved until it s better than catnip exactly , said al and who is the candidate who will get america back to simple restaurant food once we tell him it s a problem \? not dole , i said you got it , pal eat your maraschino cherries and vote often
a 5aday campaign the presidential campaign of ralph nader , consumer advocate , protoneopopulist and nominee of the vaguely leftish green party , has a serious money problem the problem is that mr nader does n't want to spend any mr nader is leaping through flaming hoops in a determined battle to run for president on a budget of less than 5 , 000 that is the threshold at which federal candidates must file reports disclosing both their personal finances and where they raise and spend campaign money , steps he is loath to undertake so far , he said in a telephone interview , he has spent less than 1 , 300 on his race , including postage to return unsolicited contributions his biggest expense was for a couple of cheapseat united airlines flights to california , where he accepted the greens' nomination most other campaigning will be conducted by car , he said there are no overnights in presidential hotel suites i stay with friends , relatives and so on , he said many might expect the original opengovernment crusader and nemesis of political fat cats to eagerly bare his financial figures they would be wrong i like to practice what i preach , which is privacy for medical data , tax data and creditcard data , he said besides , he said , he is against bigmoney politics and for public financing of campaigns in an editorial mocking mr disclosure , the wall street journal criticized mr nader for weasling about expenses , and argued that the party s spending to promote his candidacy would normally accrue toward the 5 , 000 threshold but mr nader said he had covered that base in what is surely a first in presidential politics , mr nader said he had yet to speak to any green party officials about the fact that he is their nominee that way he avoids federal rules that lump independent spending with a candidate s own expenses when the two are coordinated , or jointly planned if there s no coordination , there s no accrual , mr nader said i go out of my way to stay away from them clinton , by a neck candidates inadvertently reveal all sorts of things under the boilerroom pressure of a campaign this week , for instance , president clinton confessed a heretofore hidden passion he loves bolos on the trail in sun city , ariz , mr clinton effusively thanked a supporter for his welcoming gift of this beautiful bolo , which i will treasure , adding somewhat cryptically i collect them i love to wear them when i have different attire on further inquiry disclosed that mr clinton does indeed have a collection of bolos , those leatherstringandslide devices that substitute for neckties in parts of the west like the sun city bolo , most were given him at political appearances official washington s chief exponent of bolos , senator ben nighthorse campbell of colorado , says he handmakes an elaborate bola bola , not bolo , is the correct usage , he insists for every president i do it as sort of a goingaway present , mr campbell said fact is , i'm making one for him right now mr campbell , elected as a democrat , switched to the republican party last year debate over debates washington s version of the vietnam war s paris peace talks , the quadrennial gathering of negotiators to forge a schedule for the fall s presidential debates , lurched into motion yesterday the nonpartisan commission on presidential debates , which oversees the haggling , favors three presidential debates and one vicepresidential debate , all 90 minutes long the dole campaign s emissary , former gov carroll a campell jr of south carolina , said his side prefers four presidential and two vicepresidential debates of 60 minutes each an equal span of time , but broken into smaller chunks the clinton campaign s chief emissary , commerce secretary mickey kantor , was mum we just listened , he said the clinton camp mused about pushing back the commission s proposed date of the first debate , sept 25 one effect of that could be to give mr dole less time to make up ground should he perform poorly nothing will happen until the commission decides the hinge issue of the affair whether to include ross perot , mr nader and other fringe candidates none of their emissaries was included in the talks yesterday , although the perot campaign s national coordinator , russell j verney , gatecrashed the bargaining i received a warm welcome from secretary kantor , he said later , and received no response from the dole representatives translation the clinton camp believes mr perot will siphon votes from mr dole s base so does the dole camp michael wines
washington , dec 19 harold m ickes sounds surprisingly gentle in his final days at the white house , given his reputation as a flinty infighter who does not yield anything easily , least of all his own perch on power you 're out of here on the 20th of january , mr ickes said simply of himself , trying to sound impersonal in describing what white house aides are watching as one of the more telling moments of the clinton presidency the forced resignation of mr ickes as deputy chief of staff and longtime clinton loyalist after some of the toughest days of incumbency you 're off the payroll , and you walk down the street , said mr ickes , smiling tightly at the finality of the idea as he took a moment away from his last white house task arranging the long celebratory day of mr clinton s second inauguration washington is basically about power , access and influence , said the 57yearold lawyer , whose demise at the center of white house power was so sudden that he has no idea yet what he will be doing on jan 21 if you have power , you have it if you do n't , you do n't i have no illusions mr ickes , whose days as a clinton friend extend forward from the vietnam war protest era through countless alliances and contests , was forced from his post as a condition the president accepted in order to hire the new chief of staff , erskine b bowles , who wants a clean slate as mr clinton moves him out , mr ickes is avoiding all public complaint but in private , friends say , he is judging the president to be as heartbreaking at this moment as he was maddeningly seductive in his sway over mr ickes the inaugural gala is a wistful postscript for mr ickes , a profanemouthed combatant as a handson political executive raspyedged in stratagem and speech , he played a blueeyed dirty harry kind of character in the white house inner sanctum his tasks embraced the best and worst of clinton times he specialized in the slogging trench warfare of whitewater , the triumphal reelection drive and , in his final weeks , the mushrooming accusations of abuse in the campaign finance process , which he knew intimately as the president s liaison to the campaign whether mr ickes already seared , as he puts it , from testifying a dozen different times before grand jury and capitol investigators on whitewaterrelated issues is soon done with this city is an open question for complex campaign financing inquiries are now looming , and he served as the nexus of president and party , proud that a strategy of early fund raising helped head off all threats of a primary challenge in discussing the subject , mr ickes concedes some minor mistakes in the process but denies any largescale scandal in his characteristic irreverence toward the political arts he so loves , he likens current campaign law to little more than the incumbent protection act the amount of money that we raised and spent , which republicans raised more of and spent , is shocking , he said of politicians' bipartisan resistance to change in their highstakes solicitations i think it is going to take something like watergate , which is so shocking and mobilizes public opinion to a pitch that congress and the incumbents are forced to change the system and i quite frankly do n't see that if all goes according to mr ickes s micromanaged plan , mr clinton , his old friend of 25 years' standing , will be presiding outside at the gala inaugural parade on jan 20 just as mr ickes finishes packing inside the white house and departs the careerings onstage and off are breathtaking even for political aficionados like mr ickes who claim never to be surprised by the cut and thrust of politics chatting amiably , he offered a merry leer of confirmation to anybody who thinks otherwise even those who are touted in the press as being 'best friends' and 'closest friends' and all of that , he said , declining to criticize the president , in fact praising him repeatedly his glance softening in retrospect at his innocent advent , mr ickes continued it was a monday , jan 3 , 1994 , the day i stepped off the plane to come work here i came directly to the white house , and i was asked , 'do you know anything about whitewater \? ' i'm serious , he said , his laughter cutting the white house office hush he spent three long years trying to master , contain , explain whitewater , during which he ran up personal legal bills in the tens of thousands of dollars i do n't know if anyone has mastered whitewater , but i certainly became steeped in it , he said , laughing like a man who has survived the running of the bulls what they 're trying to do is catch you in a perjury charge , he said of the whitewater inquisitors and they try to squeeze you privately , the tale of mr ickes s downfall is already part of west wing lore , the latest object lesson in the political dictum to never leave your back uncovered the first hint came in a newspaper article two days after the reelection that he had helped manage for the president mr clinton did not tell mr ickes of his decision until he was confronted just before his press conference announcement , several officials say , and even then he was uncharacteristically wordless when mr ickes complained of the crudeness of being so publicly fired i do n't think it is a question of loyalty , mr ickes said carefully in looking back and defending the president s right to jettison him mr ickes wanted the chief of staff s job now other ranking posts , requiring senate approval , are out of the question because republicans view him as such a partisan firebrand and the president shows no appetite to fight for him mr ickes s departure is notable if only because he leaves without one of the multimilliondollar book contracts that lately seem the requisite parachute for celebrity clinton aides he said he had decided early on to forgo the one personal project he had wanted to indulge in the white house keeping a private diary , as his father , harold l ickes , did before him as president franklin d roosevelt s secretary of the interior it would have been subpoenaed , the son said flatly in his white house office it s hard to keep anything quiet in here the senior ickes s diary is a classic among washington memoirs , one worth searching lately for bittersweet cautions about the inevitable fate of insiders like his son decades ago the father wrote of the moment he lost his affection for the president he was serving despite his pleasant and friendly personality , he is as cold as ice inside but ickes the younger will have none of that , insisting that mr clinton is a complex man , a historic president and still a friend the only caution he ever really needed about washington politics , he adds , came from his mother , not his father when my father died , he said , i remember her surprise , if not to say shock , when many people who she had thought were fairly close friends here no longer talked to her that came as a rude awakening he clearly has this in mind as he plans the president s gala and his own departure asked whether his service was worth it , mr ickes paused i think it s a very close call , he answered there are plenty of pluses in serving bill clinton , he continued , and some outright joys in public service but soon the battlescarred political manager , smiling darkly , began reviewing the laborious damage control and the sniping from without and , finally , from within put on top of that subpoenas and legal bills and all , he concluded , smiling at the honor of it all knowing all of that in december 1993 , i'm not at all sure i would have ever come here photo harold m ickes , the departing white house deputy chief of staff \( stephen crowley the new york times \)
the handmaid of desire by john l'heureux 264 pp new york soho press 23 given the disdain for the novel in the academy where literary theory is seen as the supreme discourse perhaps it is only natural that novelists continue to seek their revenge john l'heureux , whose previous novels include a woman run mad \( 1988 \) and the shrine at altamira \( 1992 \) and who teaches creative writing at stanford university , has created in the handmaid of desire a satirical fantasy in which a motley bunch of bartheans , deconstructionists and disciples of foucault are wholly at the mercy of an omnipotent novelist , who rearranges their lives for them according to the requirements of her latest plot the english faculty at the unnamed california university that serves as mr l'heureux s setting is sharply divided into two groups , fools and turks , the fools being those older , fuzzily benevolent types who retain a wistful fondness for literature , although none of them is any longer foolish enough , or brave enough , to pretend seriously that it still matters everything about them , from the hardboiled eggs they eat at faculty meetings to their woolly enthusiasm for one another s company , is an object of scorn to their younger , hipper colleagues , whose devotion to the probing , thrusting , hardbreathing analysis of the latest developments in metaphilosophical transliterary theory is second only to their ferocious ambition for themselves constantly scheming to humiliate their enemies , and to attain more sex , power and money \( in roughly that order \) , the turks are a thoroughly envious , discontented lot the death of literature , like the death of god that preceded it , would not appear to have contributed much to the general happiness \( in fact , the most machiavellian of the turks , obsessed with his plot to replace the english department with a department of theory and discourse , turns to jane austen for consolation behind the locked doors of his study , he endlessly reads and rereads his worn , beloved copy of 'emma' to soothe his unquiet soul \) into this hotbed of thwarted vanities comes a visiting professor , olga komin a celebrated theorist whose books include feminist reworkings of foucault and husserl , she is also a novelist , intent on creating art from the chaos that surrounds her though she occasionally allows one particularly brainless hunk of a graduate student into her bed , her primary lusts are for truth and beauty and rarefied commodities like those while the fools and turks alike cavort grotesquely in hot tubs , swimming pools , meadows and flowering shrubs , she communes austerely with her thoughts nonetheless , she takes pity on the benighted creatures around her and whenever possible grants them their deepest wishes , which she magically divines before they are aware of them themselves because they are , mysteriously , not only their messy selves but the characters in her book , she manages to find in them traces of humanity , as well as to cure them of madness , infertility and seemingly terminal political correctness they , meanwhile , though failing to recognize that they have an artist among them the author , after all , has long been declared dead are just shrewd enough to realize that olga alone can offer them salvation \( only those hapless souls who do not fit into her plot does she regretfully refuse to help \) the ego wars and marital problems that olga is asked to resolve provide much amusing fodder for mr l'heureux s satire , and he has a gift for skewering both the pretensions and the claustrophobia of university life ultimately , however , the author of the handmaid of desire has the same difficulty with his book that olga recognizes in hers what she thought was this nobody could care about such silliness , not even academics she could perk it up with irony and wit satire , of course but in the end she would have to make it matter she would have to give it some kind of moral resonance and how , working with such flimsy material , could she accomplish that \? in a sense , the moral resonance of mr l'heureux s novel is provided by his being on the side of the angels on the side of art , compassion , the potential of even the most monstrous narcissists to experience love but his chilly detachment from his characters , and the thinness with which he paints them , mean that even this allegiance seems more theoretical than anything else , an abstract position divorced from his fictional practice however much he may approve of tenderness , he does not seem able to inject it into his prose one would like , in the hopelessly oldfashioned way of novel readers who are , perhaps , by definition fools to care a little about some of these characters , and this mr l'heureux does not succeed in making us do perhaps the time has passed when academic satire can be carried off successfully not only does the reality of what goes on in english departments defeat attempts at parody , but it seems impossible by now to muster any very fierce convictions about what ought to be one thinks of evelyn waugh , who knew beyond a shadow of a doubt what his ideal or even his acceptable universe would look like mr l'heureux , like the rest of us , can no longer summon up that kind of pure moral fervor his is merely a rueful , defeatist regret for what has been lost , and however wickedly entertaining he may be , he lacks the passion to convince us that it truly matters
so , as advertised , dateline went up against 60 minutes for the first time , the young shootist drawing against the old pro making a judgment on this sort of contest on the basis of a single encounter is like picking the winner in an ncaa matchup after the first couple of minutes on the court , but the event invites attention did sunday night get a lot more interesting , as the nbc advertisement promised \? did people who did not watch 60 minutes have nothing to talk about around the water cooler on monday , as the cbs ad threatened \? we can assume that both sets of producers put their strongest material forward most of the dateline hour was given to a worryoftheweek story about treatment in emergency wards here s what you have to lose sleep over this week if you are carried from an accident in such dire shape that the hospital you wind up at cannot handle you , will you be accepted by a bigger hospital that has the surgeon you need \? in a mix of straight reporting and human interest additives typical of the newsmagazine style , bob mckeown told of a 65yearold oklahoma man who found himself in such a predicament a week before the oklahoma city bombing only after hours of being turned down was he accepted for surgery he died two days later mr mckeown learned that despite the excuses offered by five major area hospitals , none was particularly busy that saturday night , the only lawful reason for rejecting a patient why did they refuse this man \? one explanation advanced was that hospitals lose money on trauma patients , but mr mckeown had already noted that this patient was insured another was that the surgeons on call just did n't feel like going out , but the unavailable doctors prudently decided not to give their explanation or show their faces on dateline despite the fuzziness , the findings prove troubling enough to justify the report in newsmagazine fashion , however , the reporter could not settle for the facts mr mckeown asked is it your understanding that had he been operated on more quickly that his chances of survival might have been better \? the answer he received was , absolutely but it came not from a medical expert but from the man s son , who , it was later revealed , is suing one hospital for 20 million what answer did mr mckeown expect \? and what did it add to the report besides a dollop of emotion \? this sort of stuff is the cholesterol of television journalism aimed at the heart , it clogs the passage to the brain stone phillips , the dateline host , promised at the commercial break that the second half of the report would reveal that many doctors and hospitals may not want to see you such allegations were made , but no hard evidence was forthcoming so the viewer was left with a provocative report that stopped short of wider significance and was marred by heartstringpulling and weakly grounded generalizations seasoned with hype what 'dateline' discovered makes you wonder whose care you can really stake your life on , announced jane pauley , the program s pitchperson in the evening s other story , ms pauley interviewed yekaterina gordeyeva , the olympic gold medal skater , whose partner and husband , sergei grinkov , died of a heart attack in november the gauzy images were accompanied by ms pauley s cooings they were a man and a woman in love the subject was inherently touching the television treatment had the feeling of a commercial for a quickie video for the romantically challenged were many 60 minutes loyalists drawn to the dateline menu \? no , the ratings indicate that there are enough viewers for both sorts of programs , or anyway that the heavy promotion worked nbc , which had n't been doing much at 7 pm on sundays , nearly doubled its audience for the time slot in the overnight ratings , scoring a 106 \( each point represents 531 , 000 homes \) coming an hour after cbs s ncaa coverage , 60 minutes , the enduring yet endangered favorite , rose a bit to a 159 the line that separates one newsmagazine from another is not always bright or wide on a weak outing earlier this month , 60 minutes carried a story by mike wallace about prison rape that seemed to belong on hard copy , and leslie stahl was wasted on a puff piece about bob dole but this sunday showed the sort of professionalism that often distinguishes the oldtimer from the competition the affecting portrait of muhammad ali that led off for 60 minutes was notable for its avoidance of pathos you could imagine the sentimentsqueezing that a less restrained interviewer than ed bradley might have indulged in as the camera showed what parkinson s syndrome has done to the once fasttalking , fastmoving champion the hour was filled out with morley safer s diverting closeup of the marijuana cottage industry that is bringing american growers big money and big sentences and by ms stahl s bemused report on what sounds like an air force coverup of a toxicwaste scandal at a supposedly supersecret base near las vegas , nev like the ncaa finalists , the newsmagazine teams have records they have been doing similar sorts of programs at different journalistic levels for years both mr mckeown s report and the 60 minutes collection were somewhat above standard as exemplified on sunday , 60 minutes generally holds its audience with an interesting mix and a steady tone dateline resorts to more gimmicks of the news magazine trade probably the two programs will settle into serving their own distinct audiences as the season continues , however , and the changeable ratings have their impact on network executives , the question may yet be whether those people around the water cooler will be remarking on how dateline is moving up to the 60 minutes quality of journalism , or vice versa photo jane pauley , left , with yekaterina gordeyeva , olympic gold medalskater , on dateline nbc , now up against 60 minutes on sundays \( steve miller nbc news \)

akademgorodok , russia , june 7 it has been four decades since they carved this gentle haven for scientists from the deep stands of birch and poplar that sweep across the siberian plain it was to be a city like no other in the workers' paradise , a place where the unhindered ideals of socialism would fuel the quest for perfect truth for a while it seemed to work nikita s khrushchev , who created this science city , spared nothing to make certain that the finest soviet minds were freed from the worries of the common man if a researcher needed to fly 3 , 000 miles to moscow , he had only to ask for a ticket expensive new equipment arrived on every train as institutes sprouted among the blooming lilacs , thousands of idealistic men and women rushed to fill them it was the most beautiful time of our lives , said natasha pritvich , an engineer who was 28 in 1962 , when she took a job here in the new institute of hydrodynamics it was like a religion to us then we believed so very deeply in everything we did belief is a word that does not come up much in akademgorodok these days as a center of science , the city still a lovely contrast to grim novosibirsk , 20 miles away is dying nearly half of the scholars have fled in the past five years , many selling their apartments to the only people who can afford them businessmen who drive cars with darkened windows with federal stipends less than a tenth of what they were a decade ago , the staffs of entire institutes have tried to emigrate only 5 percent of the 15 , 000 scientists in the city are younger than 30 now we need something back , said mrs pritvich , who , like many of her colleagues , says she will vote with reluctance for the communist leader , gennadi a zyuganov , in the presidential election on june 16 i am not a fool who thinks the past will be better than the future but mr yeltsin has let them sell our country and i would like it to stop strange as it may seem , this quintessential fortress of intellectual rigor , where the liberal economic policies of perestroika were born , will almost certainly vote heavily for mr zyuganov when the communist leader made a campaign stop here this week and spoke to an overflow crowd , the head of the siberian branch of the russian academy of sciences , valentin koptyug , made sure that loudspeakers were strung on trees along the main street they did n't even do that for solzhenitsyn , said seraphim winslow , a representative of george soros s international science foundation , which has singlehandedly kept much of this town alive over the last five years and he is a god here to walk through the lush spring grass among the once heralded research centers the institutes of genetics and philology and nuclear physics among more than two dozen others is to tread everywhere on the shards of soviet dreams when mikhail s gorbachev , the last soviet leader , launched his perestroika program in 1986 he drew his chief economics adviser , abel aganbegyan , and many of his aides , from the town s economics institute but the market forces they unleashed have had particularly harsh effects here electronics experts sell meat at the local market biologists grow vegetables salaries , for those who still earn them , are rarely paid on time those who are paid pull in about as much as a bus driver investment in research and development , an extraordinary 21 percent of the former soviet union s gross domestic product in 1990 , fell to 15 percent in 1991 , according to the russian government by last year it was less than half of one percent , and national science foundation in washington has estimated that american laboratories spend up to 100 times as much on equipment and supplies as russia does now thousands of people who pledged their lives to the idea of akademgorodok and the soviet union may be liberal enough to despise the worst excesses of communism and educated enough to believe in an open society , but it is not hard to see why so few intend to vote for president boris n yeltsin i have a higher degree in electronics , said anna kravetz , 45 , whose work now consists of punching the prices of the meat she sells into her blooddrenched calculator at the local market i'm not going to say that communism was great it was lies and repression but did i live better then \? well , of course major discoveries are still made here just this winter the institute of catalysis reported an important new approach to using chemical reactions to neutralize the dangers of nuclear waste but this spring , senior staff members met to discuss moving the enterprise to canada coming here was a gift for my parents , said valery bukhtyarov , 36 , the scientific secretary at the institute of catalysis they were given everything and now there is nothing left to give so of course there is bitterness and a feeling of loss who would n't feel bitter \? but mr bukhtyarov takes the long view i am going to support boris yeltsin , he said i do not like him or even respect him when he issued a decree last month calling for more money for science research everyone here laughed for days he has wasted more in chechnya that we could even hope to see but with him there is a little bit of hope without him there will be none at all possibly because this place was supposed to be sealed off from the problems of russian society , the pain and disappointment here is in many ways all the more evident our university is slowly dying , said tanya barchinova , who has a doctorate in the history of science but currently runs a gender studies program here under a grant from the soros foundation ms barchinova , 43 , was raised in this town , which at its peak had 100 , 000 residents \( now down to 80 , 000 \) and some 28 , 000 scientists her father was a professor of biology who was jailed by stalin science has been my life but we grew up in a war complex , she said it may have been a peaceful place , but it was all built on lies it was this foreign thing implanted on the soil of siberia people act surprised that it failed it was false , so it was destined to fail ms barchinova said she would vote for president yeltsin she says she was dismissed from her job at the university teaching philosophy because she was a democrat the department split into factions , the democrats and the communists , she said each wing taught only according to its views when the cuts came , the department head , who is a communist , had to fire people he fired us wistfully , she said i am sorry that people feel the need to support zyuganov in this of all places but i cannot blame them they are desperate and they have been deceived asked if she was afraid of the future , she laughed the future is a long , long time , she said here in russia if you believe in something you must put your life into it i believe in freedom photo dmitri zimlanov , a senior researcher , monitors the timing of an experiment at the institute of catalysis in akademgorodok , russia the city , once a haven for scientists , has suffered since the collapse of communism \( james hill for the new york times \) \( pg 16 \) map of russia highlighting akademgorodok as a center of science and intellectual life , akademgorodok is dying \( pg 16 \)
boston a government agency with a history of abuse is called to account by the courts the government s answer is to immunize the agency from legal challenges to its policies and practices the scenario sounds like one from singapore or some other authoritarian country we know it ca n't happen here but it can , and it will , if an immigration bill now nearing completion in congress is passed and signed by president clinton the immigration measure has dozens of harsh features but its most stunning provision would forbid any court in the united states except the supreme court to enjoin the immigration and naturalization service from continuing a practice that is against the law or the constitution the exception for the supreme court is essentially meaningless it does not have the time or the means to hold the detailed factfinding hearings in which other courts in recent years have found racial discrimination and other kinds of lawlessness on the part of the ins the idea of immunizing a government agency from being called to account in the courts goes against what most americans have thought was the theme of our system government under law to do it for one of the most troubled of all federal agencies , the ins , is a step so extreme that it is hard to believe it is happening but it is republicans in congress have drafted a conference report on immigration bills passed by the house and senate that includes the courtstripping provision their version of the legislation may reach the floor this week public attention has focused on a house amendment that would bar children of illegal immigrants from public schools but other sections of the final compromise already agreed to by republican members would also have drastic consequences gov george pataki and other new york officials have expressed deep concern at provisions of the recently enacted welfare reform law that would make immigrants ineligible for some federal programs the immigration bill , as drafted by the republican conferees , would go farther one provision among too many even to list would make retroactive the welfare bill s restrictions on the use of various public programs by legal immigrants the restrictions would now apply to people lawfully admitted during the last five years for example , a woman who came to the united states legally three years ago , who is pregnant and has been abandoned by her husband , leaving her desperate , could be barred from prenatal care and medicaid an especially harsh section of the bill applies to people who come to this country seeking asylum from persecution president clinton s counterterrorism bill , approved last spring , included a section drastically limiting asylum procedures the senate , when it considered the immigration bill , voted to make that change less harsh the republican conference report sets up a new , stringent procedure a refugee who reaches our shores with false papers or none as has often been the case since jews fled nazi germany would have to persuade an immigration officer that she has a credible fear of persecution if turned down , she could get review by an immigration judge that would have to take place within 24 hours , if possible , but in any case within seven days the review could be by telephone or a video connection the refugee would have no right to a lawyer , even at her own expense and in any event there would hardly be time to get one the ins decision could not be reviewed by any court not only in the drastic asylum provision but in petty matters the bill would turn the screw on immigrants for example , aliens paroled into this country many cubans are in that category would be forbidden after one year to have a driver s license altogether , it is an extraordinarily vindictive piece of legislation the question is why why should congress choose this moment , a time of prosperity , to turn against our traditions and beat up on refugees and lawful immigrants \? perhaps the gingrich republicans in the house , frustrated in their desire to wreck environmental protections , are working their feelings out against a target they think is politically weak but the issue is not really immigration it is our faithfulness to american values of law and fairness
to the editor i am chagrined to see someone as knowledgeable as senator bill bradley suggest amending the constitution in this case , for limits on campaign spending to make it clear that money does not equal free speech \( oped , nov 11 \) amending the constitution has become the dodge of those who lack the courage of direct action and suffers the more important defect of being an almost insurmountable drafting problem what specific language can senator bradley offer that would not also be subject to subsequent court interpretation \? the need for reform seems to center on the growing need for enormous sums for television advertising effect reform simply by cutting off the need at the root the airwaves are subject to regulation all serious candidates for national office should be allowed free , equal television time by government mandate , and none of them should be allowed to run paid political advertising let the money be used for print advertising , direct mail , soapboxes , field workers or whatever else television ads , the engine behind the need , should be off limits john f mc alevey tallman , ny , nov 11 , 1996
in the soup business , passion rules why else would sensible people wait patiently in line for over an hour even in arctic temperatures to pay 10 for 16 ounces of soup to be eaten at cluttered desks , on the curb or on a park bench \? what else would drive a man to work up to 20 hours a day and on weekends , relentlessly inventing new soups and improving old ones , complaining bitterly all the way \? what else would spur on new entrepreneurs who are trying to turn soup kitchens into big businesses , with visions of soup restaurants not only throughout manhattan but also all over the country and even the world \? all this passion for humble , homely soup \? in an unlikely makeover , soup has thrown off its terry cloth robe and has dressed up to take a public bow five manhattan restaurants , up from one just two years ago , are specializing in soup , serving thousands of people at lunch each day two are about to open other outlets around manhattan not to be left behind , delicatessens , coffee bars and health food stores , most of which had quietly dished out soup in the past , are calling attention to their wares , putting up signs and displaying soup kettles the appeal of soup crosses every ethnic and economic line soup ranges from the bottom rung of the social ladder , when doled out as the watery broth of prison movies , to the top , when sipped as delicate consomme flavored perhaps with wild mushrooms or foie gras and costing as much as 22 a portion at daniel , the acclaimed restaurant on the upper east side my love of soup is very big , said daniel boulud , the chef and owner of daniel , where he offers at least five soups each day i grew up on soup every day from soup s current ascendant position , all roads lead back to soup kitchen international , the little storefront on west 55th street that has been drawing huge lines of loyal customers for over 10 years this is the domain of al yeganeh , who painfully bears the stigma of soup nazi , as he was caricatured in a seinfeld episode last fall that parodied the precision of his way of selling soup since then , mr yeganeh s business has boomed more than ever , though he feels he has paid a significant price for his fame , both in the public s perception of him and in distraction from his work it s made my life miserable , he said not so for chris ramani and his partners , who opened soup nutsy on east 46th street last june , openly knocking off mr yeganeh s operation we planned it as soon as we saw the seinfeld' episode , he said business has gone through the roof , mr ramani said , and soup nutsy has new outlets in the works are they considering a siliconvalleystyle public offering \? oh , sure we are , he said we basically want to be the starbucks of soup whatever its hopes , soup nutsy is not without rivals daily soup opened in february on east 41st street , but not , a coowner , peter siegel , insists , because of the seinfeld episode i hear that every day , and i spend a lot of time saying we were n't influenced in any way , mr siegel said i am a passionate soup freak , and have been all my life i was always doing the breaddip thing with soups , and i just woke up one day and said , 'hey , let s do it' daily soup is doing so well that a second outlet is to open soon on 17th street between broadway and fifth avenue , mr siegel said , pausing to chat just before catching a plane to the netherlands to discuss the development of daily soup europe we are aggressively expanding , he said while mr ramani and mr siegel are more businessmen than soup makers , jonathan schnipper , the chef and a coowner of hale and hearty soups , takes a back burner to nobody in his passion for soups it s absolutely a labor of love , he said when it opened in june 1990 on lexington avenue , hale and hearty was a healthoriented food shop and soup was a minor part for a long time , the first thing people used to ask was what kind of soup we had today , mr schnipper said it always seemed to be what people were really interested in so in may 1995 , hale and hearty soups was born that was before the seinfeld' episode , mr schnipper points out , though he concedes the episode did not hurt his business it just brought a ton of soup interest in manhattan , he said people ask us , 'oh , are you the soup nazi \? ' hale and hearty serves 400 to 500 customers a day , not including a large delivery business it is just about to open a soup kiosk in the concourse of the world trade center and two other outlets in manhattan while the influence of the seinfeld episode is debatable , nobody disputes mr yeganeh s influence with minor variations , the soup restaurant formula is his soup served to waiting customers in paper containers , accompanied by bread , fruit , plastic spoon , napkins and perhaps a moist towelette when he looks at the soup landscape , what does he see \? a bunch of idiots trying to cash in everywhere , said mr yeganeh , who is not so much bilious as he is proud of his soups and of his singleminded dedication to soup making i only compete with my own self
trenton , feb 29 a proposal to use a private business operating like a managed care network to handle state child welfare cases has put new jersey at the forefront of a national debate over how best to overhaul the care of abused and neglected children while more than a dozen other states are exploring steps designed to coordinate services better , in some cases by turning parts of their child welfare operations over to private companies , no plan is as broad as the plan supported by a top child welfare official in new jersey under the proposal , which officials of the state division of youth and family services called preliminary , caseworkers would still investigate reports of child abuse and neglect , and would maintain responsibility for the severest abuse cases but they would pass on the bulk of their caseload to a private profitmaking company that would coordinate services like foster care , therapy and adoption in seeking a company to manage thousands of children s cases , new jersey is departing from the usual practice of overseeing and contracting with hundreds of nonprofit agencies to help troubled families under the plan , the state would select a company , through competitive bidding , that would manage the 225 million in contracts it now has with 1 , 300 agencies that arrange services for more than 46 , 000 children under state supervision this is different than other states because of the level of coordination and because it will be coordinated by a private company and not the agency , said patricia balascobarr , director of new jersey s division of youth and family services , who supports the proposal but the most important part is our workers will have more time to do the initial assessments and decide what the child needs the proposal has raised concerns among some child welfare experts while acknowledging that new jersey and other states have often failed to protect children from abuse , some experts expressed doubt that a private business would put children first that s a dangerous way to go , said david s liederman , executive director of the child welfare league of america , a washingtonbased association of public and nonprofit providers of child services i get nervous about contracting with forprofit companies because their goal is to make money but if the goal is to provide appropriate care , with quality being the operative word , then i think you have a chance of developing a program that could be positive in recent months , the federal department of health and human services has received proposals from 14 other states seeking waivers of regulatory requirements so they can experiment with new approaches new jersey officials said their proposal would probably not require a waiver because the state would still oversee how the private company spends money we can turn to someone to implement the plan without giving up authority , ms balascobarr said and we will continue to have monitoring and compliance responsibility new york state is seeking a waiver to use a managed approach for its foster care and adoption assistance programs , but its plan would not involve a private company instead , the state s 62 counties would administer separate plans , the new york department of social services said other states considering managed services or use of private companies include tennessee , west virginia , illinois , massachusetts and north carolina , the department of health and human services said the states are exploring the principles of managed services , in which one group controls financing , negotiates preset payments and serves as a clearinghouse for services in some states , the government agency is proposing to administer its own managed service plan instead of using a private company to do so , as in new jersey but in others , only part of the child welfare system would be turned over to a private company massachusetts is considering that approach for its residential care services no state has received a federal waiver yet new jersey s plan is the brainchild of thomas blatner , who headed the state youth services division from 1982 to 1987 mr blatner , a child welfare consultant , recently formed his own company , the family supervision network , to bid for the state contract if the plan is approved initially , pilot programs would start in 4 of the state s 21 counties state officials said the proposals could go out by this fall and the pilot program could start as early as next january the premise of mr blatner s model is that a private concern like his would make a profit by improving the effectiveness and management of child welfare services many children receive an excessive amount of care , mr blatner said , while others receive less than they need he said he would not cut costs by using lower paid , unskilled workers , a practice that has sometimes occurred when public services were turned over to private companies we will do just the opposite , he said our employees will be more than caseworkers they 'll basically function as caseworkers and family therapists
kansas city , kan it was , at the time , the most expensive campaign kansas had ever seen , and may still rank as the ugliest it began with insinuations of corruption and incompetence , and soon escalated to accusations of slander and sleazy campaigning it featured , quite literally , a round of televised mudslinging and it ended with a lastminute barrage of leaflets distributed anonymously the leaflets featured pictures of discarded fetuses in garbage cans vote dole , they said the year was 1974 and bob dole , a freshman senator , was running for reelection his opponent was a twoterm congressman from topeka , dr william r roy , the only democrat in the state s congressional delegation bob dole won the election , but narrowly , and not before he had watched his political life flash before his eyes i was prepared to lose that race , he said recently in an interview aboard his campaign plane the story of mr dole s victory in 1974 , both his admirers and detractors here and across kansas agree , is a story of tremendous perseverance , in the face of what often seemed insurmountable odds it is also a story of the power of abortion as a political issue in recent weeks , mr dole has been doing everything possible to distance himself from the uncompromising views of the most vocal antiabortion advocates he has said abortion will not determine his choice of a running mate , nor is it an issue , he has suggested , that should decide how voters act in the polling booth abortion is , he maintains , a moral issue , and as such should not divide people of good will yet it is precisely the political passions that abortion generates that may have saved mr dole s career the 1974 campaign , many argue , turned on the issue , and it was mr dole who insisted on its relevance indeed , as recently as the presidential primaries , when he was wooing social conservatives , mr dole was taking credit for giving abortion precisely the sort of prominence that is now threatening to divide republicans and weaken his candidacy and he pointed to his bitterly fought campaign in 1974 , just one year after roe v wade , as the race that introduced the issue to national politics go back and look at the record , he told a meeting of the christian coalition in south carolina shortly before that state s crucial primary in march and you 'll find that when abortion first became a national issue was at my reelection in 1974 facing a dilemma scandal of watergate hurts reelection bid at the start of the 1974 campaign , no one was paying much attention to abortion as a former highranking aide to mr dole recalled , i do n't think anyone had any idea that abortion was going to be the huge issue it turned out to be indeed , some aides to mr dole say that his own position on the subject did not seem to them , at first , especially well formed he gave no sign , they say , that he thought of himself as a strong opponent of abortion it was not a major point of conviction for him , noted another longtime adviser , who like several others interviewed spoke only on the condition of anonymity it s just that it turned out to be a significant point of vulnerability for his opponent certainly , mr dole seemed to need all the help he could get that year the watergate scandal had been building all summer , culminating in president richard m nixon s resignation on aug 9 , just three months before election day even in staunchly republican kansas , republicans were running scared mr dole especially had cause for concern he had been party chairman at the time of the watergate breakin , had initially defended mr nixon in its aftermath and had , throughout his career in the senate , championed the president s policies he could not distance himself from the former president without seeming to appear disloyal , or disingenuous , or both mr dole himself conceded how hard it was for him to find a safe place to stand it s an impossible dilemma , he told the new york times that summer one guy gives me hell for betraying nixon , the next comes up to me and says , 'i'm for you bob , but you 've got to get nixon off your back' kansas democrats made the most of his difficult situation , noting that even if mr dole were not involved in the breakin or the coverup , the scandal still reflected badly on his skills as a leader as republican party chairman , they argued , he ought to have known we had him in a dilemma , recalled norbert dreiling , a former chairman of the kansas democratic party who advised the roy campaign if he was that important , he needed to be accountable and if he could n't run the republican party , then he should n't run for the senate though they never explicitly mentioned watergate , dr roy s advertisements were clear in their allusions a kansas senator who put loyalty to nixon and his party ahead of loyalty to his state , is how one roy television commercial described mr dole a respected voice for kansas , was , meanwhile , how the advertisements described dr roy
port chester summer school has usually carried a faint punitive aroma while their peers are indulging in leisurely activities like swimming at the beach or relaxing in the backyard , those students whose lackluster academic performance during the school year required them to catch up on course work during summer vacation must do time in classrooms , relegated to the monotony of work sheets and relentless quizzes not so at the regional summer middle school , situated in the port chester middle school here , where 64 pupils in fifth through eighth grades are studying five of these students are doing an enrichment summer course this program , which is in its first year , is a joint venture between the port chester school district and the southern westchester board of cooperative educational services although the majority of pupils came from the port chester school system , which this year initiated a policy that pupils could not be promoted if they failed two major subjects , other participants came from rye , new rochelle and harrison or from parochial schools outofdistrict pupils paid a fee of 240 a course the session ran from june 26 through aug 1 and offered morning classes in english , mathematics , social studies and science pupils took up to two courses , depending on which subjects they had not passed during the school year most remedial programs beat in kids' brains , said alan kramer , the supervisor of gifted and talented and summer programs at southern westchester board of cooperative educational services we work with kids on core concepts if a kid has failed english , he s missing all kinds of things you ca n't repeat a year s work in 21 days we give them a real grounding in core skills , so that the students are more prepared next september the seventheighthgrade english class is reading albert camus s 'the stranger' the idea here is 'let s take them to the next level , not the past level' pupils in a social studies class , for example , eschewed textbooks and took part in debates and mock trials and applied geography skills to map out a tour for a rock band in a science class , pupils with little more than plastic bags , straws , flat wooden sticks and construction paper tried to design a container to keep a raw egg from turning into scrambled eggs in the infamous eggdrop experiment and in a mathematics class , students were engrossed in estimating the cost of siding for a building it does n't look like remedial work , mr kramer said in the math class , they 're given realworld problems for authentic learning when there are work sheets , they come out of the needs of students to handle a skill area classes are deliberately kept small \( some have as few as three students , while none is larger than a dozen \) , and teachers are encouraged to arrange the classroom space in semicircles or other groupings to get away from the more conventional rows of desks most of the students are seated in circles , said phyllis conlin , coordinator of the regional summer middle school it s another way for them to view teaching and learning for 14yearold sonya diaz , who took social studies and science , the small classes were important i'm learning more , she said there were too many people in my regular class i could n't concentrate mr kramer said many of these kids are used to hiding in the back of the room here they become participants they ca n't hide nor are pupils assigned letter grades credit depended , in part , on attending class and teacher evaluation of a portfolio of work students could not miss more than three hours of a course there s a whole body of work that follows the student , mr kramer said we want their teachers to stop looking at johnny jones as the kid who flunked math last year for many of the pupils , academic failure had less to do with their abilities than with their attitude some students who are very bright had no motivation during the year , ms conlin said to help them improve their attitude toward school , the program also offered counseling and support services through a program called start today and reach for tomorrow , a collaborative project of the port chester middle school and the guidance center , a communitybased agency in new rochelle such guidance and support services are unusual for a remedial summer program sometimes a youngster is not feeling confident , and we work with him , said marcy viboch , director of start today and reach for tomorrow at the port chester middle school we 're like a home base for some of these youngsters , who drop in informally before and after class just to chat with our counselors we 're a source of comfort and friendliness for some of the students , the program s nurturing atmosphere removes some of the problems they associated with school it s fun because they teach us different from regular school , said patty bridge , 13 , who took mathematics and science in regular school , the teachers were n't teaching they were catching an attitude , so we 'd catch an attitude yve valentin , 13 and in the same classes , said here the teachers do n't get on our case they like us kids it s more interesting teachers are particularly aware of their students' needs in this program i do the same type of teaching i do during the year , said michele weyant , who teaches english at pelham middle school here , it s just more one on one i try to keep them involved the teacherstudent relationship is better we have smaller classes , because these students need more personalized attention her colleague , deirdre macneill , a social studies teacher from the harrison middle school , added we want to improve their skills we want them to experience a little success
for the soprano harolyn blackwell , typecasting has become a burden as well as a blessing thanks to her agile coloratura , diminutive stature and girlish charm , ms blackwell , who admits only to being in her 30 s , is the perfect soubrette in operatic tradition , a vivacious , shrewd young woman who , though a servant , outsmarts the aristocrats \( think of despina in mozart s cosi fan tutte \) yet she yearns to move on to weightier , more dramatic roles and this is only one of the difficulties ms blackwell faces at the moment because she began her career in the theater , and continues to move back and forth between the metropolitan opera and broadway , she has been dubbed a crossover artist , a label that renders her suspect in the opera world s more conservative wing what s more , she gained fame under trying circumstances in february 1994 , on short notice , she stepped into the starring role in the met s production of donizetti s fille du regiment ms blackwell replaced none other than kathleen battle , the temperamental diva the met had just fired for unprofessional behavior since then , ms blackwell has found her name awkwardly linked with ms battle s even ms blackwell s coming engagements suggest a career in transition on tuesday evening , she will appear at carnegie hall with the orchestra of st luke s , led by andre previn she will sing mr previn s honey and rue , a song cycle written for ms battle , who gave its premiere and has recorded it next march , ms blackwell will return to broadway for a lavish revival of leonard bernstein s candide , directed by hal prince cast as cunegonde , she must negotiate the giddy heights of glitter and be gay five times a week without ruining her voice and candide , itself lodged in a noman s land between opera and musical comedy , will hardly strengthen her reputation in the opera world as she struggles to shatter the soubrette mold a native of washington , where she still lives much of the year , ms blackwell grew up performing in musical comedies , which required that she sing , act and dance she never saw an opera until she was 17 , she revealed during a recent lunch in soho my first impression and this was 'lucia di lammermoor , ' of all pieces was of beautiful singing that moved me to tears , she said it just spoke to me something inside me gasped and said , 'this is heaven' at catholic university in washington , she began an operatic training but was still attracted to musical comedy i was able to sing , i was able to act , i was able to move on stage , and so i was drawn to musical theater , she said but i had a voice that was too operatic for certain musicals destiny intervened in 1979 , while preparing a recital program for her master s degree , she dashed to new york to audition for a broadway revival of west side story she was hired , and for the next twoandahalf years she toured with the show , gaining skills no operatic training could have provided i learned about characterization , how you went about becoming that person , she said i learned stamina , how to do eight shows a week and i learned to make the stage my home , where i felt 100 percent comfortable but after hundreds of performances of somewhere , she was frustrated i realized , i 've trained for years as an opera singer , and i'm not being one , she explained at least i deserve to explore this avenue what do i have to lose \? for a year she participated in the apprenticeship program of the chicago lyric opera , where she slid into the soubrette niche although her dramatic skills were superb , she realized that she still lacked the vocal technique needed for opera so she returned to new york and resumed her study until , in 1983 , she felt ready to audition at the metropolitan opera when she walked onto the met stage , she noticed that it was crammed with sets for a performance of johann strauss s fledermaus that evening without thinking about it , i saw all this furniture around me and knew i could use it , she said so instead of just coming out there and standing and singing , like a normal person , i sat down on the chaise and acted as if i were despina that s the theater training so began her gradual ascent through the ranks of the met in 1994 she was cast as marie in la fille du regiment , a leading role and a cautious step beyond the soubrette she would act as ms battle s cover for the first five performances and sing the last two herself then , a week before opening night , the met dismissed ms battle and asked ms blackwell to sing all seven performances the week started out dreadfully , said shirley emmons , ms blackwell s voice teacher miss battle had requested that no covers or second cast be allowed into rehearsals so at the time miss battle was terminated , harolyn had n't gone to rehearsals she had n't watched the show and then , because she suddenly had to rehearse full out all the time , she got sick , and on opening night her doctor would only allow her to sing in head voice so the reviews intimated that her voice was n't big enough ms battle did not respond to requests for comment and on the subject of ms battle , the normally bubbly ms blackwell turned reticent you never want to be put in a situation where you have to replace someone , she said it was n't easy for either of us , but she supported me and gave me the strength to go on during that week
last october , randy johnson and david cone watched each other commit sport s most unnatural act throwing a baseball from 60 feet 6 inches they have great respect for how the other man suffered we 've both been humbled this year , cone said in the fifth and final game of the most exciting series in baseball s expanded postseason , johnson and cone both pushed their arms and their backs and their legs far beyond any conceivable comfort zone 'be a man suck it up , ' johnson said , parodying the internal pressures that any major leaguer hears he and cone are discovering there must be limits in that final game , johnson cranked up his aching left arm for six strikeouts in three innings of relief cone kept torturing his right arm 147 pitches' worth until he walked doug strange in the eighth inning , allowing seattle to tie the score , and ultimately win the series and look what happened to him he s got an aneurysm in his shoulder , johnson was saying friday night johnson is trying to come back with a bulging disk in his back he has pitched two innings in the minors and nine innings of relief for the mariners and there were rumors johnson might start tomorrow night but friday night , johnson said his back felt a little achy and maybe it s telling me i'm not ready to start yet he will not start in new york , and possibly , not for the rest of the regular season cone is recovering from surgery for that aneurysm both of them can only assume their injuries are connected to last october s heroics the seattle lefty and the yankee righty know their teams are counting on them , but they have to fight the temptation to be a hero just because they were in that position a year ago you 've got to be honest and not jeopardize yourself , cone was saying cone is preparing to go to the minors for two or three rehabilitative starts before returning to the yankees in september he was buoyed by the 55 pitches he threw to teammates on friday , pronouncing the blisters on his feet and the calluses on his right hand as normal , like spring training the compact cone and the gangly johnson both mean a lot to their teams the mariners won 27 and lost 3 in the games johnson started last season while cone was a leader the day he walked into the yankee clubhouse but there is a difference , lou piniella was saying the yankees have dwight gooden , and he s been a no 1 pitcher they have jimmy key , and he s been a no 1 they have kenny rogers , and he s been a no 1 and they have andy pettitte , and he s pitching like a no 1 johnson is the only big unit the mariners have , although he will have none of the comparisons with sandy koufax , who pitched brilliantly for the dodgers despite fear of arthritis , and bob gibson , who geared up his weary arm to save a pennant for the cardinals in 1964 now there is pressure on johnson and cone not necessarily from managers or general managers or teammates or fans , but internal pressure from the memory and the courage of great competitors you ca n't rush things , johnson was saying the situation is , i was out three months with a bad back anybody who thinks i'm ready to go nine just does n't understand i'm not rushing , and i'm not being rushed i ca n't be a hero , even if i wanted to be last year i pitched with pain , but to perform at the level coney and others do , you ca n't do it forever johnson hears that the yankees are projecting cone s starts right up to the first game of the playoffs they should n't be doing that , johnson said to say he 'll pitch game 1 of the world series and game 7 , that s not fair to him people have high expectations the reality is , i 've pitched nine innings since april and i 've still got a bulging disk in my back cone said his frightening injury makes you appreciate things more , watching your arm deteriorate both randy and i were power pitchers and we woke up one morning and we could n't do those things reality sets in reality says cone and johnson pitched in one of the great postseason games reality also says that is how cone and johnson got this way photos randy johnson , \( reuters \) david cone \( associated press \)
arlington , tex , july 31 keenly aware that they were susceptible to lefthanded pitchers , the yankees made a bold move just hours before the trading deadline tonight when they acquired the slugger cecil fielder from the detroit tigers for the disgruntled ruben sierra , the elite pitching prospect matt drews and cash considerations of between 500 , 000 and 1 million right at the deadline , the yankees added a possible fifth starter to their rotation by obtaining david weathers from the florida marlins for mark hutton in a swap of 26yearold righthanders weathers , who has been on the trading block for months and was not in florida s rotation , might start in hutton s place thursday against texas before losing to the rangers , 92 , tonight , the yankees talked about obtaining a backup shortstop or a lefthanded reliever , but they surprised even their own players when they revealed that the righthanded hitting fielder would be injected into an already potent lineup fielder , who has 276 career homers , will be the designated hitter with the defensively suspect darryl strawberry becoming the regular left fielder fly balls could become adventures this is weird , but i'm going to work for the yankees , said fielder , who deferred 2 million of his 72 million salary in 1997 to clinch the deal i'm going to enjoy myself this feels great i'm relaxed and i want to help the team this is an opportunity for me to finally get in the hunt the fielder trade is curious with the yankees leading the baltimore orioles by 10 games in the american league east and having the finest record in the entire al could they be tinkering with their winning chemistry \? team officials , though , felt uncomfortable thinking about the postseason and the possibility of facing a succession of lefties so they did something the rangers' darren oliver tamed the yankees tonight to decrease their record against lefthanders to 1516 that s a big righthanded bat , manager joe torre said all the questions have been about lefthanded pitching , lefthanded pitching this should neutralize things to really better our lineup i think we needed the extra righthanded bat , strawberry said we needed someone with power that was hurting us we got better having cecil in the middle of the lineup will be ideal for us cecil can only help us , tino martinez added he s coming from a lastplace team to a firstplace team he s going to want to contribute and fit in the disgruntled sierra , who had accused torre of lying to him about playing time earlier this season and who was reluctant to alter his hitting style as he slumped , was emotional as he left the ball park nothing surprises me , said sierra , who was hitting 258 with 11 homers and 52 runs batted in i 've been in this league for 10 years , so none of this surprises me but this is hard , man this team could go to the world series this is hard torre said of sierra , he tried , but he just was n't the home run threat we needed while torre expects fielder to bring a booming bat , the prospect of having strawberry in left field could be frightening i'm looking forward to getting back out there , strawberry said we think he can handle it , said torre , who might have been crossing his fingers under his desk the 6foot3inch fielder , listed at 250 pounds but most likely closer to about 270 , was an institution in detroit he had a cellular phone pressed against his ear in the clubhouse tonight while the tigers were playing visiting california fielder is hitting 248 with 26 homers and 80 rbi this year i'm shocked that i'm going to the yankees , fielder said i did n't think it would be the yankees that s a good place i'm happy to be getting this opportunity the yankees will pay fielder 2 , 360 , 655 for the rest of 1996 and 52 million in 1997 with 2 million deferred the tigers will pay sierra 1 , 639 , 344 this year and 55 million in 1997 , so fielder s arrival and agreement to defer the cash means new york s payroll will be slightly higher after his addition to the roster if the yankees traded the 32yearold fielder even up for the 30yearold sierra , the trade would have been more bearable but parting with the 21yearold drews , their no 1 draft choice in 1993 and top pitching prospect , could eventually haunt them drews struggled this season with a combined record of 110 and a 600 earned run average at class aaa columbus , class a tampa and class aa norwich the 68 righthander had seemingly calmed down at norwich with a 13 record and 250 era i do n't know about giving up matt drews , kenny rogers said we 'll see but torre said any time you can help yourself , i think you have to do it i think cecil fielder brings a lot to this club earlier this month , hutton \( 02 , 504 era \) said he did not want to be traded because he has been with the yankees for his entire career but the australian who pitched capably in his only two starts is not as experienced as weathers , who is 22 with a 454 era in 31 games for the marlins weathers has not started since july 7 , but he has 53 career starts as opposed to 5 for hutton sierra , who joined the yankees last july 28 , had moist eyes as his brief and stormy stint with new york ended he shook his head about leaving a team that is preparing for a world series without him this is n't over for me , sierra said i got more baseball left in me i'm not done
miami , aug 10 carlos baerga thought he was the heart and soul of the cleveland indians , an inspirational leader loved by his fans and his team or at least that s what he thought until july 29 , when he was traded to the mets being traded when the indians had a sevengame lead in the american league central and the mets trailed by 16 games in the national league east was numbing enough but the real hurt would come over the following days , as the indians said that baerga had reported to spring training 2025 pounds overweight and as unnamed members of indians management were quoted as criticizing his skills and questioning his work ethic and priorities was it a smear campaign designed to defend the trade \? or is baerga really washed up at 27 , as the indians have suggested \? anybody can say anything they want about you , baerga said thursday when the mets arrived here for a fourgame series with the florida marlins but the only person that can let you down is yourself and that s not going to happen i'm going to prove to the people that i can play it has been nearly two weeks since baerga and alvaro espinoza came to the mets for jeff kent and jose vizcaino , and baerga said he still experiences stages of disbelief he thought he would be an indian for the rest of his career , certainly at least until his contract ran out in 1999 it was like a family over there , he said i do n't know why they needed to fix something that was n't broken there is no debate that baerga was laboring through a difficult season after hitting 310 and averaging 17 homers and 92 runs batted in from 1991 through 1995 , baerga was batting 267 at the time of the trade , his lowest average in six years as a starter his 10 home runs and 55 rbi were low in a season when power numbers are up throughout the major leagues , and were taken as a sign he could no longer hit for power as well as average he had been dropped from the no 3 spot in the batting order to sixth because he was hitting 242 with runners in scoring position his problems at the plate seemed to magnify his defensive liabilities never a wiz with the glove at second base , baerga had committed 15 errors and , in the indians' eyes , was not getting to the ground balls he once did there were whispers that some cleveland pitchers were annoyed that his range had deteriorated to the point that every routine grounder was an adventure in the end , the indians concluded that despite his relative youth , he was on the downside of his career we felt we were limited at second base , cleveland general manager john hart said the day of the trade the big offensive numbers we 're used to getting from carlos baerga were not there and he was struggling defensively we made a decision on what would make the club better , hart added we knew it would be controversial but with our offensive capabilities , we felt to win big games late in the season we have to play better defense baerga acknowledges the problems he has had this season , blaming his decline in production on a left wrist that was still sore as a result of a collision with yankees outfielder bernie williams last season more recently , baerga has been bothered by a pulled abdominal muscle that caused him to miss seven starts with the mets in the first two games here , which the mets and marlins split , baerga started at first base to put less strain on the muscle tonight , in the mets' 96 loss to the marlins , baerga started at first again and went 1 for 3 with two runs batted in over all , it s just been a bad season , baerga said but that s all it is one bad season indians pitcher dennis martinez defends baerga , saying the indians' attitude toward him was indifferent as early as spring training ever since the first day of spring training , all i heard was that he was overweight , martinez said they went out of their way to make life miserable for him he ca n't play like that you ca n't play under that kind of pressure baerga admits he likes to come into camp with extra weight and work himself into condition but he insists he weighed 215 when the season started , not the 230 that was reported , and is at 207 now he views such attacks as damage control by the indians i do n't know why they keep going with this , he said i think they just have to come up with something because the fans were really against it espinoza agreed they 're looking for excuses they know they should n't have traded carlos everybody knows it baerga believes he first fell into disfavor with the indians during the off season , when he refused to move to third base when cleveland was interested in signing the freeagent second baseman roberto alomar that s when it all started , baerga said none of the rumors , however , scared the mets general manager joe mcilvaine said that when baerga was first offered two days before the trade was made , he called three people familiar with the indians to get the scoop we went to anybody we knew who had inside information on cleveland and put our heads together , mcilvaine said when we made the trade we were satisfied if we had n't been , we would n't have made the trade everybody has pluses and minuses there is no perfect player out there no matter who you 're after mcilvaine calls the acquisition of baerga a longterm deal , and remains confident that once he is healthy baerga will be the player he has been over the previous five seasons , when he was a threetime allstar he has already agreed to play third regularly when his muscle pull heals you 're not going to get a guy when he s at the peak of his game unless you 're going to pay a king s ransom , mcilvaine said when you look for an opportunity , you look for a player who is having an off year or struggling a little bit that s when a team might be inclined to trade a guy when you look at his record over the last four or five years it s stellar he s only 27 years old he s the youngest player in the trade that s enough reason right there mcilvaine invoked 1983 , when the cardinals called the mets and gave them 24 hours to decide whether they wanted to trade for keith hernandez this was much the same way , mcilvaine said it was one of those deadline deals where you had a day or two to make up your mind on whether you wanted to do something when opportunity knocks you can either ignore it or go for it so we went for it the mets have high hopes for baerga , comparing him to hernandez for the type of leadership they hope he will bring to a young team that is in need of it once he knows the league , he could be the takecharge player we have n't had in the infield since hernandez , the mets coach mike cubbage said while this season may be a wash for baerga , he s confident the indians , and not the mets , will regret the trade i want to prove to the people that i still can play , that i still can have fun on the field and have fun with the players , baerga said i want to be the same player that i used to be the last few years photo carlos baerga , right , has had a tough season the indians see it as a trend the mets hope he becomes a leader \( associated press for the new york times \)

little rock , ark , aug 2 in the end , say the jurors in the latest case brought by the whitewater independent counsel s office , they voted to acquit two arkansas bankers of four felony counts because neal t ainley , the government s main witness , had appeared evasive during his testimony he never looked at us , one juror , mary m zinamon , recalled in an interview after the verdicts were returned on thursday he only kept looking at the government s table , like he was saying to them , 'tell me what to say' betty i sweeden , another of the jurors , said all of them had doubted mr ainley one of the few things they had been able to agree on we just did n't believe him , mrs sweeden said we felt that he was already in trouble and he said what he said because he was just trying to save himself in three days on the witness stand , mr ainley , former president of the perry county bank , had accused the defendants , the bank s owners , of instructing him to conceal from the government large cash withdrawals made by bill clinton s 1990 campaign for governor of arkansas mr ainley also said he and the owners , herby branscum jr and robert m hill , had taken bank money to reimburse themselves for their contributions to the campaigns of mr clinton and others but after five days of sifting the evidence , the jury announced acquittal on four of the counts with which mr branscum and mr hill had been charged , including conspiracy to conceal the campaign s cash withdrawals on seven other counts including a second conspiracy charge , on the reimbursements some of the jurors deemed other evidence sufficiently strong to outweigh mr ainley s lack of credibility and warrant a conviction the panel reached an impasse on these counts , prompting the court to declare a mistrial on them the prosecutors say they are considering whether to retry the bankers on the unresolved counts the jurors who were interviewed afterward described the frustration of days of hollering at one another , their deep confusion about the law on conspiracy and their ultimate consensus on only a few of the issues before them at first , it was just six pigheaded people on one side and six pigheaded people on the other , said mrs zinamon , 41 , a management representative for a telephone company it got real tense we were really tired , and there were days when everyone was yelling and nobody was listening at one point , i looked to one other person and said , 'if i say it s yellow , you 're going to say it s blue' the intensity of their disagreements surprised mrs zinamon and the other jurors , who had appeared to be bonding during the six weeks of trial testimony after rick degroat jr , a 35yearold yard foreman for an auto salvage company , told the others that he had become a grandfather , they sported large pink buttons that said , it s a girl during breaks in the proceedings , many of them could be seen smoking and chatting on a courthouse stoop , or sitting around a pickup truck in front of the building listening to country music on the radio but late on thursday of last week , when they were locked inside the jury room with a stack of exhibits to begin their deliberations , it quickly became clear that a consensus could prove elusive the first sign of trouble came with their initial decision selecting a leader three of them vied to become foreman , and , mrs zinamon said , the vote split 432 ultimately the jurors settled on alice fields , 55 , inventory manager of a grain company but mrs fields was so unassuming that on tuesday she refused to sign a note asking the judge for guidance to resolve a deadlock mrs fields , who did not return several telephone messages left for her today and on thursday , told her colleagues that she would not put her name on the note because she feared that it would be published in the local papers in the end , two other jurors signed in her stead at that point in the deliberations , the jurors had reached an agreement on two of the counts , but their decision on one of them did not last long according to mrs zinamon , they agreed on monday to acquit the defendants of both conspiracy counts but some of them then realized that they had misunderstood the judge s instructions on conspiracy , and by wednesday they had deadlocked on the first conspiracy count , involving contribution reimbursements most of the jurors appeared unimpressed with the videotaped testimony of president clinton , called as a witness by the defense mr degroat said he would have liked to see the president testify in person , but others said the testimony had been irrelevant to their deliberations we thought it was a waste of time , mrs zinamon said several also said they had not believed the testimony of bruce r lindsey , deputy white house counsel , whom the prosecution designated an unindicted coconspirator the prosecutors said mr lindsey , as treasurer of the 1990 campaign , had instructed mr ainley to conceal the cash withdrawals from the government mr lindsey said he had been trying to hide the withdrawals only from political opponents , not from the government , and had not violated any laws of mr lindsey s performance as a witness , mrs zinamon said it was the same as ainley s i did n't believe a thing he was saying lindsey s testimony just did n't make sense mrs sweeden , a 59yearold retired federal poultry inspector , said none of the jurors had believed mr lindsey , and wesley n camp , 29 , the president of a small company that makes livestock trailers , said he believed that mr lindsey had actually conspired with mr ainley to conceal the cash withdrawals still , mrs zinamon said she thought that while mr lindsey might have acted improperly , he had not acted criminally even after their work was over , there remained some disagreement among the jurors about what had occurred mrs zinamon said there had been only two or three holdouts who wanted to convict the defendants on the remaining counts two other jurors said the vote had been closer to 6040 in favor of acquittal as for the counts on which they would reach agreement in the end , the jurors started hesitating , mrs

and worst of all , the families say , are the televised replays of the explosion itself on any given moment , on any given day , i can turn on the television and see my brother and the shuttle crew die , said eric mcnair , 41 , the astronaut s youngest brother , who will speak at this year s candlelight ceremony in lake city it s hard to get past this thing when you 've got to see that over and over again it is something none of them can forget , a moment frozen in memory the gleaming shuttle poised for flight , the icicles hanging from the ship , the bitter chill that seeped through even the warmest coats , the nerveracking countdown , and finally , the glorious liftoff it went up so beautiful , remembered bruce jarvis , now 78 , the astronaut s father , who stood in the bleachers at cape canaveral cheering as it flew seventythree seconds later , the shuttle exploded that s not right , mr smith s wife , jane , told her three children as they watched the two rockets attached to the ship separate and the shuttle disappear when her 17yearold son looked at her in confusion , she burst into tears and told him they 're lost overwhelmed with grief , carl mcnair , another brother of the astronaut ronald mcnair , closed his oncethriving computer consulting business in atlanta because he could not focus on his work erin smith , who was 8 when her father died , fell behind in her school in houston and mrs corrigan , who has managed to deliver hundreds of speeches about her daughter without breaking down , once confessed to her husband , i think one day i'm going to explode today , the families find comfort in the dozens of memorials that have sprung up around the country in framingham , mass , where mrs mcauliffe led her parish softball team to the 1964 championship , a science center now carries her name in beaufort , nc , where mr smith learned to fly airplanes before he could drive , the local meteorologist reads the weather from the michael j smith airport and here in lake city , a landlocked farming town where mr mcnair picked cotton and tobacco as a boy , there is a ronald mcnair junior high school , a ronald mcnair memorial , and a ronald mcnair boulevard , which runs near the cemetery where he is buried his brother eric and his aunt lela visit the grave every week , and speak of the local news , the scholarships given in his honor and the family happenings in some ways , eric mcnair has come closer to his mother s way of thinking over the years there are no dead here , he said , just family and friends who have passed to the other side some people die and some people do n't , said mr mcnair , who with his brother , carl , runs the ronald mcnair foundation , a nonprofit foundation that exposes children to the sciences the people that live are the people in the hearts and minds of others the best of the best was in that shuttle ten years later , we 're still telling their stories we still remember and they still live photo grace corrigan gives speeches about her daughter , christamcauliffe \( rick friedman for the new york times \)
lake buena vista , fla , oct 19 the folks at disney world are used to long lines good thing they have them this weekend , and they are not snaking around space mountain they are forming at the top of the leader board for the walt disney world oldsmobile classic and at the gates leading to the magnolia course where , suddenly , golf has become the main magic kingdom attraction the grandstands were full , the galleries were huge and the golf was great four players taylor smith , lennie clements , jay haas and rick fehr were tied for the lead at 16under par after today s third round five players were chasing them at 15 under tiger woods , payne stewart , mike sullivan , ronnie black and joel edwards and there was enough electricity in the air to light up orlando most of the mania is , of course , traceable to woods , the 20yearold phenom for whom we are running out of superlatives remember the beatles at shea stadium in '66 \? this is the golf version even some veteran players are amazed by what they are seeing when he first came out everybody was saying , 'let s see what he can do , ' said haas , 42 , whose 68 late in the day at the palm course put him where he is well , he s shown us i do n't think there s any question he s been the best player on our tour the last month he s nearly won four tournaments already everybody s been waiting for the next jack nicklaus to come along perhaps he s here perhaps he is woods is on the verge of his fifth consecutive topfive finish , something that has not been done on tour since curtis strange did it in 1982 at the age of 27 woods s second victory in three weeks is a distinct possibility of his 26 professional rounds , 20 have been in the 60 s , including 10 of his last 11 his stroke average of 6929 coming into the week was the best in golf , and it is very likely that he will be among the top 30 money winners in the game and earn a spot at the seasonending tour championship next week even to those who predicted greatness for woods , this extremely high level of play has come as something of a surprise but not to woods , who shrugged when he was asked about whether his results coincided with his expectations i really did n't think about it , he said after today s round of 69 i knew i 'd win one of the seven tournaments , but that s about it i did n't know i 'd play this well for this many events on a sunny , breezy and cool day at disney , woods shot his highest round of the tournament in front of the largest saturday crowd in the history of the event it was a difficult putting day he threeputted the 18th hole from 12 feet , missing a 3footer for par but he struck the ball as well as he has all week at the 614yard eighth hole , he reached the front of the green with a 3wood from 279 yards he eagled the 526yard 10th when he reached it with a 5iron at the 595yard 14th , he launched a 3wood from 284 yards , over water , over the green and into the back bunker he was over that green in two \? stewart asked , incredulously , shaking his head see , now , i ca n't relate to that that comes from a man who has won nine tournaments , including two major championships , and who set the course record of 61 on the magnolia course four years ago stewart , who needs a victory here to get into the tour championship , might not be able to relate he played the same hole with a driver , 3iron and sand wedge but he will have the opportunity to compete with woods head to head on sunday , since they are paired together oh , boy , stewart said that should be interesting it should the whole shooting match should be interesting none of these players is likely to roll over and play dead for woods each in his way has plenty of motivation clements is looking for his first victory in 396 events as a pro smith is in his fourth season looking for his first victory fehr has won here before , in 1994 , though not since edwards , sullivan and black are journeymen pros capable of pulling off an upset an upset \? amazingly , that is what it has come to in two months as a professional , woods has become the favorite to win every time he tees it up this has not happened since , well , since nicklaus arrived back in 1962 woods is a man for whom par5 s do not exist on the 12 par5 holes so far this week , he is 13under par this was what nicklaus did in his prime , overpower and intimidate , not necessarily in that order for nicklaus , anything less than a victory was unsatisfying woods is the same way what seemed the height of arrogance when he began i think i can win every time i play , he once said has become a matter of fact at the very highest level of play that s the way jack was , haas said everybody used to think that if they could beat jack , they 'd win now i'm thinking , 'if i can just stay ahead of tiger , that might be the number to shoot' that is what they are standing in line to see now at disney no animatronics here this is the real deal
making 'hype' in hype , a new documentary about the seattle rock scene , the city s bestknown band , nirvana , is n't even mentioned for the first 35 minutes instead , the film opens with performances by two obscure bands from the pacific northwest , crackerbash and the mono men it was because of their interest in seattle s lesserknown heroes that doug pray , a firsttime director , and steve helvey , a firsttime producer , persuaded bigger stars like eddie vedder of pearl jam , kim thayil of soundgarden and mark arm of mudhoney to grant interviews to two outsiders from california over dinner in the east village recently , the film s two creators made an analogy between seattle s rock scene and a castle with the sign stay away posted over the drawbridge they said they gained entrance by waiting outside the castle for so long that they almost forgot why they wanted to be inside in the first place when mr pray , who had previously directed videos for the young fresh fellows , a seattle band , started traveling to that city to work on the film , he slipped into the local pace , in which little work is talked about and even less gets done it was a period of hanging out in bars , going to shows and being completely broke when he actually got around to conducting interviews , mr pray said he was so nervous that he hardly gave the musicians room to speak after one such interview , with members of mudhoney , it took the pair six months to get the film back from the lab because they had no money in the end , a frustrated financial backer prodded them to finish , promising to give them whatever they needed if they 'd only complete the film they are still in debt , but all that extra time spent in seattle slowly turned them from newcomers into insiders the product is a humorous , fastmoving chronology of seattle music , mixing performances and interviews with bemused and cynical stalwarts to trace a path from the purity of a handful of local punk bands playing in a vacuum in the mid1980 s to the exploitation of the grunge explosion in the early 90 s though the film ends with the suicide of kurt cobain , it unwittingly gives a glimpse of seattle s future when dave dederer of the city s latest success story , the presidents of the united states of america , can be spotted in the crowd dancing at a fastbacks concert the story is told from the point of view of entrenched scene makers , which means that many of the darker episodes of grunge history overdoses , abductions , infighting are ignored or glossed over hype is at sony village \( 66 third avenue , at 11th street , in manhattan \) tupac shakur , dead or not \?

this month is a threeyear anniversary for paula doremus , one consumed by regret for the past , uneasiness for the future in the three years of their separation , mrs doremus and her husband , jack , have grown more distant and cold , as each has tried to forestall the expensive process of recrimination that each year consumes the lives and often fortunes of about 50 , 000 new jerseyans , a process seemingly nobody in this state slips through without a long , deep wound divorce it s a catandmouse game right now , a waiting game , said mrs doremus , 46 , a cardiac technician from vernon she fears her husband will fail to make mortgage payments on the family home , where she still lives i look in the local paper every week to make sure that it s not about to be sold on the sheriff s block , she said in the meantime , he waits to see if i am about to take him to court , and i wait to see if he s about to take me neither one of us can afford the lawyers so i feel pretty lucky we 've been able to avoid the process this waiting game a prolonged , formless and painful separation with little immediate prospect of resolution may seem unusual , but it has at least one advantage so far , the doremuses have managed to avoid the emotional and potentially ruinous financial toll that must be paid to enter new jersey s matrimonial law courts , navigating a labyrinth of red tape , adversarial legal battles and often several different judges before reaching the end anger is a common result of the process it comes from entering a structure that immediately places distrustful participants in antagonistic roles , where they are susceptible to being prodded by lawyers whose fees increase as the battle wears on deluged by hundreds of complaints , the state legislature is considering 21 bills that , among other things , are intended to shorten the length of a separation before some divorces are granted to as little as three months \( it is now 18 months , at least \) , to promote mediation instead of costly adversarial encounters \( the total legal cost of a divorce averages 8 , 000 to 20 , 000 , lawyers say \) , toughen enforcement for alimony payment and require divorcing parents to attend seminars explaining the laws and their responsibilities after divorce at the same time , the state supreme court is considering its own set of rules to do the same the court has heard from hundreds of litigants , lawyers and other interested parties since starting hearings on the subject last spring , with the last one in october the court has set a deadline of next fall to coalesce these opinions into a new policy among the changes being considered by the court are ways to more strongly encourage divorce mediation , to make sure that judges are assigned cases from start to finish and to limit the ways lawyers can collect payment , which has sometimes included placing liens on the homes of clients already reeling from the dissolution of their marriage and division of property it is none too soon for change , according to lawyers , litigants , judges and legislators people are saying , 'the system is not responsive to me and i am not walking away feeling like i am a winner , ' said jeffrey kuhn , the supreme court s staff director on the 26member special committee , which includes judges , business people , social scientists and teachers these are people who had bad divorces and they want to be heard , he added we are trying to come up with alternatives donna brophy , 43 , a secretary with two children , wished she had been given some alternatives married for 17 years , ms brophy thought that the beginning of a divorce proceeding in 1988 would lead to a short , if painful , experience and then a more promising future but she was terribly wrong , she said , after six years of litigation that has cost her a home , her children and more than 40 , 000 in legal fees when i was married , i was like anyone else , she said i dreamed of the little house in the suburbs , watching my children grow up , having grandchildren and growing old with my husband , she said it was the fairy tale instead , ms brophy s tale is one of a divorce proceeding that was put off three times , went before at least seven different judges \( she lost count \) , and was handled by three separate lawyers when her husband asked for a divorce , she was uncertain about what to do , she said , so she asked a friend to recommend a lawyer the lawyer , she said , turned out not to be a specialist and though she spent more than 15 , 000 on his services , ms brophy said he allowed much of her financial security to be negotiated out from under her by the time she discharged him , more than a year after filing , ms brophy was forced to put her house up for sale in order to pay off this lawyer and ready herself for a second lawyer s bill she also borrowed 3 , 000 from a friend to pay the retainer for lawyer no 2 , and began a search for work as a secretary in order to survive although the divorce was finalized in 1991 , her house was slow to sell , and lawyer no 1 froze her bank accounts he came to the closing of the house in 1992 just to collect , she said

port washington , li when scarlett s white kitten died the other day not entirely unexpected given the degree of his burns another avalanche of calls tumbled in to the north shore animal league scarlett and her brood being international celebrities and all , the world press has been as relentless as the public marge stein , manager of public relations , is constantly reminded that europe and the united states are in different time zones now i know how my son , the doctor , must feel , she said i'm on 24hour call ! everyone wants a progress report is the mother of all mother cats going to make it \? are the four remaining kittens she carried from the burning building ok \? will they be adopted \? yes , yes and yes but as to the biggest question who gets to take scarlett and her little ones home who knows \? besides reaping a mother lode of publicity from its feline hero , the north shore animal league is facing a pleasant problem picking a home for scarlett and her brood from the more than 6 , 000 offers that have poured in over the last month from all over the globe we 're not quite sure how we 're going to do it , said ms stein , sifting through a stack of requests piled high on her desk look where they come from ! montreal , cairo , washington , fargo , nd , amsterdam , japan before scarlett cashed in eight of her nine lives to save her 4weekold babies , she was a scraggly stray squatting in an abandoned garage on the seedier side of east new york , brooklyn now , people act as though she and her kittens are the last cats on earth i ca n't even pick one letter out , ms stein said how do you measure a person s goodness \? there s not a bad one in the bunch they all say they would consider it an honor to adopt scarlett they try every advantage big colored envelopes drawings , poems , sob stories donations a veterinarian s wife from new jersey wrote to say she could offer scarlett love and the best medical care a woman from maryland enclosed pictures of her house , a wooden contemporary where two cats strolled on the deck and lounged on cushioned wicker settees in the glass sun room none of this , ms stein said , can be explained presumably , most people who want scarlett or the little ones live within distance of animal shelters full of homeless cats cats who might , when called upon , perform their own heroic feats the north shore animal league has about 100 cats \( and 200 dogs \) that need homes the shelter hopes scarlett s fame will give it an adoption boost during this weekend s national pet adoptathon it can use one , even if it is the most famous , successful animal center in the country \( it places over 30 , 000 animals a year but not all of its publicity is good some humane groups have criticized the shelter for importing puppies rescuing them , ms stein says from other states to satisfy demand \) scarlett and her kittens were brought here by david gianelli , a firefighter from ladder company 75 in east new york who called after seeing the white cat carry her kittens one by one from a wild blaze in her shelter he had rescued a doberman pinscher from a fire 10 years ago and remembered that north shore had nursed the dog back to health when ms stein heard scarlett s story , she called a news station just one , she said the next thing i knew , it was media madness a bbc report prompted some requests for adoption cnn s coverage has led to others and heaven knows what would have happened if the shelter had accepted oprah winfrey s offer to fly scarlett and the kittens first class to chicago ms winfrey s producers are still pushing to have the cats on for a mother s day show mother s day happens to be the day the north shore animal league has set as the cutoff for requests to adopt scarlett as if it needed more mail , the shelter is asking people to write , in one paragraph , why they would make the best family for scarlett and or her kittens this gives everyone who wants a shot a chance , ms stein said the kittens are safe from prying eyes in foster homes scarlett , named by a shelter worker for the pink patches left on her face when the fire scorched her fur , is still recovering at the shelter monday , a month to the day since her rescue , she slept soundly in a protective cage in the operating room , oblivious to the commotion she was causing at the adoption center , a wellto docouple of advanced middle age kept asking where is scarlett \? when can we see her \?
if you 've bought a new computer equipped with a drive that can write on a cdrom as well as read one , you 're in rapidly growing company some computer industry estimates say that millions of drives that let people record their own cdrom s will be sold in the next year with this new technology , those outside of corporations can produce their own cdrom s ever more small businesses , homebased entrepreneurs , hobbyists and individuals organizing recipes , photographs or household records can now enter them onto recordable compact disks for computers and audio systems but such cd s are generic the shiny disks do not come with labels machines to create the round , sticky labels with holes in the middle can cost thousands of dollars , making them the purview of bigger businesses that generate enough cdrom s to justify the price everyone else has generally had to settle for scribbling a title onto their disk with a magic marker that s what workers did at micro patent , an east haven , conn , company that sells cdrom patent data bases several years ago , the company started compiling custom data bases for clients and discovered that there was no good way to label the disks so they invented and patented an offtheshelf kit that uses windowsbased software to make labels that can be produced in a laser printer it was funny to be doing all this hightech work and then have to resort to labeling the disk with a marker , said greg veilleux , micro patent s vice president for software development i do n't think any of our customers appreciated it mr veilleux went looking for a solution , but found only expensive labelmaking machines that required customcoded cdrom drives and special printers worse , there was no good way to apply the labels so they would be consistently centered on the disk and stick without bubbling or creasing we needed a little platform with a hole so we could drop a positioner through it , mr veilleux said the only thing we found that could do it was an old mr coffee machine in the corner of our office we used the plastic cone that you drop the filter into as our platform it really did the job for us mr veilleux and his colleagues wrote windowsbased software that offers different typefaces and graphics and allows users to position the text in a variety of ways around the label and use threedimensional or scanned images as part of the design a person loads the program into a computer , brings a blank label onto the computer screen , designs text or graphics , and hits the print button the kit comes with a plastic platform and guiding tool for centering and applying the labels , graphics software that can be used in many pc or mac graphics programs , and 100 blank labels that fit into a laser printer micro patent is already selling the package by mail order for 79 , and hopes to have it in stores before the end of the year mr veilleux , frederick johnson , john heath jr and william dufault received patent number 5 , 543 , 001 combination locks for handgun triggers thousands of people die every year from accidental gunshot wounds , some of them children the american medical association estimates that more than a million children 14 and younger in this country have access to guns at home plenty of safety devices exist , but few prevent guns from being fired by all but authorized individuals two florida inventors have patented a lock they say secures a handgun trigger with a touchsensitive numerical combination anyone who intends to fire the weapon must know the combination the inventors say the lock can be released within seconds , even in darkness , as long as the weapon is held in a firing position if you buy a gun , it has plastic or rubber grips , explained frank w brooks , chairman of saftlok inc in tequesta , fla we wanted to make a lock that was easy to install and would interact with the gun without modifying it after buying a gun and a lock kit , the owner would remove the grip plate and attach the lock mechanism to the gun s inner workings the company makes lock mechanisms for pistols and revolvers our safety lock installed in a pistol with a trigger safety acts to block the safety from moving so you ca n't release it , mr brooks said some pistols do n't have a trigger safety on those we block the draw bar , the connecting mechanism between the trigger and the hammer in the case of a revolver , none have safeties you take the grip off , and our lock blocks the hammer stirrup so the hammer ca n't move now the gun may be safer , but is it available for someone who might want or need to fire it \? the lock has three buttons on its surface a user would choose a code and lock the gun by entering the combination with two fingers mr brooks said that would prevent accidental locking but to unlock the gun for firing , the owner would press each button a given number of times to satisfy the combination for example , if the code were 323 , each button would have to be pressed the corresponding number of times they snap , making a sound , and release the safety , mr brooks said in our tests , it takes people less than five seconds to unlock the gun he added this lock had to be such that you could carry it with the gun and never need a key or have to look for the lock to operate it it had to work by feel trying to remove the lock forcefully would damage the gun the inventors hold seven patents for their safety device , and they are already selling kits through gun dealers and locksmiths the first patent , for the lock mechanism , is 4 , 987 , 693 picture frames of changeable size a 22yearold california inventor has patented what he says is the first adjustable picture frame worthy of a mechanical patent , rather than a design patent , since the 1940 s daniel bomze , a new stanford university graduate in engineering product design , has created a frame made of four sides of plastic that can be adjusted to 50 different picture sizes the frame is sized with a matrix of clear snaps in each corner that connect the front and back pieces tools are not necessary to open and close it , mr bomze says , and the horizontal and vertical lengths can be changed so the proportions are adjustable , too people can use the frame for a 4 x 6 photo one week and then a 5 x 7 the next without wearing out the snaps or the plastic , mr bomze says he received patent number 5 , 546 , 689 patents are available by number for 3 from the patent and trademark office , washington , dc 20231
washington , nov 10 it has not been an easy ride for david r hinson , who resigned as head of the federal aviation administration on saturday mr hinson , who is 62 , spent his 39 months in office coping with a string of crashes that raised embarrassing questions about the agency the loss of life from airplane disasters this year was particularly disheartening , coming a year after an unprecedented safety summit of aviation industry officials and regulators that was meant to move the industry toward a goal of zero accidents but as he looks forward to returning to private life , mr hinson is unapologetic about the performance of his agency during his tenure the first major crash of the year has proven particularly embarrassing for the agency in may , a valujet dc9 crashed in the everglades , killing 110 people , and mr hinson backed up his boss , federico f pena , the secretary of transportation , when he insisted that the airline was safe the following month , the faa turned around and grounded the carrier , for violations mr hinson stresses were unrelated to the crash we had an unfortunate confluence of events which caused the secretary to suffer some public embarrassment , mr hinson said in an interview last week then in july , a parisbound trans world airlines 747 exploded off long island , killing all 230 people on board the fbi turned up evidence of explosives in the wreckage a few weeks later in an admission that raised questions about interagency communication , the faa admitted that all big planes are likely to have evidence of explosives , whether they have been bombed or not , because of the procedures used when dogs are put through bombsniffing exercises on board the cause of the crash is still unknown but other , smaller crashes have also put the agency in a bad light in april , a 7yearold girl and two adults were killed in a crash in cheyenne , wyo , in the plane in which she was seeking to become the youngest pilot to fly across the country mr hinson s agency tried to convince the world that its rules on who may fly a plane were adequate , and none had been broken there have been other problems in mr hinson s tenure the air traffic control system kept breaking down because the agency had not replaced old equipment mr hinson has updated the equipment but the system still has staffing problems and last year the national transportation safety board , which investigates accidents , cast doubt on the faa s ability to evaluate new planes , after the crash of a frenchbuilt turboprop in roselawn , ind , because of a susceptibility to icing that had gone undetected there may be more bad news to come the safety board opens hearings in a week on the valujet crash , and the faa is likely to be faulted for the way it oversees startup airlines that are growing rapidly the general accounting office , in a recent study prompted by that crash , criticized the faa for spending more time inspecting smoothrunning airlines than troubled ones but mr hinson , in a 45minute interview last week , said that in his tenure , the faa has been through fundamental improvements that will help it meet the challenges ahead it s a commitment to change that i see in the agency , and a willingness now to accept change that i feel very good about , he said one of the major problems is the rate at which technology is being introduced , and the inability historically at the faa to deal with rapid technological change in an efficient way , because they were mired in the processes of the 1950 s but the faa has recently won exemption from most federal personnel and procurement rules , and in the last few months the agency has quickly hired new talent by paying more than the standard wage scale unhappy with the work of a contractor on a new navigation system , it terminated the contract in days , instead of years and every working day , mr hinson said , the faa puts in service another four or five new pieces of equipment mr hinson lists as a major accomplishment pulling the plug on an illmanaged program for better air traffic control equipment instead , the faa is now pursuing a replacement that will do roughly the same work , with offtheshelf , easytomaintain computer equipment , leaving improvements in function for later he has also helped accelerate the use of satellite navigation , and begun the job of establishing computerized datagathering on the airlines' daytoday operations , a qualitycontrol technique already in use in europe mr hinson , a former fighter pilot and former executive with midway airlines , has not said what his future plans are his replacement is likely to have experience in air safety , which the clinton administration has made a focus two men with long experience on the national transportation safety board have been mentioned as possible replacements carl vogt , a former safety board chairman , now a lawyer in washington and a member of the white house commission on aviation safety and security , which is headed by vice president al gore and robert t francis , the safety board s current vice chairman mr francis , who served for years as the chief faa official in europe , became a familiar figure to the public in july as the board member assigned to the twa crash mr hinson said that the aviation industry and its regulators will have to do better in future years to drive down the death rate per million miles flown , or the increasing volume of flights will drive up the number of deaths in a recent speech , he said that in the last 35 years , the death rate had fallen by more than 90 percent but the number of flights will rise by 40 percent by 2015 , his agency estimates , and the number of passengers will double he said , though , that the agency could stand further changes it would work faster and better if it were an independent agency , freed from the bureaucratic delays imposed by the department of transportation , and from the political appointees whom it would never have hired on the basis of merit , he said a chronic problem for the agency , according to mr hinson and some of the faa s critics , is that presidential elections and other circumstances have forced turnover in the administrator s office , just as the occupant was getting to understand the problems but mr hinson s successor , under a recently passed law , will have a term of five years photo david r hinson has announced he is leaving his job as head of the federal aviation administration after a tenure of 39 months \( kirsten elstner for the new york times \)

his question hung on the salty , festive air mr spence , for all his plutocrat s past before he found god amid the islanders , admitted he was getting steamed , considering all the sound bites about philanthropy and the fact that almost 2 out of 5 delegates earn 500 , 000 or more a year never mind politics , do those kids have a right to life \? he demanded to know i just decided this morning , i 've got to be saying it like it is before these people leave town sharing the melting pot , too of all the surreal touches at both major parties' convention gatherings , none is more striking than this year s bewildering sense of a kind of deliberate mutual metamorphosis on the one hand , president clinton has been busily cutting out the republican middle ground for democratic campaigners seizing oratory , proposals and imagery of the familyvalues theme republicans considered their patented property as if in revenge , the republican delegates are politicking as delighted extras in the gop s turnabout stratagem their image meisters have scripted a telegenic meltingpot of a party scene , a revised hustings romance of wretched refuse that democrats once considered their own the humble poststeerage family grocery store that mario m cuomo celebrated famously at the 1984 democratic convention resounded here at the heart of susan molinari s keynote address guyatano molinari lived a simple dream , orated his greatgranddaughter , telling of the family barbershop that flourished , remarkably enough , only blocks from the cuomo store in queens where s the script \? here s an unscripted moment from the floor i decided to come because i had nothing to do this summer , explained a 16yearold republican volunteer , idling at the back of the hall in friendly conversation instantly , an adult supervisor , scandalized in the eavesdropping , intruded the youth are here because they 're concerned about the country and love america , the supervisor said slowly , insistently right \? the volunteer , suddenly alert , quickly volunteered 'yeah , sure that too here s a moment being scripted leading up to senator mccain we want just normal applause , a hall supervisor instructed a crowd of about 350 young republicans assigned to jumpstart the planned spontaneous eruptions of applause and cheering last night the longest rally was twoandahalf minutes , the supervisor said , ordering more for the nomination of mr dole let s try to double that tonight sick humor as the hour neared for the nomination of bob dole , secret service agents rushed to a hotel bar next to the hall after a delegate overheard a morbid if light remark about the nominee uttered by a writer from the new yorker , yes , the new yorker the writer , sidney blumenthal was questioned and released back to his ginandtonic after meredith marshall , of katchikan , alaska , complained she heard him say of mr dole , he should do the country a favor and die mr blumenthal insisted he was only joking about the lack of convention surprises maybe dole will save the party only minutes before the nomination he might expire he marshaled various character witnesses who happened to be near the bar committing journalism it s a slow news day , right \? ms marshall , said angrily , wondering about the state of wit at the new yorker jfk redux of all the republicans gathering here for political vindication , none has chosen to flirt more notably with selfparody than former vice president dan quayle , the target of perhaps the most withering putdown in electronic debate history when lloyd bentsen informed him in their 1988 encounter that he was no john f kennedy hammering president clinton s character today at a christian coalition rally , mr quayle rehearsed a line he delivered at the convention i had the pleasure of serving in the senate with bob dole for eight years i 've known him for over 20 years he s a man of integrity , he s a man of character and let me just say this bob dole is a friend of mine and , bill clinton , with all due respect , when it comes to character , you 're no bob dole written in the eyes the pingpong motion of most of the primetime talking heads televised from the podium glance shifting left to right , right to left , methodically on through peroration has nothing to do with any tugofwar down on the floor over the party s soul rather , this is the effect that teleprompting machines have on neophytes as they read and try to appear engaged in unscripted vox pop they shift between screens as between lifelines , their eyes dependent on reflective glass crawling their words invisibly before viewers only veterans of the machines take care to pause as if thoughtfully between the glasses and stare forth at the central camera lens of the watching nation no masterpiece theater british news correspondents seem to be having extra fun watching the convention for signs of orwellian imperiousness in the republicans' tightly scripted display of postcolonial democracy a nation of channel surfers , wrote patti waldmeir in the financial times , describing what s become of assembly and free speech and those other rights snatched from the crown the correspondent was halfamused , halfappalled at all the facile highs and lows of soap opera concocted by the republicans the studio audience cried and clapped on cue , the correspondent reported no cliche of cinematic technique was spared special pleaders whatever else the agenda speakers say freedom means , it is certainly all about lobbying tieins in the halls and streets where the delegates throng thus far , the ubiquitous butt man has not been seen seeking them out , but there is condom man , derek hodel , a new yorker in sevenfoottall costume who is pleading for more aids research another special pleader , carl pope , director of the sierra club , wandered in mufti like a voice in the wilderness , begging for a hall credential to get near delegates and lobby in defense of the environment photos for former vice president dan quayle , echoes of 1988 \( dave gatley for the new york times \)

stamford , conn , oct 22 a gynecologist testified today that the 16yearold who said she was raped by alex kelly 10 years ago was injured and terrified after what the doctor called her night of horror my impression , said the stamford doctor , marilyn kessler , was that the 16yearold was a little girl who was probably a virgin on the night before i saw her and that she was rather viciously raped by alex kelly the doctor s detailed description of the 16yearold s injuries to her genitals , buttocks and neck came on the day the prosecution rested after five days of testimony in a case that was delayed for nearly a decade the defense is to begin presenting its case on wednesday the final prosecution witnesses were a court clerk and a police detective who dryly told the jurors the barest outline of the story that attracted national attention to mr kelly , the former darien high school wrestling star they said that mr kelly did not appear for a first scheduled trial in 1987 , forfeited his bond and was brought back to face charges after he surrendered in switzerland in 1995 none of the details of mr kelly s world travels , his winters at ski resorts or his life with a fiancee in sweden were mentioned but if the drama of the fugitive tale was missing from the courtroom , mr kelly s lawyer tried to introduce some drama into his crossexamination of dr kessler in her testimony for the prosecution , dr kessler said , i observed multiple cuts , lacerations , barely dried blood , blackandblue areas , scrapes , in the teenager s genital area dr kessler said the injuries she saw showed forceful penetration several times that would have been excruciatingly painful mr kelly s lawyer , thomas p puccio , challenged her conclusions but before he began questioning her about her examination , he suggested that the gynecologist had violated court rules that bar witnesses from the courtroom and might have tailored her testimony he asked if she had had a lawyer monitor the testimony of earlier witnesses by attending many court sessions appearing shaken , the doctor said the lawyer was merely a friend and that the two had only discussed the testimony in passing then , in a response that drew ridicule from mr puccio , dr kessler said she and the lawyer spoke more about what people were wearing in the courtroom and what we were going to have for dinner than the testimony in his crossexamination , mr puccio suggested that the doctor did not follow usual procedures for examining a rape victim , did not keep detailed records and had been swayed in reaching her conclusion of rape dr kessler saw the young woman in her office the day after mr kelly drove the girl home from a teenage gathering the young woman , dr kessler said , was accompanied by her mother and provided an hourlong description of the events before the doctor began an examination mr puccio repeatedly asked whether the genital injuries and bruises the doctor described could have been consistent with voluntary sexual intercourse it certainly did n't look like consensual sex to me , dr kessler said in response to one such question she said the patient was in so much pain that she conducted only an external examination the doctor s testimony was crucial for both sides the heart of the prosecution case was the emotional testimony of the young woman herself , and the powerful accounts of her father , brother and sister about events that night but it was only through several expert witnesses who described blood found in the car as consistent with the young woman s blood and through the testimony of the police and dr kessler that the prosecution could try to corroborate those intensely emotional accounts for the defense , the doctor s testimony presented an opportunity to question how much other people s impressions about the events may have been shaped by the young woman s account of what happened mr puccio dwelled on details of the notes the doctor wrote after her examination years ago he pointed out , for example , that the doctor kept no precise notes on the size of the young woman s injuries instead , she agreed , she described injuries in terms such as small or deep to such challenges , dr kessler said simply , i will never forget the young woman s injuries and she refused to concede that the injuries she saw on her young patient could have been caused by consensual sex after a woman is injured and she bleeds and says , 'ouch , stop , ' most people would stop , dr kessler said they would n't keep at it
santa ana de chipaya , bolivia it is harvest season on this barren , windswept plateau , some 13 , 000 feet above sea level in the andes mountains , but juan condori mauani can barely find enough grain to fill his poncho in times past , quinoa , a highly nutritious grain that is a staple of the high plain , was so abundant that mr condori and other chipaya indians hauled it away in large bundles on their backs but a severe drought has ruined yet another crop for the chipaya , the last remaining descendants of the uru tribe , who were among the first inhabitants of south america although the chipaya once had the immense andean plains to themselves , they are now confined to a small parcel of arid land next to a salt lake that is useless for farming and cannot sustain the 2 , 000 residents of this isolated village and if their luck does not change , the chipaya , who have lived for centuries in this desolate land , virtually untouched by the outside world , are likely to become extinct before long , their distinct language and culture perhaps lost forever what little is here must go to feed the animals , and there will be none left for us to eat this year , said mr condori , a tribal elder without better land or some help from the government , we cannot feed our people i do n't know what we will do despite promises from the bolivian government to help the chipaya , and national press coverage of their plight , tribal officials said that no government aid had come and that time was running out like their forefathers , the chipaya live in round adobe huts with thatch roofs they speak a rare melodic language that few outsiders understand , and practice a religion that mixes pagan and christian beliefs the women dress in elegant woolen ponchos and skirts with matching hats and wear their hair in small tight braids tribal members marry only among themselves and are generally suspicious of outsiders the village cemetery has remains dating back hundreds of years but the modern world is encroaching on the chipaya except for tribal officials and the elderly , most of the men have abandoned the traditional woolen ponchos , pants and white knitted hats for what they say are more comfortable clothes , usually bought from vendors of secondhand american clothes who pass through town while women for the most part still prefer traditional attire , they often wear polyester leggings underneath their skirts new technology is quickly being adopted in the last year , the village received its first telephone , and its first electrification when 20 families installed solar panels in the top of their adobe huts television and electrical appliances are expected to follow in addition , a religious battle for the chipayas' souls has erupted between roman catholics and pentecostals , who have built new churches in this secluded village and persuaded some chipaya to abandon their language and rituals and separate themselves from nonchristians the chipaya worship a number of gods , including christian saints and a host of spirits , but the chief divinity is pachamama , the earth mother , to whom they sacrifice animals and offer libations and kisses toward the ground , according to eulogio mamani quispe , the tribe s spiritual leader the blood and fetuses of llamas and sheep are used as offerings at weddings , housewarmings and other celebrations , mr quispe said but mr condori , the elder , said he fears these traditions will soon be lost , especially since the men of the tribe will have to spend the next six months picking fruit and vegetables across the border in chile , as they have for the last five years , to earn money to support their families in the worst case , mr condori said , the entire community may have to move to chile or disband , steps that the elder said were certain to bring an end to bolivia s most ancient living culture what we are afraid of is that with the constant migration to chile , the chipayas will lose a sense of who they are , their identity and traditions , said gilberto pauwels , a belgian anthropologist who is an expert on the uru culture it would be a great travesty if that were to happen while most chipaya who go to chile to work eventually return to the village , a growing number of men are putting down stakes there we met a chipaya who has his property in chile , his jeep , his cellular telephone and his workers , many of whom are other indian groups and chipaya , mr pauwels said this is a total change in mentality before , it was understood among the chipayas that chile was only a place to work now , it represents a new life florencio mamaniquespi , a 28yearold field laborer , said that he had grown accustomed to his frequent trips across the border to work but that he always looked forward to coming back home , although he cannot say the same for his friends many of my friends are living over there full time and they want to move their families because it s too difficult going back and forth , mr mamaniquespi said but i tell them you have to endure this hardship to maintain our race'
the conceptual artist tim rollins would like to think of himself as a kindly geppetto , guiding a group of troubled , underprivileged bronx teenagers into adulthood through the ministry of art the recent documentary kids of survival the art and life of tim rollins and kos even shows a work called pinocchio made of tree logs inset with eyes and constructed by mr rollins and his charges the film tries to portray mr rollins as a social workergeppetto in paints the idea that arts education is a sophisticated form of social work has been gaining ground among lobbyists concerned with the neglect of arts in the public schools the same notion is at the heart of another documentary , which opened on friday , about teaching music to poor bronx schoolchildren , small wonders the film , which was nominated for an oscar under the title fiddlefest , opens in a way that recalls the beginning of the movie version of west side story but here the focus is on the poor neighborhoods of the east bronx a fiercely dedicated violin teacher named roberta guasparitzavaras gathers 150 students from three alternative elementary schools and teaches them to play these bronx stories are meant to show the powers of art for children in extremis , as social salvation ms tzavaras , whose father was a factory worker , makes nononsense demands for commitment from those students lucky enough to be in her classes if a violin is forgotten at home , the student is threatened with dismissal practice is not demanded , ms tzavaras said in an interview , but competition insures a high level of dedication mr rollins expects no less from his charges he practically adopts them for his afterschool program , paying them , lecturing them and using them as collaborators anyone using drugs or failing school is booted out of the program one student is asked to turn in his nintendo set for a month another almost has his art supplies thrown out when he acts irresponsibly but in these films , it is not the art that is saving souls in small wonders the benefits for the students seem to come more from the demands made on them by teachers and parents than on the students' sawing away at twinkle , twinkle , little star mr rollins makes more claims for his project , invoking themes like history and greatness but kids of survival does n't show any great beneficial effects of the oratory or of the teenagers' experience with art one dyslexic student who has been with mr rollins for 10 years still lies , skips classes and shirks his commitments and none of the young men in this film make much of an impression this is no hoop dreams , the acclaimed documentary in which talented young aspirants are tested by life instead , it celebrates the coach s recurring messages so what lessons can be drawn from these two films \?

milan , italy , may 10 as the cream of italian fashion went on trial here today , several defendants , including giorgio armani , agreed to pleabargain settlements in their taxbribery cases mr armani , perhaps italy s foremost arbiter of elegance , was fined 64 , 000 and given a ninemonth suspended jail sentence in a statement released late today , mr armani said that he had agreed to the plea bargain even though he did not consider himself guilty he reached the settlement , he said , in order to close a chapter that has upset my professional serenity the rollcall of star defendants included not only mr armani but also gianfranco ferre krizia , the professional name of the designer mariuccia mandelli , and santo versace , the brother and business associate of the designer and entrepreneur gianni versace there were to have been 19 defendants in the trial , but the court agreed to settlements for 9 of them , including mr armani none of the defendants appeared in court today , and much of the proceedings involved an unsuccessful effort by defense lawyers to have television cameras banned from the courtroom to deflect negative publicity from the usually highprofile and always highticket designers two years ago , the corruption investigations that have swept through italian politics and business turned toward the golden generation of designers that has put milan in the company of paris and new york as a world fashion capital the 19 defendants scheduled for trial today included designers and their business associates , as well as government tax inspectors investigators said the tax inspectors pocketed tens of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for providing the fashion companies with favorable audits the settlement for mr armani , which was negotiated by lawyers and the threejudge panel that is hearing the taxevasion case , implies an admission of guilt in exchange for the minimum statutory sentence but lionel ceresi , mr armani s lawyer , insisted that mr armani was not guilty the settlement , mr ceresi said , was not an admission , but a conclusion of the proceedings mr armani , whose fashion empire sold apparel last year with a retail value of 19 billion , was accused of paying tax inspectors bribes totaling 64 , 000 in 1990 he and the other designers on trial have not denied making the payments but have insisted that the payments were extorted by unscrupulous government auditors in a recent interview with the daily telegraph of london , mr armani compared making the payments to paying the check in a restaurant after a good meal the defendants making settlements today included aldo pinto , the husband and business associate of ms mandelli , and vittorio terrenghi , a business associate of mr armani the lawyers for the 10 remaining defendants said they would go to trial in an effort to have the names and reputations of their clients cleared the trial was adjourned to june 18 the remaining defendants include mr ferre , the portly , bearded designer who runs a fashion house in milan in addition to designing for christian dior in paris because hundreds of witnesses have been named by both the prosecution and the defense , a verdict is not be likely to come before the fall mr ceresi , who was wearing a navy blue armani suit beneath his lawyer s black cape today , said that the main factor in mr armani s decision to agree to a plea bargain had been mr armani s loss of tranquillity he added that since other defendants would be proceeding with a trial , the facts of the case would come out with this decision , in effect , we are achieving both results tranquillity , and the establishment of the facts , he said the accusations of corruption in the fashion world seemed to have aroused a sense of solidarity with the accused in a nation where the feeling for fashion is such that news reports of a prime minister s appearance before parliament often begin with a description of what he is wearing when politicians or businessmen caught in the net of the corruption investigators have appeared in court recently , ordinary italians have packed the visitors' gallery and millions more have watched at home on television but today , few spectators were in court nicola bonuomo , the lawyer for mr ferre , contended that television cameras should be barred because they serve no social interest , but merely slake people s curiosity mr bonuomo said the fashion designers had availed themselves of the right not to appear in court because of the presence of the cameras asked whether this was ironic in a world where fashion celebrities usually drool for television coverage , he replied , but not in a courtroom the court ruled that one fixed television camera would be allowed , but that photographers would be barred from future sessions the amounts of the individual bribes that were said to have been paid 64 , 000 to 300 , 000 are small compared with the milliondollar transactions in the industry , and there is no evidence that the legal situation has financially harmed the italian designer clothing business shares in simint spa , the only company in the armani empire on the stock exchange , closed down 30 lire , or 2 cents , at 2 , 550 lire \( 163 \) today the stock , which began the year at 1 , 800 lire , has been profiting from a recent surge of investor interest in italian fashion names like gucci and bulgari in 1995 , italy s apparel industry reported a 65 percent increase in revenues , to 52 billion that included 27 billion worth of exports , which had risen 17 percent from 1994 vittorio giulini , the owner of the knitwear maker liola , and president of the association of apparel manufacturers , held out hope for the fashion designers who stand accused designers are very close to culture and art , he said in history , i 've never seen an artist who was considered a bad one because of a trial

they did n't even call it the final four that s one of the things willie worsley remembers from 1966 the ncaa did not have a copyright on the phrase , the newspapers seemed to have never heard of it , and dick vitale was not pneumaticdrilling it at us , baby nine months before the first super bowl \( which was n't called super bowl , either \) the national college basketball championships were entrusted to modest campus arenas like the cole field house in college park , md and when worsley and six other black players from texas western defeated an allwhite team from kentucky , 7265 , not many people talked about the racial angle in public the older i get the more i think about it , said worsley , now the dean of students and operations for the worldrenowned boys choir of harlem but when i was doing it , i did n't have a clue we were just 18 or 19 at some untraceable moment , not long after 1966 , the event became the final four now a gigantic american sporting jubilee , with scalpers and alumni and scouts and corporate heavies and local fans and enterprising tshirt vendors willing to brave the ncaa logo police all congregating for one quivering weekend this year the hub is a dismal swampland west of manhattan island , where the final four will be held in an arena named after an airline , a grubby practice not yet been invented in those financially innocent days a lot of people think tomorrow s semifinals constitute the best single day in american sports , far more emotional , far more authentic , than , for a yawning example , the super bowl given the enthusiasm for the final four today , it is hard to believe that 30 years ago the texas westernkentucky result was given second billing on the front page of the times sports section , right below the brigham youngnyu final of the national invitation tournament , even then a declining event , but held in madison square garden , the unyielding center of the hoops universe back then not only that , but the vestigial nit final was shown on cbs , while the texas westernkentucky game was shown at 10 pm on channel 11 , a local station if it had been dukekentucky , they 'd have shown it on channels 2 , 4 and 7 , willie worsley said the other day texas western \( now texas at el paso \) was not a big name in 1966 , but it trounced utah in the semifinals on friday night even though the 1960 s of antiwar and civilrights movements were well under way , many sports sections overlooked the racial makeup of the teams one exception was perceptive stan isaacs at newsday , who noted that utah started three blacks , whereas duke and kentucky had none between them , and then he said of texas western all of the first seven are negroes that should n't be significant one way or the other , except that many people make it noteworthy with snickers about the ethnic makeup of the team the disparity in the final game was staring us in the face adolph rupp of kentucky had never suited up a black player whereas don haskins recruited black players down in the west texas town of el paso to this day , the texas western players insist they were on no racial mission if anything , we were just cocky , worsley said we were from new york , detroit , indiana , chicago , and you have to be cocky to survive up north kentucky was a fine team , very solid , but we felt we could beat them people still point to an early thundering dunk by david \( big daddy \) lattin as setting the mood , but worsley disagrees our speed and defense decided that game isaacs described how kentucky s louie dampier showed up in texas western s dressing room afterward to congratulate the winners many accounts show rupp raging privately about losing to blacks , but rupp behaved like a gentleman in public that night i thought i remembered rupp showing up in the texas western locker room , but worsley and haskins and the longtime publicist eddie mullens all insist it never happened , and they would know the result is considered one of the epic surprises , matched only by villanova s upset of georgetown in 1985 having covered both , i say that georgetown would have beaten villanova two out of three , but texas western would have beaten kentucky two out of three that was no upset that was the future blacks were already the oncoming heart and soul of american basketball , but that night in college park paved the way for jack givens , kenny walker , sam bowie , jamal mashburn and now rick pitino s predominately black team , the pride of the commonwealth i look at georgetown with its allblack team , black coaches all over the place , nolan richardson coaching arkansas , worsley said of the texas western alumnus who won the 1994 title there have been many great games and many great players , but the single greatest night was in maryland when an allblack team won the national championship , and raised the level of an event that would soon be called the final four photo adolph rupp glumly

cuajimalpa , mexico , aug 12 with a videoandtelephone call that turned into a breezy chat with a state governor , president ernesto zedillo today opened a new era of competition in longdistance telecommunications in mexico mr zedillo made the call to the northern city of monterrey across the newly completed digital fiber optic network of avantel sa , a company formed by the alliance of the mci communications corporation with grupo financiero banamexaccival , mexico s largest banking group it was the first longdistance call not carried by telefonos de mexico sa , or telmex , whose 48year monopoly concession expired on saturday to the relief of avantel officials , the sound and video image of benjamin clariond , governor of the state of nuevo leon , were so clear that he and mr zedillo extended what was supposed to be a ceremonial hello into a wandering survey of events in the state including a discussion of the rainfall in front of more than 2 , 000 people at an avantel service center on the outskirts of mexico city it seems like that little wire really does work , mr zedillo said with the inauguration of the 3 , 356mile avantel network , an investment of nearly 900 million that links 33 of mexico s largest cities , mexico has managed to stay on schedule for the longplanned opening of longdistance competition for the next four months avantel will offer services to pilot business customers only through its own network but the next leap in competition comes on jan 1 , 1997 , when avantel and other companies will begin to provide longdistance service to mexican homes by interconnecting with telmex s network a total of eight companies have applied to compete with telmex the biggest besides avantel is a company formed by att and alfa sa , under the name alestra , which has pledged to invest 1 billion in five years to build up its own network in coming years both avantel and alestra hope to seize about 20 percent of the mexican longdistance market , which is expected to be worth about 15 billion a year , including communications and equipment , by the end of the century president zedillo s visit demonstrated that mci and avantel are maintaining a lead over att in laying down a cable network and getting service up and running this was the second avantel event mr zedillo had attended since september 1995 officials from the president s office , anxious to dispel suggestions that he is engaging in favoritism , said he had not gone to inaugurate the facilities of other companies because none had finished construction work mexico began to privatize and diversify its key stateowned industries under the administration of mr zedillo s predecessor , carlos salinas de gortari the policy is one mr zedillo has continued to pursue even though mr salinas has fallen into disgrace among mexicans , with his family tangled in corruption scandals , and he was forced to move into exile to ireland as part of the legal requirements of the new competition , on friday one day before the deadline mexico established an autonomous federal telecommunications commission avantel officials said they expected the new commission to help free the oversight of the industry from the political pressures it faced when monitoring was handled by the communications ministry analysts predict telmex will retain about 60 percent of the market the giant company was privatized in 1990 by a group led by mexico s grupo carso sa in partnership with sbc communications and france telecom since then , telmex has invested about 10 billion , according to analysts , to improve its network and especially its customer service , which had a reputation for being slow and indifferent telmex sought to preempt some competition in recent months by offering the firstever discounts on some longdistance service to mexican homes telmex is preparing for competition and they seem ready to face it , said sari mayer , latin america telecommunications analyst at salomon brothers although telmex s potential competitors have grumbled behind the scenes that the company s preparations for interconnection have been reluctant , mci officials acknowledged today that the former monopoly had cooperated on the basics daniel e crawford , the mci official who is head of avantel s operations , said that avantel would in practice be one of telmex s biggest customers once avantel s residential longdistance service starts next year in another area of privatization , mexico announced today that a consortium including two california energy companies won the first private license to distribute natural gas the consortium , which includes enova international of san diego , pacific enterprises international of los angeles and the mexican company proxima , will distribute natural gas in the border city of mexicali
science on trial the clash of medical evidence and the law in the breast implant case by marcia angell , md 256 pages w w norton 2750 the two chief facts of marcia angell s sober and rigorous examination of the controversy over silicone breast implants can be simply stated one is that since about 1992 , a few highly skilled liability lawyers have succeeded in effecting a vast transfer of money from several corporations to themselves and their clients the claim they have made in courts , convincingly to juries , is that silicone breast implants have caused grievous diseases in women the second fact , which is at the heart of dr angell s retelling of this cautionary tale , is that there is no scientific evidence that silicone implants cause any diseases in women at all to put this another way , a kind of legal confiscation of several billion dollars has been engineered , with the sanction and approval of the american legal system , aided by a gullible news media and by a kind of rejection of science or at least that is the essential argument made by dr angell , who is a physician and the executive editor of the prestigious new england journal of medicine in the most remarkable case covered in detail by dr angell , a houston woman was awarded 25 million in compensatory and punitive damages by a jury in 1994 the woman , pamela johnson , said that silicone gel from her breast implants leaked into her body and induced an autoimmune disorder , in which she feels like she has a bad case of the flu all the time but as dr angell points out , ms johnson had apparently not been diagnosed as having any wellrecognized immune disorder or connective tissue disease , the latter a devastating illness with such symptoms as lupus , rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma dr angell call ms johnson s medical situation nebulous , saying she had vague , nonspecific complaints , such as recurrent sinusitis , sore throats , colds and bladder infections the astronomical sums involved in her case left the implant manufacturers facing two bad alternatives to fight future cases in court with the risk of suffering more large transfers of cash or attempting to settle out of court the companies opted for the latter solution , setting aside 42 billion \( 1 billion of which was reserved for the lawyers \) in one of the largest classaction cases ever in going over this history , dr angell furnishes little information that has not already been reported in the press on the breast implants controversy indeed , her footnotes show her indebtedness to reporters , especially those at the new york times , who have covered all aspects of the implants controversy , from the absence of any scientific proof of plaintiff claims to the staggering amounts of money that lawyers and collaborating doctors have earned as they have brought or threatening to bring these cases to court what dr angell does in clear , meticulous fashion is provide an authoritative voice on the breast implant matter from within the scientific establishment along the way she puts together the entire story , beginning with the first breastenlargement operation \( in germany in 1895 \) and ending with an update on the status of the 42 billion settlement \( it is crumbling because of the largerthanexpected number of claimants \) dr agnell is not an exciting writer her book includes no courtroom drama , no inside glimpses of boardrooms , no interviews with plaintiffs \( or anybody else \) but her presentation is convincing and her conclusions well substantiated a combination of greed , mediasensationalism , judicial gullibility and the cleverness of lawyers triumphed so totally over science that we have to doubt society s commitment to such things as evidence and scientific logic dr angel begins with a quick summary of the silicone implants issue , arguing among other things that the system resulted in relatively small gains for many women and enormous gains for a few lawyers in simple , nontechnical language , she describes what silicone implants are and what problems women have encountered in using them she covers the food and drug administration s decision in 1992 to ban the implants , not because there was evidence that they were dangerous but because the manufacturers had not satisfied requests for information about their safety the unintended consequence of the fda s decision was the birth of an immensely profitable liability industry , which dr angell describes in some detail , giving the names of three supposedly expert witnesses who have persuaded juries that the silicone implants do cause connective tissue disease and other ailments some distinctly secondrate scientists testify in trial after trial and consult in case after case , sometimes even earning their living that way , dr angell writes their major talent , she adds , is convincing juries , not evaluating evidence dr angell does review the evidence , provided by several epidemiological studies none of the studies indicate any connection between the implants and connective tissue disorder still , as dr angell puts it , even before the studies , the courts had long since decided that implants cause connective tissue disease she asks given the absence of scientific evidence at the time , why were the courts so sure of their conclusions \? the answer has several parts , including , of course , the very nature of the adversarial system , whose object is not to ascertain the truth but to be victorious but dr angell cites a host of indications that science itself is being repudiated , not only by lawyers with a financial stake in repudiating it but by many others as well , from new age healers to feminists and multiculturalists whose more radical exponents see it as little more than the customs of a white men s club but dr angell writes , the question do breast implants cause disease \? can be answered only by science and by nothing else dr angell s book , dry though it is , is an important statement , not just about silicone implants but about other matters at the intersection of law , science and opinion her book is a plea for

twice in two weeks , the pittsburgh steelers have been awarded a touchdown they did n't deserve and they 've parlayed those two touchdowns into a super bowl xxx date with the dallas cowboys but if the national football league still used instant replay , maybe the indianapolis colts would be going to arizona if you play with fire without asbestos gloves long enough , you 're going to get burned and by playing without instant replay to rectify the clearly missed calls that have eased the steelers' path so far , it s inevitable that sooner or later commissioner paul tagliabue will be presenting the lombardi trophy to an undeserving team maybe then the nfl will reinstitute instant replay too late to help the wronged team when obviously bad calls occur during the season the theory of most coaches is that the bad calls will balance out over the 16game schedule maybe they do and maybe they do n't , depending on the timing of those bad calls but in the super bowl playoffs , there s not enough time for the bad calls to balance out ask the colts , stung by a touchdown awarded to the steelers in their 2016 victory in the american conference championship game sunday none of the officials noticed kordell stewart step out of bounds behind the end zone before catching a 5yard pass from neil o 'donnell ask the buffalo bills , stung by a touchdown awarded to the steelers in their 4021 victory in a divisional playoff the previous weekend the officials ruled that ernie mills had been forced out of bounds beyond the end zone with a reception after getting only one foot down under the instantreplay system used from 1986 through 1991 , the stewart call would have been reviewed , but not the mills call because it involved the officials' judgment the steelers probably would have kicked a field goal had each of those two calls gone against them or been reversed by instant replay , but if even one ensuing play had been different , each game would have evolved differently who knows if the colts or the bills might not have won \? but we do know that the steelers benefited from the absence of instant replay and in that absence , a clearly incorrect call could create an undeserving super bowl champion and tarnish the nfl credibility already shaken by franchise moves pro football is arguably the most difficult game to officiate swift pass receivers and speedy pass defenders soar in midair huge blockers and huge pass rushers tangle in the trenches in fairness to the zebras , replays show virtually all of their calls to be correct virtually all , but not all and more often than not , the few calls that are clearly incorrect invariably seem to turn the game toward one team or the other those two calls in pittsburgh did n't balance out instead , they tipped the balance to the steelers this is n't meant to demean the steelers' stature with linebacker greg lloyd , pass rusher kevin greene and cornerback carnell lake on defense , with o 'donnell throwing and bam morris running , the steelers are the afc s best threat to the nfc s monopoly of the super bowl since the 1983 los angeles raiders conquered the washington redskins the cowboys , coming off their 3827 victory over the green bay packers , are an 11point betting favorite , as they should be but if the packers can scare the cowboys until brett favre s interception in the fourth quarter , the steelers can scare , if not surprise , the cowboys if the steelers are to win , they must do what the packers were unable to do eventually wear down the cowboys' huge offensive line when those cowboy blockers control the line of scrimmage , troy aikman has time to throw to michael irvin , emmitt smith has holes to run through and deion sanders has the defense guessing with the cowboys , there are no secrets , no tricks see emmitt run , see troy throw to michael , see deion dance , see the points flash on the scoreboard but it all starts with that huge cowboys line that weighs a total of 1 , 617 pounds mark tuinei 314 , nate newton 320 , derek kennard 333 , larry allen 326 and erik williams 324 their average weight of 323 pounds is calculated from their listed weights , which are not necessarily to be confused with their actual weights only the cowboys scale knows for sure what those five weigh but the scale is n't telling and when those five weigh in , there s no instant replay photo kordell stewart \( reuters \)
this morning in washington , when the television industry introduces its plan for putting sexandviolence ratings on television programs , the shouting will resume over whether the best system has been chosen it has often been billed as the beginning of a debate over censorship , but with government thus far staying out of the process , the issue is more complicated than that in fact , it is the first step in a struggle over who will control the increasingly sophisticated technology that will soon be feeding information into american homes if it becomes possible someday to rate shows with nearly boundless precision , who will make the finer distinctions \? and will consumers be able to screen out so much programming that they will , in effect , play programs on their sets the way they now play cd s \? if so , how would mass advertising , which pays more for larger audiences , reach them \? the present debate is about whether to label programs by their appropriateness for certain age groups , the way movies are rated , or label them by advisories indicating that shows have certain levels of violence , sex or foul language , and let parents decide what to block from their children the industry group , led by jack valenti of the motion picture association of america , will unveil its proposal this morning , with categories called tvy \( for all children \) , tvy7 \( inappropriate for children under 7 \) , tvg \( for general audiences not specifically children \) , tvpg \( parental guidance urged \) , tv14 \( not for children under 14 \) and tvm \( adults over 17 only \) many educators and students of children s media issues favor more detailed advisories , indicating whether sex or violence is at issue in a program six of them met with vice president al gore yesterday to seek the administration s support they pointed to editorials in 30 of the nation s leading newspapers supporting their position most producers believe that labeling a show as having violent or sexual content will cause at least some viewers to click away from it that , in turn , could cause some advertisers to stop buying commercials in it those in the industry who do support labeling argue that it is better to try a voluntary code than to risk having the government impose one , and that the proposed code s movielike format will be familiar and easy to operate for most parents but no matter which format is chosen , the technology must be available to accommodate it to transmit the codes into a television set , and permit parents to set their vchip blocking device to screen out programs they wish to block from their homes eventually , specifications for that technology must be approved by the federal communications commission reed e hundt , the fcc chairman , has taken no position on the two competing ideas for ratings codes it s a decision that he knows relates to a larger , potentially thornier , question what else should the television set be able to block \? we have to write a rule that sets new standards , and somehow provide the possibility for innovation , given the virtual certainty that television is going to evolve into a higher form of software , mr hundt said in an interview friday , referring to the eventual merger of television sets and computers he said television is a limited device that displayed what broadcasters want to display it s not as openended as the internet environment , where the user is controlling to a great extent what goes into and out of his set' the vchip is an overlap point between this new mode of communication and the old television way , mr hundt said that s why none of this is easily thought about by any of us , and ultimately , the chip question will be a question that has major first amendment ramifications for the moment , the private hope of people advocating a more detailed ratings system , one that says whether a program has sex , violence or foul language in it , is to make sure that the blockingchip specifications adopted by the fcc will accommodate that type of code even if mr valenti s group carries the day and wins a trial of its simpler , agebased system , as president clinton himself urged last week , the other side hopes to prevent foreclosing all possibility of a more elaborate blocking system even if the technology exists for a detailed ratings code , the human power would be a more difficult proposition because there are about 2 , 000 hours of television programs to be rated each day , the plan is to let producers or distributors assign the rating to their shows , hoping that peer pressure and public scrutiny will keep them honest take , for example , nbc s friends or cbs s the nanny , two popular sitcoms they are broadcast at 8 pm , when many children are watching , yet they worry some parents because of the sexual innuendo permeating the dialogue and the body language of their characters under the valenti group s system , those shows would probably get a tvpg rating , meaning parental guidance is advised because the show may contain infrequent coarse language , limited violence , suggestive dialogue and situations under the other format , those shows would be probably be rated v0 or v1 \( they have little or no violence \) , s2 or s3 \( for sexual situations \) and l1 or l2 , depending on the language used the valenti group , representing the television industry , has decided that such a system would be too complicated for producers to sort out , would lead to inconsistency , and , in the end , would not make parents' decisions any easier than the more general tvpg if you had a vsl system , practically all shows would have some level of it , said rosalyn weinman , executive vice president of broadcast standards for nbc you 'd have to have a 'v' on superman , ' and an s' on 'dr quinn , medicine woman , ' and pretty soon you 're actually destroying any real sense of information more is actually less it starts to become meaningless whichever system is chosen , there seems little doubt that ratings will affect advertisers jack myers , an advertising industry consultant , recently surveyed 700 advertising leaders he found that 64 percent of them believe a program ratings system will influence the content of network programming , and 82 percent believe that a rating system will influence their buying decisions
chicago , aug 14 when frank thomas belted a majestic homer over the centerfield fence off andy pettitte today , the ball traveled so straight , so far and so fast that it turned comiskey park into comiskey party the huge scoreboard erupted in a cacophony of lights , sound effects and fireworks the white sox were celebrating , and the yankees were not invited this scenario seemed oddly appropriate because the yankees have been tripping and falling regularly of late the secondplace orioles had already surged to a lead in baltimore on their way to squashing the milwaukee brewers and now thomas s 437foot rocket in the sixth inning made it seem as if pettitte would be mortal during the daylight and the yankees would continue to be morose in august wait do not punch the panic button yet acting like the resilient team that bolted to the best record in the american league , the yankees spoiled chicago s brief party and instead came away with a pivotal 31 victory first , tino martinez matched thomas with a massive homer in the seventh , then bernie williams and darryl strawberry flicked consecutive doubles to put the yankees ahead by a run derek jeter went deep in the eighth to pad the lead and mariano rivera slipped smoothly into the closer s role to protect it calm was restored it s like somebody slapped them in the face , manager joe torre said of his players thanks , the yankees needed that having lost four of their last five games while the baltimore orioles crept into their rearview mirror , the yankees could not afford to fumble a threegame series in chicago for the first time since 1991 or waste another stupendous performance by pettitte i think , jeter said , we all felt it was a mustwin situation and there was no better pitcher to have on the mound than pettitte he became the al s first 17game winner and improved to a breathtaking 110 with a 266 earned run average in starts before dusk pettitte has no explanation for being so adept in daylight , but he was superb today in being nicked for one run and seven hits while striking out nine and walking none in seven innings rivera substituted for the injured john wetteland \( strained right groin muscle \) and struck out two in two innings for his fourth save do not discount the importance of this victory do not treat it as a routine midaugust result that enabled the yankees to maintain their sevenandonehalfgame advantage over the orioles in the al east the yankees are 77 in august and their cushion is as small as it has been in a month , so they needed a jolt before beginning a 10game homestand on friday night against seattle everybody knows we were struggling , strawberry said we wanted to get back on the right track that s the most important thing after thomas s homer woke the yankees , martinez sent james baldwin s 21 curveball into the rightfield seats to tie the score at 11 and continue his blistering pace at the plate martinez has 14 hits in his last 25 atbats and is hitting 373 since the allstar game break tino s gotten ignored because of all the hoopla surrounding cecil and darryl , said torre , referring to the acquisitions of strawberry and cecil fielder but tino s on fire he s gotten some big hits for us martinez said i'm not looking to be the man as long as we win , i do n't care who gets the notoriety martinez s 18th homer rattled baldwin , a rookie who lost for the first time in nine starts at comiskey , and roused the yankees williams followed by slicing a fly to left that dropped three feet in front of a diving tony phillips for a double the left fielder could have played the ball on a bounce for a single , but his decision wound up haunting the white sox after strawberry slashed a grounder off the bag at first base , resulting in a quirky bounce that gave the diving thomas no chance williams scored to make it 21 the tworun seventh was full of fortune for the yankees chicago manager terry bevington eschewed walking strawberry , although first base was open , and catcher pat borders did not corral a foul tip that would have made strawberry a strikeout victim sometimes , things work out for you , strawberry said sometimes , they do n't today , it worked for the yankees pettitte dusted off a cut fastball that he had not used recently and befuddled the white sox , holding them to 2 hits in 11 atbats with men on and twice escaping sticky jams with runners at second and third he improved to 102 in decisions after yankee losses of course we needed one , said pettitte \( 177 \) we had lost two in a row we have n't been playing good baseball things are going to come around again we 're going to click again inside pitch derek jeter has embraced batting leadoff with a 449 average in 10 games in that spot asked if he thought his oppositefield homer off james baldwin was gone , he said , i do n't hit enough of them to know when they 're going to be gone mariano rivera has held the first batters faced in an outing to 2 hits in 40 atbats , a stunning statistic that bodes well for him as a closer joe torre considered using kenny rogers in relief wednesday , a role the 20 million lefthander might inherit in the postseason jimmy key , rogers and dwight gooden will start for the yankees in the first three games of the seattle series photos yankees' darryl strawberry ripping a runscoring double over the bag

albany , sept 23 although no one has formally proposed the idea , many members of the legislature say they strongly believe that they will return for a special session after the nov 5 elections to give themselves a raise , and a potentially hefty one at that few issues are as thorny , and this year in particular the question of a pay raise is twisting the lawmakers into political contortions many adamantly feel they deserve a raise because their base salaries of 57 , 500 a year were set in 1989 , because fewer of them hold outside jobs than ever before and because new york city council members are now paid 13 , 000 a year more than they are , even though legislative districts are larger if there is justification for a city council member getting 13 , 000 more than us , then there is justification for a pay raise for state legislators , said senator frank padavan , a republican of queens but this is also an election year for all 211 members of the assembly and senate , a year when fiscal conservatism is a campaign byword in many races and when large blocs of voters seem anxious about corporate or governmental downsizing to ask for a raise now would be unseemly at best , a form of political harakiri at worst , many legislators say i think everybody wants it , but i think the politics are something else , said assemblyman scott m stringer , a democrat of manhattan , who supports a raise you represent lots of people who get less than that people are getting laid off there are budget cuts how do you advocate for that \? complicating matters is the fact that challengers around the state are recognizing the toxic quality of the pay raise issue in many districts , insurgents are demanding that incumbents take the pledge first , to vote against a raise , and second , if one passes , to give the money back we should make it very clear that that would be about the most obscene thing they could do , said jeanette provenzano , a democrat who is running against assemblyman john guerin , a republican from kingston mr guerin has announced that he opposes a raise for all those reasons , whatever planning is being done to pave the way for a raise is being conducted in the utmost secrecy so secret , in fact , that legislators claim to know nothing about it , even as they heatedly discuss the issue among themselves it is n't a plan , said assemblyman edward c sullivan , a manhattan democrat who said he supports a pay raise is there a bill coming up \? i do n't know will we meet this year \? i do n't know if we do , will a bill come up \? i do n't know has anyone taken a count \? i do n't know is anyone sponsoring a bill \? i do n't know it s just assembly members talking about it , chitchatting patricia lynch , a spokeswoman for assembly speaker sheldon silver , said , there s been no discussion , no dialogue and it s not on the radar screen her comments echoed earlier remarks by joseph l bruno , the senate majority leader but the legislative leaders have been careful to leave the door open to passing a pay bill this year when mr bruno issued a news release recently saying that he personally opposed a pay raise , his aides made a point of saying that he had not ruled out allowing a floor vote on a pay bill no legislator has publicly argued that he or she is poorly paid and by national standards , they are not their base pay is the second highest among state legislatures , after california s 75 , 600 a year moreover , none of them actually receive just 57 , 500 a year all but 38 of the 211 legislators receive special stipends for holding socalled leadership positions these range from 30 , 000 for the assembly speaker and senate majority leader to 6 , 500 for the ranking minority member of the assembly committee on tourism , arts and sports development legislators also receive 89 a day to cover workrelated expenses though the payments are in theory intended to compensate legislators for food and lodging costs while they are traveling , members have been known to collect these per diems for days when they did not leave their home districts although there are no official figures available , it is believed that most state legislators do not have other jobs the time is ripe for discussion of a raise because the law prevents the legislature from giving itself a raise for its current , twoyear term that means it can only enact raises that take effect in future terms so , legislatures have typically taken up the issue after the november legislative elections but before jan 1 , when the new term begins since incumbents almost always win , the legislature can , in a year like this , essentially vote in december to give itself a raise in january however , a measure passed this year would require the signature of gov george e pataki , and he would probably be under intense pressure from conservatives and antitax groups to veto a pay raise the governor has said recently that he does not think it is appropriate for any elected state officials to get raises at this time some legislators have called for creation of an independent commission to recommend raises as a means of depoliticizing the issue that type of system exists in new york city , where a mayoral panel last fall recommended raises for the council , the mayor and other city officials nevertheless , the vote generated a storm of criticism there are signs that a similar fate awaits the legislature if it votes itself a raise this year some upstate newspapers have already come out in opposition to the idea , and one , the times heraldrecord of middletown , has surveyed all legislative candidates in its readership area to see how they would vote on the matter only one of 19 candidates said they would vote for a raise senator joseph r holland , a republican of nanuet stupid \? mr holland said , finishing a reporter s question about whether he felt uncomfortable being one of the only people to openly support something that most legislators seem to want privately yeah , i'm one the few if you want people who are really interested in the job , sometimes you have to pay some money for it personally , i think a raise every eight years is not excessive

a series of electrical explosions under a packed lexington avenue subway train last night sent hundreds of panicked riders scrambling for the exits , trapped hundreds more in stalled trains and shut down service on the city s busiest subway line for hours while none of the 30 people treated for injuries were seriously hurt and transit officials promised normal service by morning , for those aboard the train the usual numbing rush hour routine turned , for a few moments , into a heartstopping ordeal officials said the blasts were caused by a beam falling from the underside of the train and possibly striking the electrified third rail the first blast came about 7 05 pm , just as the doors were opening on the southbound no 5 train making local stops some riders bolted for the exits , while others reacted calmly but a few seconds later , a rising cloud of smoke and a second blast brought bedlam , as hundreds of commuters raced out of the train and the station , some of them sustaining injuries in the stampede some passengers reported hearing as many as five or six explosions as the underside of the train belched flame with each successive concussion and the station filled with smoke , many passengers said later , they thought that bombs were going off a small group in the first car , thinking that the station itself was the source of the blasts , headed into the tunnel , running all the way from 51st street to grand central terminal , nine blocks south two of those were damien rivera , 17 , and luis menendez , 16 , friends from the lower east side who were heading home from volleyball practice in east harlem at the first blast , everybody started running , mr menendez said we thought it was a firecracker , and then we heard the second boom , and it kept booming and booming people started crying and the conductor said , 'go through the tunnel , go through the tunnel , ' and 15 of us went as they pelted along a catwalk through the dark , grimy tube , he said , each successive explosion made him think the danger was growing closer i was screaming 'run ! run ! ' i thought i was going to get burned up jeanne mcmahon , 32 , a student heading home from hunter college , was farther back on the train there was this huge , red , loud explosion , she said , and within seconds there was smoke and people started rushing , running out of the cars , running and screaming i thought it was a bomb soon , she said , the smoke was so thick she could not tell whether there was another train on the uptown tracks everybody thought the worst , said another rider , william doyle , who compared the scene to a bruce willis movie the train was just pulling into the station and the detonations started occurring , he said kareem williams , 16 , was standing on the uptown platform , waiting for a train to take him home to the bronx from a school dance , when the train pulled in on the downtown track there was a big explosion on the bottom of the train and sparks flying and smoke and a ball of fire , he said it blew one time and then it stopped , and then it blew again , like 30 seconds later transit workers , realizing that some riders had fled into the tunnel , cut off third rail power to prevent electrocutions , making it impossible for other trains to bypass the station on the express track two crowded trains were trapped in the tunnel behind the disabled one , and one was not evacuated until nearly four hours after the ordeal began transit workers later led some of those people out through the tunnel and to emergency street exits between 51st and 59th streets the ripples from the breakdown quickly spread , and soon all 4 , 5 and 6 train service was stopped from the brooklyn bridge station to 125th street at 11 pm , there was still no service southbound from 86th street to brooklyn bridge up on the street , scores of ambulances and fire trucks and hundreds of dazed passengers brought traffic on lexington avenue and several cross streets to a halt for several hours the emergency medical service treated 15 people at the scene many still shaking with fear , or looking dazed behind their oxygen masks for ailments ranging from bumps and scrapes to smoke inhalation , and took another 15 to hospitals last night , transit officials said they thought they had found the cause of the blasts each car of a subway train has a shoe a flat metal tongue about a foot long that makes contact with the third rail , the system s source of electrical power the shoe is attached to a wooden beam on the undercarriage of the car wood is used because it is a poor conductor , and will not transmit the 600 volts of electricity from the third rail into the metal body of the car joseph e hofmann , senior vice president of the transit authority , said the shoe beam fell from the underside of one car and exploded he would not elaborate , and it was not clear if the beam made contact with the third rail , or if the failure caused electricity to arc from the third rail to part of the train such an arc can be accompanied by loud bangs transit workers said they found a splintered , charred beam on the tracks under the train mayor rudolph w giuliani , who went to the station , said , there was a brake shoe that had a gash in it , and that was what caused the fire but transit officials said that they had never heard of a gash in a brake shoe , and that , in any case , a broken brake shoe would not cause a fire or an explosion the incident came just a week after an explosion in a con edison electric cable cut off power to subway signals in brooklyn , forcing six lines to shut down and stranding as many as 40 , 000 riders aboard stalled trains fires are a constant problem in the subway , though they are far less common than they were in the early and mid1980 s , before a multibilliondollar rebuilding effort there were more than 3 , 000 fires aboard trains in 1985 , compared with fewer than 300 last year budget cuts have led the transit authority to cut its maintenance staff in the last year , but it is not clear whether that had anything to do with last night s incident photo subway riders being evacuated from an emergency exit at 55thstreet and lexington avenue after an explosion shortly after 7 pm yesterday under the no 5 train \( frances roberts for the new york times \)
washington , march 21 senator bob dole called today for the resurrection of plans to build a national missile defense system by 2003 the system would cost billions of dollars and would violate a treaty on antiballistic missiles between washington and moscow mr dole , speaker newt gingrich and other leading congressional republicans introduced a bill today to build such a system in seven years , saying it was vital to the nation s defense the united states has no defense and i repeat no defense against ballistic missiles , mr dole said if it s left up to the clinton administration , it will stay that way building a technological umbrella to shield the nation from nuclear attack was the goal of the star wars system begun by the reagan administration the project spent more than 30 billion and produced no hardware capable of shooting down a barrage of missiles , a technological goal at the outer reaches of the human mind and computer power the clinton administration has said it would veto such a bill defense secretary william perry said last month that united states military and intelligence experts did not see the threat of a ballistic missile attack on the united states intelligence estimates say north korea and iraq are at least 15 years away from developing longrange missiles i do n't believe we can wait , mr dole said asked what he thought such a system might cost , mr dole said , i 'll leave that up to the experts he added it s going to cost money , but i do n't but i think defense you know , we 're talking about protecting american lives in another military spending decision laced with political content , the white house said today that a prototype b2 bomber would be upgraded and added to the fleet of 20 being built that decision means that 493 million will be spent on the plane , much of it in military plants in california the clinton administration , until today , said the fleet of 20 each costing about 22 billion would suffice the decision stole some thunder from mr dole , who has plans to visit a b2 bomber plant in long beach , calif , on friday with this token gesture , perhaps president clinton is acknowledging how the crucial california aerospace industry has suffered under the weight of his defense cuts , mr dole said today research , engineering , development and production of the b2 and the various prototype ballistic missile defense systems create thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of pentagon spending in california , the nation s most populous state and , with 54 electoral votes , the biggest prize in november s presidential election

to the editor your june 10 news article about the two women murdered on the appalachian trail misses the point the real story is that women are not as safe as men anywhere on city streets , in central park or in the wilderness all the people you quote are men , and none mention women s safety on the trail as an issue most women who hike are all too aware of the additional risks they face because they are women , and therefore have to take personal safety into consideration before embarking on a hiking or camping trip wendy thomas somerville , mass , june 11 , 1996
alison chase could have been mistaken for a pleasant , nononsense den mother as she sat and talked the other day in a chelsea restaurant that is a role ms chase has spent the last 25 years playing , on and off the stage , with her own three children and with a large , fluctuating and rowdily creative family called the pilobolus dance theater it was in the classes she taught at dartmouth college that the founding members of pilobolus , which is performing at the joyce theater through saturday , discovered dance a quartercentury ago ms chase was soon drawn into the company s activities , as a performer and a choreographer nothing could have prepared her for those classes they were a sinkorswim experience , both for the students and their teacher , who was only a few years older than they were dartmouth had n't gone coed then , the 50yearold ms chase recalled i had a total roomful of testosterone cases she established an almost immediate rapport with her first students , who included moses pendleton , jonathan wolken , robby barnett and michael tracy , four of the founders of pilobolus jonathan and moses were seniors , she said they had to take music , theater or dance to graduate , and they were looking for a nice , easy class a few of the kids the students really cracked me up they 'd say , 'god , if my father could see me running around in panty hose' much of the unfettered imaginative approach to movement that pilobolus is known for developed in ms chase s classes ms chase was not interested in teaching dance techniques she began with improvisational exercises and composition assignments early on , mr pendleton began improving on the assignments he always did something different , ms chase said ruefully none of them had seen any modern dance , she continued they had a sports vocabulary they brought in terrifically fresh choreography no one thought of the assignments as material for theatrical performance but when dartmouth received an invitation to participate in a 12college dance showcase in new york city , the students chose a work called pilobolus to represent the class its irrepressible creators mr harris , steve johnson , mr pendleton and mr wolken named the dance after a fungus and later took the name for their group pilobolus was the last dance on the showcase program the audience , which included the veteran choreographer murray louis , exploded they were fresh and off the wall and radical because they did n't know , ms chase said they did n't come with all the baggage mr louis asked the pilobolus quartet to stay over and perform their piece again for alwin nikolais , the choreographer with whom he worked this was a tribute to murray and nik s true generosity in fostering creativity , ms chase said they were great they said , 'go back and do what you do , and we 'll present it at our theater in december during christmas break' mr louis and mr nikolais took the fledgling choreographers under their wing , and the concert was a success enrollment in ms chase s dartmouth classes soared invitations to perform steadily increased , and by the mid1970 s pilobolus was dancing internationally at the same time , ms chase had found a soul mate in another dancer at dartmouth , martha clarke , and the two tentatively suggested to the pilobolus men that they put a little female energy in the center , or off to the side of the company performances in 1973 , the women were somewhat uneasily accepted as colleagues ms clarke left a few years later to make a career in theater , but ms chase continued to collaborate with the company even after she left dartmouth collaboration is still the key to the creation of the pilobolus repertory we 'd love to have more time to play , to explore , ms chase said but booking takes priority , especially in this day and age aeros , the season s premiere , began at the company s rural headquarters in washington , conn , with several weeks of improvisation for its creators mr barnett , ms chase , mr tracy and mr wolken and the performers the material was then distilled over a few weeks in the fall and spring after 25 years , we 're still using a dialectic method of arriving at our decisions , ms chase said it does take more time now , because we 're not dancing but we get just as intense as we did years ago photo alison chase of pilobolus \( sara krulwich the new york times \)
following are excerpts from yesterday s decision by the united states court of appeals for the second circuit , written by justice roger j miner , striking down parts of new york state s law against assisted suicide the right to refuse medical treatment long has been recognized in new york in 1914 judge cardozo wrote that , under new york law , e very human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body in 1981 , the new york court of appeals held in the eichner case that this right extended to the withdrawal of lifesupport systems the eichner case involved a terminally ill , 83yearold patient whose guardian ultimately was authorized to withdraw the patient s respirator the court of appeals determined that the guardian had proved by clear and convincing evidence that the patient , prior to becoming incompetent due to illness , had consistently expressed his view that life should not be prolonged if there was no hope for recovery in storar , the companion case to eichner , the court of appeals determined that a profoundly retarded , terminally ill patient was incapable of making a decision , having never been competent at any time in his life in both these cases , the new york court of appeals recognized the right of a competent , terminally ill patient to hasten his death upon proper proof of his desire to do so after these cases were decided , the new york legislature placed its imprimatur upon the right of competent citizens to hasten death by refusing medical treatment and by directing physicians to remove lifesupport systems already in place the concept that a competent person may order the removal of lifesupport systems found supreme court approval in cruzan v director , missouri department of health there the court upheld a determination of the missouri supreme court that required proof by clear and convincing evidence of a patient s desire for the withdrawal of lifesustaining equipment in affirming the missouri supreme court , the united states supreme court stated the principle that a competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior decisions the court noted that the inquiry is not ended by the identification of a liberty interest , because there also must be a balancing of the state interests and the individual s liberty interests before there can be a determination that consitutional rights have been violated the court went on to find that missouri allowed a surrogate to act for the patient in electing to have hydration and nutrition withdrawn in such a way as to cause death , subject to a procedural safeguard to assure that the action of the surrogate conforms as best it may to the wishes expressed by the patient while competent in view of the foregoing , it seems clear that new york does not treat similarly circumstanced persons alike those in the final stages of terminal illness who are on lifesupport systems are allowed to hasten their deaths by directing the removal of such systems but those who are similarly situated , except for the previous attachment of lifesustaining equipment , are not allowed to hasten death by selfadministering prescribed drugs indeed , there is nothing natural about causing death by means other than the original illness or its complications the withdrawal of nutrition brings on death by starvation , the withdrawal of hydration brings on death by dehydration , and the withdrawal of ventilation brings on respiratory failure by ordering the discontinuance of these artificial lifesustaining processes or refusing to accept them in the first place , a patient hastens his death by means that are not natural in any sense it certainly cannot be said that the death that immediately ensues is the natural result of the progression of the disease moreover , the writing of a prescription to hasten death , after consultation with a patient , involves a far less active role for the physician than is required in bringing about death through asphyxiation , starvation and or dehydration withdrawal of life support requires physicians or those acting at their direction physically to remove equipment and , often , to administer palliative drugs which may themselves contribute to death the ending of life by these means is nothing more nor less than assisted suicide at oral argument and in its brief , the state s contention has been that its principal interest is in preserving the life of all its citizens at all times and under all conditions but what interest can the state possibly have in requiring the prolongation of a life that is all but ended \? surely , the state s interest lessens as the potential for life diminishes and what business is it of the state to require the continuation of agony when the result is imminent and inevitable \? what concern prompts the state to interfere with a mentally competent patient s right to define his own concept of existence , of meaning , of the universe , and of the mystery of human life planned parenthood v casey , when the patient seeks to have drugs prescribed to end life during the final stages of a terminal illness \? the greatly reduced interest of the state in preserving life compels the answer to these questions none

washington , nov 21 the house republican leadership retreated but did not surrender today on its idea of replacing members of the house ethics committee , which is considering charges against speaker newt gingrich michele davis , spokeswoman for representative dick armey of texas , the house majority leader , insisted that the whole notion that he is trying to replace anyone is wrong but mr armey issued a statement saying , i hope we can , in a bipartisan fashion , find the best way to reconcile the house rule that members serve on the ethics committee for no more than six consecutive years with the need to complete the committee s current work obviously , he said , the four members of the investigative subcommittee should continue their work until they come to a resolution ms davis said that in expressing support for keeping intact the subcommittee that is investigating speaker gingrich , mr armey was not implying that any of the ethics committee s six other members four of whom , three republicans and one democrat , have already served on the committee for six years should go but she said their departure would be no particular problem noting that if they stayed , their next task as committee members would be to serve as a kind of jury should the investigating subcommittee forward charges against the speaker , she said that the extent of their knowledge about the charges is hardly any greater than any of the other members of congress half the committee s 10 members are appointed by the republican leadership , half by the democratic leadership the republicans would find themselves embarrassed politically if they replaced some of their own members under the sixyear rule while the gingrich inquiry was still under way the minority leadership , which argues that the membership should not be changed , has already described any such effort as casefixing so the republicans are hoping to strike some kind of accord with the opposition , which has shown no inclination to help out the democratic whip , representative david e bonior of michigan , who is the author of many of the tax and campaignviolation accusations against mr gingrich , held a news conference today to accuse the republicans , as he did on wednesday , of trying to rig the jury mr bonior dismissed the sixyear limit as an obscure house rule asked on wednesday whether she planned to remain on the committee , representative nancy l johnson , the connecticut republican who heads it , said she was waiting to see how discussions over the sixyear rule played out but mrs johnson was quoted in today s issue of the capitol hill newspaper roll call as saying that to ask members to stay on after their six years were up would be a very bad precedent and the nov 10 issue of a connecticut newspaper , the new britain herald , quoted her as saying she would not serve on the committee after the new congress takes office in january the sixyear rule was adopted in 1989 and has been generally relished by members , who dislike service on the ethics committee but the rule was ignored in 1991 , when representative james v hansen , a utah republican , was named to the committee for a sixth twoyear term and in january 1989 , before its adoption , several committee members who had planned to leave stayed on to complete the investigation of speaker jim wright , democrat of texas the republican leadership , mr bonior said at his news conference today , is trying to pick a new judge , rig the jury and undermine this investigation in his own statement , mr armey attacked some partisans on the other side of the aisle apparently referring to a complaint by mr bonior that was reported today in the new york times s account of the republican plan , mr armey said these partisans sought to continue the tactics of an ugly campaign that most americans had hoped was finally over under the rules of the ethics committee , formally the committee on standards of official conduct , the investigative subcommittee of two democrats and two republicans , assisted by an outside counsel , james m cole is looking into accusations originally leveled against mr gingrich and also into questions that the subcommittee itself subsequently raised , among them whether he had given the investigators accurate , reliable and complete information if that subcommittee , which has promised to finish its work by the end of this year , decides that the accusations should go forward , it will present them to the full committee s six other members , three democrats and three republicans , who will then act as a jury were these six members to decide that the speaker is guilty , the full committee would sit to determine punishment , which could range from a letter of reprimand to a recommendation to the house that he be expelled ms davis , mr armey s spokeswoman , said his sole concern in the matter was the rules of the house , a recognition that the rules of the house require no more than six consecutive years but , she said , we have no proposal whatsoever ms davis said mr armey wanted to meet with the house democratic leader , representative richard a gephardt of missouri , and work this out in a bipartisan fashion but she said no meeting had been scheduled , and laura nichols , spokeswoman for mr gephardt , said none had been specifically requested

washington , feb 22 the director of central intelligence said today that the secret budget for spying might be made public , and he defended a longstanding policy allowing clandestine officers , under extraordinary circumstances , to pose as reporters or to use journalists as informers publicly debating the limits of secrecy with members of the senate intelligence committee , the director , john m deutch , said the classified budget for espionage agencies could be made public if a presidential commission on intelligence recommends it the commission is to issue its report on march 1 the money from 26 billion to 28 billion this year is hidden in false accounts within the public budget of the pentagon , despite a clause in the constitution demanding a full accounting of all federal spending the chairman of the senate intelligence committee , arlen specter , a pennsylvania republican , and the committee s deputy chairman , bob kerrey , a nebraska democrat , said the secrecy surrounding the budget was excessive and should be lifted on the issue of using reporters as intelligence sources or of allowing spies to pose as journalists , mr deutch cited a 19yearold policy that the director could waive a prohibition on the practice in lifeordeath emergencies or in extraordinarily sensitive cases the policy , which also covers use of peace corps workers and the clergy , was publicly announced by the cia in december 1977 there is no evidence that the cia is currently coopting journalists or allowing agents to pose as reporters government officials said flatly today that nothing of the sort is going on the senate intelligence committee has to be notified if a waiver is granted , and senator specter said today the fact that he has received no such notice since becoming chairman in january 1995 was a pretty good sign the prohibition is in force the issue was revived by a study published this month by the council on foreign relations suggesting that the cia should reconsider limits on nonofficial cover for clandestine officers posing as a reporter is an ideal cover for a spy , since both jobs require traveling to outoftheway places and prying out secrets the issue , however , is a touchy one for foreign correspondents , many of whom have been falsely accused of spying by hostile governments my sympathy on this matter is very , very much with the journalistic community , mr deutch said but he added that in a lifeordeath situation the cia might consider the use of a journalist in an intelligence operation mr deutch s testimony came in an annual report to congress on the threats facing the nation he said that american intelligence is watching china s military minute by minute he said chinese military exercises scheduled to take place off taiwan risked the chance that a miscalculation or an accident , unintended , could lead to some very , very serious hostilities there the cia , he said , knows very little about beijing s future leadership and intentions nor does the agency understand what is going on in north korea , he said while none of these nations threatens the united states militarily , he said , the spread of nuclear and chemical weapons throughout the world may someday pose a direct threat mr deutch confirmed that china had sold nuclear weaponsmanufacturing technology to pakistan , and he said libya is building the world s largest underground chemical weapons plant in a mountain seventeen other nations are working on chemical weapons , he said
manchester , nh , feb 16 patrick j buchanan s toughest opponent in the republican presidential campaign here in new hampshire may well be himself columns , comments and acquaintanceships , past and present , seem to be rising against him even in his own element , talk radio , mr buchanan today found himself fighting off longstanding accusations of racism , antisemitism and fascism these are the cuss words of a dying establishment , he said during a radio interview here , trying to turn those accusations into proof that he was fearless in risking the anger of the powers that be with his tough talk on trade and domestic policy but the questions kept coming , as they have throughout his career as white house speechwriter , columnist , television commentator and twotime republican presidential candidate where his supporters see courageous politics and prose , critics have long found code words intended to excite a fear of foreigners , jews , homosexuals and blacks mr buchanan has a political gift for crystallizing complex policy muddles over issues like trade into sharpedged debates in doing so , though , he habitually uses his blazing rhetoric to develop usagainstthem nationalist themes with which he questions not only his opponents' judgment but also their patriotism in a debate here on thursday night , he turned a plainspoken explanation of his trade position stiff import tariffs , for one thing , and american withdrawal from the world trade organization into an attack on senator bob dole for having supported the north american free trade agreement i plead guilty , bob , to wanting to protect american workers making 10 bucks an hour in south carolina textile mills from having to compete with mexicans making a buck an hour , he said that s just not fair that is unamerican the accusation that mr buchanan harbors antisemitic sentiments has arisen intermittently over the years because of columns like one he wrote in 1977 in it , he called hitler a racist but also described him as an individual of great courage with an intuitive sense of the mushiness , the character flaws , the weakness masquerading as morality that was in the hearts of the statesmen who stood in his path on a radio show here this morning , the host , dan pierce , asked mr buchanan , are you antisemitic \? oh , for heaven s sakes ! he replied listen , we have jewish supporters , he said , and went on to list several by name we 've got rabbis on the board of our campaign we 've had jewish friends our whole lives pat buchanan s writings and pat buchanan s broadcasts have been on the air for 25 years , he said many , many of those editors that edited those columns were jewish folks do you really think that they would put in their papers something they believed was like that \? it s absurd mr buchanan said he knew the motivation for such attacks against him without naming anyone , he said , there is a terror down there in washington , dc , that pat buchanan will succeed the value he places on loyalty is a thread that has been woven throughout mr buchanan s writing he invoked it again today in explaining on radio why he had chosen not to dismiss outright larry pratt , who took a leave as a buchanan campaign cochairman on thursday after the disclosure that in advancing his battle against gun control , he had associated with members of the white supremacist aryan nations and rightwing paramilitary groups mr pratt , who himself has not been known to make racist or antisemitic remarks , said on thursday that he loathed white supremacism and today mr buchanan said i do n't dump people over the side the way they do in washington and wipe my hands of him and say goodbye he s got a right to defend himself and when he gives me his word as a brother christian , i take him at his word but no sooner had mr buchanan addressed the question about mr pratt than his campaign suffered another embarrassment today a county chairwoman of the buchanan campaign in florida acknowledged that she was also a leader of the national association for the advancement of white people officials of the buchanan organization accused the woman , susan lamb , of deceiving them , and severed their relationship with her in a telephone interview , ms lamb denied that her group was racist the goal of the organization , she said , is equal rights for all and special privileges for none for instance , she said , it opposes government setasides for minority contractors but since the campaign has asked her to resign , she said , i will do so i will do anything i can to help pat buchanan s campaign mr buchanan is widely remembered for the usagainstthem theme of his speech at the 1992 republican national convention , where he declared that there is a religious war going on in this country for the soul of america and called forth the image of soldiers quelling riots in los angeles as those boys took back the streets of los angeles , block by block , my friends , we must take back our cities , and take back our culture , and take back our country
