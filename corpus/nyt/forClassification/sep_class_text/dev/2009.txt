pleasantville , ny while was making his various stops across the new york metropolitan area tuesday , speaking at length about his new book and all the controversial topics within , general manager had his own platform to answer back his response , however , was limited to eight words i'm not going to comment on the book , cashman said at a charity event here cashman spoke for nearly two hours to a capacity audience of 164 people at the jacob burns film center on behalf of ed randall s bat for the cure foundation to benefit prostate cancer research he talked at length about george steinbrenner , manny ram rez , the 2004 collapse against the red sox , the yankees' centerfield situation and past failures regarding pitching and minorleague development but he would not address the yankee years , torre s new book in the book , which was cowritten with tom verducci , torre questioned cashman s trustworthiness and said that their relationship had changed for the worse over the last few years they worked together cashman told reporters before the event that he had not read the book , and had not spoken to torre since torre called him jan 25 after news first broke of torre s characterizations about him in the book i have n't read it , he said we 'll leave it at that when asked if he would ever write a book of his own in response , cashman said no i 've had my chances , he said it s not something i'm going to do the only time cashman mentioned torre was to tell the story of how torre and the coaches sent him the lineup card from cashman s first victory as general manager in 1998 although audience members were allowed to pose questions , none asked about the book or cashman s relationship with torre in a discussion that was enlightening about every other aspect of his life and work , cashman talked about the fame and attention that came with his highprofile work , something he said he never actively sought there are times , he said , including this week , when it s not something you ever really want it was the only time he made even a cryptic reference to the fallout from the book regarding the current yankees , cashman said he was looking only to sign some nonroster invitees to spring training , and did not expect any major moves between now and the beginning of camp i fully expect to go to spring training with what we 've got , he said and that s a good thing cashman took a question about why he was not pursuing ram rez , and he said that he simply could not afford it after spending so freely during the offseason people expect us to get in on manny , but it s not going to happen , cashman said we 're in the nonroster invitee mode he added , he s a great player , but when you look at our payroll , we 're tapped did the cashman have any clues as to where ram rez would end up \? i hope he stays in the national league , cashman said , but not at shea someone skeptically asked if cashman was really satisfied with the situation in center field , and he responded that he expected melky cabrera to bounce back after a dismal season last year at the same time , he said , i 've got a kid named brett gardner that s hungry and wants that job cashman also entertained the audience with tales of his years with steinbrenner , and at one point randall told him that one day he would have a great many stories to tell his grandchildren about all those intriguing nights at yankees stadium no doubt , he said , and i keep telling my therapist about those nights at yankee stadium
nairobi , kenya is once again a raging battle zone , with jihadists pouring in from overseas , preparing for a final push to topple the transitional government the government is begging for help , saying that more , more money and more guns could turn the tide against the islamist radicals but the reality may be uglier than either side is willing to admit somalia has become the war that nobody can win , at least not right now none of the factions the moderate islamist government , the radical militants , the , the clan militias who control others , the autonomous government of somaliland in the northwest and the semiautonomous government of puntland in the northeast seem powerful enough , organized enough or popular enough to overpower the other contenders and end the violence that has killed thousands over the past two years somalia analysts say the main event , the government versus the shabab , will drag on for months , fueled by outside support on both sides the united nations and western countries see the transitional government , however feeble , as their best bulwark against piracy and islamist extremism in somalia , and are pumping in hundreds of millions of dollars for the government s security at the same time , the shabab are kept afloat by an influx of weapons and fighters , much of it reported to be flowing through neighboring eritrea the shabab , more than anyone else , have succeeded in internationalizing somalia s conflict and using their jihadist dreams to draw in foreign fighters from around the globe , the shabab , whose name means youth in arabic , are a mostly under40 militia who espouse the strict wahhabi version of islam and are guided , according to american diplomats , by another , betterknown wahhabi group al qaeda ahmedou ouldabdallah , the top united nations envoy for somalia , said that there were now several hundred foreign jihadists fighting for the shabab he noted that they were more motivated , better organized and better trained than typical somali street fighters , who tend to be teenagers paid a few dollars a day to charge blindly into battle with rusty kalashnikov rifles these young combatants know as much about military tactics as they do about school , which is not a lot class has essentially been out for the past 18 years , since somalia s central government collapsed but the shabab have limitations , too in the past few weeks , the shabab and their allies all but seized somalia s capital , mogadishu , and sealed the escape routes out of the city in the end , though , they were unable to overrun those very last , but strategically vital , areas the government still controls , like the port , the airport and the hilltop presidential palace the new shabab overseas recruits have imported to somalia the tricks of al qaeda s trade , like remotecontrolled explosives and suicide bombs but as iraq and sri lanka have shown , insurgents need more than suicide bombs to take over a country they need overwhelming force , or a persuasive ideology and governing strategy , all of which the shabab currently lack the only role that seems fit for them right now is that of spoiler the shabab ca n't govern , said hassan gabre , a retired engineer in mogadishu he said the shabab were simply part of somalia s industry of violence , trying to defend the anarchy regime shabab clerics are quick to put their austere version of islam into effect in the territory they seize , recently of a convicted thief and then dangling the lifeless , bloody results in front of a shocked crowd in kismayo , a port town in southern somalia but this may be just a gruesome side show mr ouldabdallah spoke of a hidden agenda and suggested that the real reason the shabab and their allies were in control of kismayo was a confluence of sinister business interests like gunrunning , human smuggling and the underground charcoal trade there s an economic dimension here , he said it was not always like this the shabab were a crucial part of a functioning minigovernment in 2006 , when an alliance of islamic courts briefly controlled much of southcentral somalia the shabab s controversial religious policies were tempered then by moderate islamists , who delivered services like neighborhood cleanups and community policing , and as a result the whole islamic movement won grassroots support in the end , the experiment lasted only six months , until ethiopian troops , backed by american military forces , invaded and drove the islamists underground that intervention failed the islamists returned as a fearsome guerrilla force and the ethiopians pulled out this january , setting somalia more or less back to where it had been in 2006 , with 17 , 000 people killed in the process \( according to \) moderate islamist leaders then took over the transitional government , nominally protected by 4 , 300 african union peacekeepers but no one is especially well liked in mogadishu these days , not even the peacekeepers , who may have the most dangerous peacekeeping mission of all many somalis turned against them after a deadly episode in february when a roadside blast hit an african union truck and the peacekeepers responded by firing wildly into a crowded street according to somali officials , the peacekeepers killed 39 civilians , though the african union said that the true figure was much lower and that the people had died in a crossfire radical islamists are now calling the african troops bacteria all this could be an opportunity for the transitional government after all , the new president , sheik sharif sheik ahmed , rose to popularity as a neighborhood problem solver , best known for helping free kidnapped children but sheik sharif s government seems hobbled by the same tired , intractable clan divisions and lack of skills that torpedoed the 14 previous transitional governments there have been glimmers of hope , such as the government passing a national budget for the first time in years and using legitimate tax money from mogadishu s port to pay its soldiers but the bigger picture is grim in the past few weeks , it proved very difficult for the government even to organize its various militias to jointly defend the few blocks it still controls the pattern is clear , and may not be broken anytime soon a weak government means more violence , means weaker government , which means still more violence , and so on with all the fighting that s going on , this government ca n't attract the best somalis , said mohamed osman aden , a somali diplomat in kenya the good somalis are not going to come when it s so violent would you \?
jalrez bazaar , a year ago , the were tormenting this lush valley just miles from the afghan capital , kidnapping people and blocking the road all that changed when american troops arrived in february they dropped from helicopters and set up three camps where there had been none , expecting a fight instead , the taliban put up almost no resistance and left for other areas now trucks travel freely and merchants no longer fear for their lives compared with last year , it s 100 percent different , said muhamed zaker , an apple farmer from the area the jalrez valley is a test case , the first area in afghanistan where s strategy of has been applied , and it is a promising early indicator but in afghanistan , a complex patchwork of tribes , ethnicities and rivalries , it remains unclear whether the early success in this area can be replicated in the painstaking business of counterinsurgency , security requires more than just extra troops it means giving afghans reasons to reject the insurgents by providing the basic trappings of a state an effective police force , enough government services , and economic opportunity so they can work rather than fight defense secretary robert m gates has said the troops here have about a year to show they can turn around the momentum of the war , before afghan and american patience runs out but afghanistan is a country where only a third of the population can read and even the most rudimentary infrastructure is lacking , and commanders on the ground say rushing the process would be a mistake it s construction , not , one american officer said , comparing the task with that in iraq , where the american effort was referred to as reconstruction one problem is that the gains in jalrez could still be temporary insurgents regularly leave areas where americans appear , only to resurface later we are hearing it s better now , said hoji mir ahmad , a fruit merchant based in kabul , but god knows what things will be like when the harvest comes when the americans came to the jalrez valley , a skinny finger of green just 30 miles west of kabul , the capital , taliban fighters had controlled it for more than a year , taking advantage of a virtual absence of american troops a unit of about 200 american soldiers had patrolled an area of half a million people and was so thinly spread that its captain had to drive 12 hours to hold a meeting with a local leader humiliations had become routine the taliban would blacken the faces of men they said were thieves and parade them in jalrez bazaar , a town west of the valley , eight people were killed in 2008 , residents said it looked like we did n't have any destiny , said momin shah , a farmer , sitting on a crate in a small supply shop fearing that the taliban were tightening their hold around kabul , the americans were sent to secure the two provinces just south and west of it , logar and wardak , the gateway to the capital and the location of the country s main northsouth highway then came the first surprise the taliban left for other areas rather than fight musa hotak , a member of parliament from jalrez district who is a former taliban commander , said the two main militant leaders had moved with their families to pakistan the reason , american officers said , was simple math the new contingent increased the number of americans tenfold mass counts , said lt col kimo gallahue , a commander in the new battalion what is now causing unrest in jalrez is an assortment of lowlevel criminals , americans and afghans said , men who may be thought of as taliban , but whose main pursuit is money , not infidels \( the main target in jalrez is a man whose last big crime was stealing solar panels \) that gives the americans hope that if they bring money and jobs fast enough here and to the rest country , they could substantially weaken the insurgency i learned everything i know about the jalrez insurgency from , ' colonel gallahue said at the foot soldier level , it s economically driven for afghans , life has improved , a fact that , for jalrez bazaar residents , has trumped the irritation at having foreign troops on afghan soil people hate them but it s better to have them here , said shah mahmoud , a farmer , 70 if security is established , we do n't need the americans and they do n't need us in the rules of counterinsurgency , soldiers must move quickly but carefully to solidify gains the americans are trying to strike a delicate balance between wooing villagers with public works projects and continuing to put pressure on insurgents in the same areas progress is slow lt col michael gabel , the commander responsible for channeling money into villages , said one early frustration was the discovery that the provincial governor had no funds at his disposal so the americans set aside 500 , 000 per district for projects like roads , bridges , and cows for widows the money is tied to the central part of the american plan for afghanistan local guard forces the program , which got its start in jalrez , pays local people 120 a month to guard their villages a similar program in iraq aimed at winning over sunnis , among them insurgents , grew into the major tipping point of the war but afghanistan is not iraq , and afghans fear that the program could create warlords afghanistan s complex ethnic ties proved to be the next problem part of jalrez district is made up of pashtun , the ethnic group most closely associated with the taliban , and a , a blow to american plans in the pashtun village of ziwalat on a recent sunday , a crowd of residents ticked off a list of complaints americans forbid driving at night americans talk to shop owners without buying anything americans block traffic , forcing pregnant women to wait but questions about recent violence an asphalt machine belonging to a chinese construction company was burned , and a bomb set on the road wounded eight afghan soldiers drew blank looks who is laying mines \? we do n't know , said a man in a brown scarf mr hotak , the member of parliament , who is from ziwalat , argues that villagers still do not feel safe if the americans abandon them , the taliban will return to kill them but american commanders suspect the reticence has more to do with political jockeying by former mujahedeen commanders like mr hotak , who want posts in the government mr hotak said his brother wanted to be police chief , but did not qualify because he was illiterate the americans say the effort in wardak could succeed if given enough time pashtuns are slowly coming forward to join the guard forces local residents are beginning to call in tips it s moving as fast as it can , said matthew sherman , the americans' political adviser if we force it , then it wo n't work
in most offices , having even one sarcastic , socially artless computer expert is barely tolerable but on 24 , the fox action serial , the collision of two acerbic , techsavvy employees played by and mary lynn rajskub is a welcome development for viewers monday night s episode of 24 features the pairing up of sorts between chloe o'brian \( ms rajskub \) , the computer hacker who has long helped guide the hero jack bauer through his lifeordeath adventures , and janis gold \( ms garofalo \) , an fbi agent deeply suspicious of her new office mate chloe it is a rivalry meant to leaven the oftengrim , highpressure thriller with humor and it s an inside joke for ms rajskub and ms garofalo , longtime pals whose careers often intersect it was just a weird mixture of my goofy buddy and then , like , oh , god , it s jack bauer , ' ms rajskub said of the pairing in a telephone interview it s so intense that it s kind of crazy when ms rajskub \( pronounced ricecub \) , a comedian and actor , joined the counterterrorism team of 24 in its third season , her character was designed to provide support to bauer by hacking computers and providing him with escape routes she also offered assistance to viewers by delivering crucial exposition as well as comic relief , often as a result of her tendency to say exactly what s on her mind , no matter the situation \( introduced to the fbi s computer system in monday s episode , chloe tells an agent , whoever set your network up that way did n't know what they were doing the agent sheepishly responds , i set our network up that way \) howard gordon , an executive producer of 24 , said chloe was the slightly outofsync person who was strangely competent but lacked certain social cues she had a really unique charm that could be set against the deadpan urgency of the show the plan for season 7 , mr gordon said , was to discredit bauer \( kiefer sutherland \) and his team , forcing them to work alongside their counterparts at the fbi it would be interesting to see someone who was like mary lynn in many ways , and who did the same thing as chloe , mr gordon said what would happen if two competing and complementary characters were doing the same job \? but when she was asked to join 24 in 2007 , ms garofalo , a former west wing star and an unabashed liberal , had misgivings about the conservative politics of the series s cocreator joel surnow as well as the show s seemingly cavalier depictions of torture nonetheless , ms garofalo said in an interview , being unemployed and being flattered that someone wanted to work with me outweighed my stance \( mr surnow left the show in 2008 , though its trademark gunpoint interrogations have remained \) ms garofalo had an added incentive she would be working with ms rajskub , whom she has known from the standup comedy world for more than 15 years the two often performed standup together \( ms garofalo said they shared equal billing ms rajskub said ms garofalo was the headliner \) and briefly overlapped on the hbo series the larry sanders show , on which ms rajskub became the fictional talk show s talent booker when ms garofalo s character left that job at the time , ms rajskub said , she was intimidated by ms garofalo s popularity and her performance style she s very well read , very verbal , very outspoken , ms rajskub said i'm none of those things her own comedy , she said , comes from my insecurities , being uncomfortable and unsure what i'm going to say , and being swept along with things on 24 that mixture of technical proficiency and social awkwardness has made chloe one of the show s most popular characters \( ms rajskub resisted the idea that male viewers might be attracted to a computer geek with a willful attitude are you asking me to dominate you \? she asked a reporter \) when ms garofalo joined the series , it was her turn to be ms rajskub s apprentice ms garofalo s challenge , she said , was to create a character that was not only distinct from chloe , but that would not be pigeonholed as one more irascible female sidekick she decided that agent gold would come from a place where anxiety and irony collide , she said she s very selfaware whereas mary lynn does n't quite understand what impact she s having on people but their fateful faceoff was delayed along with the 24 season for more than a year by the writers' strike during that time ms rajskub learned she was pregnant she gave birth in july to a son , valentine \( that was a surprise to everyone , ms garofalo said probably her boyfriend most of all \) with the new season now under way , ms rajskub and ms garofalo said their alter egos would eventually develop a reluctant respect for each other as they search for a mole in the fbi s ranks i do n't want to work with her , ms rajskub said of ms garofalo s character , and i think everybody s stupid and i'm better than everybody you know , the usual , and i'm pretty much right playing ornery friends is not much of a stretch , ms garofalo said the real difficulty is pretending that the world s fate rests in their hands it s hard to do dialogue like that , especially with someone you know in your social life , because the stakes are so ridiculous , ms garofalo said it s very hard not to start laughing or i guess i should say , it s very hard not to start laughing if you 're as immature as i am
with low turnout expected in tuesday s primary election for the late edward m kennedy s senate seat , analysts are predicting that getoutthevote efforts will decide the generally humdrum race polls have consistently put martha m coakley , the state attorney general , far ahead of her three democratic rivals but ms coakley could still lose if her organization fails to get supporters to the polls and with the primary coming during the hectic period between thanksgiving and christmas , mobilizing voters could prove more daunting than usual ms coakley is getting a lastminute boost from former president bill clinton , who recorded a phone message on her behalf that will be sent to thousands of likely primary voters ms coakley and her rivals representative michael e capuano stephen g pagliuca , a coowner of the boston celtics and alan khazei , cofounder of a national service program fanned across the state tuesday in hopes of swaying undecided voters , whose numbers are still considerable the winner will face one of two republicans state senator scott brown or jack e robinson , a businessman who ran against mr kennedy in 2000 on jan 19 massachusetts has not sent a republican to the senate in 37 years , so whichever democrat wins tuesday s primary will almost certainly lay claim to mr kennedy s storied seat about 37 percent of the state s 41 million registered voters are democrats , and about 11 percent are republicans more than half are unrolled , but they can vote in the primary with a democratic or republican ballot polls suggest that mr capuano , a sixterm congressman , is the likeliest of ms coakley s rivals to manage an upset the two received nearly equal support from organized labor , and the capuano campaign has focused doggedly on getting out the vote mr capuano has billed himself as a scrappy washington insider who knows how to get things done mr pagliuca , a wealthy investor , says his business acumen would help solve the state s economic problems , while mr khazei , whose city year organization recruits young adults for a year of community service , says he would challenge the status quo as a political outsider ms coakley stands out as the only woman in the race , the candidate with the highest name recognition and the first to declare her candidacy after mr kennedy died of cancer on aug 25 although they have gushed tributes to mr kennedy throughout the short campaign , none of the democrats has won a coveted endorsement from a highprofile member of the kennedy clan in the most visible hint of such support , caroline kennedy attended a fundraiser for mr khazei last month
washington before art went nuts in the 1960s and splintered off into a thousand different directions , the smart money was on purity paintings and sculptures would be whittled down to the bare bones of form , material and technique transparency and logic would yield intellectual rigor and abstract beauty , and this would provide escape from the confusion and corruption of mainstream culture the sculptor anne truitt \( 19212004 \) was a purist , but only to a point a prot g e of the archformalist critic clement greenberg in her youth , she worked within an extremely limited set of variables throughout her fivedecade career she was best known for slender , flattopped , humanscale monoliths resembling models of modernist skyscrapers made of wood and smoothly finished in semigloss colors configured as stripes , wide bands and rectangles , they were supremely tasteful marriages of color field painting and minimalist sculpture yet despite her purist impulses , her work was not puritanical in anne truitt perception and reflection , a splendid retrospective at the hirshhorn museum and sculpture garden , her sculptures resonate poetically on multiple levels organized by kristen hileman , an associate curator at the hirshhorn , the exhibition of 49 sculptures and 35 paintings and drawings has a beautiful , futuristic look with the museum s curving walls painted pale gray and ms truitt s monoliths and other constructions placed singly or in groups on white platforms with rounded corners , it looks as if it were designed by stanley kubrick in his spaceodyssey mode ms truitt s works are less radical technically than those of the most celebrated minimalists for one thing , she resisted industrial modes of fabrication during a period spent in japan in the '60s with her husband , the journalist james truitt , she created aluminum sculptures , which she did n't like and destroyed looking closely you can see how lovingly painted her handmade works are she applied multiple coats , alternating brushstrokes between horizontal and vertical directions and sanding between layers her colors are always exquisitely nuanced , whether tending to eyestrainingly dark combinations la ad reinhardt or to pale , impressionist pastels or to poplike candybright hues this makes her pieces seem less like painted sculptures than like threedimensional paintings it aligns her with artists like ellsworth kelly , kenneth noland and gene davis , the second two being members , along with morris louis , of the washington color school of the '60s and '70s , to which the washingtonian truitt also belonged ms truitt s earliest works suggest that she might have become a representational sculptor had her influences been otherwise first \( 1961 \) has three white , pointed pickets joined like a section of fence but the sense of a symbolic urge can still be felt in her most abstract works , although obliquely the stele , her favorite shape , has been used since ancient times for memorial and funerary monuments , and the form gives ms truitt s work an archetypal , timeless feeling southern elegy \( 1962 \) , a representation of a tombstone \( an archtopped tablet on a plinth \) is one of several early pieces that refer directly to the cemetery a writer of uncommonly graceful prose much admired for her published journals daybook \( 1982 \) , turn \( 1986 \) and prospect \( 1996 \) ms truitt described her works in psychological terms in the catalog essay , ms hileman quotes a revealing passage recalling her junior year at bryn mawr , ms truitt wrote , i was obsessed with the idea of myself as a citadel , an inner stronghold for which the experience of my life would on the one hand provide nourishment and other the other build more and more intactly this may explain why works that depart from the stele are less powerful an anthropomorphic , integrative container of the self , the monolith had a personal significance for ms truitt unlike any other form she added moldings or crosspieces to some works , but those elements only disrupt the unity of the stele without contributing anything very exciting formally or metaphorically grant \( 1974 \) , the only large piece that lies horizontally on the floor , has nicely colored bands of mauve and ochre around it and an additional , short plank on its dorsal side for formal variety , but it has none of the imposing impact of the standup works the exhibition includes some of ms truitt s paintings on canvas , which are disappointing rather than using the flat rectangle to further explore color and other painterly possibilities , she created vaporous fields of white on beige fabric more like agnes martin than robert ryman , they hint at a zen spirituality , but have little of the presence of the sculptures a puzzling series of pieces called pliths , which resemble small fringed rugs slathered in black paint , are the least impressive of ms truitt s more experimental efforts the most compelling works remain the simplest verticals midday \( 1972 \) , at 10 feet high , is monumental without being overbearing , and its fireenginered paint gives it a fierce energy that is intensified by the compressive , rectilinear form as in two especially vibrant works from 1968 , morning choice and a wall for apricots , which sport wraparound bands of fruity hues , it sometimes seems as if you are looking at columns of pure , dematerialized color but the optical is always anchored in sensuous immediacy collapsing the deep past \( the ancient stele \) and the future \( the kubrickian monolith \) into the personal and perceptual present , ms truitt s apparently reductive sculptures exude a heady , soulful vibe

mexico last month adopted a law that decriminalizes the possession of small amounts of marijuana and harder drugs , including cocaine and heroin other countries in latin america are considering similar changes in their laws , prompting antidrug groups in the us to say that pressure from south of the border will push the united states toward decriminalization , if not legalization , of drugs what effect will the new policy will have in mexico and , possibly , in the united states \? will it draw socalled drug tourists from across the border \? is the obama administration doing the right thing by taking a waitandsee attitude , in contrast to the bush administration s vehement opposition to a similar plan proposed in mexico in 2006 \? is an associate professor of political science at the university of texas at el paso and is also on the faculty of the universidad aut noma de ciudad ju rez mexico decriminalized the possession \( but not the production , trade , and distribution \) of drugs so did argentina and colombia the move is , as politicians explain it , designed to curb police corruption bribing people when caught with small amounts of drugs if they said any more about it , they would be wrong and they know it , as they do not make any claims that this measure will result in less drugrelated violence indeed , if they asked me , will decriminalization of the possession of small amounts of drugs save a single life in ciudad ju rez , where there have been about 3 , 200 murders in 21 months , my answer would be a rotund no but decriminalizing drug possession is in and of itself a change of , paradoxically , gigantic and modest proportions gigantic because it is a solid first step to pave the way for 1 \) distinguishing between drug use and drug abuse 2 \) paving the way for fully medicalizing abuse , that is , reinforcing the idea that we should treat drug addicts much as alcoholics and offer them help instead of prison time , and 3 \) focusing state resources on the production , trafficking and distribution networks but modest because it still commits governments to continue their war on drugs , just not on the user what is surprising is the fact that this change is coming from latin america , a catholic , largely conservative continent this represents a cultural shift that may mean that latin america is changing but also that it is increasingly disappointed with the american approach to drugs and the futility of its strategies and tactics read more in the end the united states may be left alone to fight a 40yearold failed war on drugs or join the rest and craft a more nuanced strategy to consider other possibilities in dealing with psychotropic substances perhaps this time change will come from south to north , instead of north to south president obama has not defined his own strategy , adopting by default the policy in place for almost a century but before he does , he would do well engaging former and current latin american presidents and figure out what they perceive that he cannot yet see is the global distinguished professor of politics and latin american and caribbean studies at new york university he was foreign minister of mexico from 2000 to 2003 the recently approved new drug law in mexico is in fact not a step toward decriminalization , but rather toward mandatory sentencing until last month , possession of small \( unspecified \) amounts of drugs was not a criminal offense in mexico only the sale or purchase was the new law establishes a minuscule limit on legal possession , meaning that today , almost anyone caught carrying any drug is subject to arrest , prosecution and jail if anything , the new law criminalizes drug use much more radically than before , and it is probably for this reason that president calder n signed it , and that the obama administration has looked the other way it will almost certainly not attract us drug tourists to mexico , since the risk of being arrested for possession has grown considerably with the new law , whereas before the real risk was just a shakedown by the authorities the law actually is part of a campaign to justify president calder n s war of choice on drugs by stating that drug consumption in mexico has increased over the past 10 years in fact , the government s own unpublished but leaked national addiction survey for 2008 shows that this is not the case the growth of marijuana , heroin and metaphetamine consumption is flat in all categories \( addiction , occasional use , atleastonceinalifetime use \) , and while cocaine addiction , for example , did rise from 300 000 victims in 2002 to 450 000 in 2008 \( a 50 percent increase , or roughly 6 percent per year \) , it did so from a tiny baseline , for a tiny percentage \( 04 percent \) of mexico s population , a much smaller share than for the us , western europe and practically every country in latin america read more mexico should move toward decriminalization , but it cannot do so if the united states does not among the many reasons is the socalled zurich effect , ie , what occurred in the swiss city in the 80 s and 90 s when it was one of only a couple of european towns that had legalized virtually all drug use , and consequently attracted thousands of users from across europe , eventually forcing the city to shut down its needle park and abrogate decriminalization if the current movement toward legalized medical use of marijuana and or decriminalization prospers and expands in the us , mexico will be able to move in the same direction , and perhaps reduce the tremendous cost the war on drugs is imposing on mexican society , without any visible results or hope for success s executive director of mexico s president calderon got it wrong on decriminalizing drugs i fear for the future of mexico and the domino effect here at home a better way to distinguish users from dealers is to increase drug courts and treatment facilities and the frequency of referrals of lowlevel drug offenders into these programs drug courts save lives , holding users accountable while leveraging them into treatment treating users as though they merely were speeding by imposing a minor fine is not in the best interest of mexico s citizens ignoring the behavior or fining them eliminates the opportunity for meaningful intervention drug users are not innocent they support the vicious drug cartels without their demand for drugs , the supply side has no purpose since terrorists depend on the drug market to fund their activities , users are potentially aiding terrorism because drug traffickers are frequently linked with weapons and human trafficking , users are also supporting these activities drugs put more impaired drivers on the highways , endangering others they make workers less productive and less safe users utilize more healthcare benefits , increasing insurance costs in the us , about 75 percent of children in foster care are victims of drugabusing parents and roughly 60 percent of domestic abuse and 80 percent of workplace thefts are drugrelated drug use is linked to crime , school dropout , and teenage pregnancy all of this will likely increase , further burdening mexico s judicial system , which is already hanging by a thin thread read more the rule of law the process of being physically safe is fragile creating an environment where it is easier to use drugs while enhancing the market for drug traffickers could tilt things in mexico bringing on utter destruction of it as an orderly society is a professor in the school of public policy and the department of criminology at the university of maryland mexico is one of several latin american countries that want to avoid a war on local drug users even as it deals with horrific violence arising from the international drug trade the country has therefore considered decriminalizing the possession of illicit drugs for personal use evidence from other countries suggests that decriminalization could be modestly helpful in addressing mexico s recent difficulties the most analogous recent experience is that of portugal , which decriminalized drug possession in 2001 when these measures were implemented , critics feared that decriminalization would lead to increased drug use , and that drug users across the european union would congregate there to all outward appearances , decriminalization produced none of the feared effects given that drug users in portugal were hardly ever arrested before 2001 , the result was not surprising mexico has been similarly restrained in enforcing its own drug possession laws removing the possible deterrent effect of criminal prosecution is thus unlikely to make much difference to the decision to experiment with drugs in mexico given the corruption that has been revealed in endless scandals at all levels of mexican drug enforcement , one major attraction of decriminalization is that it reduces the number of ways that local police can extort the populace , including us college students sampling various intoxicants on their spring vacations read more the prior us drug czar would no doubt have lectured mexico about spreading poison , as he lectured canada when it was contemplating decriminalizing marijuana the current czar , perhaps observing that our nation is by far this hemisphere s largest consumer , is showing admirable good sense and restraint in letting other nations experiment with policies that would be politically unacceptable within our own borders unfortunately , decriminalization will not address mexico s most severe drugrelated crime and violence these problems arise almost entirely from us demand for illicit drugs decriminalizing drug possession within mexico may thus prove entirely sensible even so , these policies are likely to leave our southern neighbor with much the same constellation of drugrelated violence as it now confronts is executive director of the drug policy alliance the recent decriminalization of drug possession in mexico is good for mexico , good for the us , and consistent with the broader trend in europe , latin america and elsewhere the new law eliminates criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of drugs , authorizes treatment instead of incarceration for addicts , refrains from forcing rehabilitation on consumers who are not addicted , and legitimizes the ritual and cultural use of drugs like peyote this should , in theory , result in fewer people being incarcerated for nothing more than drug use or possession , and allow police to focus on more serious crimes such reforms generally do not result in higher rates of drug use at least that s the evidence from other countries and it will have no impact on president calderon s battle with the major drug trafficking organizations it s hard to see the law encouraging drug tourism from the united states , and certainly nothing to compare with the tourism generated by mexico s lower drinking age and easy access to lower cost pharmaceutical drugs nothing in the law authorizes the creation of dutchlike coffee shops selling marijuana openly the jamaican tourism industry has nothing to fear from mexico s reform and americans generally prefer the higher quality marijuana grown in our own country why did the obama administration refrain from criticizing the mexican reform \? probably because it understands that it will have no impact on drug use or trafficking in the united states but perhaps it also is coming to the conclusion that criminalization of drug possession typically does more harm than good
judith scott could n't hear or speak , yet she found a language with which to describe her inner world hawkins bolden could n't see , yet his statues stare at you with haunted eyes and both royal robertson and ike morgan , isolated by mental illness , communicated through paintings what they could n't express any other way these four artists , whose lives and work are the subject of a new documentary , make , which is screening on saturday evenings at 6 through may 2 at the ricco maresca gallery in chelsea , belong to a category that some call outsider or selftaught artists , although these are terms that the film studiously avoids certainly all of them lived and made their art outside mainstream society , and mr morgan , who is still living , continues to do so but , as frank maresca , one of the owners of the gallery , which is also showing a group exhibition of the four artists , said , it is not their disabilities or their harrowing stories that make their work interesting all of these people were born with a gift , mr maresca said , and it was through their situations that the gift grew the way that it did their situations were extreme , to say the least ms scott who is the most established of the four , having had museum shows and been the subject of a book , as well as another film was born with severe down syndrome in 1943 her twin sister , joyce , was developmentally normal , and as children they were inseparable but when they were 7 , their parents sent judith to an institution , where she remained for 35 years , so isolated that for a long time her sister did n't know if she was alive in the 1980s joyce scott located her sister , moved her to the bay area , where joyce lived , and enrolled her in a workshop for artists with disabilities called the creative growth art center there , after showing no interest in the paints that were offered her , judith suddenly , with no prompting , began to create strange , cocoonlike sculptures by wrapping found objects in layers and layers of multicolored yarn she continued making these , in many variations , until she died in 2005 a psychologist interviewed in make speculates that the sculptures , which sometimes take on anthropomorphic shapes , represent memories of her childhood bond to her sister that no one knows for sure lends her work as with all the exhibition an air of mystery to mr bolden , who was blind from the age of 7 or 8 as the result of an accident , the triballooking sculptures that he created out of old pots , discarded kitchen equipment , pieces of carpet and other detritus found around his memphis neighborhood were scarecrows to keep birds away from his vegetable garden i think it brought him a really intense joy to scare the birds , one of the filmmakers , scott ogden , said of mr bolden , who was over 90 when he died in 2005 but as for whether he considered these figures art , mr ogden said , i think he did n't even understand the question mr robertson , who lived in extreme poverty in baldwin , la , and died in 1997 , did n't consider his paintings , depicting alien landings and apocalyptic disasters , art either , but a form of prophecy only mr morgan , whose colorful , impressionistic paintings are based on pictures in books or album covers , thinks of his work as art yet he also sees it as a job , the only one he had in the 25 years he spent in the austin state hospital being treated for schizophrenia \( he was released several years ago \) it s given him a sense of purpose , mr ogden said he spends every waking minute making art for mr ogden , 35 , an artist who lives in brooklyn and shows his work at ricco maresca while supporting himself primarily as an art handler , make is the product of a more than decadelong obsession he was a student at the university of texas at austin when he encountered the work of mr bolden , mr robertson and mr morgan at the webb gallery in waxahachie , tex i just got blown away , said mr ogden , who with his baby face and few days' stubble looks as if he should be in an indie rock band this stuff looked so different from what i was seeing in art school he became friends with the proprietors of the gallery , bruce and julie webb , former dallas punk rock kids , as he described them , who fell in love and discovered a shared passion for old signs , carnival banners , masonic objects and other curiosities , as well as selftaught art even though mr ogden had little money , he started collecting sometimes he would watch the gallery and take care of the webbs' dogs in exchange for art because of his fascination with mr morgan s paintings , the webbs encouraged him to visit mr morgan at the hospital in austin , which he did \( i was nervous , he said , but ike is such a sweet guy , i felt comfortable with ike almost instantly \) the webbs also took him to see mr bolden in memphis and sent him to visit mr robertson in louisiana when he arrived , mr robinson was standing on his front porch , holding a bible and giving a sermon to the thin air he welcomed him into his house and talked for about six hours straight i do n't think i said a word , mr ogden recalled , adding that because of mr robertson s deep cajun dialect he understood only about a third of the monologue a few years later , in 1999 , when he was in graduate school at queens college , mr ogden made a short video about mr morgan later he filmed mr bolden , with whom he had developed a friendship , and ms scott , whose work was already well known mr robertson had already died , but mr ogden was able to borrow footage from others who had filmed him through a private detective he also tracked down mr robertson s estranged wife , adell , though it took years and several visits before she agreed to be interviewed in 2003 he teamed up with malcolm hearn , a freelance editor , who helped him shape his footage into a narrative mr maresca , who with his business partner , roger ricco , has been involved in the world of selftaught art for decades , said that despite the examples of a few familiar selftaught artists like henry darger and mart n ram rez , it can be hard to call the art world s attention to work that does n't fit into any period or movement ricco maresca did a show of mr bolden s work 20 years ago , and it fell on blind eyes and deaf ears , mr maresca recalled aside from ms scott , whose work now sells for tens of thousands of dollars , the artists in the make film and show still lack any substantial market mr ogden , however , is passionate about promoting their work \( there is a tattoo of mr robertson on his left bicep \) , and he hopes the film and the show , which runs through may 16 , will bring it to the attention of young audiences the title of the film reflects its main theme this urge to create that is unstoppable , mr ogden said despite their hard lives , he added , none of the artists in the film felt sorry for themselves art made a way for them to communicate with the world , whether anyone was listening or not

birmingham , ala while the notable and celebrated sat in the bright cold of washington to hear president obama pay homage to the men and women obscure in their labor , who have carried us up the long , rugged path towards prosperity and freedom , many of those very men and women were sitting here on folding chairs in an enormous , darkened concert hall a trip to washington had been the plan for robbie revis smith , 73 , twice jailed in the 1960s for her part in the civil rights struggle but she can barely stand up now because of a bad back so she took the bus at 7 on an atypically frigid morning to get a front row seat at the inaugurationwatching event at the boutwell auditorium in birmingham the rev fred l shuttlesworth , the 86yearold survivor of bombing , beatings and multiple imprisonments , is as much a part of civil rights royalty as anyone but he had only recently gotten out of the hospital he sat upright in his wheelchair a few feet from the stage and there was colonel stone johnson , 90 , sitting quietly in his brown pinstriped suit , his hat on his knee he said he had done washington anyway , many times i been so much , mr johnson said all the marches , i did n't miss none across the country , at halffilled lunch counters and in las vegas showrooms , in break rooms and backrooms , americans gathered to watch the rare sight of a dusty old clich that anyone , even a little black child , could some day be president actually squaring up to reality for many who continued to doubt up to the last minute that this was truly going to happen , the sight of a black man taking the oath of office seemed to be breaking news even if , technically , it was not and nobody , even mr shuttlesworth , who was wheeled out as soon as mr obama s speech was concluded , wanted to be alone as they watched this moment which in large part began in the churches and living rooms of birmingham i started to stay at home and watch this and drink a cold beer or some champagne , said willie clements sr , a burly 53yearold former postal worker who grew up in a world of separate drinking fountains and jim crow but i got to thinking this may not happen in my lifetime at that moment , mr obama was preparing to be sworn in excuse me , i got to make a call , mr clements said my twin brother s watching this in vegas everywhere , people gathered store owners in the bronx stole glances at television sets in backrooms in between helping customers about a dozen latinos stood in the lobby of a los angeles ymca watching the event the cars had been moved outside at the uptown body and fender shop in oakland , calif , to make room for a projector , helium balloons , a lifesize cutout of mr obama and a crowd of about a hundred among them was leon cross , a black carpet cleaner and janitor from nearby hayward , calif , who a couple of months ago had cast a vote for president for the first time in his 52 years now his crosstown carpet care is offering a 44th president carpetcleaning sale fortyfour dollars per room , which , he said , was practically giving it away i'm happy to do what i can , said mr cross , whose face was lined with tears by the end of mr obama s speech all the swivel chairs at the silver star barber shop in atlanta were turned to the television mounted high on a wall and all of the normal barbershop conversation football , whiskey , unrealized diets yielded to quiet at the start of the invocation how you going to ask if i'm watching \? dione mccalla , a 33yearold bookstore owner barked into his cellphone of course i'm watching the haircuts and trims continued throughout the ceremony , but at 12 06 pm , when mr obama was introduced as the 44th president of the united states of america , the shop fell into an even deeper hush willie edwards , sitting in the corner eating a hot dog and wearing an obama shirt , shook his head ai n't that something , he said but the moment did not belong to only one group , as personal as it may have felt maybe this means that someday we might see another historic day a hispanic president , said 27yearold forklift driver alex gonzalez , one of several men gathered around a rabbiteared television in a meeting room at a fire extinguisher plant in elk grove village , ill at a crowded viewing party of inauguration day hookyplayers at the royale , a popular bar on st louis s south side , will roth , a 61yearold retired department manager at a grocery store , remarked on the day s meaning for gay men and lesbians we 'll finally have an ally in the white house instead of an adversary even those who did not feel a personal stake in the inauguration or who opposed mr obama on policy grounds remained in the company of others to watch one of the country s occasional concessions to the pomp and circumstance of royalty at the sparsely populated cross keys diner in republicanheavy adams county , pa , 83yearold leo lunger , who works for his soninlaw s carwash and concrete businesses , expressed disgust for mr obama s bailout plan and what he sees as a continuation of clintonera policies you ca n't buy your way out of this , mr lunger said i knew he was going to spin us blind but he stayed at the counter and watched the swearingin , as the restaurant owner s wife , vickie saltos , an ecstatic obama supporter , sent to her daughter in washington whatever the feeling was about mr obama s politics , most agreed that this onehour ceremony marked a kind of new phase in the country s 233year history few would know about that better than florence beatrice stevens smith , 104 , who lives at the heartland health care center in kendall , fla the community room was already packed , with residents peeking behind walkers , when ms smith entered , with a red , white and blue lei around her neck the ceremony had begun although several in the room dozed peacefully , the television was turned up loud enough for people down the hall to hear it from their beds ms smith did not say much but an employee at the home confirmed what stories in the newspaper had said ms smith had been a typing teacher at tuskegee university in alabama , and her father , a former slave , had served in the union army when mr obama appeared on screen and began his oath , she moved forward in her wheelchair and adjusted her glasses he is really president , ms smith whispered , as others in the room applauded that s nice
two california women running together in last year s needed more than four hours to cover the first 16 miles then , suddenly , they seemingly transformed into elite athletes , their finishing times suggesting a worldrecord pace through the marathon s toughest section turns out , they had taken a shortcut they ran in only four boroughs , skipping the bronx and making a beeline for the finish line they cheated and they were not alone thirty years after rosie ruiz infamously combined distance running and subway riding , some marathoners still succumb to temptation and take unscrupulous means to the end last year , 71 runners in the new york city marathon were disqualified for various violations of race rules at least 46 of them for reducing the marathon to something less than 262 miles an untold number of runners escape detection , marathon officials said surely some cheats will prosper among the 42 , 000 entered in sunday s race mary wittenberg , the race director , called the number of cheats shocking she added , we have a duty to make sure that everyone who crosses our famed finish line earns the medal they achieve runners have found several inventive ways to skirt the rules , if not parts of the course some take shortcuts , stepping off the course and rejoining it closer to the finish , often sneaking into central park once they enter manhattan near mile 16 other racers hand their identities to faster runners , by giving them their designated bibs or the electronic timing sensors that attach to their shoes to officially record progress at intervals on the course the new york road runners , the marathon s organizer , declined to release names of disqualified runners but an analysis of race results by the new york times found some recreational firsttimers , apparently desperate to reach the finish line others secured a coveted qualification time for the the proportion of men and women was about the same it falls on tom kelley , the marathon s director for race scoring , and several other staff members to comb through race data and catch those who have cheated he has been the marathon s hall monitor for years , so he knows how to find stories of transgressions in the streams of timing data the new york road runners gives each runner with suspicious times a chance to explain when mr kelley is confident that cheating has occurred , he may issue a lifetime ban from the race he said some europeans caught taking shortcuts had explained that in their culture , any long run was a marathon they do n't understand it s a set distance , he said a popular place for runners to diverge from the course , he said , is where they enter manhattan off the that is tantalizingly close as the crow flies to the finish line in central park but the course , with more than 10 miles to go , turns uptown onto first avenue , then begins a daunting stretch through harlem and the south bronx before returning to manhattan and the hills of fifth avenue and central park the siren songs from the park were apparently too alluring for wendy savinar and cheryl rosenberg , the two california women with suspicious times in last year s race there was no electronic timing record of them from miles 17 to 25 discussing in a telephone interview whether she had run the whole race , ms savinar said , i technically had n't she said that an ankle injury compelled her to cut to central park and that ms rosenberg went along new york is not alone in dealing with runners who choose their own route to the finish line last year , the women s winner of the sarasota marathon in florida was disqualified for taking a shortcut in 2007 , the former mexican presidential candidate roberto madrazo was disqualified from the berlin marathon over suspicions that he took a shortcut this year , dane patterson , a contestant on the nbc reality show the biggest loser , admitted to having hitched a ride with the show s crew for three miles of a marathon in arizona nbc apologized mr patterson , who said he later went back and ran the three miles he missed , told reporters , in my mind , i ran the full 26 miles none of those errant runners attracted the notoriety of ms ruiz , who used the public transit system in new york in 1979 and was exposed as a cheat after she crossed the finish line first in boston several months later about 400 , 000 people finish a marathon each year in the united states hundreds are later disqualified at new york , boston , chicago and the marine corps marathon in the washington area , which together account for about a quarter of those finishers , more than 400 are disqualified each year race violations are especially troubling to organizers when they affect competitive integrity the analysis of last year s marathon showed that participants competing with someone else s race bib deprived two runners of celebrating agegroup victories on race day a 19yearold in the field gave his bib to someone five years older , and that person posted the best time in the 1819 division the real division winner , joseph keegan of long island , did not find out he was first until this spring in july , he said , he received his award , a tiffany crystal tray still , mr keegan said , he wished he had known of his victory on race day i would have felt proud of myself , he said my family came in , my girlfriend came in i would have been able to say look , see \? you came and supported me and this is what you get' in the men s 6064 division , a 61yearold from italy gave his bib to a 25yearold friend , who posted a time close to the world record for the 6064 age group the real winner was alan miller , who has run the new york city marathon more than 20 times but will miss it this year because he is battling cancer mr miller said he attended postrace gatherings each year , one with the new york police department s running club and another with friends at mickey mantle s restaurant on central park south if he had known on race day last year that he won his age group and that an award was headed his way , mr miller said , drinks would have been on him it would have been extra special , he said
chicago \( ap \) bob bradley sees rusty players arrive at united states national team camps before important games , and he is not pleased too many key american players have been buried on their clubs' benches it s one thing if it happens for three or four months , bradley , the united states coach , said if it happens one year after another , then guess what \? it s trouble halfway through the sixnation final round of world cup qualifying matches in north and central america and the caribbean , the united states is in good position to grab its sixth straight berth but it has not been pretty after a on wednesday , the united states had to rally for a in chicago on saturday the united states \( 311 \) is in second place in its region with 10 points , 2 behind costa rica \( 41 \) and 5 ahead of thirdplace el salvador \( 112 \) , which visits fourthplace honduras \( 121 \) on wednesday that night , mexico \( 13 \) hosts trinidad and tobago \( 022 \) the region s top three teams advance , and the fourthplace team will play the fifthplace team from south america in a homeandaway series the united states has home games left against el salvador \( sept 5 in sandy , utah \) and costa rica \( oct 14 in washington \) , and road matches against mexico \( aug 12 \) , trinidad and tobago \( sept 9 \) and honduras \( oct 10 \) bradley says he wants to see everyone on his roster playing regularly in leagues by the fall damarcus beasley , a big part of the united states world cup teams in 2002 and 2006 , became a virtual nonentity by the end of his second season with glasgow rangers he played in just 11 scottish premier league games , and one each in the scottish league and the fa cup beasley , a 27yearold midfielder , did not score a goal he played in just three games after dec 6 i love glasgow , i love scotland , beasley said , adding i do want to play more if that happens , that i need to go somewhere else , then that may be , an upandcoming star forward , was purchased by villarreal of la liga , spain s top division , from major league soccer and the red bulls for 10 million last summer altidore , 19 , made only two starts and four substitute appearances during the first half of the season for villarreal , scoring one goal then villarreal , which finished fifth , lent him to the seconddivision leader deportivo xerez on jan 30 but instead of having more playing time , altidore failed to play in a single match his only action in 2009 has been with the national team he scored three goals in a 30 qualifying win against trinidad and tobago on april 1 , becoming the youngest american with an international hat trick but he was ineffective against costa rica and against honduras , having trouble maintaining ball control altidore said he was looking forward to returning to villarreal and meeting with the new coach , ernesto valverde i already have the reassurance i'm going to be playing games next year , no matter where i go , so i'm excited about that , altidore said , who signed with dc united in 2003 at age 14 , might have been the most hyped young american player now 20 , he has become more spectator than player since portugal s benfica acquired him from mls for 2 million before the 20078 season adu started just twice in his first season , scoring five goals in 21 league and cup appearances , then was lent to as monaco of the french league he played 110 minutes all season he played in nine league matches , all as a substitute and none after dec 21 jonathan spector , a 23yearold defender , made 28 appearances for west ham of the english premier league in 20078 , but he needed surgery last june to repair a torn labrum in his right hip he did not return to action until dec 28 , and appeared in just nine matches all season in april , he sustained a concussion and did not return for six weeks on saturday , spector started at right back for the united states when you bring players into the national team and now they have n't been playing , you have tough decisions to make , bradley said in some cases , you show faith in a player but as the world cup draws closer , bradley is cutting back on faith and relying more on form
state college , pa one of the main questions that dogged no 7 this summer was how daryll clark would perform without the smurfs the skilled receiving corps of deon butler , jordan norwood and derrick williams so named the smurfs because none are taller than 6 feet left the nittany lions after last season , and with them went much of the nittany lions' production at wide receiver after an auspicious start last week in penn state s seasonopening victory against akron , clark , a senior quarterback , followed up with a less impressive but still effective performance saturday in penn state s 287 win over syracuse at beaver stadium against the orange \( 02 \) , clark completed 20 of 31 passes for 239 yards and 3 touchdowns , with one interception last week , he threw for 353 yards and 3 touchdowns i feel like i'm getting better , clark said i feel like the timing is getting better with the wideouts , you know , and it s like a daytoday thing i can only get better because these guys want to work as well , and obviously , we 're not happy with where we are now but we 're winning football games and there is some life in the game where we 're making plays , and we 'll just build off of that stuff clark threw for 2 , 592 yards and 19 touchdowns in a breakout season in 2008 as he led the nittany lions to the rose bowl butler , norwood and williams accounted for 17 touchdowns and 1 , 932 of those yards and just how has clark handled the loss of his three top receivers \? it helps that he is throwing to taller receivers in derek moye \( 65 \) and graham zug \( 62 \) those guys , really , really tall , it gives us an opportunity to throw it up if a corner or whatnot has pretty good coverage , clark said you know , you can go up and play jump ball with them and allow those guys to make plays for us , and that s something we did n't have last season zug , a former walkon who earned a scholarship and a starting spot , was clark s goto target saturday he had six catches for 79 yards to lead all receivers in both categories he also caught one of clark s touchdown passes a 20yard play in the third quarter that put penn state ahead , 210 penn state , however , did not lose all of its offensive weapons from last season it still has the junior tailback evan royster , who rushed for 1 , 236 yards in 2008 but as part of a new wrinkle in penn state s offense , the nittany lions' coaching staff put royster in motion multiple times and lined him up at receiver , a move designed to counter a defense that was playing the run the move worked , and royster had more yards receiving \( 61 \) than rushing \( 41 \) most of those receiving yards came on one play early in the first quarter as penn state faced a secondand12 from the syracuse 49 , royster went in motion and ran a slant he caught the ball a few yards from the line of scrimmage , made a couple of syracuse defenders fall down as he ran and juked , then sprinted to the end zone for the first score of the game royster can do it all , penn state coach joe paterno said he s a heck of an athlete we put him in motion because we 're trying to keep the safety from sticking his nose up in everything , and we got what we wanted out there the day was not without some tribulation for clark on a fourthandgoal from the orange 1 , clark fumbled the snap , a turnover paterno chalked up to a bad exchange clark also underthrew moye on a post route , a bad pass that lingered in clark s mind after the game the pass was intercepted by syracuse cornerback kevyn scott i'm still ticked off about today , about the underthrown post that i had , clark said but as mad as clark might have been with himself , he did not have the day that syracuse quarterback had paulus , the former duke point guard who made his second start for the orange , was 14 for 20 , but threw for only 105 yards and 2 interceptions , with a late touchdown pass he rotated with ryan nassib , who was 4 of 5 for 30 yards , as syracuse struggled to mount a significant threat to the penn state defense
paris the leaders of the gathered sunday in brussels in an emergency summit meeting that seemed to highlight the very worries it was designed to calm that the world economic crisis has unleashed forces threatening to split europe into rival camps an urgent call from hungary for a large bailout for newer , eastern members was bluntly rejected by europe s strongest economy , germany , and received little support from other countries chancellor angela merkel of germany , facing federal elections in september , said countries must be dealt with on a casebycase basis saying that the situation is the same for all central and eastern european states , i do n't see that , mrs merkel told reporters she spoke after prime minister ferenc gyurcsany of hungary warned , we should not allow that a new iron curtain should be set up and divide europe with uncertain leadership and few powerful collective institutions , the european union is struggling with the strains this crisis has inevitably produced among 27 countries with uneven levels of development the traditional concept of solidarity is being undermined by protectionist pressures in some member countries and the rigors of maintaining a common currency , , for a region that has diverse economic needs particularly acute economic problems in some newer members that once were part of the soviet bloc have only made matters worse europe s difficulties are in sharp contrast to the american response president obama has just announced a budget that will send the united states more deeply into debt but that also makes an effort to redistribute income and overhaul health care , improve education and combat environmental problems whether europe can reach across constituencies to create consensus , however , has been an open , and suddenly pressing , question the european union will now have to prove whether it is just a fairweather union or has a real joint political destiny , said stefan kornelius , the foreign editor of the german newspaper s ddeutsche zeitung we always said you ca n't really have a currency union without a political union , and we do n't have one there is no joint fiscal policy , no joint tax policy , no joint policy on which industries to subsidize or not and none of the leaders is strong enough to pull the others out of the mud thomas klau , paris director of the , an independent research and advocacy group , said , this crisis affects the political union that backs the euro and of course the eu as a whole , and solidarity is at the heart of the debate the crisis also has implications for washington , which wants a european union that can promote common interests in places like afghanistan and the middle east with financial and military help all of that is in doubt if the cornerstone of the eu its internal market , economic union and solidarity is in question , said , a former state department official who runs the brussels office of the german marshall fund the problems are basically twofold within the inner core of nations that use the euro as their common currency , which together have an economy roughly the size of the united states' and within the larger european union the 16 nations that use the euro introduced in 1999 , and one of the proudest european accomplishments must submit to the monetary leadership of the european central bank that keeps some members hardest hit by the economic downturn , like ireland , spain , italy and greece , from unilaterally taking radical steps to stimulate their economies germany once vowed never to bail out weaker members in return for giving up its strong national currency , the deutsche mark but german leaders are now faced with the unpalatable prospect of having to put german money at risk to bail out less responsible partners that do not adhere to european fiscal rules within the larger european union , fissures are growing between older members and newer ones , especially those that lived under the yoke of soviet socialism some countries of central europe , like the czech republic and poland , are doing relatively well others , including hungary , romania and the baltic states , are in a state of nearmeltdown but only two newer members tiny slovenia and slovakia are protected by being among the countries that use the euro , and there was little support on sunday for changing the rules to allow more to join quickly many new members have seen their currencies plummet against the euro that has made their debt repayments to european banks , their primary lenders , a much greater burden even as the global recession has meant a plunge in orders from consumers in the west some countries are asking for aid , both from their european partners and from the international monetary fund , to prop up their currencies and the banks while western european countries are reluctant , with their own problems both at home and among the countries using the euro , there is a deep interconnectedness in any case much of the debt at risk in eastern europe is on the books of euro zone banks especially ones in austria and italy the same is true of problems farther afield , in ukraine , which is not yet a member having watched the soviet union collapse , the countries of central and eastern europe embraced the liberal , capitalist model as the price of integration with europe that model is now badly tarnished , and the newer members feel adrift before the larger european summit meeting on sunday , the poles called an unprecedented meeting of nine of the new member nations in the east to discuss common grievances prime minister mirek topolanek of the czech republic , which holds the rotating presidency of the european union , tried to ease tensions , insisting that no member would be left in the lurch we do not want any dividing lines we do not want a europe divided along a northsouth or eastwest line , pursuing a beggarthyneighbor policy , mr topolanek said but his hungarian colleague , mr gyurcsany , called for a special european union fund of up to 241 billion to protect the weakest members his government circulated a paper on sunday suggesting that central europe s refinancing needs this year could total 380 billion failure to act , the paper said , could cause a second round of systemic meltdowns that would mainly hit the euro zone economies mrs merkel opposed an undifferentiated package , although she suggested on thursday that targeted help might be offered to specific countries , like ireland governments of the countries of the european union have already spent a total of 380 billion in bank recapitalizations and put up 317 trillion to guarantee banks' loans and try to get credit moving again on friday , the european bank of reconstruction and development , the european investment bank and the world bank said they would jointly provide 311 billion to support eastern european nations , but much more will be needed mr klau , of the european council on foreign relations , sees a worrying loss of faith in a certain brand of capitalism it s politically dangerous there since they 've just emerged from an ultraregulated and stifling system , were confronted with shock therapy that created great hardship , and are just beginning to recover and stabilize , he said now they 're thrown back into an economic and political cauldron the new members are finding that their european partners are putting their own national interests ahead of collective and necessary solidarity , mr klau said charles grant , director of the , a research group in london , is more sanguine , however my expectation is that the euro zone countries , out of pure selfinterest , will bail each other out , he said for central and eastern europe it is too early to say there wo n't be solidarity but noneu countries in the east particularly ukraine seem to be the no 1 worry
mayrhofen im zillertal , austria as rider after rider crossed the finish line at the on thursday , was nowhere to be found he finally arrived , in 73rd place , with the other mortals who would not stand atop the podium or become soaked with champagne after the sixth stage of the threeweek race although armstrong slipped to 25th place from 22nd over all , he began the day with a message for his many starryeyed fans people have to step back and realize that not every race is like the , he said while preparing in bressanone , italy , for the day s journey into austria i have n't been at every race in the front during my career , i did n't win every bike race by seven minutes it s important to keep it in perspective michele scarponi of italy won the 154mile stage , which took nearly six hours to finish he raced ahead of the peloton in a breakaway , zooming through land reminiscent of he passed rolling hills , snowcovered mountains and cows wearing copper bells the scent of farm animals drifted through the air the peloton descended in a blur on one particularly steep , technical hill but scarponi , who served an for his involvement in a spanish doping ring , headed into this tyrolean town alone his compatriot danilo di luca remained in the leader s pink jersey , five seconds ahead of thomas lovkvist of sweden michael rogers of austria is in third , 36 seconds back armstrong s astana teammate levi leipheimer , who was 20th on thursday , remained in fourth place over all , 43 seconds out of first place what scarponi did was impressive , di luca said we did n't have any interest in chasing him down we only wanted to defend the pink jersey the giro will start in innsbruck , austria , on friday on its way through switzerland and back into italy by then , the fans will most likely have reverted to celebrating with wine and cheese instead of the beer and bratwurst that were popular thursday and by then , armstrong is very likely to be in the same spot in the standings he had once expressed a desire to win the giro , in this , his first time in the event but his plans have changed , armstrong , 37 , has shifted his focus to use the race as a training ground for the , which he has won seven times and he has developed a different perspective of the peloton from the back people have to remember the 2001 tour valencia , when i was seven minutes off the back , or the 2003 parisnice , when i dropped out after one stage , he said you have to pick your moments i spent a lot of my career in the back of the bus some of the other riders , however , are still bracing for armstrong to pounce with 15 stages to go and a route that will wind through milan and turin before heading south plenty of time remains riders say that the individual time trial , which is set for may 21 in the tourist spot , may be ideal for armstrong to steal a stage victory it will be longer than usual , by about 30 minutes , and features several hills ivan basso of italy , one of the race favorites , said he expected armstrong to vie for a victory there he said he was confident that armstrong would begin to race faster with each passing day of the giro to me , he s the king and he is stronger right now than most people would be after breaking their collarbone not too long ago , basso said you ca n't expect him to be the king again in just this first big race but he will do something special by the end , for sure then again , if leipheimer is in contention for the pink jersey , or maglia rosa , armstrong acknowledged that he might have to put aside his ambitions of winning a stage one of the fans cheering for armstrong on thursday would have none of that i came to see lance armstrong win , and i ca n't imagine him not winning , said paolo tozzi , who drove to austria from milan to see armstrong race it is in his blood to try to finish first , no \?
washington given the excitement in washington this week , one would think that with inauguration of and the departure of george w bush the economy is about to spring back to life , the troops are all on their way home from iraq , there will be health care coverage for all and , , celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect but as mr obama takes the oath of office , there is evidence that , as enthusiastic as the public is about the change in power , there are no expectations of quick fixes the cascade of grim economic news , combined with the calculatedly sober tone mr obama has adopted most recently in his noapplauseline speech to thousands of supporters at the concert on the mall on sunday has provided something of a cushion for mr obama people are going to give obama more time than they would any other new president because they know he is dealing with unprecedented challenges , said mark mckinnon , a consultant who worked for a time for senator john mccain , mr obama s republican opponent in the presidential election the economic crisis presidentelect obama faces may in some ways help him it is taking some of the helium out of what would otherwise be stratospheric expectations still , if it is now clear that mr obama has some time , the next question is , how much \? just how much patience does the country have for turning the ship of state around , no matter how much it likes its new president \? mr obama s advisers , who have been nothing if not diligent about pushing the idea that none of this is going to happen quickly , tend to avoid allowing themselves to be nailed down on any specific timetable , not surprisingly i just do n't know , david axelrod , mr obama s senior adviser , said in an interview i think that s hard to judge i think right now people are inclined to give us some time by time i mean more than months people understand that it s going to take years rahm emanuel , mr obama s designated chief of staff , responded with a terse email message when asked how long he thought mr obama had will not put time on it , he wrote i think based on what i see they know these are big problems and cannot be turned around quickly , he wrote public quite pragmatic a , conducted last week , offered at least some guidance for the obama expectations clock most respondents said they thought it would take mr obama two years or more to deliver on campaign promises to improve the economy , expand health care coverage and end the war in iraq one of the more intriguing questions as the nation approaches this transfer of power is this at what point , if ever , does mr bush lose ownership of this recession and it becomes an obama recession \? most respondents think the recession will last two years or longer david plouffe , who was mr obama s campaign manager , argued that there were some ways in which mr obama can earn patience from the american public , and that much of it has to do with tone people expect a change in priorities , he said people expect a change in intensity but they know it s going to take a long while for things to stabilize and turn around in truth , though , according to aides to mr obama and outside analysts , the amount of time he has to deliver on promises and deal with problems varies with the problem and the promise for obvious reasons , he probably has a good deal of breathing room on the economy that is also true with health care , given the long and tortured history of attempts to change the system but given the crispness and certitude of the campaign promise mr obama made to bring all combat troops out of iraq in 16 months , it seems fair to say that the public at large \( and his democratic base in particular \) will not be quite as tolerant of delays on that front the fact that mr obama and his aides have not done anything to really walk back that promise , as opposed to some others , suggest that he understands that mr obama may also find it difficult to delay for too long closing the guant namo bay detention camp he has walked a careful line on this issue since the election , raising all the complications in closing it while at the same time making clear that it will be closed eventually and mr obama s ability to slowwalk some campaign promises will also be affected by how well he maintains his standing with the american public and continues to project an air of command and competence with a series of missteps upon assuming the presidency in 1993 , bill clinton was quick to squander what political capital he had , as became clear with his party s disastrous showing in the midterm elections of 1994 so far , mr obama has managed to remain unscathed by any missteps he has made , but his ability to ask for the american public s patience depends in no small part on the public s confidence in his competence and motives mr axelrod said he thought that mr obama and the country were in tune with one another on the problems he faces and what it will take to turn things around what s remarkable about the polls is that people are at once optimistic and realistic , he said they have high hopes for his presidency , and that he can help lead us out of the morass we are in and they understand how deep the morass is and that s a good position to be in still , if this past few years have proved anything , it is that things move much more quickly in politics than they ever have before public opinions shift , events change , perceptions change even as mr mckinnon , the media adviser , argued that mr obama enjoyed a lot more running room than other presidents , his estimate of when the check might come due was probably one that mr axelrod would not like to hear i think obama can count on a very long honeymoon , said mr mckinnon , who also advised president bush on media strategy i think he s got about six months , which is about five and half months longer than usual
minneapolis like every other team , the position a coach near third base to direct runners but at a critical juncture in game 3 of minnesota s american league division series , nick punto decided that the thirdbase coach , scott ullger , was superfluous , and instead took an erroneous cue from the boisterous metrodome crowd of 54 , 735 with the twins down by a run to the and running out of chances , punto who had doubled leading off the eighth inning sprinted for third on denard span s slow grounder up the middle hearing the crowd roar , punto presumed that the ball had dribbled into center field , and tore around third as if escaping a fire he never looked for ullger until he was almost a third of the way past the bag the ball never reached the outfield shortstop fielded it behind second base ullger thrust both hands forward to stop punto , who by this time was nearly to the alds logo in foul territory between third base and the plate punto fell trying to stop jeter threw the ball home to catcher , who caught punto diving back to third the twins never scored again in a that ended the franchise s 28year run at the metrodome minnesota s final game was supposed to be last sunday , but the twins' unlikely rush to overtake the detroit tigers for the al central title extended the dome s baseball life now it is done , and punto s gaffe helped finish it off i wanted to dig a hole , crawl inside it and die , punto said it was really embarrassing i knew he did n't hit the ball real hard i thought it was getting through the crowd was going crazy i had my head down i picked up scotty late it was all on me a terrible play , and a key play in the game most people gave the twins little chance in this series against the yankees , and the twins sabotaged themselves with mistakes at crucial points in the last two games in the fourth inning of a scoreless game 2 , carlos gomez fell rounding second on a single by matt tolbert with delmon young heading home , gomez failed to get in a rundown and was tagged out before young could score , costing the twins a run twins closer joe nathan could have used the extra cushion in the ninth , when s tworun homer tied the score sunday , besides punto s mistake , michael cuddyer was forced at second in the fifth on jason kubel s line single that handcuffed second baseman cuddyer broke back to first , presuming a catch by cano , and right fielder nick swisher threw him out there s really nothing you can do about it , twins manager ron gardenhire said you freeze on a line drive and you start going back , and the guy missed the ball what are you going to do \? none of this should have looked unfamiliar to gardenhire he preaches aggressiveness on the bases , and although the twins are known for their smallball savvy , they sometimes take foolish chances during two homestands in midsummer , the twins had five runners picked off on the bases the twins cut down on mistakes in september while winning 17 of 21 games to overtake the tigers but they never played as well as they needed to against the yankees , who swept them in 10 games this season when patrolled center field , the twins rarely lost at the metrodome in october , winning all eight world series games for titles in 1987 and '91 but the twins closed the metrodome with an eightgame postseason losing streak , five of them to the yankees , and five consecutive series losses since 2002 this is a team you 've got to be sharp against for nine innings , nathan said and the twins , again , were not

as i write this i m listening to the first track from useless creatures , a new instrumental record i am working on that s now ready to be mastered the song is called master sigh some headvoice singing and whistling through a looping pedal merged with ambient loops made at my barn it s wordless , drumless and fluid a sonic jacuzzi \( i had a music history professor in college who snarled at us freshman for listening to music as if it were some sonic jacuzzi \) despite my years of trying to make a living at music , thankfully that jacuzzi hasn t been drained of its hot , frothy , swirling , soothing power the main record in this project , noble beast , is finished and mastered and ready for consumption january 20 it includes natural disaster \( the song that began with the trip to the natural history museum \) and oh no \( the song i chronicled from idea to completion in my previous posts \) editor s note listen to the audio clips at right to hear how oh no progressed this instrumental companion record is something i ve be been meaning to make for years the title selfmockingly alludes to my uneasiness about the usefulness of instrumental music like some heirloom chicken that stumbles over its own plumage or a pug struggling to breathe or a hairless cat , bred for aesthetics not that such creatures are useless they re cute as hell , but sort of beg the question who s to say a creature is noble \? anyway so of course i don t consider instrumental music useless it s good to remind myself when i m having a crisis of purpose and feeling useless that at least i can make something beautiful the piece on useless creatures i m most excited about is called the barn tapes three summers ago i had an engineer friend come out to my barn in western illinois with an old quarterinch tape machine we opened all the doors and windows , hooked up my violin to six amps placed throughout the barn , put microphones inside and out and made four hours of ambient loops they are static in the sense that almost every note in the scale is in each loop and there is almost no forward motion , just this swirling mass of sound this creates a sense of time slowing down so i made a loop for every note in the 12tone scale , major and minor , with the goal of assigning each to a key on a keyboard , creating a new instrument i ve always loved the sound of a tape machine slowing down or speeding up as it creates a satisfying bend or warble to the note much like that sound in an old film when the projector falters a bit we never made a keyboard but instead transferred the 24 loops to 2inch 24track tape and then played it back through an old neve console and performed the mix with the faders , using both hands and occasionally my nose to crossfade between loops the pitch manipulation happened at random because the tape stock we used was 15 years old and warbled quite a bit we also used the varispeed function on the tape machine to slide between keys the result is 10 minutes and 30 seconds of cumulous clouds of sound with sparrows and crickets and cicadas swelling with the faders i hear those summer storms coming over the mississippi or passing north over wisconsin in midaugust i ve included a link to a home video made by xan aranda during one session with dan dietrich engineering there s another track called hot math a lofi recording i made myself in my barn it s an example of a west african polyrhythmic groove i ve been into for years and in this case i was clearly enjoying myself this is elusive stuff it just doesn t work by choreography you just have to be in the right mood it goes on for seven minutes and i intended to shorten it but it just feels too good besides this is my indulgent record we mixed all this in los angeles at bob clearmountain s studio with david boucher , with whom i made the mysterious production of eggs he is tireless and steady and always pushing me to do better some of this record consists of jamming like hot math while some is throughcomposed though none of it is written down the carrion suite is a fourpart piece with todd sickafooose playing bass and glenn kotche playing drums we ran through it twice and went for it it s the most classical sounding of all the tracks it s a collection of all the ideas that come out of me when i m warming up at sound check a little dvorak mixed with gypsynuyorican jazz and afrocuban bach sometimes writing a pop song almost seems like a noble pursuit , perhaps because there s such restraint involved resisting the urge to wail or cut loose and shred this may be one reason why i chose to call the song record noble beast when i start writing and recording a record i try to make sure that the songs i write don t get in the way of making music so there s a dance between words and music and it seems to help having a companion project like this to diffuse the tension between the two next time did writing these posts for measure for measure while i was writing and recording my record end up affecting the songs themselves \?

doubtful that monday s tsunami of hockey news could have been much bigger , broader or of more significance , from stories with industrywide impact \( judge redfield t baum s ruling affirming the nhl s contention that jerry moyes could not sell the coyotes to jim balsillie by the end of this month the huge by nhl standards tv ratings for game 7 \) stories of leaguewide interest \( the penguins stanley cup parade , which drew a crowd estimated at 375 , 000 , a turnout that would please almost any club if it were lucky enough to be a cup winner \) to some of more local import \( the wild s selecting todd richards to be their head coach the end of roy mlakar s 13year tenure as senators president , replaced by cyril leeder , who has been with the sens from day 1 peter chiarelli receiving a contract extension as bruins gm and paul maurice receiving an extension as hurricanes coach oh yeah , and the continuing saga of sid s snub big news but judge baum s decision \( which you can read here \) is the real big news he rejected arguments that he be compelled to allow the team s relocation by june 29 , the expiry date on balsillie s offer to buy the club he also firmly rejected arguments that the league was violating antitrust law by prohibiting the sale and relocation of the club because they did not conform to its rules jim balsillie s public statements trumpet his intention to move the coyotes for the start of next season he wants the league to process his application for sale and transfer of the club , and he wants the league to enter into mediation with him on the matter , which baum encouraged but did not order the court did not approve either our approach or the nhl s , echoed balsillie spokesperson bill walker in a mass email message \( also quoted in the hamilton spectator \) , adding we still think there is enough time for the nhl to approve mr balsillie s application and move the team to hamilton by september the court invited mediation on these issues and mr balsillie is willing to participate in such mediation if the nhl is also willing to do so and , earlier tuesday , his lawyer said balsillie would make another bid on the team  but , why would the nhl accommodate balsillie \? as the toronto star s damien cox points out in his column tuesday , balsillie s wildly effective public relations campaign whipped up considerable antileague sentiment and portrayed supporting his cause as patriotic , as if this difficult legal and financial quagmire needed the added irritation of nationalism thrown into it \( and cox seems very skeptical of that argument anyway , portraying the pr effort as aimed at making his attempt to heist the phoenix coyotes out of arizona seem as though it was a grassroots campaign , the heartfelt desire of the people , rather than a billionaire trying to elbow his way into the exclusive nhl club \) so there s no reason for the nhl to take that path it plans to keep the coyotes where they are for next season , to be run and funded by the league baum scheduled an auction for the club , which will now take place in september , to find a new owner who will keep the team in glendale if none can be found , carrie watters in the arizona republic writes , league attorneys have proposed a second auction would open bidding to those seeking to relocate the team although most of the attention in this matter has focused on the possibility of relocating the team to southern ontario , the fate of glendale has been relegated to an afterthought other than the argument that the nhl is failing there , so it makes more sense to put the coyotes elsewhere but the city of glendale , a party in court opposing the coyotes sale and relocation , would be most damaged by the team s move baum s ruling reviewed glendale s case , which was based on its expenditure of 183 million to finance the arena , which was completed in 2003 , when steve ellman was still the team s owner glendale projected a 30year return of around 750 million from the building and had language inserted in the 30year lease agreement calling for stiff penalties if the coyotes moved before the lease expired the declaration of bankruptcy was a potential way for balsillie and moyes to avoid those penalties but baum didn t rule on glendale s claim to keep the penalties in place he moved , for now at least , that the team isn t going anywhere how and why ellman got to geographically undesirable glendale is a long , tortured story \( which was discussed here in january \) , but it was mostly to spite the politicians of the highly desirable scottsdale location where ellman had originally planned to build his arena ellman and scottsdale quibbled about the demolition of the los arcos mall and debris removal costs ellman didn t get his way and fled to glendale so the coyotes are stuck in glendale , one of a number of missteps that led the nhl to this lovely monthlong battle that detracted from the league s premier events , the stanley cup playoffs and final but monday s ruling , though it sustained the status quo , has not fixed this situation the team will probably continue to drift competitively , with a number of good young players who need to mature , and is not likely to attract any significant free agents they will still probably lose lots of money this year and now it will be all the owners money , not moyes s having been dragged through bankruptcy court has done nothing to improve the club s image or the attractiveness of the market for a potential future owner it s still a mess the difference is the league can now steer the efforts to clean the mess without fearing that the club will be hijacked and deposited where it would infringe on the rights of two other clubs and if it s at all in tune with reality , the league should also begin the study that commissioner gary bettman has maintained it has yet to do , assessing the viability of placing another team in southern ontario
los angeles each time ambled toward home plate friday night , he stirred memories runners were in scoring position , the home team trailed and a sellout dodger stadium crowd rose as one , first with a roar , then with chants of manny ! manny ! as he dug in at the plate these were the types of moments , with playoff implications , that captivated this city last season when ramirez s presence as much as his big bat drove the to their first postseason series victory in 20 years but this season , as the playoffs approach , the question is not so much if ramirez can carry the dodgers , but can the dodgers carry ramirez \? after a feeble september , in which he batted 229 , ramirez had an ignominious start to october in friday night s 43 loss to colorado , he had his first fourstrikeout game with the dodgers and stranded runners in scoring position in every atbat entering saturday night s game , the dodgers' lead over the rockies in the national league west was one game with two to play although both teams have clinched playoff berths , the division winner will have homefield advantage throughout the playoffs boos , unimaginable a year ago , rained from every nook of the stadium even mannywood after three of his strikeouts friday the exception came in the third inning during a basesloaded atbat , when the crowd like ramirez for several seconds did not realize he had swung at the third strike , which forced him to suppress a sheepish grin as he turned toward the dugout it s definitely a concern , manager said he just does n't look comfortable up there we obviously need him the only thing i can do is write his name in there , pat him on the back and expect better things to happen the arrival of the playoffs will bring increased scrutiny on the origins of his slump has his swing become too long \? is he hampered since being hit on the hand by a pitch in late july \? is it simply the inevitable ebb and flow of a baseball season \? or is it the elephant in the room \? when you have served a 50game suspension for taking a banned female fertility drug one used in conjunction with steroids and your name is subsequently linked to an earlier positive drug test , you are not just another slumping 36yearold power hitter when you get suspended , you have to understand that there s a whole lot of stuff that goes with it fair or not fair , torre said i think he knows that sitting in front of his locker stall before the game , ramirez politely declined to discuss his slump , preferring to turn his attention to a bowl of oats , bananas and strawberries afterward , he leaned back in his chair and took questions , but shed little light today , i had a bad day , ramirez said but remember , they did n't make rome in one day i know i'm one of the best hitters in the league i'm just going to come tomorrow and be patient asked what gives him this confidence , ramirez said with a smile , all you 've got to do is check my police report and see that i'm a good hitter as for the fans' boos , i have no control over that , he said in spanish part of ramirez s success and his charm has been his ability to laugh at the game , and himself manny being manny can bring an air of lightness to a clubhouse and confidence to a lineup it did when he arrived in los angeles , just as it did when he created an uproar in boston when he declared that it was not the end of the world if the red sox trailing cleveland by three games to one in the 2007 american league championship series lost the series they did not , and they won the world series but just as that attitude belies the seriousness with which ramirez works at hitting , others wonder if he is more affected than he is letting on he does a good job of making a joke out of everything , but if you 're a human being , some of those things are going to get to you , said rockies reliever joe beimel , who played for the dodgers last season he s not a robot he has feelings and emotions when he came last year , he brought his bat and a confident attitude that rubbed off on people i imagine it gets pretty tough sometimes , especially when everybody puts the load on you it s a lot of responsibility to have put on your shoulders the dodgers played well without ramirez , going 2921 during his suspension , a sign that their young players were growing up but lately they look like a flawed team the rotation looks to be the shakiest in the playoffs with the journeyman randy wolf , who has never pitched in the playoffs , and the 21yearold clayton kershaw slated to open the playoffs against philadelphia or st louis outfielder andre ethier is batting 189 against lefthanded pitchers catcher russell martin , coming off backtoback allstar appearances , is hitting 250 , 35 points below his career average casey blake , the veteran third baseman , played friday night for the first time in 10 days because of a bothersome hamstring and matched ramirez s four strikeouts scouts who have followed the dodgers began noticing more than a month ago that teams were beginning to challenge ramirez more frequently inside since his return from the suspension the september struggles of ramirez , who had 4 homers and 13 rbi in the month , have only emboldened pitchers people are n't afraid of him anymore , one scout said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly those speaking publicly were more circumspect he s one of those hitters who s one swing away from being hot , colorado manager jim tracy said when you have a star offensive player like that , that is as good a breakingball hitter as he is , and he hits the fastball like he does , you 're not allowed to make bad pitches to a guy like that and get away with it i do n't care if his batting average right now looks like it s room temperature , you 're going to pay for it but when ramirez came to the plate in the first inning with ethier at second base after a double , rockies pitcher ubaldo jimenez did not walk him or pitch delicately surely the approach a year ago instead , jimenez fired three fastballs , at 100 , 98 and 96 miles per hour two were up under ramirez s hands and none were greeted with a full swing all were strikes in his final atbat , ramirez was late on a much more pedestrian pitch a belthigh 86mph fastball that reliever rafael betancourt left over the plate as he dressed at his locker stall afterward , ramirez slipped into jeans , pulled on a tanktop tshirt and rummaged around for his shirt after rifling through his belongings , leading to a moment of exasperation , he managed to find it if only the same could be said for his swing
one of the few emotionally searing moments in the courageous heart of irena sendler , a holocaust movie oddly devoid of them , occurs when the drama is done the face of the real heroine on whom the story is based appears on screen , her words paying tribute to the jewish mothers forced to part with their children during the war and the christian women who gave safe harbor to those sons and daughters irena sendler , who died last year at 98 , was responsible for saving the lives of 2 , 500 jewish children during world war ii , smuggling them out of the warsaw ghetto and delivering them to polish catholic families who reared them until they could be reunited with their parents after the war in 2007 she was nominated for the nobel peace prize but lost to al gore the courageous heart of irena sendler \( a hallmark hall of fame presentation , to be shown sunday on cbs \) recounts her story with none of the zeal , passion , terror and chaos that her mission involved the producers strive for a solemnity that cannot be called maudlin \( as if there were a vast appetite for cool popcultural treatments of the holocaust \) and wind up with something that feels lazy , as if they believed the project s noble goals were enough to carry it when sendler initially comes up with the idea of clandestinely shepherding jewish children out of the ghetto , she meets a measured , predictable brand of resistance wherever she goes take them out \? her mother inquires is that what you are thinking \? past the gestapo \? the german soldiers \? the jewish police \? how is that possible \? you are a social worker a priest tells her that what she plans is too dangerous another mother says it is impossible for women to relinquish their children willingly all of these moments are included , i imagine , so that anyone who might be under the impression that circumventing the ss was really no biggie can be set straight once and for all is sendler , and marcia gay harden , fresh from her strange sexpot litigator on damages , plays her mother , quiet , purposeless and barely present , draped in an afghan ms paquin s plain face , the kind on which conscientiousness is so easily registered , makes her well suited to the role , but her performance suggests that she does n't agree she seems listless and somewhere else , as if she were missing the vampire lust she embodies on true blood , the hbo series in which she stars perhaps this explains why she seems to find her spark only during the movie s lessthannecessary romantic subplot irena sendler has been called the female oskar schindler , and the movie proves that yes , indeed , she possessed a courageous heart it is a shame , then , that the film is all weak bones the courageous heart of irena sendler cbs , sunday night at 9 , eastern and pacific times 8 , central time directed by john kent harrison written by mr harrison and lawrence john spagnola , based on the book the mother of the holocaust children by anna mieszkowska brent shields , jeff most and jeff rice , executive producers jerzy zielinski , director of photography henk van eeghen , editor jan a p kazcmarek , composer produced by hallmark hall of fame productions with anna paquin \( irena \) , goran visnjic \( stefan \) , michelle dockery \( eva \) , danuta stenka \( hannah \) , rebecca windheim \( karolina \) , sergei marchenko \( jasio \) , paul freeman \( monsignor godlewski \) , leigh lawson \( rabbi rozenfeld \) , marcia gay harden \( janina sendler \) and nathaniel parker \( dr majkowski \)
jenin , west bank visiting israel , i 've been peppered with questions from israelis and palestinians about where their peace process will fit in among president obama s priorities my guess , i 've answered , is that president obama has three immediate priorities banks , banks and banks and none of them are the west bank that said , once obama is able to think afresh about the middle east , he will find that the bush team has left an interesting legacy here 140 , 000 us soldiers doing nationbuilding in iraq and one us soldier actually a threestar us army general doing nationbuilding in the west bank we need a better balance those us soldiers in iraq can take pride in the recent iraqi elections , which have strengthened the more secular and centrist parties but we have to wait and see if the losers in this election take their defeat peacefully and whether the winners can actually produce better governance the iraqi elections , though , are a rare example of arabs getting a chance to build their own future from the bottom up , and i continue to root for them palestinians need the same chance you ca n't have a twostate solution without two states , and today the palestinian authority in the west bank , which still supports a twostate deal , does n't have the institutions of a state , particularly an effective police force therefore , my hope is that obama will focus not only on peace plans from the top down , but also on institutionbuilding from the bottom up the best way to isolate hamas in gaza is to build the palestinian authority in the west bank into a decent government with steadily expanding control over its territory that s exactly what the one us army officer in the west bank , lt gen keith dayton , is up to i accompanied him and his little team to jenin once the most violent city in the west bank to see their work it was quite a scene i watched a company of newly trained , proud and professionallooking palestinian authority troops , standing at attention , ak47 assault rifles at their side , listening with obvious respect to the american general telling them what you 've done has done more to advance the palestinian national project than anything else you took care of your people at a difficult time that is how the security forces of a country behave no , you do n't see that every day general dayton was addressing the second special battalion of the palestinian national security force , or nsf it was trained by the jordanian police in a program overseen by the us security coordinator a k a dayton he was originally assigned to help reform palestinian security by the bush team in 2005 , but only got the funds to do so after hamas took over gaza in 2007 some 1 , 600 palestinian nsf troops have since graduated , and 500 are now in training schooled in everything from riot control to human rights , the nsf is the only truly professional force controlled by the palestinian president , mahmoud abbas the israeli army , originally dubious about the dayton mission , has come to respect it and is now allowing it to expand to hebron what really got israel s attention was that during the threeweek israelhamas war in gaza , the west bank never blew up , largely because nsf troops allowed widespread protests but kept palestinian demonstrators from clashing with israeli soldiers general dayton is our friend , said col radi abu asida of the nsf now we have excellent training now we have professionalism in our security work we told the people during the gaza demonstrations , you can protest , but you must do it in a modern way' unfortunately , funding for dayton s work secured by two farsighted us house members , nita lowey and gary ackerman runs out soon that would be a tragedy before the nsf was deployed there was chaos here , said mohammed abu bakr , a jenin wedding shop owner , referring to the security vacuum after the collapse of the arafat regime everyone wanted to fight with everyone else now everything is organized the dayton mission a rare bright spot in a broken landscape is the ground floor we need to build upon the issue is not just territory , but how we fill that territory , said gidi grinstein , the president of the israeli think tank , the reut institute jenin is important this is the beginning of capacitybuilding , which leads to institutionbuilding , which leads to statebuilding , which leads to independence but the legitimacy of the palestinian police depends on the peace process moving forward and palestinians being ceded control , by israel , over more territory as they prove themselves , he added otherwise , they are seen as a tool to promote the occupation and will be delegitimized and attacked so it is important to have george mitchell , the us special envoy to the middle east , steadily pushing the diplomacy from above , but nothing will happen without vastly increasing us efforts from below to help west bankers build a credible governing capacity do that , and everything is possible do n't do it , and nothing is possible

nashville before joe flacco led the march that advanced the in the playoffs , before he stepped forward in the pocket and fired a pass toward his favorite target , he remained oblivious to the stage or the setting or the stakes the stage american football conference divisional playoff game , with flacco s sixthseeded ravens playing topseeded tennessee the setting score tied at 1010 , late in the fourth quarter , nearly 70 , 000 fans screaming and waving powderblue towels at lp field the stakes win and advance to the afc championship game win and become the first rookie quarterback in nfl history to record two playoff victories oblivious as always , the man teammates call joe cool considered none of that for all he let on afterward , he could have been back in college at delaware or in high school in new jersey , instead of on a national stage , playing in the most important game of his young career same as any other drive , flacco said the \( same as any other \) drive started at the ravens' 24yard line the baltimore offense , which had spent most of the day stumbling and fumbling and punting , faced a thirdand2 from the 32 on the previous seven third downs , the offense had failed to convert yet there came flacco , stoic and expressionless and possibly aided by officials who did not penalize him for delay of game despite the play clock s running down to zero flacco s teammates say he never feels the perceived kind of pressure , but on this play , he sensed pressure in the pocket , real pressure from the ' defense , closing in flacco stepped forward and launched a deep pass down the middle of the field , into a narrow space , aimed a tad too high tight end todd heap leaped to make the grab , securing a gain of 23 yards that led to the winning field goal and a 1310 victory after the game , heap stood in the locker room surrounded by reporters how can a rookie quarterback make that kind of play , they kept asking heap said it came down to something simple , like flacco s eyes heap had searched them before the game , looking for nervousness or awe he found nothing , same as always , the best possible of signs you read his eyes , and there is nothing to read , heap said you are looking at him , and you are thinking , does anything faze this guy \? the answer , apparently , is no even though flacco did not play organized football until seventh grade or that he transferred from the university of pittsburgh after sitting on the bench or that he starred at delaware , far from the spotlight that shone on him saturday the ravens loved flacco s canonized arm strength , loved the unemotional way with which he compartmentalized football on the field and carried himself off it they selected him the first round , making flacco the first quarterback taken there from the football championship subdivision since 1995 , when steve mcnair of alcorn state was selected third over all by the houston oilers in training camp , flacco was third on the ravens' quarterback depth chart only after an injury knocked down kyle boller and an illness grounded troy smith did flacco become the starter , and only then right before the season in his first five games , he threw one touchdown pass and sprayed seven interceptions to grateful defensive backs over the final 11 regularseason games , though , flacco tossed 13 touchdown passes and 5 interceptions and , more important , led the ravens to nine wins one turning point came when cam cameron , the team s offensive coordinator , met with the rookies before baltimore s game against miami on oct 19 he looked into flacco s eyes , same as heap had saturday , and implored him to lead the ravens to lead them right into the playoffs he led them that day against the dolphins , and he led them saturday against the titans he s going to be a good one , tony brown , a titans defensive tackle , said after saturday s game the guy kept his poise all day like the ravens as a whole , flacco turned in an ugly performance saturday but made just enough decisive plays to will his team to victory he completed 11 of 22 passes for 161 yards and a touchdown , but three of those completions made the difference in the first quarter , flacco heaved a deep ball down the right sideline to receiver derrick mason for a 48yard touchdown pass that tied the score at 77 i may be 34 , mason said , but i can still get behind you i got behind the defensive back , and joe put it right on the money in the third quarter , flacco completed a 37yard strike to receiver mark clayton , leading to a matt stover field goal that gave the ravens a 107 lead in the fourth quarter , flacco found heap , and there he had it three plays , three deep passes , three scores and 108 very important yards titans running back lendale white said his team would beat the ravens 9 out of 10 times but on saturday , tennessee did not because of a ravens defense that forced three turnovers , because of the titans' own mistakes and because of a rookie quarterback named flacco , who lost out to atlanta quarterback matt ryan for offensive rookie of the year , who faced veteran signalcallers the last two weeks in chad pennington and kerry collins , and who has outplayed all of them we 've been confident in ourselves all year , flacco said it does n't matter to us we 're going to go out there and battle the crowd , battle the other team and give our best that s what we did today same as any other day same as any other drive

location philadelphia nickname owls last year , the three teams with an owl mascot were predicted to finish in the following order temple \( no 105 \) , rice \( no 104 \) and florida atlantic \( no 68 \) this year , i predict temple to be the best owls in the fbs the great horned owl , if you will last year s ranking  no 105  what was said last year  after a threegame improvement in 2007 , temple expects another successful fall but are the owls an above500 team \? their schedule may allow them to break that way , but a number of things must go the owls way for such a previously unthinkable scenario to occur first , temple must take care of business at home , as mentioned the outofconference slate , featuring two bcs conference teams in connecticut and penn state , also has two games against service academies if the owls are to finish over 500 , they will need to sweep army and navy i don t think temple can beat navy , despite the departure of paul johnson , so even matching last season s 44 conference mark will not give temple a winning season reranking no 86 2008 record and recap \( 57 , 44 \) yes , temple did match 2007 s 44 mark in mac play , and did add an extra victory by defeating army in nonconference play it still wasn t enough to push the owls into bowl eligibility , though the team did post its best finish since going 74 in 1990 but there is no question that this was the most competitive temple team since the program joined the big east in 1991 the five wins the most since that 1990 season matched the program s output over the previous three seasons combined the owls scored 281 points on offense , the program s most since scoring 308 in 1986 \( when , amazingly , the team went 011 \) on defense , the team allowed 277 points , only the second time the owls have given up fewer than 300 points in a season since 1992 of the team s seven losses , only one \( a 453 loss at penn state \) came by more than 10 points in its six other defeats , temple lost by 3 points \( to connecticut \) , 2 , 4 , 10 , 6 and 3 three of those losses came on the final play of the game \( more on this in a moment \) looking at the team s annual improvement under golden \( from one win in 2006 \) , and taking into account the 15 starters and countless contributors returning from last year s team , is there any doubt that temple is the trendy pick to take the mac east division away from buffalo in 2009 \? high point i was impressed by temple s 1410 victory over ohio yes , the owls were outplayed , and yes , the team racked up only 143 yards of total offense but after losing so many close games , it was important for tu to pull out a close game like this in mac play the offense was not great in 2008 , as illustrated in the win over ohio , but the owls did gain 437 yards of total offense in a 5552 shootout win over eastern michigan that game was followed by a 276 victory over akron in the season finale , giving temple two straight wins to end the season low point oh , those narrow defeats must have had temple fans losing their hair let s count them down connecticut , by 129 in overtime buffalo by 3028 \( one of the best finishes of the season \) western michigan , by 73 central michigan , by 2414 , temple s widest margin of defeat in mac play navy by , 3327 in overtime and kent state , by 4138 if temple takes just two of those games or merely the buffalo game it is likely the east division champ tidbit even though the owls were plus4 in point differential last fall \( 281 scored to 277 allowed \) , tu is minus1 , 179 for the decade , having scored 1 , 853 points and given up 3 , 032 from 20036 , temple never allowed fewer than 393 points in a season , which equates to 323 points a game over a 12game season its worst defensive performance came in 2005 , when temple allowed 498 points in 11 games that s a 453 points per game average tidbit \( dental edition \) temple s school of dentistry , founded in 1863 , is the

season from 20057 only one other fbs team can tout a defensive turnaround as impressive as temple s louisiana tech went from 119th in total defense in 2006 \( 542 total points allowed , 417 per game \) to 52nd last fall \( 237 per game \) not surprisingly , tech went 85 in 2008 , a fivewin improvement over its 310 mark of 2006 returning starters 15 \( 7 offense , 8 defense \) key losses the offense must replace quarterback adam dimichele , the 2008 team mvp the former penn state transfer and pennsylvania prep legend started 26 games over his three years with the owls , missing games only because of a number of injuries as a senior , dimichele missed three games because of injury he sat out a combined seven games as a junior and senior his senior year was his best 1 , 911 yards and 19 passing touchdowns , both career highs , as well as careerlow six interceptions \( in 231 attempts \) dimichele added three touchdowns on the ground , also an individual high along the line , the graduation of alex derenthal opens the center spot up to competition for the first time in five years derenthal made 47 consecutive starts from 20058 , a school record , and earned allmac secondteam honors as a senior it was the first time derenthal was named an allconference performer fellow linemen andre douglas \( 24 career starts \) , a transfer from rhode island , and jabari ferguson \( 14 starts \) must also be replaced at wide receiver , bruce francis graduated as the alltime school leader in touchdowns with 23 his 13 as a senior also set a school record , as did the 38game reception streak to end his career his 45 receptions , 687 yards receiving and touchdown total led the team , the second consecutive season francis had done so losses on the defensive line are troubling first , the owls lost tackle terrance knighton , the only firstteam allmac selection in school history knighton earned that honor as a senior , when he tallied 54 tackles \( 75 for loss \) and a sack however , he could have very well been an allmac pick as both a sophomore \( 57 tackles , 3 sacks \) and a junior \( 56 , 2 sacks \) knighton was lost to graduation the wouldbe senior junior galette was recently dismissed from the team for a violation of rules , robbing the owls of its most talented pass rusher galette , he was also suspended for the final four games of 2008 , finished his junior season first on the team in both tackles for loss \( 10 \) and sacks \( 75 \) remember , he reached those totals in only eight games tough losses both , and while the owls have depth on the defensive front \( eight returning players with at least nine games experience \) , it will be difficult to replace the lost production one 2008 starter is lost in the secondary cornerback evan cooper jr but tu lost contributors in georg coleman , richard sheppard , tommie williams and daryl robertson , the last because of a violation of team rules the only unit that worries me in terms of its losses is the front four however , as mentioned , the team does bring back eight contributors players to watch the owls may have the youngest offensive line in the fbs , as the postspring depth chart features three sophomores and a pair of juniors in starting roles yes , the group may be young , but it s experienced on the left side of the line , the sophomores pat boyle \( tackle \) and wayne tribue \( guard \) started a combined 13 games as true freshmen boyle s twin , sean , who also played as a true freshman , currently stands as the leader to replace derenthal in the middle four owls are competing for the starting running back job , a position that very well may see a bycommittee approach temple returns its two leading rushers from a season ago \( keeayre griffin , 394 yards and 5 scores and joe jones , 275 yards \) , as well as two players the senior lamar mcpherson and the sophomore ahkeem smith with a good shot at earning the starting role mcpherson , a converted linebacker , actually sits atop the depth chart heading into the summer the receiver most able to step into francis s large shoes is the senior jason harper , who finished second to the departed recordholder in both receptions \( 33 \) and yards \( 571 \) a season ago a former tailback \( 20067 \) , harper led tu in rushing in 2007 with 586 yards he added 22 receptions for 226 yards that fall , showing the coaching staff what he could do in the passing game also expected to be major contributors at receiver are dy onne crudup , delano green and michael campbell the senior crudup \( 18 receptions last fall \) is the most experienced of that bunch , though green has made his presence felt in the return game stepping in for knighton at tackle is the junior elisha joseph , who had 20 tackles , 35 for loss , as a threegame starter last fall he ll join returning starters andre neblett \( nose tackle \) and the sophomore adrian robinson \( end \) along the temple defensive front the sophomore morkeith brown is one potential replacement for galette at end another is the senior brian sanford \( 31 tackles , 2 sacks \) , who started at end a season ago but was scheduled to move inside to nose tackle in his final season there are no question marks at linebacker , where the owls return all three of their 2008 starters the senior alex joseph , the team s secondleading tackler last fall \( 87 , 35 for loss \) , mans the middle he will be flanked by the juniors amara kamara \( 67 , 2 sacks \) and elijah joseph depth comes in the person of the senior john haley \( 43 tackles , 3 sacks \) , who started games at both middle and outside linebacker a season ago temple will not lack for experience in the secondary the team brings back two cornerbacks with starting experience the senior anthony ferla and the junior jamal schulters as well as the talented sophomore jared williams safety is also in good hands the junior jaiquawn jarrett , the team s leading tackler in 2008 \( 88 stops , 3 interceptions \) , returns at free safety , where he ll be pushed for playing time by the senior wilbert brinson and the sophomore kevin kroboth the team welcomes back the senior dominique harris \( 66 tackles , 3 picks \) at strong safety position battle to watch the owls have two players competing to replace dimichele at quarterback both have starting experience the junior vaughn charlton started a combined seven games from 20067 , often as an injury replacement for dimichele he threw for 417 yards and 2 scores as a true freshman in 2006 , after he was mired in a preseason battle with dimichele for the starting role , and 808 yards and 3 scores in 2007 charlton was productive as a sophomore , minus the season finale against western michigan , when he went 6 for 25 for 92 yards in a 163 loss golden redshirted charlton last fall to give him two seasons as the potential starter to earn the starting role , charlton must outduel the sophomore chester stewart , whose rookie season saw him throw for 524 yards on 50 percent passing obviously , he had his struggles , as shown by his 47 touchdowntointerception ratio the two were neck and neck through the spring , so the position battle will continue through the summer and into fall practice 2009 schedule  sept 3 villanova sept 19 penn state sept 26 buffalo oct 3 eastern michigan oct 10 ball state oct 17 army oct 24 toledo oct 31 navy nov 5 miami university nov 13 akron nov 21 kent state nov 27 ohio game \( s \) to watch in nonconference play , the owls must at worse get a split against the service academies if temple were to go 53 in the mac , going 22 in its nonconference slate will make the difference between playing in a bowl game or staying home in conference , i see buffalo and ohio as temple s biggest rivals for the east division crown season breakdown prediction i doubt we ll see an easier schedule i see only one game where temple will be outclassed \( penn state \) , and only one other game where , as of now , i m predicting temple to lose \( navy \) other than that \? there is no doubt that temple can play with , and defeat , the other 10 teams on its schedule will it \? no , the owls aren t going 102 but this team could win eight games , though seven , with five coming in mac play , seems like the more logical prediction i believe that the team will be very strong on defense \( perhaps the best in the mac \) and that this unit will carry what looks like a pedestrian offense of course , if temple can get a better effort out of its running game , the offense could be much better i remain concerned about the quarterback spot , though charlton or stewart could excel once given a greater opportunity as the starter i have temple winning the mac east division with a 75 record with the potential of breaking through completely with an 84 finish and reaching the mac title game this will be the best temple team in nearly 20 years dream season the owls burst through with a 93 season , earning the east division crown and a place in the mac championship game nightmare season expectations have been raised a bit by temple s solid play over the last two seasons , so a slide back to 210 would constitute

when syracuse was at madison square garden in march winning its unforgettable sixovertime marathon against connecticut in the big east tournament quarterfinals , the orange s big three announced their presence loudly point guard jonny flynn contributed 34 points and 11 assists in 67 minutes forward paul harris posted 29 points and 22 rebounds shooting guard eric devendorf poured in 22 points they were the top scorers for a team that lost in the big east final , went to the round of 16 in the ncaa tournament and won 28 games none of them are back , but syracuse s shelves are not bare the orange showed off its potential thursday night , upending no 13 california , 9573 , at the garden in the semifinals of the 2k sports classic benefiting coaches vs cancer syracuse \( 30 \) , which received a careerhigh 22 points from the sophomore point guard scoop jardine and 17 points , 11 rebounds and 6 blocks from the junior forward wes johnson , advanced to play friday against no 6 north carolina , the defending national champion , which defeated no 15 ohio state , 7773 , in the late game we feel better about this year s team than last year s team , said syracuse guard andy rautins everybody is so unselfish everybody is going within the offense and we have a great identity as a hardworking defensive team rautins has moved in as a fulltime starter for coach jim boeheim after starting 10 games last season , when he hit 102 3pointers then there is the athletic 67 johnson , a transfer from iowa state he started two seasons for the cyclones , earning a spot on the big 12 s allrookie team as a freshman johnson is averaging 147 points and 73 rebounds so far after sitting out last season two people are playing the part of flynn , a lottery pick by the timberwolves brandon triche , a freshman , has been starting at the point , but is sharing the role with jardine , who sat out last season with an injury arinze onuaku , a 69 senior centerforward , and a 69 junior power forward , rick jackson , are returning starters who provide toughness inside they 're big , strong and long , said mike montgomery , cal s secondyear coach the bears \( 21 \) were the preseason pick to win the pacific10 , which they have not done since 1960 montgomery has four starters back , but one of them , the senior forward theo robertson , was out with a foot injury cal went 2211 last season and led the nation in 3point shooting at 427 percent , but syracuse held the bears to 6of20 shooting from long range after trailing by 50 , the orange took control , creating havoc with its 23 zone and turning defense into offense syracuse dominated inside and out jardine lit a spark , hitting two free throws , then turning a steal into a layup to help syracuse take a 3014 lead he had 13 points at the half johnson also made his presence felt in the first half with 10 points , 7 rebounds and 4 blocks only 14 points by the senior point guard jerome randle and the orange s wayward freethrow shooting \( 10 of 19 \) kept the bears in the neighborhood in the first half , which ended with syracuse leading , 4433 randle finished with 25 points , but the orange opened the margin to 24 in the second half i think we 're starting to learn offensively how to work with our big guys , boeheim said we have n't really done that the last couple of years in the second game , ohio state \( 21 \) trailed north carolina \( 40 \) by as many as 19 points in the second half , but the buckeyes staged a furious rally to cut the lead to 7573 on a 3pointer by the junior guard jon diebler with 113 seconds left the sophomore point guard larry drew ii countered with two free throws to clinch the outcome it was a unique game in the sense that they are strong on the perimeter and they would like to have more depth and size upfront , and we are the opposite , north carolina coach roy williams said we have depth and size upfront and we would like to have more depth on the perimeter he added i liked our competitiveness tonight it is a very good basketball team we beat i think we have a good chance of being a very good basketball team i wanted it to come sooner than it is coming to us
witham , england like many new housing developments in these troubled times , retirement community is not currently bursting with tenants but it is keeping up its standards , said a spokesman for baker tilly , the receiver that took over when the owner went bankrupt the gardens are free of weeds the 24hour security service is still in place the appliances are in good repair we 're committed to making sure that the resident is well looked after and that he has all the support he needs , said dipesh patel , a baker tilly spokesman yes , the resident there is just one his name is les harrington , and since last year he has been the only person living in the homebridge complex , of 58 units on 24 acres someday he hopes to get a neighbor it would be nice if , when you 're out there and it s dark , you could see someone with their lights on or hear the sound of someone s television set to music , said mr harrington , 86 it would be nice to have people , someone just sitting there chatting to you , what they want to do , their families anything on the other hand , because there is no one else to give attention to , mr harrington gets a great deal of attention from the people who work at the complex he is the exclusive concern of a staff of three , who have taken a proprietary interest in his wellbeing mr harrington , who served in the navy in world war ii , worked for 32 years as a van driver for the daily express , and has the paper delivered every morning keith has told me , if that paper is n't off your doorstep every day by 8 30 , i'm coming in to check up on you , ' he said of homebridge s handyman similarly , when mr harrington s teenage grandson visited one evening with a friend , the security guard on duty immediately telephoned to make sure the pair were guests , not marauders but it is still weird to be the only person living in a complex meant for many homebridge , built on the site of a former hospital , was supposed to be home to a thriving community of senior citizens living in 34 separate apartments and in 24 suites in a central building there is a handsome dining room and a comfortable lounge for eating , meeting and socializing for several exciting months , three women moved into some of the suites i used to go over after lunch , and we 'd play tennis and bowls on the wii screens , mr harrington said then the women moved out now the rooms are all deserted , casualties of a recession that has flattened britain s real estate market the communal rooms give off a toonew smell and have the strange sort of emptiness you find in sciencefiction movies , in communities whose populations have mysteriously vanished the other day , four tables in the dining room were set for dinner in the lounge , plush armchairs were grouped amiably around a silent television set popular paperbacks crowded the bookshelves they were going to be arranging trips out , as a social thing , said mr harrington s daughter , sherri kent but obviously , because no one moved here , it has never really happened not that there has n't been interest from prospective tenants , with some even putting down deposits but every time , something has happened to derail the sale , and the expected neighbors have failed to materialize mr harrington bought his apartment for several hundred thousand pounds he ca n't remember exactly how much in 2007 , just before the recession came his late wife , doris , had , or lou gehrig s disease , and they could no longer remain in their old house also , mrs harrington was worried about the future she wanted to live here so that when she left dad , she knew he 'd be all right and there would be other people to talk to , mrs kent said when they moved in , keith , the handyman , volunteered to put up a set of shelves for mrs harrington s lovingly collected royal doulton china figurines nobody will ever know what pleasure it gave her in her last three months of life to look up and see that there , mr harrington said mrs harrington died in 2008 , three weeks before the couple s 61st wedding anniversary mr harrington is extremely active and comes from a generation that does not believe in lying around moping and feeling sorry for yourself he sees a great deal of his two daughters and four grandchildren , who live here in witham , a quiet town in essex , in southeast england he walks to the gym and works out three days a week , and stops in most days at the offtrack betting parlor the author of several short stories published in women s magazines , he is revising his first novel , barney , a romantic adventure about a pilot named frank barnes , set in world war i when prospective tenants come to homebridge , mr harrington always shows them around but none of the apartments can be sold until a new company buys the development , said mr patel of baker tilly that leaves mr harrington with no immediate hope of getting his own neighbor my dad does like a chat , mrs kent said i would like him to have someone his own age to talk to
with a car carrying syringes , ampules of human growth hormone , a drug extracted from calves' blood and a macintosh laptop , mary anne catalano tried to enter the united states through buffalo three months ago , federal documents say catalano , who works for dr , told federal investigators that the plan was for her to meet up with her boss after she crossed the border , said the documents , a federal criminal complaint border authorities had previously tried to prevent galea from entering into the united states with medical equipment and , as a result , had flagged him , she told the authorities when catalano pulled up to the border in a nissan rogue , an american border inspector asked her whether she had any items to declare , the documents said she responded by saying that she had medical supplies the authorities then searched the car , finding the drug paraphernalia and the laptop , which had medical files related to several professional athletes catalano was arrested and immediately began cooperating with the authorities a month later , the authorities in canada raided galea s office in toronto in the united states he is under investigation by the federal authorities , who are seeking to determine whether he has provided performanceenhancing drugs four drugrelated charges were brought against him in canada on wednesday it was seven years ago that the federal government began its first major investigation into the distribution of such drugs to athletes that investigation was sparked by the decision of , an internal revenue service agent , to rummage through the trash of the bay area laboratory cooperative in the middle of the night what remains to be seen is whether the search of the car will become the equivalent of novitzky s search of the trash , leading to disclosures that match those that grew out of the lengthy , and now legendary , balco investigation in the balco case , numerous athletes were interviewed by federal investigators and summoned before a federal grand jury to answer questions about their knowledge of balco and its steroiddistribution activities the athletes were not targets of the investigation , but some , including barry bonds , were charged with lying to either investigators or the grand jury and some , including marion jones , went to prison as a result the case involving galea appears to be in its initial stages on wednesday , the royal canadian mounted police brought four drugrelated charges against galea , who has treated many prominent professional athletes , including tiger woods , jose reyes and dara torres the charges relate to actovegin , a drug made from calves' blood that is not approved for sale in canada or the united states the charges include criminal conspiracy to import the drug to both countries , conspiracy to export it to the united states , smuggling and selling an unapproved drug in an interview with the new york times before being charged , galea said he had treated some patients with actovegin , but he was adamant that he had not violated any laws catalano s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment wednesday according to the federal documents , catalano told the authorities after she was arrested that she knew the items she was bringing into the united states were illegal she also said that galea told her that if she were questioned about the purpose of her trip , she should say that she and galea were coming to the united states for a conference with other medical professionals and that none of the equipment in the car was for treating patients she also stated , according to the documents , that galea did not have a license to practice medicine outside of canada galea has said he traveled to florida several times in the past year to treat woods during his recovery from knee surgery the florida department of health has opened an inquiry into whether galea practiced unlicensed medicine in his visits to woods s home , a department spokesman told cbs sports this is one of the interesting areas of law and medicine , said , the codirector of the hall center for law and health at the indiana university school of lawindianapolis , when asked about the issue of galea s medical licensing why should it matter \? you would think it should n't matter because medicine is medicine in canada , the united states or wherever but the law says that unless they have a license , the laws say you cannot directly treat a patient galea has said he treated woods at least four times with plateletrich plasma injections which are not considered doping under the pga s drugtesting program at woods s home in windermere , fla , in february and march of this year the licensing of doctors is mainly controlled by the states the penalties for doctors practicing without a license differ from state to state , orentlicher said in florida , a doctor can be charged with a felony for not having a license and be sentenced to up to five years in prison and fined up to 5 , 000 if convicted a conviction for practicing medicine without a license in new york carries a sentence of one to four years in prison

robert mcnamara , lyndon johnson s icyveined , coldvisaged and rigidly intellectual point man for a war that sent thousands upon thousands of people \( most of them young \) to their utterly pointless deaths , has died at the ripe old age of 93 long after the horror of vietnam was over , mcnamara would concede , in remarks that were like salt in the still festering wounds of the loved ones of those who had died , that he had been wrong , terribly wrong about the war i felt nothing but utter contempt for his concession i remember getting my draft notice in the mid1960s as johnson s military buildup for the war was in full swing i'm not sure what i expected probably that the other recruits would be a tough bunch , that they would all look like john wayne i was staggered on the first day of basic training at fort dix , nj , to be part of a motley gathering of mostly scared and skinny kids who looked like the guys i 'd gone to high school with who looked , basically , pun intended , like me that s who was shipped off to vietnam in droves youngsters 18 , 19 , 20 and 21 many , of course , would die there , and many others would come back forever scarred johnson and mcnamara should have been looking out for those kids , who knew nothing about geopolitics , or why they were being turned into trained killers who , we were told , could coldbloodedly smoke the enemy good shot ! and then kick back and smoke a marlboro many would end up weeping on the battlefield , crying for their moms with their dying breaths or trembling uncontrollably as they watched buddies , covered in filth , bleed to death before their eyes sometimes in their arms i was lucky the army sent me to korea , which was no walk in the park , but it was n't vietnam i served in the intelligence office of an engineer battalion but no one could truly escape the war i would get letters from home that would make my heart sink , letters telling me that this buddy had been killed , that that buddy had been killed , that a kid that i had played football or softball with or had gone to the rifle range with had been killed for what \? mcnamara did n't know my sister s boyfriend got shot a very close friend of mine came back from vietnam so messed up psychologically that he killed his wife and himself the hardest lesson for people in power to accept is that wars are unrelentingly hideous enterprises , that they butcher people without mercy and therefore should be undertaken only when absolutely necessary kids who are sent off to war are forced to grow up too fast they soon learn what real toughness is , and it has nothing to do with lousy bureaucrats and armchair warriors sacrificing the lives of the young for political considerations and hollow , flagwaving , riskfree expressions of patriotic fervor mcnamara , it turns out , had realized early on that vietnam was a lost cause , but he kept that crucial information close to his chest , like a gambler trying to bluff his way through a bad hand , as america continued to send tens of thousands to their doom how in god s name did he ever look at himself in a mirror \? lessons learned from vietnam \? none as the times s tim weiner pointed out in mcnamara s obituary , congress authorized the war after president johnson contended that american warships had been attacked by north vietnamese patrol boats in the gulf of tonkin in august 1964 the attack never happened as mr weiner wrote , the american ships had been firing at their own sonar shadows on a dark night but mcnamara , relying on intelligence reports , told johnson that evidence of the attack was ironclad does this remind anyone of the slam dunk evidence of saddam hussein s weapons of mass destruction \? more than 58 , 000 americans died in vietnam and some 2 million to 3 million vietnamese more than 4 , 000 americans have died in iraq , and no one knows how many hundreds of thousands of iraqis even as i was writing this , reports were coming in of seven more american gi s killed in afghanistan a war that made sense in the immediate aftermath of the sept 11 attacks , but makes very little sense now none of these wars had clearly articulated goals or endgames none were pursued with the kind of intensity and sense of common purpose and shared sacrifice that marked world war ii wars are now mostly background noise , distant events overshadowed by celebrity deaths and the antics of sarah palin , mark sanford and the like the obscenity of war is lost on most americans , and that drains the death of robert mcnamara of any real significance
various ideas lurk behind antonietta vicario s our togetherness , which opened at danspace project on thursday night most of them seem to be about unity or community , or perhaps just female bonding however , none of these themes achieve much resonance in a 45minute piece in which ms vicario plays out repetitive scenarios with dryness that might be compellingly rigorous but instead just feels thin our togetherness , by her company , antonietta vicario makes dances , opens with four women \( julie alexander , nicole mannarino , sandy tillett and ms vicario \) , dressed in white sweatpants and tshirts over brightly colored tank tops , their backs to us they are marching emphatically in silence , their legs wide apart , their hips moving side to side , arms swinging loosely eventually , as a low electronic hum begins , two women begin a slow sequence of lunges and simple , synchronized walks and jumps \( the score , by bradley kemp , adds horns to build into a dense , slightly menacing soundscape \) oddly , since ms vicario s biography betrays no hint of allegiance to an earlier guard of moderndance choreographers , this movement is vaguely reminiscent of merce cunningham s clear shapes , bentforward silhouettes and sudden changes of direction during all of this , the whiteclad dancers are moving over six lanes of white paper , laid out so carefully that the brownonwhite pattern made by the masking tape on the paper looks like a moroccan floor motif visually , all that whiteness , amplified by carol mullins s lighting , is quite nice but like many elements in our togetherness , the paper , which is soon slowly rolled up by two dancers and put aside , feels like an idea that has landed in the piece without ever attaching itself imaginatively , conceptually , associatively to the whole so does ms vicario s decision to have the dancers strip down to brightly colored briefs and tank tops at one point , then get dressed again so does the rather amateurish group affirmation \( you are everything , the women repeat , with selfconscious smiles , standing in a tight square toward the end \) so do the repeated marching sequences , which perhaps should force us to seek variation within sameness instead , meaning seems to dissipate rather than accrue the women s togetherness is conveyed literally , but its emotional reverberations remain opaque
washington when a security guard at the united states embassy in kabul , afghanistan , was leaving for breakfast monday morning , he froze at the sight of a crude poster of a rat hanging on his door warning ! the poster said in stark , black letters rats can cost you your job and your family the guard was a whistleblower who had told of security lapses and lewd , drunken bacchanals by fellow workers , sparking an outcry and enraging secretary of state now he wonders whether he should have kept his mouth shut threats are still running rampant here , he said in a telephone conversation from kabul , speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal so even though it looks like state may finally turn things around , no one s ready to celebrate yet such skepticism may be warranted a review of two years of email messages , letters and memos reveals that the state department had long known of the serious problems with armorgroup , the contractor chosen to protect its embassy the complaints went beyond the , the documents show , and included serious understaffing , bullying by management , petty corruption and abusive work conditions in fact , the deficiencies became so severe that they threatened the security of the compound , the documents show , and state department officials withheld payments to armorgroup as a way to compel it to comply with the terms of its agreement on a few occasions , government officials warned the company that if it did not correct the most egregious problems it would lose the fiveyear , 189 million deal yet both times the contract came up for renewal , in 2008 and 2009 , the state department opted to extend it , officials confirmed the troubles with the armorgroup contract , and the state department s frustrated dealings with the company over two years and through two administrations , illustrate how the government has become dependent on the private security companies that work in war zones , and has struggled to manage companies that themselves are sometimes loosely run and do not always play by the government s rules with a stretched military , the government relies on the security companies themselves to vet , train , and discipline the guards , all at the lowest cost it s expensive for the state department to withdraw a contract from one company , rebid the project and award it to a new one , said janet goldstein , a washington lawyer who represents one of the armorgroup whistleblowers so businesses know that once they get a contract , state may ding them around a little bit , but it s not going to fire them the perils of this reliance were most graphically illustrated in iraq in 2007 , when security guards from another contractor , blackwater , were involved in but interviews and documents show that the armorgroup affair , in its mundane , unsavory details , offers perhaps a more representative look inside the troubled relationship between contractors and the government in war zones state department officials acknowledge they had a litany of complaints about the company , none of which , they insist , compromised the security of the embassy but they profess to being deeply embarrassed by reports of parties where security guards were photographed naked , fondling and urinating on each other i 've been doing this for 37 years i'm proud of what i do , said patrick f kennedy , the undersecretary of state for management who oversees outside contractors but , he added , this is humiliating mr kennedy , however , defended the state department s overall handling of the contract the frequent letters of complaint the government sent to armorgroup , he said , were evidence that the department was keeping close tabs on the company the greatest majority of the failures cited in the letters were addressed , he said part of the problem , officials said , was that the guards are housed in a complex six miles from the embassy , camp sullivan , with little oversight by state department officials susan pitcher , a spokeswoman for wackenhut services , the american subsidiary of the danish company that owns armorgroup , referred questions to the state department , saying only that it was cooperating with the government s investigation on monday , the independent commission on wartime contracting in iraq and afghanistan will hold a hearing to examine the state department s oversight of the contract christopher shays , a former congressman and cochairman of the commission , said there was a serious failure on the part of the state department in being unable to compel the contractor to fulfill its commitment the disclosures , which were originally made by a nonprofit organization , project on government oversight , deeply rattled the state department at a staff meeting following the release of the group s report , senior officials said , mrs clinton vented her anger about the lurid pictures karl w eikenberry , a retired army general who became president obama s ambassador to afghanistan last may , was livid , an official said , because he had never been briefed about the problems despite their unease with contractors , officials acknowledged the department had no choice but to keep using them in situations where there is a surge of intense security requirements , it is a real challenge , said jacob j lew , the deputy secretary of state for management and resources we cannot reduce the security presence the state department was not in a buyer s market when it looked for a company to protect its embassy in kabul it picked armorgroup in march 2007 , after its previous choice , mvm , proved unable to marshal the necessary personnel or equipment , officials said of the eight companies that bid for the contract the second time around , only two were deemed technically capable armorgroup was the cheapest the company s most recent contract extension was granted in june this year , after a senate hearing in which one of its executives , samuel brinkley , a wackenhut vice president , said in sworn testimony that his company was in full compliance with the terms of its contract , and a state department official , william h moser , a deputy assistant secretary of state , also under oath , said he was satisfied with the company s performance in interviews , armorgroup whistleblowers said they felt betrayed by the testimony by many measures , they said , things were worse , not better after largely uneventful company barbecues morphed into what have been described as scenes from the lord of the flies , at least a dozen of the men started a document trail of their own , sending email messages and photographs to the project on government oversight according to interviews and those documents , from july 2007 to april 2009 , the state department issued armorgroup at least nine warnings , nearly one every other month , about contract violations that ranged from mundane concerns about the company s ability to keep accurate personnel logs , to more critical concerns about corruption among company managers and the hardships faced by sleepdeprived , underpaid guards the majority of them from nepal who could not understand simple commands in english while the gurkhas were largely the source of the language problems , the lewd hazing rituals were largely the activity of the native english speakers , a mix of americans , south africans , new zealanders and australians in 2008 , after armorgroup was acquired by the danish company , g4s , wackenhut informed the state department it was taking control of the kabul contract , and promised to fix any problems government officials agreed to give the new owners a chance according to their own correspondence , their optimism seemed to dim fairly quickly on aug 22 , 2008 , the state department wrote to armorgroup to express concerns that staffing shortages were so severe the company might not be able to provide security after a situation with mass casualties on sept 21 , 2008 , the state department deducted 24 million in payments from armorgroup , warning that its failure to provide a sufficient number of guards gravely endangers the performance of guard services in march 2009 , the department again advised armorgroup that it had grave concerns about staffing shortages , noting that inspectors on a recent tour found 18 guardposts left uncovered in april , it denied armorgroup s request for a third waiver to the requirement that it teach its foreign guards english a month later , without much explanation , armorgroup told the state department that deficiencies relating to language and staffing had been resolved and a month after that , a senior state department official told the senate subcommittee on contracting oversight that despite contractual deficiencies , the performance by armorgroup north america has been and is sound i sat in the audience that day , and shook my head in disbelief , said james gordon , a former armorgroup executive who has filed a whistleblower s lawsuit against the company he says he was forced out for complaining about the problems i knew that conditions at camp sullivan were deteriorating , that the contract continued to be understaffed , that the conditions in kabul were getting more dangerous , and that the us embassy was facing grave threats
in a letter to a british parliamentarian last month , a senior state department official insisted that the united states was doing its utmost to ensure that iraq s government would treat 3 , 400 iranian exiles living at camp ashraf in eastern iraq humanely two weeks later , a clash between the exiles and iraqi police left 11 iranians dead , and 36 were taken into custody by iraqi forces americans troops had guarded the camp since 2003 , but recently handed over responsibility to iraqi forces baghdad promised that the exiles would be protected there is no authoritative version of events , but it does not look as if that promise is being kept the iraqi government claims the exiles threw stones and molotov cocktails when iraqi forces entered the camp , ostensibly to establish a police post the exiles have video showing iraqi forces beating people with clubs and charging them with vehicles the administration s response has been weak officials say they will press iraq to fulfill its promises but can only do so much now that iraq is in charge the camp s residents are members of the people s mujahedeen of iran \( mek \) , which is committed to overthrowing tehran s government saddam hussein welcomed them to iraq during the iraqiran war and they have lived at the camp ever since iraq s shiitedominated government now has good relations with iran and little enthusiasm for the mek the americans are at best ambivalent the group , which some consider a cult , is on the american terrorism list for attacks against the united states \( in the distant past \) and more recently against iran in 2004 , the united states seeking to stabilize iraq recognized the camp s residents as protected persons under the fourth geneva convention , after they signed statements renouncing terrorism and gave up their weapons residents say that washington has now betrayed that commitment they have a legitimate complaint but the mek has also made no effort to reduce tensions with the iraqis the united states should not retake control of camp ashraf but it must warn prime minister nuri kamal almaliki that it will more closely monitor how the exiles are treated iraq s government must formally charge those arrested , give them a fair trial and take steps to avoid a repeat of last month s bloodshed if iraq is determined to close the camp , washington , baghdad and the united nations should develop a process residents are barred from resettling in many third countries because of the group s terrorist designation finding a solution will not be easy , but none of the exiles should be forcibly returned to iran
denver when major league baseball postponed game 3 of the national league division series between the and on saturday , it marked two unusual occurrences first , the postponement was due mostly to the predicted temperature , not actual precipitation second , sporting events in denver , including rockies games , have endured much worse conditions , sometimes creating memorable spectacles if not topnotch performances there have been snowballs thrown at broncos games , eliciting a 49ers kicker to miss and enticing a raiders lineman into the crowd there was a nighttime coloradonebraska football game with the wind chill far below zero and a berth in the orange bowl undecided \( they tied \) even the rockies have played through subfreezing temperatures and snow , including on one opening day none of that will happen this weekend with denver glazed in snow and a gametime forecast of temperatures in the high 20s , saturday night s game 3 was moved to sunday night the temperatures are expected to be in the mid 40s game 4 was moved to monday \( low 50s \) , which had been a day off in the bestof five series , which is tied at a game apiece game 5 , if necessary , remained scheduled for tuesday in philadelphia phillies manager charlie manuel said he woke up on saturday , saw the snow and heard the temperature , and was glad the game was postponed there comes a time when i think the magnitude of the game and what it means and what it s all about , that temperatures can hit a low where you do n't play , he said major league baseball has no temperature threshold for postponing a game , according to patrick courtney , a league spokesman there may be only one other postseason game postponed because of cold the reason given for delaying game 7 of the 1903 world series in pittsburgh while gametime temperatures have not always been noted , the coldest postseason game on record was game 4 of the 1997 world series in cleveland , between the indians and florida marlins it was 35 degrees at the start the rockies once played the montreal expos when the gametime temperature was 28 degrees , on a day \( april 12 , 1997 \) when the official low temperature was 7 snow fell in the middle innings , and an estimated 20 , 000 people attended when denver was awarded an expansion franchise to begin play in 1993 , the effect of the milehigh altitude was a big concern so was the unpredictable weather , particularly in spring and fall on opening day in 1994 , at mile high stadium , the midday temperature was 63 degrees fans wore tshirts when the game started three hours later , it was 51 by the eighth inning , it was 25 degrees and snowing the rockies opened coors field in 1995 , but started their seasons on the road 10 of the next 14 years still , rockies games in denver have been snowed out 12 times 11 in april \( the city s secondsnowiest month , behind march \) and one in september september in denver is typically warm and dry october is usually devoid of rockies games with the extra day this weekend , the phillies rotated their pitching the veteran righthander pedro martinez was expected to start game 3 , but manuel changed to the lefthander j a happ \( 124 , 293 \) , a strong candidate to win rookie of the year rockies manager jim tracy did not alter his rotation jason hammel \( 108 , 433 \) will start for colorado the shift will allow manuel to start the lefthanded cliff lee , the game 1 completegame winner , in game 4 , and place martinez in the bullpen the rockies hit 253 with 56 home runs against lefthanders , and 264 with 134 home runs against righthanders we like lefthand pitchers against colorado , manuel said i think that gives us the strongest way to go about it most of the snowgame memories in denver s consciousness involve the broncos against the 49ers on a monday night in 1985 , a snowball landed near san francisco holder matt cavanaugh as ray wersching attempted a short field goal cavanaugh bobbled the ball , threw incomplete , and the broncos won by a point on a lastsecond field goal in 1999 , after the broncos beat the rival raiders in overtime , oakland cornerback charles woodson was accused of throwing snow at fans , and offensive tackle lincoln kennedy tried to fight fans throwing snowballs at his team no such shenanigans or other weatherrelated memories appear likely during this baseball series and saturday s postponement provides no hint of the weather to expect later in the playoffs , should the rockies advance the last postseason game in denver was oct 28 , 2007 , for game 4 of the world series the gametime temperature was 68 degrees
los angeles two years ago , matt holliday was the face of rocktober , his gamewinning headfirst slide home the enduring image of the colorado rockies' heartstopping run toward the world series in the late afternoon twilight thursday , holliday provided a less endearing image for his new team , the it is the heartwrenching visage of dropped opportunity holliday dropped a soft line drive with two outs in the ninth inning , opening the door for the to steal game 2 of their national league division series and they did so gladly when mark loretta s pinchhit single capped a tworun rally and delivered a 32 victory and a twogamestonone lead heading to st louis the cardinals' fans , long known as the most supportive in baseball , will need to muster every bit of their compassion to pick up a team that after a nearperfect pitching performance by adam wainwright seemed on the verge of evening the series when james loney hit a soft liner into left field absolutely , we stole one , said right fielder andre ethier , whose solo homer was one of three hits the dodgers could manage in eight innings against wainwright i thought it was over show me one person out there who did n't think it was over we needed a little magic it came when holliday came charging in toward the gap as he closed on the ball , he lost it in the bank of lights behind first base the ball missed his glove , bounced off his abdomen and tumbled to the grass holliday then stumbled and fell on his face the cardinals followed suit casey blake battled cardinals closer ryan franklin , fouling off two 32 pitches before drawing a walk ronnie belliard followed with a bouncing single up the middle that brought pinchrunner juan pierre home to tie the score and set dodger stadium quaking after wainwright had quieted the crowd most of the day after a passed ball moved blake and belliard up , russell martin walked , loading the bases loretta , who was 0 for 15 in his career against franklin , delivered a clean single to center holliday , though he had the farthest to run , was one of the first cardinals to reach the dugout i had it , holliday said i was coming in to get it , then all of a sudden it hits the lights you ca n't see obviously , i can catch a ball hit right at me it was n't a lack of effort i just could n't see it in the clubhouse , holliday , who was acquired in july from oakland to provide support behind albert pujols , said several teammates gave him figurative pats on the back i was trying to do my damnedest to pick him up , franklin said the cardinals will now turn to joel pineiro , who won 15 games in the shadow of wainwright and chris carpenter , to keep their season alive he will face vicente padilla on saturday in st louis the dodgers did not appear to need an airplane to get there their clubhouse was as euphoric as if they had clinched the series , perhaps just drier it was the 23rd time this season they won a game in their last inning , and the 12th time they left an opponent on the field it s crazy , said loretta , who called his base hit the biggest of his career you never know in this game it s a crazy game the ending rewrote what had been a masterpiece by wainwright he allowed just three hits , but that does not begin to tell the story of his dominance he struck out seven , walked one and ethier s homer , a blast to center field with two outs in the fourth , was the only blemish until rafael furcal singled with two outs in the sixth martin had the other hit in the eighth , which was the only threat wainwright encountered all day but after he loaded the bases with two outs , wainwright did to matt kemp s bat what he had been doing the hopes of the dodgers all day he left it in pieces one shard of the shattered bat landed behind the pitcher s mound and another behind home plate , but the ball landed harmlessly in the glove of pujols , who stepped on first in the ninth , cardinals manager tony la russa turned to his bullpen , which did its best to provide a dramafree finish the lefthander trever miller retired ethier , who batted 194 against lefties this season , before franklin , the closer , came on to get manny ramirez and induce loney s soft liner toward holliday oh , man , do n't catch it sit fall , loney said , describing his thoughts when the ball left his bat i was surprised the cruel ending also shone a light on the little things that otherwise might be forgotten , particularly loney s cutting down colby rasmus at third after his double had scored mark derosa to put the cardinals ahead , 21 loney cut off a wild relay throw to the plate and nabbed rasmus at third when julio lugo doubled one batter later , it proved to be harmless that was a great play , dodgers manager joe torre said that stopped any further damage the only other dent the cardinals put in starter clayton kershaw was a solo homer by holliday kershaw , a 21yearold lefthander , was not wainwright s equal but was excellent nevertheless he pitched beyond his years , stranding the cardinals in scoring position in five innings of course , that will not be the dropped opportunity that will be remembered i definitely do n't want to go out like this , franklin said
wantagh , ny in the middle of kim sozzi s performance at the nikon at jones beach theater on sunday , the sound dropped out , and it seemed like as good a time as any to listen closely had ms sozzi actually been singing or , you know , just looking the part \? a few seconds passed , the sound was righted , and ms sozzi dug into how did you know \? , her 2005 hit with the group mynt , delivering it in a voice larger and more textured than on record ten years ago she toured with the lilith fair as a singersongwriter today , she s one of the most promising vocalists in club music , a nebulous world that prizes producer over singer , thump over texture , body over mind behind her , clamorous , tightly clustered synths did their best to obscure her , but ms sozzi , a long island native attuned to the power of the moment , was having none of it getting damned with low expectations is but one obstacle to vocalists in the often faceless , nightclubdriven world of dance music ktu s beatstock , the annual concert sponsored by the radio station wktufm \( 1035 \) is saddled with a difficult task to present in a live setting the sort of music that people typically listen to while dancing with no stage in sight like top 40 radio , dance radio is fundamentally agnostic anything that moves quickly passes muster on wktu \( the beat of new york is its tagline \) and other dance stations , that can mean hiphop , pop and rb , but it s club music less a formal genre than a catchall space that sets the playlists apart here are songs that are uptempo , to be sure , but also in a hurry , one beat hammering down before the last one has fully moved out of the way walls of synthesizers give these songs density , and beats are delivered with an almost complete lack of rhythmic complexity this is the stuff of sports arena cheers , big and brute it is also particularly welcoming club music has become a refuge for strong singers who do n't fit obviously into a genre tradition female singers with crisp , featureless voices tend to do well here there s ms sozzi , who last month released just one day \( ultra \) , a relentless album featuring the bouncy feel your love , a regular on wktu queen of this world is natalie horler , the vocalist of the eurodance outfit cascada , which released its third album , evacuate the dancefloor \( robbins \) , on tuesday ms horler is a zippy , uncomplicated singer , punchy when necessary , and coy when called for though it barely scratches the surface of mainstream pop radio , evacuate the dancefloor is one of the year s most energetic pop records it s not connoisseurs' music , but it could be , in the way that the cognoscenti have come around to justin and britney and lady gaga and so on as the last few years of pop criticism have proven , cheesy is a moving target but club music is damned by listenership as much as anything else when goumba johnny , one of the wktu drivetime hosts , asked the beatstock crowd if people from various locales brooklyn , queens , staten island and so on were in the house , manhattan was not mentioned once sleeveless black tshirts that proclaimed 100 guido were for sale at merchandise counters in other words , this is the province of the bridge and tunnel crowd on the other side of the tunnel just as country music has become a soft landing pad for aging rockers , so has the dance floor become an adopted home for rb singers and pop stars early in the show , the backstreet boys performed to flog a new single pitbull , the cubanamerican rapper from miami , has recently been flirting with dance music and , as one of the most famous performers on this bill , was received rapturously also performing here was kelly rowland , late of destiny s child she is featured on the first single from david guetta s pop life \( astralwerks \) , which is to be released next week and which savvily takes the anonymous template of much of the competition and adds stars ms rowland , neyo , , estelle and others during the history of house segment at beatstock , several dlist performers , in the manner of amusementpark revues , crashed through awkward cover versions of dancefloor classics with nothing in common apart from tempo freeze s aeiou , technotronic s pump up the jam , cajmere s percolator , the jungle brothers' i 'll house you but familiarity has weight this collection of unfamous people channeling famous songs was far better received than , say , kevin rudolf , who has had a pair of clubrock hits in the past year , and who performed early in the night to general disinterest in this world covers are no issue they 're practically a requirement at beatstock , cascada covered because the night , by the group , and what hurts the most , by rascal flatts \( yanou , one of the producermembers of cascada , first came to prominence in 2001 with a club version of bryan adams s heaven \) ms sozzi performed a soulful version of heart s alone and the set by rockell , who showed up for beatstock dressed as if she 'd meant to make a quick supermarket run but accidentally ended up on stage , bounced from cover to cover ca n't we try \( dan hill vonda shepard \) to dreamboy dreamgirl \( cynthia johnny o \) to in a dream \( emotion in motion \) in this way beatstock , and by extension club music , is a celebration of collective memory far more than of any individual artist or song nowhere is this more true than in the case of freestyle , the primarily hispanic digitalsoul subgenre that was central to new york s musical identity in the 1980s , and that nurtured a host of singers who could n't find a home in rb or pop though freestyle music has n't been in vogue for more than 15 years , wktu remains committed to it , a preserver of local heritage freestyle gets regular rotation on the air , and at beatstock , several of the genre s stars were booked , including a robust lisa lisa , a remarkably wellpreserved george lamond and a slightly less so stevie b the singer judy torres , who for more than a decade hosted a dedicated freestyle show on the station , closed the night out nostalgia could have carried these artists through their sets , but for the most part they were near the top of their game vocally it was a strong reminder that in the club music of every generation , there are n't just songs in search of dancers , but also singers in search of listeners
the conventional wisdom in new york late last season was that the giants chances at postseason success ended when tight end jeremy shockey suffered a seasonending injury during a 2210 loss to washington on dec 16 , 2007 now we know that was hardly the case shockey s injury gave the rookie tight end kevin boss the opportunity to introduce himself to giants fans once the playoffs began , boss combined with the fellow rookies steve smith and ahmad bradshaw to play major roles in the giants super bowlwinning run , even though none of them were important factors in the team s 106 regular season surprising as it may seem , it is hardly a new concept for teams to be fueled in the postseason by unknown or underutilized players or those back from injury including the giants , the last three super bowl champions have made their runs by scoring big with contributions from unexpected sources in 2005 the steelers dusted off jerome bettis in december and rode him to the super bowl finish line bettis , who had been parked for most of the season \( 186 yards rushing and 2 tds in pittsburgh s first 12 games \) , rushed for 362 yards and 10 tds in the steelers final 8 games in 2006 the colts lost 4 of their final 7 regularseason games , including a 4417 rout by jacksonville in a game in which the jaguars rushed for an astounding 375 yards but the return of safety bob sanders , who missed all but four games in the regular season , transformed indianapolis s postseason defense the colts , who had allowed 2 , 768 rushing yards \( 173 yards a game \) and 360 points during the regular season \( 225 average \) , allowed only 331 rushing yards \( 828 average \) and 65 points \( 163 average \) in their four postseason games if a surprise player theme is going to take hold in the playoffs this season , the early favorite has to be san diego s darren sproles , who filled in for the injured superstar ladainian tomlinson and rushed for 105 yards and 2 touchdowns in the chargers 2317 overtime victory over the colts sproles also had 178 yards in kickoff and punt return yardage another possibility could be arizona s edgerrin james , who lost his starting tailback job to tim hightower in october , but returned to the starting lineup last saturday and played a major role in arizona s victory over atlanta but this weekend s games will show if any of the teams that had firstround byes will have any january surprises up their sleeves
camp leatherneck , afghanistan i'm here in helmand province in southern afghanistan this is the most dangerous part of the country it s where mafia and mullah meet this is where the taliban harvest the poppies that get turned into heroin that funds their insurgency that s why when president obama announced the more than doubling of us troops in afghanistan , this is where the marines landed to take the fight to the taliban it is 115 degrees in the sun , and adm mike mullen , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , is addressing soldiers in a makeshift theater let me see a show of hands , says admiral mullen , how many of you are on your first deployment \? a couple dozen hands go up second deployment \? more hands go up third deployment \? still lots of hands are raised fourth deployment \? a good dozen hands go up fifth deployment \? still hands go up sixth deployment \? one hand goes up admiral mullen asks the soldier to step forward to shake his hand this scene is a reason for worry , for optimism and for questioning everything we are doing in afghanistan it is worrying because between the surges in iraq and afghanistan , we are grinding down our military i do n't know how these people and their families put up with it never have so many asked so much of so few the reason for optimism \? all those deployments have left us with a deep cadre of officers with experience in iraq and afghanistan , now running both wars from generals to captains they know every mistake that has been made , been told every lie , saw their own soldiers killed by stupidity , figured out solutions and built relationships with insurgents , sheikhs and imams on the ground that have given the best of them a granular understanding of the real middle east that would rival any middle east studies professor i 've long argued that there should be a test for any officer who wants to serve in iraq or afghanistan just one question do you think the shortest distance between two points is a straight line \? if you answer yes , you can go to germany , south korea or japan , but not to iraq or afghanistan well , this war has produced a class of officers who are very outofthebox thinkers they learned everything the hard way not in classes at annapolis or west point , but on the streets of fallujah and kandahar i call them the class too dumb to quit i say that with affection and respect when all seemed lost in iraq , they were just too stubborn to quit and figured out a new antiinsurgency strategy it has not produced irreversible success yet and may never but it has kept the hope of a decent outcome alive the same people are now trying to do the same thing in afghanistan their biggest strategic insight \? we do n't count enemy killed in action anymore , one of their officers told me early in both iraq and afghanistan our troops did body counts , la vietnam but the big change came when the officers running these wars understood that rb s \( relationships built \) actually matter more than kia s one relationship built with an iraqi or afghan mayor or imam or insurgent was worth so much more than one kia relationships bring intelligence they bring cooperation one good relationship can save the lives of dozens of soldiers and civilians one reason torture and abu ghraib got out of control was because our soldiers had built so few relationships that they tried to beat information out of people instead but relationshipbuilding is painstaking and that leads to my unease america has just adopted afghanistan as our new baby the troop surge that president obama ordered here early in his tenure has taken this mission from a limited intervention , with limited results , to a full nationbuilding project that will take a long time to succeed if ever we came here to destroy al qaeda , and now we 're in a long war with the taliban is that really a good use of american power \? at least the class too dumb to quit is in charge , and they have a strategy clear areas of the taliban , hold them in partnership with the afghan army , rebuild these areas by building relationships with district governors and local assemblies to help them upgrade their ability to deliver services to the afghan people particularly courts , schools and police so they will support the afghan government the bad news \? this is statebuilding 101 , and our partners , the current afghan police and government , are so corrupt that more than a few afghans prefer the taliban with infinite time , money , soldiers and aid workers , we can probably reverse that but we have none of these i feel a gap building between our ends and our means and our time constraints my heart says mission critical help those afghans who want decent government my head says mission impossible does mr obama understand how much he s bet his presidency on making afghanistan a stable country \? too late now so , here s hoping that the class too dumb to quit can take all that it learned in iraq and help rebuild the country that s been too broken to work
after news came that the boston globe may be sold , we asked six experts in newspaper valuations what they think the newspaper is worth for a column on the subject each gave detailed , thoughtful answers that we thought we would share in full here our experts are mark m edmiston , managing partner , admedia partners rick edmonds , media business analyst , poynter institute john morton , independent newspaper analyst mike simonton , analyst , fitch ratings reed phillips , partner , desilva and phillips ken doctor , analyst at outsell inc mark m edmiston , managing partner , admedia partners anyone saying the boston globe bostoncom has no value is reflecting conventional wisdom but it s not accurate assessment since warren buffett has said that he wouldn t buy a paper company for a 1 , it is easy to take the position that he is right forever \( not many people have made money betting warren is wrong on investment opportunities \) looking at it as snapshot , there is not much more to say taking a longer view , i believe there has to be value in a business that still generates that level of revenue and has one of the most respected brands in journalism the trick is to get from here \( losing 50 million a year \) to there \( a more targeted multidimensional content business that has costs that are lower than revenue \) the issue is whether that effort will leave any money for the times to get , as a purchase price the value of the business is not just what gets paid to the times but that figure plus how much money will it cost to finance the business until key questions are answered such as how far down is the bottom on advertising spending how big a risk is it that the bottom is zero and can costs be reduced to less than the projected revenue , whatever that is it is like buying a business that has a lot of debt , the purchase price is the cash to seller plus the debt in this case it is cash to seller plus the accumulated deficit caused by not addressing the problem until now the immediate problem the answers to those questions are not clear and it may very well be that the debt is greater than the value assuming things are not going to get better quickly , recognizing that the employees will fight downsizing every way they can , and providing a margin of error for the uncertainty around the future of the base business , a buyer has to budget several hundred million to finance operating losses , restructuring charges and investment in new boston globe businesses it is not just moving on to the internet no paper has found a viable way to replace lost \( print \) revenue with online revenue it means rethinking the whole model , ie stop worrying about how to save the paper and start taking the journalistic assets and finding multiple ways of delivering what bostonians need , when they need it , and where they need it the future paper is part of the whole , not the whole that is an expensive proposition so if we assume a 100 million turnaround from last year s dismal numbers , a respectable 50 million profit in say 2012 would yield an optimistic value of 67 times that figure a long way of saying that while the business has value , perhaps 350400 million , it may not have sufficient value for the times to realize any cash from a buyer rick edmonds , media business analyst , poynter institute hardly any newspapers have been sold in 2009 for the one that has and the two headed that direction , the going rate seems to be a fair price for real estate and other tangible assets and nothing more an investment banker friend , speaking of another leading american paper , told me its value as a going concern is basically zero the globe s digs on morrisey boulevard don t compare to your midtown palazzo , but they and the presses are worth something so would be the globe s circulation and advertising lists were it to go out of business so figure maybe 75 to 100 million for that someone who values the prestige and prospects might kick in 50 to 100 million more and would have it maybe it would not even require a premium right now if a buyer took on the unresolved labor mess probably a case of that alternative valuation principle it s worth what someone is willing to pay for it unless there is a very eager buyer , it probably makes more sense for the times co to wait a year \( ps the three comparables , as your real estate agent would say are the san diego union tribune , sold to a private equity firm the portland \( me \) press herald , about to be sold to a private group headed by richard conner , expected to close monday and the austin american statesman , with several finalist bidders but no sale yet none of the parties to these transactions is a public company so the sale price is not being disclosed , but those who know say the bids are low , essentially take it off my hands with something for the hard assets \) john morton , independent newspaper analyst for starters , i m disappointed that the times has retained goldman sachs to explore a sale i had hoped the company would stick with the globe during its difficulties in the expectation that an economic recovery in ne would permit the globe eventually to return to modest profitability , albeit as a newspaper considerably reduced in size and journalism \( some of this has already happened \) with that off my chest , i ll make these observations sales of moneylosing dailies in the past have brought prices at least equal to the value of physical assets plant , equipment , trucks and anything else you can kick unfortunately , the company doesn t provide a separate balance sheet for the globe that i m aware of , but i d be surprised if the physical assets were worth less than 100 million or so to regurgitate some history , the company paid 11 billion for the globe in 1993 and 2963 million for worchester in 2000 , making a total of just under 14 billion in january 2007 the company wrote down its investment for the two of them by 8144 million , leaving about 585 of the original investment there no doubt were additions to the original investment in the form of various capital investments to upgrade systems and whatnot over the years and reductions to reflect depreciation and amortization , but let s forget that for simplicity s sake how to apportion the 585 million between the two papers is a bit knotty , but here goes \( remembering that we re still in early 2007 \) smaller dailies like worchester had dropped less in value by early 2007 than larger dailies like the globe it might be reasonable to think the telegram had dropped in value by half , say to 150 million take that away from the 585 million would suggest the company then put the value of the globe at about 432 million in early 2007 i ll note here that sometime in 2006 jack welch was said to be suggesting a price of 500 to 600 million based on an informal valuation by goldman \( this comes from a story in the times \) of course 2007 was then and this is now , when newspaper values have dropped even further there aren t any buyers sophisticated about the newspaper industry out there \( no newspaper company in its right mind is buying these days \) , so that leaves privateequity buyers , whose recent transactions minneapolis startribune , philadelphia inquirer have not had happy results should a private buyer be found i suspect that any globe employees still employed after the deal goes through will recall the contract they have just rejected as paradise compared with what a new owner will impose in costcutting so what is the globe worth \? the globe and its web site are strong brand names and continue to have considerable influence throughout new england , and these factors alone have value despite the current losses add everything up physical assets , brand name , influence and i ll venture my swag estimate \( sophisticated wildassed guess \) on value as being somewhere between 200 and 300 million , and if pressed for a single number i d say 250 million mike simonton , analyst , fitch ratings without intimate details of their financial situation and under the uninformed assumption that around half of the 80 million in estimated losses in 2009 stems from onetime and noncash items and charges for corporate overhead , we d estimate the paper might be experiencing cash losses of round 4050 million per year at an estimated cash burn pace of around 40 million and no agreement on labor concessions , we d estimate the times co would have to pay a buyer around 2040mm in order to sever their ties with this untenable cost structure for example , at 20 million the buyer \( or assumer of costs , as they might more appropriately be referred to as \) would have cushion of around six months to develop a cost and revenue plan and to try to deal with dissention among the labor pool keep in mind , six months would go by quite quickly and then the owner would be funding losses on their own dime we re doubtful that any owner would be able to get debt financing to extend the timeframe before which the owner would have to pony up their own money times company would benefit as it would amputate an annuity stream of future losses given the grim outlook for the industry , the other elements of the portfolio will be strained to fund losses at the globe in perpetuity newspaper advertising has decoupled from overall advertising meaning there s no reason to believe that advertising trends in 2010 will be much better than 2009 even if there s a recovery if the globe has the same cost structure they could lose as much or more than 80 million in 2010 the pool of strategic buyers is almost nonexistent and we re doubtful that a financial buyer would pay money to take on these revenue and labor issues a buyer would have to believe there are meaningful profits in the outyears of their model we d question a valuation model that had meaningful profits in the tailend of the forecast horizon and that valued those profits presently in any kind of substantial way there s significant uncertainty to that tail and even if there are profits out there , the paper would have a big hole of losses out of which to dig itself once it got there it s important to note that qualitatively an entity can serve a valuable purpose in society and yet have no positive quantitative economic value in this case , assuming it does serve a valuable purpose to the local community and broader region , it does so at a cost that exceeds its ability to monetize the value that it s constituents assign to it is it purely an execution issue \? could the paper monetize it s value , but just isn t doing so or is there a fundamental disconnect between its costs and its capacity to extract revenue from its market \? we believe it s more the latter , and that the cost structure needs to be realigned with the future revenue potential there are certainly opportunities on the revenue side , but in order to be viable in the nearterm and in order to be in a position to realize some of the revenue potential , the costs will have to be drastically lower there can be a gap between what a party is willing to pay for assets and what they are actually worth , but we d be surprised if a bidder stepped in ultimately paid more than 1020 million for the globe we d assign a low probability to a scenario where the paper somehow earns a profit \( from revenue actions or a turn in the economy \) in the next few years without massive cost cuts we believe there s a low probability of a scenario where a potential buyer pays for the globe , but doesn t take cost actions at least as severe as the 8 percent pay cut , elimination of life time employment and other concessions in most scenarios , we believe any new owner would address the cost structure in a more drastic way there just aren t that many levers to pull and labor costs are one of the few areas over which an owner has more explicit control reed phillips , partner , desilva and phillips a year ago , no one would have been saying that the boston globe has no value but , the media world has changed dramatically since then it is impossible to look at the values of comparable newspaper deals from more than a year ago and draw any worthwhile conclusions about the value of the boston globe all of the comparable acquisitions have lost significant value since they were completed the three comparable newspaper companies that were acquired in the past three years the minneapolis startribune , acquired for 530 million in 2007 \( at what was thought to have been a bargain multiple of 65x ebitda , the tribune company \( acquired in late 2007 \) and the philadelphia inquirer \( acquired in 2006 \) are all in bankruptcy proceedings now for the best indication of what the boston globe is worth , we need to look at two recent acquisitions the san diego uniontribune , which was sold just three months ago \( announced on march 18 and closed on may 4 \) and tv guide which was sold in midoctober 2008 \( announced on october 13 and closed on december 2 \) both of these transactions were made by private equity investors who specialize in buying distressed businesses and , both buyers were , in essence , paid to take over these businesses from the previous owners it is estimated that the acquisition price paid by platinum equity for the san diego uniontribune was less than 50 million however , the acquisition included 135 acres of prime real estate that was estimated to be worth 100 million so , in effect , the seller was paying the buyer 50 million to take the business off its hands the sale of tv guide by macrovision had a similar theme the moneylosing magazine was sold for 1 to opengate capital , however the seller provided opengate with a lowinterest loan of 95 million to sweeten the deal in exchange , macrovision was able to offload between 70100 million in subscription liabilities to the buyer the same will likely be true about a sale of the boston globe , which lost 50 million in 2008 and is expected to lose as much as 85 million this year even though the new york times co paid 11 billion for the boston globe in 1993 , i would imagine its objective today is to remove the globe s operating losses from its income statement and unload the pension obligations and union contracts \( which include lifetime job guarantees to 400 employees \) on a buyer for these reasons , i think range of values that the new york times co is likely to get for the boston globe are , at the high end , not more than 50 million and , at the low end , a requirement to help fund the buyer s acquisition with as much as 25 million contributed by the new york times \( yes , you read that right ! \) ken doctor , analyst at outsell inc the best guesstimate of the real price a buck the best of an announced price between 50 and 100 million the delta will be in the details of what obligations guarantees subsidies the times provides to get the deal done at 50100 million , the times can walk away saying it got something and is leaving the paper in good hands , saving a bit of face and moving on to its primary focus making the new york times the most ubiquitous news brand in the world , and then seeing the revenue follow from that ubiquity detail a buck essentially represents a gentleman s agreement i take a liability , headache and a distraction off your hands , says the buyer i give you the great potential of the globe brand , a top 25 news web site and improved ability to rejigger the pieces , thanks to our new contracts and costcutting , says the times a buck recognizes that there is so much unknown and such uncharitable risk and reward here that only a token payment can even it out for both sides there s no reasonable business analysis that can yield a market price the times gets shortchanged it paid 11 billion for the paper just 16 years ago it s struggled to keep the globe staffed through bad economic times it s subsidized losses the new owner takes on great risk no bank financing means the owner s own money is immediately at risk the new owner starts out behind , even with recent contract givebacks , given the trajectory of an 85 million operating loss \( according to the times \) and a continuing 30 decline in year over year advertising revenue forget the purchase price how many millions will i have to sink in within the next year \? the potential upsides include buying an adbased franchise at the bottom of a recession and being able to be a shiny newly painted boat in a rising economic sea 2010 ad numbers can hardly help to be an improvement over this year s the feds will soon be paying people to buy cars and houses will start to sell again related advertising will recover a bit the potential downsides include inheriting a heavyoncost business model at a time when competitors from huffington post to politico to local startups to emerging online initiatives of local broadcasters threaten to do further damage to daily newspapers one other data point the most recent sale of a metro newspaper occurred a continent apart the san diego union tribune , a deeply mediocre newspaper in a widely monied metro area , was once the envy of every major news publisher they wined and dined the copley family , the longtime owners the uniontribune value , as little as a decade ago at least a half a billion dollars after languishing on the market for months , the paper finally sold in march , for a reported 50 million and that price seemed to be based on some lucrative real estate that went along with the deal the globe s real estate is less desirable its glorious history and brand are balanced out by its union contracts and its cultural legacy now , an announced price may well vary from a simple dollar it s better optics for the times for instance , the new owner could put more dollars into the buy , if the times agrees to keep current globe pension obligations , for instance there are all kinds of content , advertising and technology relationships that could be built into a new times globe relationship , with values to be computed the guild and other unions may be willing to exchange further givebacks in exchange for equity , lowering costs enough to justify a buyer putting more money up front other possibilities abound
nuevo laredo , the reminders of nuevo laredo s violent days still mar its streets bullet holes and the impacts of grenades where once flaunted their power , boardedup buildings of merchants who fled the lawlessness , and until they were leveled by the government a few weeks ago , garish roadside shrines to , the saint of death what makes nuevo laredo so remarkable now , however , is the relative calm that envelops this border town , a small dose of good news in a country awash with bloodshed , where nuevo laredo is located , used to be in the country s , with convoys of criminals riding through the streets as if they owned them and one of the highest murder rates in the country that distinction has since shifted farther west along the united statesmexico border to ciudad ju rez and tijuana , where soldiers patrol the streets by the thousands but nuevo laredo s transformation from war zone to regular town is not necessarily what it seems organized crime has gone underground in nuevo laredo , still feared , still thriving , but no longer in charge that uneasy peace may well be the best outcome mexico can extract from its consuming drug war , so nuevo laredo could be a glimpse of the country s future government officials acknowledge that their realistic goal is not to eliminate the outlaws , but to weaken them to the point where something resembling everyday life can resume the government , which is in the midst of a vicious , countrywide , played a role in the newfound tranquillity by pouring soldiers into nuevo laredo , under president felipe calder n and his predecessor , vicente fox they took up positions around the city and took over the police force , which was regarded as a corrupt adjunct of the cartels but the army did not actually defeat the traffickers here by rounding them up and putting them out of business rather , law enforcement officials on both sides of the border say , a brutal , longrunning turf war between rival cartels came to an end when one side , the gulf cartel , came out on top the added presence of government troops made it harder for the rival sinaloa cartel to continue its quest to take over gulf territory but many of the mostwanted criminals responsible for the violence got away and continued their business trafficking drugs , in the shadows what has changed and what has not in this oncebesieged border city are best seen through the eyes of some of those who survived the darkest times a police officer i 'll never go back , said homero villarreal , a former mexican federal police officer who used to investigate the cartels mr villarreal spoke from an italian restaurant across the border in laredo , tex , with his wife , dora , at his side they fled from nuevo laredo in 2005 after two of their sons , who were in their 20s , were abducted by gunmen and not heard from again mr villarreal is not sure exactly why his sons were singled out , although he acknowledges that he , like many officers , accepted money from the cartels on occasion to look the other way he makes a firm distinction between the money he took not to act and the payments that other officers took and continue to take to commit illegal acts themselves mr villarreal has not been back since he fled because , he says , the traffickers who once ran the city still lurk below the surface drugs continue to flow north , and money and guns return , as recent seizures of huge shipments make clear in recent weeks , the haul at the bridges connecting laredo and nuevo laredo , for example , has included nearly three tons of and cocaine heading north , and two caches of weapons and ammunition , as well as 1 million in cash going south mr villarreal has joined a group called laredo s missing to try to find out what happened to his sons disappearances were commonplace in those days , and the police sometimes acted in cahoots with the criminals , mr villarreal said the cartels would call the police and say they were looking for someone , he said the police would find the person and turn him over to the cartels , who would take him away those police officers who did not play along were killed it was in june 2005 , after a police chief was hours after being sworn in , that the federal government of mr fox launched operation safe mexico and sent hundreds of soldiers and federal police officers into nuevo laredo on their way to the city from the airport , the federal forces were fired upon by none other than the municipal police , which had all but turned into a protection force for the drug cartels dozens of officers were arrested after that morning shootout , which left one federal police officer wounded and offered a stark example of nuevo laredo s lawlessness a scrubbing of the police began , with all 700 officers removed from their posts and investigated what brought the explosion of violence to an end , however , was not just revived law enforcement but the fact that a long intercartel war over the lucrative transit route through nuevo laredo had run its course some law enforcement officials say that the gulf cartel , backed up by a feared paramilitary group , the zetas , defeated its rivals from the sinaloa cartel outright and sent them packing others say the cessation of hostilities was the result of a pact in which the sinaloa cartel , unable to dislodge its rivals , agreed to pay what amounts to a transit tax for drugs that passed through tamaulipas emerging from the conflict stronger than ever were the zetas , which now operate semiindependently from the gulf cartel the soldiers stationed in an armored vehicle at one of the bridges connecting laredo and nuevo laredo are only a temporary solution , government officials say , until the police are able to handle the outlaws on their own that time has not yet come it s quiet , but that does n't mean they 're not around , mr villarreal said of the drug lords believe me , they 're there a journalist long ago , journalists here stopped covering the drug violence in their backyard they still do not they avoid mentioning the zetas and would not even consider writing about one of the group s top men , miguel ngel trevi o , whom law enforcement officials hold responsible for much of the bloodshed here when the in april named mr trevi o and his younger brother as 2 of the 11 most wanted mexican fugitives , the local press took a pass we 're selfcensored , said one nuevo laredo newspaper editor , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering the outlaws we 're in the mouth of the wolf we hope one day to again have the freedom to publish what we want some papers did publish photographs recently of banners that the traffickers hung from overpasses criticizing mr calder n s government for families are sacred and should be respected , the traffickers said , a gibe that the papers reported straight army transgressions receive extensive coverage in may , the military prosecutor s office arrested 12 soldiers and said it would courtmartial them on charges that they murdered three local residents and then buried them in a hidden grave the editor says that the drug barons do not contact newspapers as much as they used to offering suggestions , which were really not optional , on which articles should be printed and which should not but they continue to lurk in the background , issuing occasional threats to keep the news media in line they mean business in 2006 , the newspaper el ma ana was , who opened fire on the newsroom and hurled a grenade in as well one journalist , struck in the back by shrapnel , was paralyzed the battle scars are still visible in that newsroom journalists continue to be singled out , but in recent years they have been killed in other parts of the country i'm concerned the problems could come back , but i'm not afraid anymore , the editor said we 've all been through too much everyone society , little by little , is recovering its voice they are talking about what happened a children s advocate on children s day in 2004 , tractortrailers full of food and gifts pulled up outside the orphanage that guadalupe carmona de gonz lez runs on the outskirts of the city there were bags of rice , toys galore and cakes in the shape of cartoon characters the children were giddy and so was ms carmona , who founded in the mid1980s with her own money even after she learned that the donations were sent by one of the area s most notorious drug dons , ms carmona remained thankful the gifts were n't for me , she said in a recent interview it was for children who had nothing the gift giver was osiel c rdenas , who was in a mexican prison at the time , accused of being the leader of the gulf cartel , which ran drug operations in nuevo laredo and points east it was his jailing , authorities say , that emboldened a leader of the sinaloa cartel , joaqu n guzm n loera , who is known universally by the nickname el chapo , or shorty , to launch his bold and bloody takeover attempt in nuevo laredo mr guzm n failed mr c rdenas was eventually to the united states , where he awaits trial on drug trafficking charges filling the void were the zetas , ruthless exsoldiers who cared much less about their public image than mr c rdenas did and who sent no gifts to ms carmona s orphanage , which now houses about 100 children her chief patron now is the government , a normal state of affairs ms carmona credits nuevo laredo s mayor , ram n garza barrios , with bringing airconditioning to her orphanage , helping to build a library and outfitting the children with school uniforms gone are the days when her calls for the city to pave the road in front of her orphanage would go unheeded , and mr c rdenas would step in to hire a crew to do the job mr garza was also one of the officials behind the destruction of the shrines to the saint of death , worshiped by traffickers , which had been set up on the highways leading into nuevo laredo he banned the sale of images of the saint on public property one of mr garza s spokesmen said the mayor was so intent on eliminating nuevo laredo s image as a drug haven that he would not comment for any newspaper article on the subject ms carmona , a religious woman , said she welcomed the government support as for her former patron , she said she never knew mr c rdenas personally but appreciated his humanitarian gestures and prayed for him during his travails she agreed that drugs break up families and result in even more orphans but she was somewhat philosophical about those who were engaged in the business , saying they were not evil people but were lured into the easy money by dire poverty we 've all committed sins , she said a shopkeeper nuevo laredo s violence may have calmed , but the border city s reputation has not changed as quickly nuevo laredo is still frequently mentioned in the same breath as tijuana and ciudad ju rez , the more recent hotspots that frustrates business owners like jack suneson , who sells mexican artifacts , or rather tries to sell them , from a stylish boutique in nuevo laredo customers are so few that he recently bought land in san antonio and is on the verge of closing his mexican store , which his mother first opened in 1954 i ca n't begin to tell you how bad business is , he said inside his sprawling store , which was full of merchandise but not buyers the other day , he took a walk around his store , pointing out the events that took place on his block alone during the dark days there were the dead bodies there was one there , he said , pointing down the block and another there you never knew when you 'd come across another victim there were the boardedup buildings some were once wellknown restaurants that catered to the americans who used to stream across the border for a taste of mexico others were casinos that were similarly filled with foreigners but closed their doors when cartels began demanding more and more in protection money mr suneson said the cartels have always steered clear of his store but the collection of taxes by the criminals continues in but one example , the pirated movies that are sold across the city bear stamps from the particular organized crime group that produced them many movies carry a photograph of a gold hummer , referring , authorities say , to el hummer , one of the top leaders of the zetas in the area until he was arrested in 2008 there s a psychosis , mr suneson said of the fear that americans still have about crossing the border into nuevo laredo these days i wo n't deny we had a bad period i wo n't say we were n't in the middle of a drug war we were but we should n't be the poster child of violence in mexico we had our bad period , and now it s crept along somewhere else
miami gardens , fla after florida s victory in the bowl championship series title game on thursday night , the biggest question was who would be sticking around campus next season the gators have the makings of a dynasty , with no seniors on their defensive twodeep and a relatively young offense that could return a majority of its key components florida quarterback tim tebow acknowledged after the game that he and his fellow juniors percy harvin and brandon spikes all had seriously discussed returning to gainesville for their senior seasons \( does this sound familiar , college basketball fans \? \) all three players would be reasonably high nfl draft choices , though none is considered a lock for the top 10 i think we have an opportunity to have a really great season next year , tebow said i think anytime that coach meyer is the coach you have an opportunity to do that i think also with the talent coming back and the experience of guys playing in big games , i think we have a chance of being pretty good spikes said he had not put a ton of time into investigating the nfl , but the knock on him is that his slow 40 time and lack of size will not make him a particularly high nfl pick harvin has a much better chance of going out , though he said that he was considering staying he also said that he did not have a timetable for when he would make a decision harvin did nothing to hurt his stock on thursday , carrying the ball nine times for 122 yards and catching five balls for 49 yards tebow is clearly entranced with the college experience he s spoken openly about the appeal of winning three titles in four seasons and joining archie griffin as the only player to win a pair of heisman trophies he said he might even be influenced by the florida fans who chanted one more year at him on thursday night to tell you the truth , i probably shouldn t let it affect me but it does , tebow said i get kind of attached , and i m attached to florida fans and the university of florida it kind of always has been it probably will be a bigger part than it should be because i should be able to narrow it down and look at the facts
across 30 years , the modern version of the sisters of st joseph has been revolutionizing the treatment of imprisoned women in new york thanks to the nuns' efforts , mothers are now allowed to care for their infants on the inside and remain close to their children in creative visitors' programs once they are paroled , these women and their children can find a year s shelter in one of nine providence house sanctuaries the nuns created in defunct city rectories and convents the order has never lacked courage five members were guillotined in the french revolution for giving shelter to the hunted now it is the bewildered community of american nuns that is the subject of two sweeping vatican investigations the question is whether the sisters are living in fidelity to the religious life a question being put to nuns in no other nation vatican investigations called visitations usually focus on serious flaws like the pedophilia scandal so , what are nuns doing wrong \? that is the question being asked by the sisters and legions of catholic laypeople well , it s all nonsense , says bob bennett , a lawyer who led the church s lay inquiry into the priest pedophilia scandal which , he says , the church has still not fully addressed he is amazed that american nuns , of all good people , are suddenly being scrutinized they are the jewels , the church s class act , he says the sisters wo n't talk publicly about fears that the vatican s goal is to push them back toward a more submissive veilandwimple past at the providence house programs last week , they talked instead about the myriad problems of their excon mothers trying to get a grip on life as ever , the nuns labor at the brink , begging alms to keep their mission going look , none of us are marching to get women ordained , one sister said in putting down the clich that they seek to undermine rome tom fox , editor of the national catholic reporter , suspects the inquiries are steeped in patriarchy and male chauvinism next time , let s have our women religious study the quality of life of our male clerics , is mr fox s advice
polls show that a majority of people in this country are utterly bewildered by the health care bills congress is considering , and that they have no idea how each would affect their family budgets or their medical care those questions should become somewhat easier to answer as congress moves closer to producing a single piece of legislation \( do n't hold your breath that may not be until christmas \) but even now , while lawmakers hash things out behind closed doors , consumers can make some preliminary assessments of the bills that have been passed by congressional committees just keep in mind that the final product could be something else entirely you could start by visiting the new york times web site \( nytimescom \) , where an interactive chart allows users to compare various elements of each of the bills \( the online version of this article has a link to that chart \) provisions in the bills could affect everyone , but there is intense debate over whether costs will go up or down unfortunately , the nonpartisan congressional budget office says it cannot forecast what will happen to premiums because there are so many uncertain variables what is clear is that if congress requires everyone to have coverage , some low to middleincome families will be spending hefty chunks of their income , despite tax credits from the government policies will be much more affordable than they are now for the uninsured , said drew altman , chief executive of the kaiser family foundation but for some middleclass families it could still be a stretch , especially if they face other big bills at the same time a closer look an interactive calculator created by the kaiser foundation shows how expensive health insurance could be for those who would have to buy insurance on their own the calculator allows you to see estimates of the premiums and the government subsidies for different groups under the different bills the estimates apply only to those who would be buying insurance on their own , not to those who are already covered through their employers , medicare or medicaid the kaiser calculator lets a user plug in age , income and family status , as well as indicate whether the person lives in a high or lowcost region insurance premiums vary substantially by area and then determine what that person would pay for example , if you are 40 years old with a family of four and an annual income of 70 , 350 \( the national median \) and you live in a mediumcost area , your annual premium would be 9 , 435 under the senate finance committee bill , according to the calculator and you would get a subsidy of 993 that would be 12 percent of your net income , in return for protection against potentially catastrophic medical expenses under the senate health committee bill , that same person s premium would be 10 , 513 higher than under the finance committee bill because it provides more generous insurance and the subsidy , also more generous , would be 4 , 339 so the family would end up paying 88 percent of income under proposals from the house ways and means committee and the house labor committee , which are similar on costs , the premium would be 9 , 435 , and the subsidy 2 , 835 accounting for 94 percent of income and under the house energy and commerce committee bill , the premium would be 9 , 435 with a subsidy of 2 , 132 that is 104 percent of income the public option the kaiser calculator does not figure what the cost of premiums or the amount of subsidies might be under a socalled public option , a governmentrun insurance plan that would compete with and presumably charge less than private insurers all but one of the bills in congress now contain a public option , but none of them is the same and there is a fight raging over whether any public option should be in the final legislation and even if one is , it would probably not be available to people covered by their employers most people , in other words the kaiser calculator also does not take into account copayments or other potential costs congress may impose , like taxes or fees on highincome taxpayers larry levitt , the kaiser foundation s vice president , who helped design the calculator , said it was more useful for comparing people in different circumstances than in determining exactly how much each would pay no one can predict with certainty what health insurance will cost 10 years from now , even under the status quo , mr levitt said and no one is predicting that congress will pass any of the current bills intact so these estimates serve only as a guidepost congress is struggling right now with how to pay for health care reform , mr levitt said and the calculator illustrates one of the biggest consequences of the decisions they 'll make what real people might pay
new haven frank ricci has been a firefighter here for 11 years , and he would do just about anything to advance to lieutenant the last time the city offered a promotional exam , he said in a sworn statement , he gave up a second job and studied up to 13 hours a day mr ricci , who is dyslexic , paid an acquaintance more than 1 , 000 to read textbooks onto audiotapes he made flashcards , took practice tests , worked with a study group and participated in mock interviews mr ricci did well , he said , coming in sixth among the 77 candidates who took the exam but the city threw out the test , because none of the 19 africanamerican firefighters who took it qualified for promotion that decision prompted mr ricci and 17 other white firefighters , including one hispanic , to sue the city , alleging racial discrimination their case , which will be argued before the on april 22 , is the roberts court s first major confrontation with claims of racial discrimination in employment and will require the justices to choose between conflicting conceptions of the government s role in ensuring fair treatment regardless of race chief justice john g roberts jr has repeatedly noted his hostility to what he has called the sordid business of divvying us up by race in 2007 , diverging from an important that allowed public universities to consider race in admissions decisions , the roberts court forbade public school systems to take race explicitly into account to achieve or maintain  the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race , chief justice roberts wrote but those cases involved education , and it has been decades since the court last took an intensive look at the use of race in public hiring or promotion among the questions swirling around mr ricci s case are whether the law should treat diversity in the work force differently from diversity in the classroom and how it should handle hiring and promotion tests that have a severely disparate impact on candidates of one race the city says it was merely trying to comply with a federal law that views job requirements like promotional tests with great suspicion when they disproportionately disfavor minority applicants the fact of the matter is it s a flawed test , said victor a bolden , the city s acting corporation counsel mr bolden added that he had sympathy for mr ricci there s no question that there are people who are disappointed , he said but disappointment does n't lead to a discrimination claim the promotion exam was offered in the fall of 2003 , and no one has been promoted since , mr bolden said the suit brought by mr ricci and his colleagues says that the city s rationale for throwing out the test is illegitimate and that they were denied a chance for promotion on account of the color of their skin karen lee torre , a lawyer for the firefighters , declined to be interviewed and said she had instructed her clients not to speak to reporters john payton , president of the naacp legal defense and educational fund inc , which filed a supporting the city , said the case , ricci v destefano , no 071428 , must be understood against the backdrop of what he described as pervasive racial discrimination in firefighting and the pitfalls of thinking that a test can capture the qualities needed for leadership in lifeordeath situations firefighting is a skilled job where all of the skills are learned on the job , mr payton said it s a really good job , and it s been racially exclusive in most of our major cities in a supporting the white firefighters , the national association of police organizations saw the injection of racial politics into public safety promotion decisions should be based on merit , the group said raceneutral decisions foster camaraderie and a sense of fairness , it added , saying that people who work in public safety are , in the main , effectively colorblind but donald day , a representative of the international association of black professional fire fighters , questioned the value of the new haven test , which included written and oral components an individual s ability to answer a multiplechoice exam , mr day told the city s civil service board , does nothing but measure their ability to read and retain there are more important values , he added young black and latino kids have every right , he said , to see black and latino officers on those fire trucks that are riding through their community they have every right to look for a role model according to the 2000 census , new haven is 43 percent white and 37 percent black africanamericans held 32 percent of the entrylevel positions in the fire department in 2007 , according to data compiled by the city , but only 15 percent of the supervisory positions in 2006 , judge janet bond arterton of the federal district court here ruled that the city had not discriminated against the white since no one was promoted , judge arterton said , no one was harmed true , she wrote , a jury could infer that the defendants were motivated by a concern that too many whites and not enough minorities would be promoted but the city s motives were lawful , judge arterton said they included fear of public criticism , the possibility of lawsuits from minority applicants that , for political reasons , the city did not want to defend and a desire to promote diversity in the fire department and managerial role models for aspiring firefighters judge arterton ruled that city officials were not required to abide by the test results even though they cannot pinpoint its deficiency explaining its disparate impact it is enough , she said , that the test results ran afoul of federal guidelines that presume discrimination where the lowestscoring group is promoted at a rate of less than 80 percent of the highestscoring group a threejudge panel of the federal appeals court in new york affirmed judge arterton s ruling in an unusually terse by a vote of 7 to 6 , the full appeals court declined to rehear the case and issued a set of in the process the six dissenting judges urged the supreme court to step in the test itself is not publicly available , but the court record offers glimpses of it one question , for instance , referred to uptown and downtown , terms that do not make sense in new haven but it is not clear what would have generated racial disparities in the results , and the six dissenting appeals court judges said the test had been carefully constructed to ensure raceneutrality blacks passed at roughly half the rate of whites and ended up low on the ranked list of possible promotion candidates under the city charter s rule of three , as positions became available they had to be offered to one of the top three candidates then on the list in practice , this meant that no black firefighters would have been eligible for the available promotions to lieutenant after a series of contentious hearings , the city s civil service board deadlocked by a 2to2 vote on whether to certify the lieutenant s test and a similar one for captain the tie had the effect of rejecting the tests with no one promoted since , we 're sort of frozen in time , said mr bolden , the city lawyer
lexington , ky the sluggish opening sale of the 2009 thoroughbred auction season had just concluded , and my last shot at selling our handsome yearling colt was the skinny old cowboy with a drooping eyelid who had trekked to our barn in sharppointed boots and a straw hat with a rattlesnake band complete with head and gaping fangs he had come to take a second look at a wellbred , smoothmoving son of quiet american who went unsold earlier in the day , among the nearly 300 of the 424 yearlings offered that failed to earn a profit at the fasigtipton kentucky sale last month while i went to get the van that would take the colt back to our farm , my wife , mary anne , was left to close the deal a follower of the axiom take horse to sale , bring home money , she sought only to recoup the colt s 25 , 000 stud fee winded from his trek to the barn , the cowboy watched the colt walk a few circles , then sat on a bench to talk it over with his adviser , one of many who claim expertise in finding thoroughbred diamonds in the rough when mary anne sat beside him , the old man patted her knee he said that he liked her horse but that his adviser had rejected him i got the money , and i only deal in cash , he said with that , he pulled 15 , 000 wrapped in a thick rubber band from the snapped front of his cowboy shirt and waved it under her nose briefly she watched the 15 , 000 and our last chance for a sale disappear next to the sunken chest of 81yearold amarillo slim preston , a professional gambler whose session in the 40th annual world series of poker appeared on television the night before preston was holding the winning hand of a buyer s market at recent horse auctions the second big sale of the season opens monday at saratoga , conducted under foreign ownership for the first time in its 111year history and amid high hopes its select highquality catalogue and fashionable boutique shoppers will give the industry a morale boost as usual , the prestigious saratoga auction will be dominated by yearlings bred in kentucky \( 184 of 235 offered \) , which is an acknowledgment of its long preeminence in the industry kentucky s state slogan , unbridled spirit , characterizes its hopes but that spirit is as hard to find in the bluegrass as a new thoroughbred owner and trainers with money to spend even with the arab ownership of fasigtipton , america s oldest thoroughbred auction company , pulling out all the stops to attract new owners and start the sale season with a bang , the extravagant recruitment , lavish dinner and offers to finance buyers produced only another whimper overall revenue at the lexington paddocks sale was 208 million , down from 281 million , and the median dropped to 55 , 000 from 75 , 000 each a 26 percent decline from a down year the average , bolstered by excessive prices for a few popular new sires , was down 158 percent , but the decadelong trend of fewer buyers and declining profitability continued only 133 of the 268 horses sold appeared to have sold for a profit unlike professional sports that derive revenue from television and marketing , horse racing depends on the discretionary income of the wealthy and about 16 percent of the more than 13 billion wagered annually on north american racing in recent years , fatal breakdowns in and breeders' cup races undermined the sport s scarce opportunities to build a fan base on television although the deaths of potential stars like the 2006 winner and the filly at the 2008 derby spurred the industry toward improved track surfaces and meaningful druguse reform , the global economic malaise has aimed a dagger at its heart precisely when things were looking up in 2008 , auction purchases fell 212 percent to 9738 million , and the overall amount wagered dropped to 136 billion from 147 billion the decline has continued this year , down 10 percent over all , including a stunning 169 percent in june for kentucky , this has struck hardest at the breeding sector , on which most of the 100 , 000 industryrelated jobs depend the 320 , 000 horses that live in kentucky are responsible for a 4 billion direct economic impact , not counting their contribution as the core of the 88 billion tourism industry and its 14 , 600 equinerelated jobs the derby alone contributes more than 200 million annually to the louisville economy but the bulk of this economic engine is horsepower associated with the residency of most of the world s leading stallions and 35 percent of the 59 , 000 thoroughbred mares in the united states , and horse sales that routinely account for more than twothirds of north american thoroughbred sales those sales averaged more than a billion dollars a year before the slowdown sales and race meets attract two million to three million visitors annually but kentucky racing is in trouble , too two of the state s four thoroughbred tracks , ellis park and turfway , are in danger of closing , and the horse population at historic churchill downs is threatened by declining purses and competition from surrounding states that are being helped by revenue from other gambling sources in june , kentucky s thoroughbred industry became the latest to ask for a government bailout none was forthcoming , largely because of opposition to expanded gambling that traditional competitors in new york , maryland , louisiana , florida and many other nontraditional racing states like pennsylvania , indiana and ohio are being helped by casino or slot machine revenue has pushed kentucky s racing back to the wall and raised the possibility that its jobrich breeding industry will follow it into oblivion that the sport of kings is in such trouble in its cradle speaks volumes about its future with an economic underpinning as fragile as the animal on which it is based , kentucky s breeding industry , seemingly addicted to its own hype about multimilliondollar sale horses and ragstoriches success , proceeded as if the laws of supply and demand did not apply stallion books the number of mares bred to an individual stallion doubled over the last 20 years and an increasing percentage of horses bred ended up in the sales pavilions although industry numbers on unprofitable yearlings are often unreliable and widely disputed , 70 percent to 80 percent unprofitable production was not uncommon on kentucky farms the upsidedown nature of the breeding and sales market is illustrated by the two most publicized racehorses of 2009 old fashioned , who broke down before the kentucky derby , and the eventual winner , , a gelding , both descendants of unbridled old fashioned , an offspring of unbridled s song \( who never won a triple crown race and retired unsound yet became a popular and expensive kentucky sire \) , sold in 2007 at the top of the market for 800 , 000 , eight times his stud fee a month later , mine that bird sold for 9 , 500 , less than the 10 , 000 his breeders put up for a mating to birdstone , an unbridled grandson who won the and prevented smarty jones from winning a triple crown typical of the erratic and trendy industry , a son of birdstone was the secondhighestselling yearling at lexington last month , bringing 400 , 000 , or 40 times the stud fee
new delhi rejecting international calls for a ceasefire , said thursday that it had the vestige of a rebel group cornered in a small wedge of the northeastern coast , where the group s elusive leader was likely to be holed up in the company of thousands of civilians defense secretary gotabaya rajapaksa said in a telephone interview from sri lanka s capital , colombo , that government forces could swiftly seize the bastion of the rebel leader , vellupillai prabhakaran , and his subordinates were it not for a shield of civilians they had placed around them the leaders are still there in that area , and they have that human shield , mr rajapaksa said very soon when we overrun this place , we will be able to capture him the military also announced the capture of the last known naval base of the rebels , the a few days ago , it said it had captured the last of seven airstrips held by the tamil tigers' crude but deadly air force , as well as a village hut that it had described as a hideout of mr prabhakaran there is no way to confirm any of what the government says journalists are not allowed anywhere near the war zone the tamil tigers have not been reachable for comment the international committee of the red cross , or icrc , estimates that 250 , 000 civilians are trapped in the combat zone the government says there are far fewer whatever the numbers , mr rajapaksa said the government would not agree to a ceasefire , as several of sri lanka s backers , including the united states , have urged , to allow the civilians to evacuate we had so many ceasefires in the last three decades , he said none of these ceasefires solved the problem do n't give them breathing space the tamil tigers have been widely accused by , among others , international aid agencies , of prohibiting civilians from leaving the area , which has been bombarded by aerial attacks , artillery shelling and even one of the worst victims of the fighting was the last proper hospital in the rebelheld area , which had come under such repeated shelling over four days that the red cross , which helps run the hospital , had to evacuate all patients and staff members and flee deeper into rebelcontrolled territory on thursday , mr rajapaksa , the brother of president mahinda rajapaksa , denied that government troops would shell the hospital , but insisted that not all its patients were civilians and that the tamil tigers were fighting in the vicinity he said the red cross had been cautioned to evacuate the hospital into what the government had demarcated as a nofire zone the agency has repeatedly warned both sides that hospitals and known civilian sites are , by definition , protected zones under international law president rajapaksa said wednesday that it would be just days before the tamil tigers were defeated , promising an end to one of the world s longestrunning civil wars

a trillion here , a trillion there presidentelect barack obama is warning us to expect trilliondollar budget deficits for years to come the economy is in a precipitous downturn and no one , on the left or right , is advocating tax increases that would jeopardize a recovery in the meantime , we 're spending money as fast as we can the troubled asset relief program \( 700 billion and counting \) mr obama s proposed stimulus program \( 800 billion and counting \) and important initiatives still to come , like an overhaul of the way we pay for health care china , which has purchased more than 1 trillion of american debt , is getting antsy as keith bradsher of the times has reported , the global downturn has prompted beijing to keep more of its money at home , a move that could have painful effects for us borrowers mr obama has tried to assure the public that his administration will be as careful as possible with its monumental spending , promising to invest wisely and manage the expenditures well and he has made it clear that he is aware of the minefields that accompany mammoth longterm deficits at some point , however , someone is going to have to talk about raising revenue the dreaded tword is going to come up  well , there s a good idea floating around that takes its cue from the legendary willie sutton why not go where the money is \? the economist dean baker is a strong advocate of a financial transactions tax this would impose a small fee ranging up to , say , 025 percent on the sale or transfer of stocks , bonds and other financial assets , including the seemingly endless variety of exotic financial instruments that have been in the news so much lately according to mr baker , the codirector of the center for economic and policy research in washington , the fees would raise a ton of money , perhaps 100 billion or more annually money that the government sorely needs but there s another intriguing element to the proposal while the fees would be a trivial expense for what the general public tends to think of as ordinary traders people investing in stocks , bonds or other assets for some reasonable period of time they would amount to a much heavier lift for speculators , the folks who bring a manic quality to the markets , who treat it like a casino it raises money in a way that comes primarily at the expense of speculation , said mr baker the fees would be a considerable expense for someone who is buying futures , or a stock , or any asset at 2 o'clock and then selling it at 3 the more you trade , the more you pay for the typical person holding stock , who is planning to hold it for a long period of time , paying the quarter of one percent on a trade is just not that big a deal the fees , though small , could amount to a big deal for speculators because in addition to the volume of their trades they often make their money on very small margins someone who buys an asset and then sells it an hour later at a one percent appreciation might feel quite pleased he or she would be less pleased at having to pay a quarterpercent fee to purchase the asset in the first place and then another quarter percent to sell it this , according to mr baker , is part of the beauty of the transfer tax it tends to curb at least some speculation it s a very progressive tax , he said , that discourages nonproductive activity a hallmark of the bush years has been the rampant irresponsibility by the white house , congress and the general public when it comes to matters of finance the costs of the wars in iraq and afghanistan were placed on credit cards and off the books their ultimate overall costs will be in the trillions incredibly , president bush and congress taxes in wartime , which is insane budget deficits and the national debt are streaking toward the moon and the only remedy anyone has come up with for fending off great depression ii has been deficit spending on a scale reminiscent of world war ii excuse me , but did somebody say the baby boomers are about to start retiring \? maybe the piper will never have to be paid maybe the deficits will someday magically right themselves maybe some prosperous future generation will be more than happy to clean up the mess we left behind if none of that is true , we should start looking now for some real money somewhere a stock transfer tax is not a bad place to start
tampa , fla so , the pittsburgh steelers have won a sixth super bowl championship , the first team to do so what should we call this one \? one for the other thumb \? one for the other index finger \? naila , in tampa , and john , back in new york , chatted before the game , so to come full circle , here are our postgame thoughts john what a game , naila holy moley nj didn t look like it would be much of a game for a while there , huh \? john no kidding i never thought anything would trump that giants win for excitement but that might have done it kurt warner really played a heck of a game i think that was the sixth highest passing total in a super bowl but doesn t ben have incredible nerve \? nj that was one hell of a drive by ben roethlisberger is it possible that larry fitzgerald is so good that he hurt his team s chances of winning the super bowl \? john really good call they scored too quick i am so impressed with roethlisberger , how such a big oaf can be such a good quarterback and so mobile nj but did the cardinals have any business being in that game \? would it have been a travesty had the cardinals won , like some have suggested \? john that would have been weird but the cardinals straightup played a solid game the passing offense really figured the steelers out the only breaks the steelers created were those turnovers they did not do much with their pass rush it s all about winning good teams are supposed to win those games really , the cardinals outgained the steelers by a lot 407 to 292 that tells the story the cardinals might have blown the steelers out if not for james harrison nj and , well , if they hadn t committed so many penalties \( 10 for 106 yards \) john ooof those three personal fouls were brutal just brutal the cardinals best defensive stars of the game making bonehead plays nj the steelers were not doing themselves any favors near the end there either john nope what do you think was the most memorable play holmes s td \? harrison s \? nj man , that s hard is it going to be like tyree s catch and plaxico last year \? plaxico won the game , but tyree got all the replays john you are right i think you could make the case for fitzgerald s td , the goahead score he was gone in a flash nj hard to top very large man running 100 yards john i agree nj let s end with the question we started with coach or stands \? as a steelers fan , would you have wanted to be here \? john no that is too much i think you miss too much in the ballpark and , anyway , i could never have afforded the tickets i am going to get hazed for that , but i don t care i can do my own replays with the dvr nj i m not sure we re going to settle this couch vs stands debate but super bowl xliii was the first pro football game i have ever attended live , and i m not sure watching this game on tv , with all the chatter and all the commercials , will ever feel right again i would also like to say , i told you so santonio holmes 10 46 pm dan rooney , accepting the lombardi trophy , thanked president obama before he thanked the steelers fans the president took the unusual stance of saying that he was rooting for one team over the other in the super bowl , returning the rooneys support from the presidential campaign when he got the microphone for the trophy presentation , coach mike tomlin was asked how concerned he was when larry fitzgerald scored on a 64yard play to give the cardinals the lead he said if they were going to score , that was the way the steelers would have wanted it quickly steeler football is 60 minutes , tomlin said , and with that , the cheers from the robust , towelwaving crowd drowned out whatever he said next santonio holmes was the super bowl mvp , with 9 receptions for 131 yards , most of which coming on the final drive he scored the gamewinning touchdown , on a 6yard pass with 35 seconds left \( that just happens to be exactly how much time was left when plaxico burress scored the winning touchdown last year \) i wanted to be the guy to make the plays , holmes said asked what the play call was for the winning score , roethlisberger said drop back , scramble right , scramble left , find someone open the field at raymond james stadium is now covered with silver confetti it looks a little like it snowed here larger groups of steelers fans are gathered around the entrances to the tunnels , still waving their towels and chanting , defense ! they probably should be chanting offense ! some final stats roethlisberger 21 of 30 for 256 , 1 td , 1 int , 932 passer rating willie parker was the steelers leading rusher , with 53 yards on 19 carries he was a bit of nonfactor after being one of the stars in detroit three years ago kurt warner was aweinspiring again , 31 of 43 for 377 yards , 3 tds and that one fateful interception his passer rating was 1123 larry fitzgerald had two touchdowns in his seven catches for 127 yards , most of it in the second half if there was a conn smythe trophy in the nfl , for mvp of the entire postseason , fitzgerald would win it anquan boldin had eight catches for 84 yards , while steve breaston also had some big plays in his 6 catches for 71 yards john s analysis from the couch in brooklyn after the teams exchanged drives early in the quarter , warner got the cardinals back in a high gear they were moving the ball like they had been in the second quarter , really , like you felt they could have been moving it for the whole game the key play of the drive came on a second and 4 , from midfield , when warner found j j arrington coming out of the backfield for a 22yard gain warner finished it off with a td pass , a pictureperfect fade route to larry fitzgerald the cardinals had cut the lead to 2014 just like that they went 87 yards in eight plays \( all passes \) over 3 57 the steelers took over at their 24 , with 7 24 left if they could have ground out another drive like they had in the middle of the third quarter , the game would have been wrapped up but roethlisberger took another huge sack , and the cardinals got the ball back with 5 28 left it was another dramatic swing it didn t happen as fast as harrison s return , but it was just as important the cardinals started at their 25 , but quickly moved to midfield after a personal foul a play later , they were inside the steelers 30 , after a pass to steve breaston for 23 yards with about four minutes left , the cardinals were driving to possibly win the game then it got dramatic a holding penalty , then a tipped pass then another near interception then an incompletion and the cardinals decided to punt this time , it was the steelers saying , whew perhaps not from relief , though the cardinals punt had pinned them at their 1 after narrowly avoiding a safety , roethlisberger had a completion to holmes at the 20 but the refs flagged the steelers for holding on the play in the end zone and that s a safety by the rules but , really , the safety didn t matter the cardinals , trailing by 2016 , had to score a touchdown , anyway two plays later , they did larry fitzgerald takes a strike on a post route , in the middle of the field he turned upfield and ran for a touchdown , watching himself on the big screen the whole way the steelers comeback did not begin well a holding penalty put them in a deeper hole , if that was even possible but it ended spectacularly roethlisberger , as he had many times in the game , extended plays with his lumbering legs starting from their 12 , roethlisberger pushed the steelers to midfield and then , after an amazing pump fake , he finds santonio holmes pure speed to about the 5 an amazing play an amazing drive an amazing game two plays later , holmes made a dramatic catch for a touchdown at the edge of the end zone , his tippytoes in the red and the whole crowd watched him fall out of bounds the officials reviewed the play it was good we used to do that all the time when i was a kid , in the streets in front of our houses you d purposely throw the ball so your friend could catch it like that , with his feet in the street and his body falling into the zoysia the cardinals had a final chance , with 29 seconds left there was a flourish two completions but a fumble by warner , as he struggled against a withering rush , clinched it for pittsburgh in the end , the cardinals stunning super bowl comeback came a few minutes too soon the cardinals were able to drive to the pittsburgh 44 , but kurt warner , trying to heave one lastchance pass , fumbled and the steelers recovered to end the game wow 4q , 35 ahem , naila would like to say that she predicted a big game by santonio holmes roethlisberger and holmes took over the steelers drive , with holmes scoring the goahead touchdown , on his tiptoes in the corner of the end zone holmes had 73 yards receiving on the drive roethlisberger s pumpfakes did just enough to keep the cardinals defense off balance but it should be pointed out that the cardinals scored on their last drive in 21 seconds they have 35 seconds left 4q , 1 57 jeffrey marcus reports from the below the stadium that four men with black reebok gym bag full of steelers win hats and tshirts who had walked onto the field , just came running back through the tunnel they returned with bags that said cards win 4q , 2 00 ok maybe it wasn t too little , too late in the last 20 minutes , a dull , chippy , frustrating super bowl became a classic , the end of the second half mirroring in the end of the first in drama and twists the cardinals have just gone ahead on a touchdown by , you guessed it , larry fitzgerald 4q , 2 57 weirdness has ensued it is now the steelers who are committing bad penalties a holding penalty in the end zone gave the cardinals a safety 4q , 3 30 this place is all yellow towels right now a holding penalty on mike gandy after the cardinals had reached the steelers 26 was crippling to what had been a promising drive for the cardinals but the steelers held solid after that and stuck after crossing midfield , the cardinals punted and were able to down it at the 2 a shoving match after the play led to an unnecessary roughness penalty , putting the steelers at the 1 warner had completed 10 passes in a row , but misfired on three straight 4q , 5 37 how did we get here \? kurt warner with the ball , down a touchdown with five minutes left in the super bowl \? this did not seem possible even 10 minutes ago darnell dockett has been a man possessed on the cardinals last two defensive series another sack of roethlisberger on second down was crushing , as the steelers went three and out it was a defensive stop the cardinals desperately needed 4q , 7 30 again , larry fitzgerald will catch anything thrown in his general direction it may be too little , too late , but fitzgerald finally is having an impact on this game starting deep in their own territory after steve breaston was crushed on a punt return by william gay , the cardinals moved 86 yards in eight plays the drive included four passes to fitzgerald for 31 yards the last one was a 1yard touchdown pass in which fitzgerald pulled the ball out of the sky if this were basketball , it would have been an over the back call 4q , 11 42 australia is getting to see plenty of their favorite son , ben graham after getting a first down , the cardinals again killed themselves with a penalty , a holding call that gave them second and 19 at their own 24 they gained only 6 more yards and on came graham his punt traveled only 27 yards after giving the steelers another first down with a penalty , darnell dockett had two tackles for a loss , including a sack for roethlisberger for a loss of 12 it was the cardinals first sack of the game 4q , 13 49 a thought of james harrison on monday , harrison said he did not think he would rush the quarterback as much in this game and lo and behold , his biggest play so far was in pass protection but he certainly rushed 100 yards for a touchdown john s thirdquarter analysis from the couch at the beginning of the third quarter , as the cardinals tried vainly to forget about the most unforgettable play of recent super bowl history , they were , within minutes , nearly waylaid by another big defensive play with warner under heavy pressure on a third down at midfield , james farrior knocked the ball out of his hand but , after the review , the potential fumble was ruled an incomplete pass the steelers took over at their 18 , and tried to turn the clock back to the early second quarter , when they stopped had a chance , after stopping the cardinals offense cold , to add to a 10point lead for a while , it looked like they might deliver a knockout blow powered by inside runs from willie parker and helped by three personal fouls , two of them on the two cardinals who ve made the biggest defensive plays so far rodgerscromartie and dansby the steelers rolled downfield 79 yards in 16 plays over 8 39 \( the third personal foul , unbelievably , came on a fieldgoal attempt , giving the steelers a new set of downs inside the 5 \) in the end , with 2 11 left in the quarter , the steelers settled for a field goal and the cardinals dodged a haymaker the cardinals have spent most of this game wiping their brow and saying , whew the cardinals offense has been able to move the ball , a little , but in short bursts , dan marinostyle they end the quarter with a second and 9 at their 34 the steelers drive chewed up a big chunk of the third quarter that s how games get won but , although the steelers have displayed flash on defense , through three quarters , their pass rush has lacked a certain oomph only one sack so far over all , they seemed to be focused on the cardinals marquee receivers , covering the downfield lanes that left the flats open to warner , who seemed to have an outlet receiver ready whenever the steelers rushers get close the cardinals have been undisciplined in this game and it was devastating on the steelers first drive of the second half the cardinals had the eighthmost penalties during the regular season , with 98 for 816 yards they have the secondmost penalties in the playoffs , with 19 for 156 yards on this drive , cardinals penalties helped the steelers drive down to the red zone after starting from their own 18 pittsburgh got three first downs on arizona penalties , including a roughingthekicker after jeff reed had kicked a 27yard field the steelers had a whole new set of downs at the 4yard line but the steelers couldn t capitalize \( roethlisberger nearly threw an interception that seemed certain to be returned for a touchdown \) , and still only got 3 points the cardinals already have 8 penalties for 81 yards 3q , 10 57 considering how discombobulated the cardinals offense looked in the first quarter , it is hard to question now ken whisenhunt s decision to defer after winning the coin toss but arizona needed an impressive drive to start the second half and it didn t get one there was another long review , this time to check if kurt warner had fumbled on 3rd and 6 from the steelers 49 or had thrown an incomplete pass it was ruled an incompletion , which angered the pittsburgh contingent of the crowd , but the result was essentially the same ben graham s punt was not spectacular , and the steelers had the ball at the 18 instead of deep in their own territory some key halftime stats kurt warner 12 of 18 for 135 yards , 1 td , 1 int ben roethlisberger 11 of 14 for 130 yards \( his stats for all of super bowl xl 9 of 21 for 123 with 2 ints \) edgerrin james four rushes for 10 yards , three catches for 26 yards willie parker eight rushes for 34 yards heath miller four catches for 47 yards anquan boldin three catches for 56 yards in case you were wondering , hines ward has 1 reception for 38 yards , on the second play of the game larry fitzgerald had one catch for 12 yards , near the end of the half dan g in comments asks what would have happened if the replay had reversed the play at the end of the half and james harrison had been ruled down at the 1 would the steelers has been able to run another play \? the answer , according to al michaels , was no harrison s rumbling down the field had used up all 10 seconds left on the clock and wherever he stopped , the half would have been over john s secondquarter analysis from the couch in brooklyn the steelers began the second quarter with a touchdown , which was an absolute must scoring is important , i know , but they had been inside the 5 about five minutes earlier and came away with only 3 points but on third down , gary russell took the handoff and headed inside , following close behind the left guard it was not a slowdeveloping play , but it took some pushing and shoving for him to score that gave the steelers a 100 lead with 14 01 left the steelers have shown the ability to gain tough yards on the ground when they need to it s true they were a solid rushing team in the regular season , but the offensive line has been a bit of a patchwork at times the cardinals second drive began with short passes , and a little sputtering warner had looked a little rusty at least two of his first five passes were visibly off the mark but he quickly settled down after a holding call with about 10 minutes left in the half , which could have been a body blow to the cardinals momentum , warner with three consecutive plays announced his intention to stick around and play awhile on the first play after the penalty , warner responded with a 13yard pass to steve breaston , basically erasing the 10yard loss on the next play , warner found himself with plenty of time and he fired a 20yard rocket downfield to a wideopen anquan boldin , who kept going after the catch and was dragged down inside the 5 then the td , on a fade route to the backup tight end , ben patrick that cut the steelers lead to 107 the cardinals seemed to thrive on the energy of the successive gains the offense went from stumbling short passes to vertical slashes through the steelers defense and they got an important foothold on the scoreboard the teams traded futile drives , and then the action started with under three minutes to play , after a punt that pinned them inside their 20 , a pass by roethlisberger was tipped high in the air and intercepted by karlos dansby a hard pass tipped at the line became a giftwrapped chance for the cardinals to end the half with the lead a preposterous possibility , to anyone who had watched the first quarter given the break in field position and opportunity , the cardinals looked like a different team they really did but as if on cue , the steelers defense trumped the cardinals for the game s big play the cardinals were at the 1 , and then warner threw an interception to steelers linebacker james harrison right to him he jumped up and was off to the races he returned it 100 yards , and was finally tackled as he slid into the end zone for a disputed touchdown they reviewed it and reviewed it and john madden said , to heck with it , if he makes a runback like that , just give him a touchdown the refs did harrison was getting oxygen he deserved it everyone in raymond james stadium was given a flashlight and were told to point it at the stage between the camera flashes and the flash lights , and the red light that has now enveloped the stadium , and the fire works shooting from the stage , this is pretty darn cool if only bruce could play tenth avenue freeze out all night bruce follows with born to run no surprises here so far everything is blue now a snippet of the new single , working on a dream is next , with a smooth transition into glory days , with a friend who s an old football player this time the effect of the flashlights is fantastic naila doesn t want them to turn the stadium lights back on the game changed dramatically in the final seconds of the half the cardinals got the ball back with two minutes left and moved smoothly down the field larry fitzgerald made his first contribution to the game , catching one pass for 12 yards on first and goal from the 1 , kurt warner tried to hit anquan boldin in the end zone and was intercepted by james harrison , who returned it 100 yards for a touchdown harrison , the defensive player of the year , appeared close to being tackled several times before fighting his way to the end zone he seems to have learned something from ben roethlisberger the play was reviewed to see if the ball crossed the plane of the goal line , but the call was upheld it was the longest play in super bowl history , of course 2q , 2 09 the steelers were not to be outdone the cardinals went three and out , going backwards they started at the steelers 43 because of breaston s punt return , but ended up at their own 40 , thanks to two penalties but the steelers were unable to capitalize ben roethlisberger threw an interception two plays later 2q , 4 16 the cardinals are pumped up now after the touchdown , the defense came out on fire , holding the steelers to six plays and 12 yards then steve breaston reeled off a 34yard punt return 2q , 8 43 as naila suspected , receivers other than larry fitzgerald were going to be big factors in the arizona offense but it was edgerrin james who finally got the cardinals moving james had 27 total yards on a nineplay , 83yard drive anquan boldin had the big catch , gaining 45 yards on a play in which kurt warner seemed to have six months to throw and ben patrick got the touchdown on a play in which warner nearly fell down it was the type of balanced drive that has been the hallmark of the cardinals in the playoffs alan schwarz reports in to the fifth down from the concession line with this nugget so i m waiting on line for a 12 bratwurst , and who s in front of me but cuba gooding jr i asked him who he was rooting for , and he said , cardinals ! c mon ! rod tidwell ! i m embarrassed to say i had no idea what he was talking about i nodded knowingly , thinking rod tidwell was maybe the cardinals fourth receiver and a buddy of gooding s only when i got back to my seat did jeffrey marcus fill me in tidwell was the football player that gooding played in jerry mcguire , the one who yelped show me the money ! into the national vernacular true to the character that won him an oscar in 1996 , gooding ordered a turkey \( sandwich \) and a hot dog 2q , 14 09 at his news conference thursday , steelers coach mike tomlin addressed his team s struggles in shortyardage situations we found a guy in gary russell , who we believe has an aptitude for those situations i think we ve had more success since we ve featured him specifically in those situations the steelers were facing third and goal from the 1 who do you think they turned to \? john s analysis from the couch i know it s early , but the steelers first drive really made an impression , if you ask me on the first play , they came out with three tight ends , they bulled their necks and gained 3 yards on a run play no 2 was a bootleg pass , and hines ward was wide open , crossing from left to right a big gain , and early tests of the steelers upfront power and of ward s knee they looked fine from here of course , after loping down the field , the steelers settled for a field goal \( and after i expressly told them in the pregame not to do that \) but 9 plays for 71 yards was a nice start the cardinals first drive made an impression , too and that was of a wall straining to hold back the surf there was a holding call , a fumble and running backs who lost their footing not a nice start the steelers picked up where they left off on drive no 2 roethlisberger took a shot at the end zone , on a second down from near midfield it was a beautiful , ontarget pass , what i was looking for from roethlisberger but the ball was tipped away at the last moment by dominique rodgerscromartie the steelers quickly shook off that disappointment the play of the drive happened next roethlisberger , on a third down and 10 , eluded the cardinals pass rush for what seemed like a half an hour , and finally found heath miller for a first down the steelers showed acumen with short passes , and power in its rushing game and they showed some calmness , letting the quarter run out with the ball snug in the red zone they outgained the cardinals , 140 yards to 13 roethlisberger is 8 of 9 for 122 yards a nearly perfect passer rating best commercial of the first quarter , bob dylan and wyclef jean william shilling pepsi together  the quarter ended with the steelers in the red zone again antonio rodgerscromartie saved a touchdown by tipping a deep ball away before it got to the wideopen nate washington in the end zone roethlisberger is showing tremendous mobility he escaped what seemed to be a sure sack on third down and passed for a first the steelers showed a wildcat formation with a direct snap to willie parker , which wasn t effective but parker has been gobbling up yardage otherwise he had seven carries for 26 yards 1q , 9 45 cardinals punter ben graham made his first appearance for his fans in australia , where it is almost 11 am on monday he said during media day that it would a good time for football fans in australia to skip work the cardinals gained only 3 net yards on their first drive , hampered by a penalty and a fumble judy battista notes that the first tackle of the super bowl was made by a kicker , the cardinals neil rackers , one of the best tackling kickers  a colleague points out that after the apparent touchdown , ben roethlisberger did not do his typical jump and bump to celebrate he jumped , but he did not bump the condition of roethlisberger s ribs and back have been in question since he was speared during the afc championship game 1q , 5 15 handing the steelers the ball did not work out very well for the cardinals the steelers did exactly as john suggested and threw deep early hines ward was wide open when he gained 38 yards on pittsburgh s second play from scrimmage willie parker had a good first drive , gaining 16 yards and had good success running outside it appeared ben roethlisberger had scored on the a 5yard touchdown run , sending the crowd into a frenzy but in an eerily familiar situation to the steelers last super bowl , ken whisenhunt challenged whether roethlisberger crossed the goal line , and the review ruled that he was down two inches from the goal line almost the exact same play was ruled touchdown for pittsburgh three years ago against seattle and again , just like john said , the steelers didn t make the small play mike tomlin elected to kick a field goal , another questionable move to start the game john in brooklyn said andrea kremer is reporting that hines ward did some kind of weird bloodfiltration treatment to get recovered from his sprained knee 6 28 pm coin toss time gen petraeus will do the honors , with lynn swann , roger craig and john elway looking on al michaels says the nfc has won the toss 11 times in a row and make that 12 pittsburgh called tails , and it was heads arizona won the toss and deferred , which is surprising a bold move , perhaps 6 22 pm jennifer hudson , performing for the first time since the murders of her mother , brother and nephew , delivered a fantastic national anthem she followed faith hill s america the beautiful , and a walkon by the crew of us airways 1549 chellsy sullenberger may have gotten a bigger cheer than faith jerheme urban of the cardinals said last week that he was looking forward to playing in an open air stadium so he could hear the jet flying overhead his first super bowl was in a dome in detroit he was right about the impact the boom , the camera flashes , the waving towels , all make for an inspiring start 6 16 pm kurt warner has just won the walter payton man of the year award seems as if no one else could have won the other finalists were brian dawkins of the eagles and matt birk of the vikings john says from brooklyn brenda warner is not wearing feathers 6 14 pm one difference between the stands and the couch while naila was watching an awesome marching band from daytona beach , john was watching faith hill sing what he described as a some impossibly terrible song the teams have run on to the field to rousing cheers from each of their fans , but steelers fans boos may have been overpower the cards fans cheers 6 02 pm nailajean and john chatted online a little while ago with some pregame analysis nj so , john , an hour before game time thoughts \? john ready oh yeah one thing i want to bring up , before we get all bloody , is this i have a serious quibble with the notion that ken whisenhunt worked some kind of miracle with the cardinals the ap , in its preview for this game , writes that whisenhunt quickly transformed them into winners ugh nj everyone says the pieces were all in place people who worked there three years ago say that actually even whiz says that john good for him only five two in 2008 of his 17 victories were against winning teams that s like me losing 10 pounds and demanding airtime for an informercial i should say , though that he has presided over an impressive playoff run none of those games were cheap or controversial nj yep he got them to adjust john but let s see what happens to the cardinals next season before we outfit whisenhunt for , you know , a cassock or whatever is there one thing you are going to be watching for \? nj believe it or not , the coin toss i m very curious to see what happens if the cardinals get the ball first if they can jump on the steelers like they did the eagles , it s going to be tough for the steelers john that is an obvious point of friction , their passing game vs the steelers defense it s tempting to say defense wins those battles , but warner was in a similar spot in the 2002 super bowl the rams lost that game , but only because of an amazing lastminute drive by the patriots for his part , warner hung 365 passing yards on the patriots defense , which was ranked sixth in the league that season nj it s so funny to me now how warner is being lauded for his quick release and his handling of pressure after all his troubles in st louis and new york with just those things i m impressed with that adjustment john i know what you mean it s weird that he has come out of nowhere what do you think of big ben \? nj i think he s tough kid i think just like last time , he doesn t have to have a great game for them to win but he can t be as bad as he was in detroit either john true nj i don t think he will be there has been talk about him being better adjusted to the special super bowl balls john because why \? nj warner wears gloves now , so it s not problem for him but roethlisberger has said he had trouble gripping the super bowl balls in detroit he might be wearing gloves tonight to deal with that john heh the weather won t be a thing , though , right \? you were saying it was chilly , but not football chilly right \? nj no , just florida chilly it seems pretty calm and clear though one of the kickers said this week that it s always a little windy , but most people wouldn t notice it it s a gorgeous night , really how s the weather in new york \? \) john ha it s beautiful today there is one thing i am going to watch for it s whether or not roethlisberger throws deep early in the game by deep , i mean a pass where the tv cameras have to pan way above the field , into the lights if he does , that will be a sign that 1 \) roethlisberger is healthy and 2 \) that the steelers are not going to hunker down and try to bulldoze the cardinals with willie parker furthermore , it will mean that this will be a more balanced clash of offenses watch for the long passes if the steelers don t try any in their first few drives , then the cardinals job will be easier what do you think of that \? nj santonio holmes seems primed for a big game there has just been too much talk about all the other receivers for the same reason , i think boldin may be huge tonight john that is a good point , too holmes and limas sweed are both deep threats , but neither have made big catches there are some cringeworthy highlights of them dropping the ball but , against the chargers , the steelers threw several long passes and i think it created room for the oline and parker to operate the steelers gained 165 yards on the ground in that game nj look at you with your stats john i m a pro i did my pregame research listening to power and the glory , nfl films soundtrack cd also , i was watching failure to launch , which stars the super bowl mvp terry bradshaw nj that is being a true fan john you want another stat \? nj i love stats john here s a useless one the steelers have won two of the last three meetings but they have played only three times since 1997 , and the cardinals won the most recent matchup , which was last season , 2114 , with a big game from of course larry fitzgerald \( 10 catches for 120 yards \) nj i interviewed a cardinals fan a little while ago and he said that the steelers fans had been very nice to them because , really , how could there be any pentup animosity \? they hardly play each other john no kidding and the cardinals haven t had the chance to annoy people by winning we should wrap this up i have a concluding nugget nj i think maybe eagles fans are annoyed john wait , why \? oh yeah , well , them s the breaks nj nugget me ! john our boss , the venerable tom jolly , picked the cardinals , and talked about how the big plays could be enough to win the game for me , i think the key for the steelers is to avoid the little plays , drives that peter out and end in a fieldgoal attempt that s the way teams with good defenses and mediocre offenses die just ask the giants nj well said can t be settling for field goals against a team like this so one final question from me how are you enjoying the view from the couch so far \? john it s great this is the greatest day for a football fan , except for a few choice ones from my husker past but it s great i am happy i am ready to start disagreeing with john madden nj you ll have to let me know if he says anything awesome i ve got to say , though , the game hasn t even started yet and it s going to be hard to top the view from the seats it is outrageously loud already but i can tell there s a part of the field i m not going to be able to see enjoy the game ! john you , too 5 34 pm anthony vertucci , a longtime cardinals fan featured in the fifth down last week , said sunday he was so excited he could hardly speak don t bring up cardinals kicker neil rackers it makes him nauseous he doesn t even want to think about the super bowl coming down to a kick vertucci and his friend , mark augusta , who said he had been brutally bludgeoned for 22 years by the cardinals , have seats near the pirate ship in raymond james stadium \( did you know there is a disneyesque it s a pirate world after all village behind the bleachers here \? well , now you know \) steelers by 17 as i predicted 8 months ago , to their 6th record super bowl victory , and the start of a new dynasty !  they were surprised just how many other cardinals fans were in town , spending last night with 500 of them at the unofficial cardinals bar in tampa , wings gone wild every cardinals fan who passed by on the concourse at raymond james was a new friend or an old one vertucci pointed to a man in a red suit and a red wig he said he d known the man for years from cardinals fans message boards and chat rooms , but he wouldn t have met him in person if arizona hadn t made the super bowl as he talked , a cards fan would come up for a high five , others would chat vertucci has been a cardinals fan for his whole life , for nearly 45 years but joe giancolo had him beat born in st louis in 1963 , giancolo said the cardinals were the only football team he had ever followed the team moved to phoenix in 1988 he moved there in 1990 giancolo and his friends , all dressed in red , said the stars were aligned it was their team s destiny to win we re few , but we re proud , augusta said 5 15 pm seen on the concourse at raymond james stadium jon gruden being surrounded by steelers fans a man , kevin salvagni , in a tshirt that was half kurt warner jersey , half ben roethlisberger , with the name warnberger and 17 on the back a tampa resident , salvagni wasn t rooting for a team he was rooting for offense his shirt intrigued marc johnson of atlanta , who stopped to talk wearing a tommy maddox steelers jersey , johnson said this was his 17th super bowl but he had not seen his own favorite teams in one he is a chiefs and lions fan so he had a tough year he figured it would be five years before the chiefs would be in a super bowl and the lions \? 55 years , johnson said 4 22 pm as \( not \) journey performed \( don t stop \) believin' at the tailgate concert outside , two nuns passed by wearing cardinals gear then kurt warner came running down the field toward the large section of cardinals fans , bringing another roar in fact there s little to celebrate about the super bowl because the nfl ultimately denies freedom to the millions of americans who will be watching today  but that ovation was countered with shouting and towel waving for ben roethlisberger , who emerged on the field for a jog shortly after 4 14 pm a rousing let s go cardinals chant just erupted from section 106 , directly in front of the auxiliary press tables it is one of the few places in the stadium at the moment where cardinals fans outnumber steelers fans all week long , not surprisingly , steelers jerseys were far more prevalent than cardinals one 4 02 pm steelers kicker jeff reed was perhaps the first player on the field at raymond james stadium and his jog around caused the few steelers already in their seats to set their terrible towels atwirlin reed was a popular interview in the week leading up to the game , his bleached blond hair eliciting as many questions about his style as troy polamalu and larry fitzgerald got but the cheer reed got was nothing compared to the roar that went up when hines ward , his knee the subject of the most questions of the week , did a lap around the field 3 35 pm earlier this week , we asked if you would rather watch the super bowl from the stands or from the couch watching

to the editor re \( column , july 17 \) david brooks rightly claims that it is a national crisis that united states college completion rates have been flat for the last 35 years but his diagnosis is incomplete he claims lack of student aid is not the major reason students drop out of college they drop out because they are academically unprepared or emotionally disengaged or because they lack selfdiscipline or because bad things are happening at home this misses the important role that family wealth plays in college completion in fact , my own research shows that only two background factors matter for college completion parents' own education and parental net worth race , what job parents hold none of that matters this salience of wealth suggests that student aid has an important role to play , since for disadvantaged students , aid functions like financial equity in easing stress at home and blunting hard tradeoffs \( between work and school , for instance \) financial aid and student psychological factors go hand in hand dalton conley new york , july 17 , 2009  to the editor while i agree with much of what david brooks says , i take issue with his statement that lack of student aid is not the major reason students drop out of college he goes on to state that dropout rates are more closely connected to lack of skills , selfdiscipline and homelife stability as a secondary teacher of many years , i would argue that all of those issues exist , but they are usually worsened by money issues this is particularly true of the students who attend community colleges , who often have to pay for a significant portion \( if not all \) of the cost themselves a former student of mine was hoping to go to the local community college for automotive studies , but her disabled mother needed the rent and grocery money her daughter paid her another former student dropped out of college after a year because his grades in his introductory classes were n't high enough to merit scholarship aid , and the loans were piling up the students who choose these colleges are often the first in their families to attend postsecondary schooling many come from disadvantaged backgrounds and are aware that without further schooling , they will remain so while these students do have other issues , the issues are so intimately intertwined with financial need that one cannot be addressed without acknowledging the other i hope that president obama will recognize this as he continues to push for improvement and expansion of the community college system caroline siecke exeter , nh , july 17 , 2009  to the editor david brooks accurately characterizes the potential of community colleges and why students attending these colleges struggle to succeed \( lack of academic preparation , poor study habits and so forth \) though mr brooks s reform suggestions make sense , he does n't mention perhaps the most basic need increased communication between community colleges and their local high schools the notion of a k16 education process is frequently touted , but actual cases of formal partnerships between high schools and community colleges are all too rare though all high school seniors can benefit from transitional experiences before leaving the relatively structured world of high school for the more independent academic and social lives of college , some students drown without them these include students who are challenged with low motivation , an unrealistic picture of what it takes to get a good job or families who may not be able to guide their 17yearolds on how to prepare for college and the postcollege world the obama innovation fund should be used to formalize high schoolcommunity college partnerships programs that begin once students are starting college may prove too late to matter marc f bernstein superintendent of schools , valley stream central high school district valley stream , ny , july 17 , 2009  to the editor re \( news article , july 15 \) president obama s proposal to spend 12 billion for community colleges is an important step to help displaced workers gain skills needed for their new careers the proposal could have a significant impact on health care reform if community colleges expand training opportunities into nursing , addressing the workforce shortage in the field by enabling graduates to fill the 587 , 000 new nursing jobs that are expected to be created between 2006 and 2016 nursing graduates from the nation s roughly 900 associatedegree nursing programs represent the majority , 63 percent , of the nursing work force it is these nurses and their baccalaureate counterparts who deliver and coordinate care in physicians' offices and at the bedside in hospitals and longtermcare facilities their numbers and the quality of training they receive are central to health care reform the president s proposed investment in a set of colleges that can prepare nurses representative of the diverse communities they serve is a critical step to ensuring that all americans have access to skills needed for jobs that will allow our economy to grow corinne h rieder new york , july 16 , 2009
a multimilliondollar collection of artwork by was stolen from the home of a wealthy art collector in west los angeles last week , los angeles police said friday the valuable collection included 10 silkscreen paintings of famous sports figures , among them muhammad ali , chris evert , jack nicklaus and o j simpson according to investigators , the artwork was on display in the dining room of richard weisman , a businessman and art connoisseur whose wellknown collection was featured in a book he published in 2003 , picasso to pop the richard weisman collection the paintings are about 40 inches by 40 inches each , and were created between 1977 and 1979 they were discovered missing on sept 3 , when a nanny who worked for the family entered mr weisman s home , which is located on angelo drive , and noticed that the paintings were no longer on the walls , the los angeles police department said in a statement on friday the nanny quickly left the house and went to a neighbor s home , where she called the police mr weisman had several other valuable works of art in his home , but none of those were disturbed , detective mark sommer of the police department s art theft detail told the associated press he said it was unclear how the paintings were removed and who may have taken them , but that a maroon van was spotted in the driveway of the home around the time of the robbery this was a very clean crime , detective sommer told the ap , adding , for some reason they had an interest in this collection mr weisman could not be immediately reached for comment late friday the los angeles police said a 1 million reward was being offered for information leading to the recovery of the images
if and when wins his release from the , his next destination may be boston , according to a report by on friday if that chain of events comes to pass , it could set up the ultimate experiment in team chemistry in their race to the nba title last season , the starstudded were a paragon of selflessness and sacrifice they called it ubuntu , an african word for unity in his 12year career , marbury has often been labeled a chemistry killer , though usually with much stronger adjectives a celticsmarbury marriage would be fascinating theater for anyone interested in group dynamics it may never happen , however the knicks will not release marbury unless he agrees to a buyout , and marbury , who is being paid 208 million this season , has shown no interest in negotiating there have been no substantive talks since dec 1 , when marbury stormed out of a meeting with , the team s president , after 15 minutes marbury s stance remains firm he recently told the new york post that he would not accept a pay cut and that , furthermore , he wanted to be reimbursed the 400 , 000 in salary that the knicks withheld as punishment for his refusal to play in a nov 26 game at detroit the knicks , who are believed to be seeking a concession in the 2 million range , also have not changed their stance walsh will not release marbury outright and has no incentive to do so barred from practices and games , marbury is no longer a distraction to the team the knicks can simply wait until marbury s contract expires after the season there had been speculation that the knicks did not want to see marbury sign with certain eastern conference teams \( including boston \) and therefore would structure a buyout with a condition that he sign with a western conference team but such an arrangement would not be permitted under nba rules also , a person involved in the knicks' internal discussions said that walsh was more concerned with marbury s going to a team like miami , a rival for a playoff spot team officials admittedly would prefer not to see marbury hoisting the larry o'brien nba championship trophy in june , but it is not their greatest concern the celtics' apparent interest is curious , but understandable they lost two valuable bench players over the summer , when p j brown retired and james posey signed with the new orleans hornets although they believe their starting five has improved since last season , the celtics are concerned about their depth marbury turns 32 next month and is well removed from his days as a top10 point guard but he is still a capable scorer and a potentially valuable third guard , if he is willing to back up rajon rondo and ray allen marbury played well in the preseason , but he has not played in a regularseason game in nearly a year one thing seems certain , based on the celtics' team culture they will not sign marbury unless everyone agrees , including the team president , danny ainge coach doc rivers and the team s three best players , allen , paul pierce and kevin garnett those discussions have not yet taken place , a team official said rivers emphasizes chemistry over just about everything else , so he may have to be persuaded marbury clashed with his last two coaches in new york , larry brown and isiah thomas , which is partly why the new coach , mike d'antoni , decided not to play him this season when d'antoni and walsh arrived in the spring , they quickly discovered that marbury was terribly unpopular with his teammates none of this means that marbury will not end up wearing shamrocks and playing for a title in june it just means that , if he does , it will make for a fascinating case study for the folks at mit
back home in union city , nj , these last few weeks , senator robert menendez would walk into a restaurant only to have someone shout the inevitable question oye , c mo le va a la jueza \? translation hey , how s it going for the judge \? the judge , of course , is sonia sotomayor , the first hispanic nominee to the supreme court and as it turns out , mr menendez is the one democratic senator who can answer that question in spanish , not just home in new jersey but also in the united states capitol until recently mr menendez was able to share the duties of speaking in spanish on behalf of senate democrats with ken salazar of colorado but mr salazar is now the secretary of the interior senator christopher j dodd of connecticut also speaks spanish fluently \( he served in the peace corps in a small village in the dominican republic \) , but he has been managing the health care legislation as acting chairman of the health committee , while still serving as chairman of the banking committee and running for reelection back home l don t know how much more the man can have on his plate , mr menendez said so with hispanicamericans riveted by the prospect of a latina justice on the high court , and spanishlanguage media equally hungry for commentary , senator menendez has once again taken to the airwaves as the spanish voice of the senate , noche after noche he appeared on telemundo three times this week twice about judge sotomayor and once about health care he was on univision s morning show , despierta america on tuesday , conducted a phone interview with agencia efe , the spanishlanguage wire service on wednesday , and held a bilingual news conference on friday with the president of the hispanic bar association although republicans have their own spanishspeaking senator , mel martinez of florida , who announced on friday morning that he would vote in support of judge sotomayor s confirmation , mr menendez gravitates more naturally to the media attention \( both in english and in spanish \) indeed , a spot in the hallway outside his office is virtually a parttime studio for spanish camera crews he is also the chairman of his party s campaign operation , the democratic senatorial campaign committee , which gives him even greater impetus to remain in direct communication with hispanicamericans , a fastgrowing and increasingly influential sector of the electorate the campaign committee also gives him a role in the democratic leadership that goes well beyond serving as the party s spokesman in spanish he has the responsibility of protecting the democrats 60vote majority and trying to expand it in 2010 when there will be a number of tough elections in swing states spanishlanguage journalists say their viewers and readers hear far more from mr menendez than they do , for instance , from harry reid of nevada , the majority leader and unlike the house , where numerous spanishspeaking lawmakers compete for time and attention , mr menendez singularly dominates his stage mr menendez said there was no question about the excitement among hispanics during the weeklong confirmation hearings the mere fact of the historical nature of it , that is was first , made the community pay attention , he said and he also said that the republican pressure , focusing repeatedly on a speech in which judge sotomayor referred to herself as a wise latina una latina sabia had raised a specter of discrimination that also raised the interest of hispanics in the proceedings at the news conference on friday , mr menendez shifted seamlessly between spanish and english , reflecting a bilingual thoughtprocess that allows him to make the same points without any stumbling in the translation hemos visto una jueza extraordinaria en su capacidad intelectual we have seen a judge extraordinary in her intellectual capacity , he said en su temperamento in her temperament en su conocimiento de la ley in her knowledge of the law en su fidelidad a la ley in her fidelity to the law the question and answer session was just like any other capitol hill news conference como responde usted en eso how do you respond to that , a reporter asked , challenging him on the republicans contention that they had set parameters for all of president obama s future court appointees he also fielded a question , in spanish , on hatecrimes legislation that was approved by the senate on thursday night an example of how reporters use any chance to interview to get him talking about a variety of subjects reporters praised mr menendez for his accessibility and his willingness to discuss any range of topics , in terms that viewers can readily grasp he wants to engage with hispanic community , said lori montenegro , a washington correspondent for telemundo he wants them to be part of the process he wants them to understand in contrast , to three interviews with mr menendez this week , she said , there had been none with mr martinez of florida ms montenegro he s very eloquent he breaks it down he s not very fancy in the words he is simple and to the point and he is known people know him
the question being asked around washington on wednesday was this should n't the man chosen to run the united states treasury which oversees the internal revenue service have had a better understanding of what taxes he owed \? the senate finance committee disclosed tuesday that the treasury nominee , , had failed to pay more than 34 , 000 in taxes for and when he was a senior official at the from 2001 to 2003 , including a small payment in 2004 after he left the imf , like other international organizations , does not withhold payroll taxes for social security and medicare from its american employees' paychecks but it provides documents to help them understand their tax obligations , including a tax booklet the version of the booklet released by the senate committee explained , on page 4 , how to pay payroll taxes mr geithner acknowledged that he received all of the paperwork , according to committee documents and he is familiar with payroll taxes , because he has paid them for household employees in the past , as well as for his personal consulting business still , several tax experts said , it is an easy mistake for an employee of an international organization to make this is not your normal situation between an employer and an employee , said saul brenner , a tax partner at berdon , an accounting and advisory firm did he make a mistake \? absolutely but it appears that both he and his accountant made a mistake american companies and their employees typically split payroll taxes for social security and medicare each pays 62 percent of the employee s gross income to cover the social security piece , along with an additional 145 percent for medicare but the imf is a taxexempt organization its employees who are not american citizens do not owe these taxes still , imf employees who are american citizens must pay these taxes , just as if they were selfemployed selfemployed individuals are responsible for paying all of the taxes on their own , and must file an additional form with their 1040 tax return when they do so the imf pays its employees a tax allowance every three months that covers the employer s portion of the taxes , and routinely provides employees with a quarterly breakdown of that allowance the senate documents said that mr geithner had prepared his own taxes in 2001 and 2002 however , an accountant reviewed his 2001 return and also failed to catch the mistake in 2003 and 2004 , he used an accountant who advised him that he was exempt from selfemployment taxes the irs has noted that many employees of international organizations , including foreign embassies and consular offices , have made mistakes in filing their taxes for example , an irs notice in 2006 said that up to half of such employees had incorrectly filed their tax returns , making errors like failure to pay selfemployment taxes the irs offered a onetime settlement to resolve these issues there was so much confusion about these and related rules that the irs offered a settlement initiative , said william massey , senior tax analyst in the tax and accounting unit of thomson reuters the error is not uncommon , as the statutory provisions governing this situation are very convoluted i have read that he relied on his accountant and that could have been an easy mistake for the average accountant to make given the complexity of the code sections involving exceptions to exceptions , mr massey said the senate documents indicated that mr geithner had used tax software in the past , but did not make clear whether he had used it in 2001 and 2002 to prepare his returns even if he had used the software in those years , tax experts said the software would probably not have warned him that he was making a mistake i do know on my software this is a mistake that could be made by an inexperienced operator , said bill gruen , a certified public account from washington who has imf employees as clients he said that income reported on w2 forms usually had payroll taxes withheld but , he said , the w2 forms sent out by the imf say simply none on those lines since mr geithner probably described himself as an employee , the software would not have prompted him to file a schedule se , which is used by the selfemployed to file payroll taxes , mr gruen said that exposes the problem with that software , in my opinion , mr gruen added mr geithner worked at the imf after leaving the treasury department , where he was under secretary for international affairs in bill clinton s administration he became president of the new york federal reserve in late 2003

as the old saying goes , victory has a hundred fathers but defeat is an orphan so as the rangers now teeter on the edge of playoff disqualification , the disowning process has begun and accusations are starting to float to the surface , even before the body does after watching them drop five games in their last seven outings , larry brooks in today s post drops his gloves and takes some swings at the rangers this team has no definable spirit has no soul there s less here than meets the eye there s less urgency than required less commitment forget that there is no center to actually make a play , there is no center to hold there is no identity , no matter how hard john tortorella attempts to stamp his own on this stoic group all that may or may not be true but wait wasn t sean avery supposed to give them the boost this lifeless group required to put them back in the hunt \? in fairness , avery has been effective to a good degree \( and mostly a good boy , too , although we ll address his saturday shenanigans shortly \) but apparently even the unsavory avery can t save them the rangers are not dead yet , and if they can find a way to overcome their limitations \( like a seasonlong substandard defense corps \) they might still find themselves going to the party next week it s not going to be easy , and the schedule may not be their friend they now face montreal , then a home and away against the flyers montreal , in front of them by three points , has their game in hand against ottawa tonight , then plays rangers , then boston and pittsburgh florida has philly , atlanta then washington if montreal wins against ottawa tonight , that should give the habs a big enough cushion , and it will come down to a threegame season against florida just to keep things simple , let s dangerously assume that canadiens win tonight although it s not a given , especially since habs inside out reports from the canadiens morning skate that montreal will tonight be without both their top defenseman , andrei markov , and their most potent powerplay weapon , mathieu schneider the pair s status for tomorrow s game against the rangers is uncertain here are the scenarios confronting rangers and florida if they end up with the same record in these three games , that is all the rangers need they win the first tiebreak based on more wins , since the rangers would have one more if they end up tied in points and wins let s say the rangers lose three games after regulation and florida wins one and loses one in regulation and one after regulation the panthers get the spot since the second tie break is most points gained in headtohead competition florida won the season series 7 points to 3 \( they won three times in regulation and got a bonus point in a postgame skills competition , while the rangers managed only one twopoint win , plus a victory in a postgame skills competition \) if this is too confusing , blame the rule that guarantees teams a point for an overtime or shootout loss unsavory saturday in case you missed it , here is what the unsavory avery pulled on saturday afternoon in boston and this video is both the nesn feed , so you must endure the least objective announcer in the nhl , and then the msg feed sam rosen has it right the officials didn t see it live , saw it only on the center ice scoreboard and called the penalty from that once upon a time \( and probably even now \) there was an nhl regulation prohibiting arena personnel from showing replays like that for just that reason on one hand , the officials ending up making the right call matching minors to both avery for unsportsmanlike conduct and to goalie tim thomas for roughing on the punches he threw at fredrik sj str m but unless the league wants to move to reviewing everything up in the video booth or in the war room in toronto , the calls should remain on the ice with the officials , unaided by anything except video of goal no goal calls as prescribed in the rule book if that regulation is still in effect , one would expect boston will be fined for breaking it , or at least reprimanded and hope the league will be circulating a memo today to the teams refreshing their memories about it , reminding them that fines will result if they do not adhere and if that rule has been somehow dropped , it should be immediately reinstituted it s one thing for clubs to have a homeice advantage of the crowd , last stick down on the faceoff and last change of players , and quite another for the home team s inhouse entertainment system to be a factor in officiating the game as for lovable sean , andy brickley on the bruins telecast has it somewhat right it s one thing to get under the opponent s skin , at which avery excels but this it totally uncalled for , brickley says he s out of line and yet , isn t that how you get under other players skins , by getting out of line \?

especially the emphasis on language and the use of dispersed , decentered installations taken together they say more about art today , more clearly , than most biennials the manipulation of time fractured , layered , circular ties together the work in these shows so does a desire to achieve the physical presence of art objects , but without their fixed materiality here the materials of note are narrative , spoken words and images moving and still , as well as experience filtered through the framework of psychology and anthropology it is worth noting and a mite depressing for the home team that none of the artists at x are american luke fowler , who extravagantly distorts the conventions of documentary filmmaking in the four works on view here , is scottish and based in glasgow keren cytter was born in tel aviv and now works in berlin her eight films , made since 2000 , reveal a voracious appetite for all cinematic genres and a few from television the britishborn tris vonnamichell for the moment lives a mostly itinerant existence , giving performances and setting up his pieces , which usually involve parts of previous works his installations at the x initiative consist of slide projections of his own and found photographs , or recordings of performances in which he tells and retells , to an almost obsessive degree , a tale that weaves together his incessant travels , personal experiences and haphazard pursuit of history these artists all younger than 33 have been seen in new york before all were included in the new museum s the generational younger than jesus triennial this spring mr fowler and ms cytter have had small solo shows in galleries and alternative spaces , and mr vonnamichell performed on the opening weekend of plot 09 on governors island in june but at the x initiative , cecilia alemani , the curatorial director , has given each of them the run of a spacious floor in the large west 22nd street loft building that once housed the dia center for the arts , and they have made the most of it the immersive experience of images , sounds and personalities that each has created blurs fact and fiction , medium and message the contrasts and similarities among their efforts ultimately form a kind of loop warriors four films by luke fowler , 20032008 showcases the most grounded of these three artists but while mr fowler makes documentaries about artists and eccentrics marginalized by society , his background in music and his fluency in the history of underground film inspire him to take dizzying liberties with the documentary form he mixes existing footage with staged and new film , segues into passages of nearly abstract sights and sounds , and sometimes as with the way out , a film made with kosten koper in 2003 loses his subject altogether these strategies help mr fowler s films expand beyond their subjects in a thrilling way pilgrimage from scattered points \( from 2006 and shown that year at white columns \) is a poignant study of the british composer cornelius cardew \( 193681 \) and the scratch orchestra \( 196873 \) that he helped found , as well as the radical notions of music and performance it lived by but it is also a study of the ideals and disappointments of the 1960s bogman palmjaguar \( 2007 \) is both a portrait of an eccentric selftaught naturalist consumed by his fight against being classified as a paranoid schizophrenic and a lyrical meditation on the peat bogs of scotland , with which he is equally obsessed there is no central character in an abbeyview film \( 2008 \) , a short tribute to a scottish village that evokes dan graham s 1960s photographs of suburban new jersey its stark views of subdivisions , traffic , parks and younger residents are enhanced by a haunting soundtrack an a cappella lament titled warriors , written and sung by the glasgow musician richard youngs it suggests that alienation , while not exactly pleasant , may not be a modern invention mr fowler s films are screened in a small theater built in the middle of the otherwise empty third floor , which concentrates their psychological and aural impact ms cytter , meanwhile , lays siege to the second floor , with multiple screens and monitors and large drawings in her show keren cytter the mysterious serious all is revealed the videos projected , the drawings illuminated in a timed sequence that forces movement and the films and images have a roaming quality themselves , moving through documentary , film noir and soap opera while rehashing roman polanki s repulsion \( a threescreen surprise \) or conjuring up godard or hitchcock the entire medium , in fact , is in flux scenes repeat , actors change character , the camera wobbles , music encroaches , voices and mouths are out of sync but against such selfconscious structuralism there is ms cytter s wild sense of cinematic beauty and the intensity of her churning narratives , which focus on sex , violence and family life , and the vicissitudes of memory and dreams the work is not all of equal quality i recommend something happened \( 2007 \) and four seasons \( 2009 \) but ms cytter s talent is formidably apparent on the fourth floor mr vonnamichell s installation reaches to all four corners , feeling stretched and a little barren but move around , and it comes quietly to life short sound pieces trickle from speakers around the space altered photographs of a previous , similarly austere exhibition are displayed on tables under glass blackandwhite images of urban settings click past on slide projectors the glue is the spoken word headsets play different accounts of a nomadic existence that takes mr vonnamichell from japan \( where he was a homeless teenager \) , to detroit , to berlin , to new york , detailing strange encounters , lost cameras and personal quests and in monumental detours insignificant fixtures , a continuing work that he started last year , he struggles to make sense of torn and stained paper on which he wrote a long forgotten dream , his words exquisitely calibrated to the images from two slide projectors mr vonnamichell speaks at something like the speed of thought , in a way that reflects the brain s very synapses , hiccups , repetitions , sudden shifts and reflexive filing system as he recounts his experiences , jumping from track to track , he might easily be the subject of one of mr fowler s films it is amazing to enter his neural pathways , if you let yourself all three exhibitions , and the art in them , have a transitory quality , both in their subjects and their presentation nothing seems really fixed today and everyday , a small show of nine artists that is in the garagelike structure on the building s roof , maintains this mood , although it is far more object oriented the show was organized by the artist and independent curator margaret lee , who contributed a photograph resembling an oversize postcard that depicts elements from the other participants' work arranged in a handsome still life the other artists then reclaimed these elements and made works with and around them for josh klein this meant taking a clumsy redglazed ceramic desk caddy and placing it on an office desk complete with chair and computer , all of which he glazed with shades of lightbeige \( claycolored \) paint donna chung s painted cardboard sculpture of a big slice of watermelon was returned to her wrapped in semitransparent paper , and it remains so , figuring in an ephemeral installation of rope and cut paper the ensemble echoes the tan cardboard and white paint of the watermelon slice , which are only really visible in ms lee s photograph olaf breuning , sam wilson , anicka yi and maggie peng , piet houtenbos and carissa rodriguez are also represented twice the props in ms lee s photograph are yeast for the art like its shows the x initiative is also nomadic a loose alliance of art dealers , collectors and curators led by the dealer elizabeth dee , it was given use of the old dia building by the new owners for one year starting in march in a sense x occupies exdia like a hermit crab set up house in an empty shell opening with an overlarge retrospective of the filmmaker derek jarman , followed by no soul for sale , a performanceheavy doityourself art fair , the group has gradually revived the building as an alternative space the new shows , collectively known as phase two , are the most impressive so far they remind us how important dia once was to new york as a curatorial example and how much it is missed , but they also surpass dia in their commitment to the new at x we see young curators and artists working without much interference from above , which does n't happen nearly enough in new york museums these days that s a strange thing the relationship between freedom and quality
ten years ago , i was given an assignment to write an article on bullying for mademoiselle this was not long after columbine and bullying presumed then to have driven the shooters to murdersuicide was a hot topic my own special contribution to the national conversation would involve making contact with a girl i ll call x , whom i recalled as having been particularly cruel to me in 7th and 8th grades i was going to confront x about this and find out what she had been feeling at the time and how she had turned out why i thought this would possibly be a good or even feasible thing to do , i can t begin to fathom now from the start , there were difficulties my old school had no records on x i didn t know where she d ended up , or if she d gotten married and changed her last name the only contact i had , via the school , was for another classmate , with whom i recalled also being friends in 7th grade i called her she was guardedly nice i told her what i was trying to do and why and asked if she had any information on x no , she said and then , in a rush , as though she couldn t hold it back , added , but i really don t remember her bullying you she didn t share any of my memories how i d come to school and find that , under x s spell , none of the girls were talking to me , could be seated near me , could even bring themselves to look at me funny , she said i don t remember any of that at all i just remember your going off to be with the popular crowd and dumping me an accusation that was , of course , true but that had somehow , conveniently , erased itself from my memory these days , i come back a lot to memories of 7th and 8th grade \( and the unreliable narrators of those memories \) , because my elder daughter , julia , is now in 7th grade , which means , of late , that she lives in a world filled with endless girl dramas of the most unfortunate and , alas , ordinary kind as i watch her attempt to make sense of all this , i try to keep a respectful distance there is no greater error , i ve come to think , than for a mother to get down in the emotional mire of her daughter s girl stuff it is undignified inappropriate , even and ultimately , judging from what i ve seen thus far , it s deeply toxic so i try to sit back and act like an adult but while she s in school , i go up to my attic and create a parallel universe in which she and i are best friends in fiction it s what i hope my next book project will be , you see a tween timetravel novel set in 1977 , when there really was a roller rink on waverly place , and i was in 7th grade the book is ostensibly all about a daughter s learning that she can t meddle in her mother s \( past \) life she has to let her have bad experiences and grow up to be who she is destined to be but it s not coincidental that , in the course of learning these lessons , my fictional daughter lives in a world completely controlled , defined and circumscribed by me it s a funny thing , this maternal pushpull of desired connection and necessary distance i sense it in a number of the tween books that i ve been reading this past year bernadette , the 40yearold protagonist of sue corbett s novel 12 again , disappears from her children s life , then reappears as a tween herself , able in this way to forge new connections with both her dead mother and her 12yearold son twelve , lauren myracle s bestseller , doesn t contain any such magical transformations or time travel yet , there s an older sister whose bookshelves contain the sort of bad judy blume books you don t see on shelves normally these days the books featuring sex , divorce and bullying and you feel , behind the sister s voice , an authorial presence saying , this was my world connect to me but are such connections really possible \? or even desirable \? the writer sarah wildman found a way to connect to her 13yearold self and an adult audience after she combed through her middle school journals and read some selections out loud as part of a show called mortified that was staged a few months ago in washington , dc her 13yearold self talked about her first boyfriend \( he s mad at me he thinks i m mad at him \) her music \( meat loaf \) , and her protopolitics \( i think that the vietnam war was pointless for us to get into my mom attended many protests my dad went to a few one they went to together , tear gas was thrown yuck what should i wear tomorrow \? \) and she asked , poignantly , does anyone ever figure themselves out \? wildman wasn t drawn back to 8th grade via motherhood her daughter is only 11 months old yet she told me that in reading her old journals she did find herself thinking of how her past might blend into her daughter s future i m in this transition , she said , of looking at the continuity of self and the universality of childhood without the editing , though , without the sort of shaping and molding and polishing that were necessary to turn wildman s rambling old diaries into a coherent sevenminute narrative , i m not sure that our selves really are so continuous and the experiences of childhood are not really as universal ie , as accessible to us as parents as we d like to believe i don t know if anything remains of the journals i began to scribble in obsessively back in 7th grade i assume not they brought me plenty of trouble even back then , when one was seized by the boys and read aloud in french class that readaloud incident is just one of many memories of victimization that , until the shock of my mademoiselle reporting , i d long carried forward as the urnarrative of what we d now call my tween years i doubt i m the only woman who constructed an early story of herself in this way whether these stories of aggrievedness shift , or whether they eternally stick may , i imagine , be one of the dividing lines between extended girlhood and something more like adulthood the problem with the shift and the good thing about the shift is that it moves you to another universe one in which the old stories just don t make a lot of sense and where you simply can t be your daughter s 7th grade bff
when alex rodriguez faces the news media tuesday at 1 30 pm , he will endure a barrage of questions , many of them ones that espn s peter gammons did not ask about arod s 2003 positive steroid test that was first revealed by sports illustrated his words will be broadcast live by espnews \( and espn radio \) , the yes network and sportsnet new york the questioners will shout at him , trying to throw him off balance so that he will spill more details about what he abused and how much he took he wo n't be in the sort of friendly confines where he met a toopolite gammons , who avoided followup questions he will be under a canopy at steinbrenner field with a bunch of nosy guests with notebooks and cameras , none of whom he personally invited will he answer the questions fully or stalk from the horde as crabby roger clemens did last year at the denialofusingsteroids news conference he called \? or will arod start the work of salvaging his soiled image \? to an extent , rodriguez is fighting for redemption at yes , which scott boras , his agent , said in 2007 would see its worth rise with longterm aid from his client s socalled iconic value but recent actions taken by yes demonstrate the shortterm erosion of rodriguez s value after the sports illustrated story broke online , the channel replaced its yankeeography of arod with one of a much safer icon , yogi berra yes then yanked a yankees classics game starring arod in favor of a three homerun game by paul o'neill again , a safer icon came to yes s emotional rescue  such is yes s power , to inflict punitive preemption of a onceglittering star in particular the arod yankeeography that waited to be created until his fifth season in pinstripes and earned three new york emmy nominations days after being benched yes cannot ignore arod for long he is contracted to be a yankee for nine more seasons he is a major part of the team s offense except in the postseason but archival arod could suffer he was interviewed on yes s centerstage series , has been featured on yesterdays with his exwife cynthia , and starred in many games , including one in which he hit three home runs and drove in 10 runs and another in which he hit his 500th homer it is hard not to view arod s performance on tuesday as a yes litmus test the more he says , the more his archival second self will be forgiven it s unfair to say that , said eric handler , a spokesman for yes now he 'll be able to address his side of the story we expect to put his classics back in rotation yes will update the centerstage and yankeeography to reflect his steroid admission his yesterdays program will be shelved because of his divorce \( like the effect that joe torre s divorce from the yankees had on his yankeeography seen it lately \? \) and the arod classics \? they can proceed with this caution arod did not test positive this season thanks for watching this clean yes broadcast one of the many reporters scheduled to be in tampa , fla , to listen to rodriguez will be sports illustrated s selena roberts , who cowrote the story about his positive steroid test during rodriguez s interview on espn , he claimed , with serial incorrectness , that she had stalked him had been thrown out of his new york apartment had been dispatched by university of miami police for trespassing when she asked him about his positive steroid test , and tried to break into my house where my girls are up there sleeping this lady , he called roberts , a former sports columnist for the new york times subsequently , rodriguez called to apologize privately to her but that was not enough for her boss , terry mcdonell , editor of the sports illustrated group he said he wanted rodriguez to publicly admit that his accusations were false i want the record to be set straight , mcdonell said in a telephone interview he said he had pressured arod s public relations advisor at the outside eyes agency in newport beach , calif , to force him into a public accounting they 've tried to get away with a private apology , which is outrageous and unfair and allowed the preposterous charges to stand , he said  mcdonell s dealings have been with the firm s ben porwitt , who did not return a call for comment mcdonell said there was no plan to take legal action against rodriguez even if he does not renounce his accusations against roberts i'm hoping this press conference will be a really fine hour for sports journalism , mcdonell said i hope it will be fair , direct and go specifically to answer questions that will shed light on the period when he was taking these drugs , and clarify things that have fallen off the story , like the attack on selena
christmas island , australia deep in the jungle on this small island lost in the indian ocean , s new 370 million reaches its full power after its lights come on at dusk bracketed by , steep cliffs and the sea , it rises from the enveloping darkness and becomes visible from the island s only inhabited corner , about 10 miles away the center opened a few days before christmas but now nearly full with refugees from afghanistan and sri lanka has come to symbolize what many call one of australia s defining fears the arrival of boat people from asia all boat people seeking asylum in australia are first brought here to , just 220 miles south of indonesia but nearly 1 , 000 miles from the australian mainland , and most are now held at enormous cost within the center s electrified , 13foothigh razorwire fences but even as boats arrive every few days , advocates for refugees and even the government s own human rights commission are urging the government to close the place down and sort the asylumseekers on the mainland they compare christmas island to guant namo bay or describe it as a reincarnation of the many notorious prison islands in australia s convict history they put this center way out here on this remote island , and then they built it way , way , way out on the island in the jungle , said charlene thompson , a social worker who counsels asylumseekers here she equated the new center to port arthur , a 19thcentury penal colony in tasmania , australia s southernmost island it s a jail , a highsecurity jail , and it feels like the asylumseekers are being treated as criminals the influx of boat people , which has swung elections in the past , has rattled the government of prime minister kevin rudd a year before another election recently , mr rudd , accused by the opposition of being soft on illegal , personally asked indonesia s president , susilo bambang yudhoyono , to intercept a wooden cargo ship from malaysia with 260 sri lankans bound for australia if the sri lankans , now held in indonesia , had been brought here , their numbers would probably have pushed the center beyond its capacity of 1 , 200 that , in turn , could have forced the government to start processing the boat people on the mainland i make absolutely no apology whatsoever for taking a hard line on illegal immigration to australia , said mr rudd , who had initially won praise from refugee advocates for reversing some of the harshest antiimmigration measures of his predecessor , john howard , including charging asylum seekers for their stay in government facilities mr rudd has continued to send boat people here for processing he has also retained his predecessor s excision policy , under which asylum seekers on islands like this one are barred from the mainland s refugee review system at first reluctant to use the new center , the symbol of his predecessor s policies , mr rudd housed the boat people in an older facility here but a surge of asylum seekers late last year forced the authorities to start using the new center nearly 2 , 000 boat people have been sent to christmas island this year currently , their numbers are believed to match the island s local population of 1 , 100 the boat people constitute only about 10 percent of all asylum seekers to australia , according to immigration officials , with most simply arriving by plane what is more , the boat people are far more likely to be recognized as political refugees after their applications are reviewed over a period of three to four months here nevertheless , the arrival of illegal boats filled with asians evokes a primordial fear here , one that has been instilled over past decades of antiasian immigration policies and is still stoked by conservative politicians there is considerable anxiety about people coming by boat and from the north , said bernadette mcgrath , the director of , who spent six months investigating the government s treatment of refugees here it s very deep in our psyche so regardless of how close a boat may have gotten to the mainland , the australian authorities first steer it to christmas island , linked to the mainland only by a fourhour flight to perth , 1 , 650 miles to the southeast , that operates four times a week a supply ship docks here every five or six weeks newspapers are delivered 10 days late the internet remains costly and slow named by a british navigator who spotted it on christmas day in 1643 , the island remained uninhabited until about a century ago , when phosphate was discovered the british brought indentured workers from asia to christmas island , which became part of australia half a century ago until the 1980s , the island was racially stratified , with white australian managers overseeing asian workers barred from whitesonly neighborhoods boat people who were interviewed said they were surprised to find themselves on an island they had never heard of when we studied geography , our teachers never showed us christmas island , said a 17yearold ethnic hazara boy from ghazni province in afghanistan , who had come here with his parents , two brothers and three sisters if we look at a world map , christmas island is hiding in the map it s so small because of the distance , building and operating the center cost several times what it would have on the mainland , according to the australian news media the distance also keeps the activists , lawyers and media away from the boat people , said gordon thomson , president of the the government has barred journalists from touring the center so far , only two have been permitted inside the visitors' room , where they have interviewed detainees according to a by the australian human rights commission , a government organization , the new center looks and feels like a prison it called the security measures excessive and inappropriate for accommodating asylum seekers inside the main fence , the report said , each compound is enclosed in a separate fence , and walkways are enclosed within cagelike structures the immigration department the commission s recommendation to stop using christmas island for detention it described the use of islands like this one as essential components of strong border control about 50 asylum seekers , mostly families with children , have been permitted to stay in residential neighborhoods on the island despite some local grumbling about the flood of boat people and immigration workers , the asylum seekers said they felt welcomed people here are all good , said a 35yearold iranian man who was staying with his wife and two sons on a block with sri lankan and afghan asylum seekers , and whose refugee application had just been approved the iranian , who like others asked that his name not be used because of fears that his relatives might suffer back home , said he and his wife had felt in danger after converting to christianity four years ago and joining the iranian branch of the assemblies of god he said he had paid 70 , 000 to smugglers to take his family from tehran through malaysia and indonesia , and finally on a 11day boat trip toward australia before being intercepted by the australian navy that has been the most common route for asylum seekers but more recently , since the end of the civil war in sri lanka in may , many tamils from northern sri lanka have boarded boats bound directly for australia , more than 3 , 000 miles away a sri lankan family of four still waiting for a ruling on their refugee application said they had spent one month at sea with 70 other people before being brought here three months ago the other morning at a local public school that the refugees' children attend daily , the young immigrants practiced english composition , played polo hockey or baked chocolate chip cookies the children s knowledge of australia is very limited , said mary ford , 29 , who began teaching here five months ago after moving from the mainland they would n't know australia s cities none of them have ever heard of christmas island most australians have n't i did n't know , geographically , where it was until i moved here people kept asking me , christmas island \? where s that \?

the powerful shubert organization , which owns the most theaters on broadway , has struck a new business deal with two respected theater producers that may lead to greater competition among other producers for the best broadway houses and foreshadow more entrepreneurial ventures philip j smith and robert e wankel , the chairman and president of the shubert organization , have signed a threeyear development deal with frederick zollo and robert cole , tony award winners for angels in america under the contract , the shubert organization could invest in zollocole shows up to a fixed percentage which none of them would reveal or act as advisers without investing jointly produced shows would be guaranteed a shubert theater , likely the best available if mr zollo and mr cole pursued a production without shubert interest , which the four said was unlikely , they would compete for theaters with other producers some industry observers , citing the laws of supply and demand , said that more competition for theater space would provide only more incentive for producers to create plays and musicals that held the widest appeal , perhaps by casting ever more star actors demonstrating that a show could be a commercial hit is essential to securing a booking in one of the 40 broadway houses , of which the shubert group has 17 mr smith and mr wankel said in interviews that their new venture also reflected the uncertain economic era that they were stepping in to help bankroll and mount their own productions at a time when some investors may still be skittish about broadway mr zollo and mr cole are two of the producers of the broadway hit a steady rain \( that play is running at a shubert theater , but the deal came about after opening night , the men said \) the four said that no fees have been paid up front , though mr zollo and mr cole are working out of shubert offices broadway has had somewhat similar deals before the director and writer james lapine had a firstlook deal with the shubert group in the 1990s , which generated the musicals passion and the play dirty blonde , but mr lapine was not a producer the two other major theater owners , the nederlander organization and jujamcyn theaters , have had development deals with other artists , and have staff members who develop shows particularly jujamcyn , which has had deals with producers but is far smaller \( with five theaters \) than the shubert group mr smith said this deal was unusual for the shubert organization , widely considered the most powerful theater owner on broadway because of the number and quality of its houses the organization has never had veteran independent producers working inhouse on shows in which the company has a right to develop and invest indeed , the deal marks one of the most assertive business moves by the organization since the death , in 2008 , of its leader , gerald schoenfeld , who was once actively involved in producing theater we ve been less handson over the last many years because there was no need to help producers by investing in their shows , mr smith said it would have been cruel to take over , say , our two best playhouses and fill them with our own plays that would not have gone over well with producers

near the starting line of the soweto marathon , i watched a group of eight men in matching runningclub singlets standing in a circle , highstepping and chanting in zulu with their voices in perfect unison , they exuded unbridled energy behind me , a tall middleaged man with long dreadlocks looked at my bib and called me by name michelle , do not worry they will regret it later as the singing continued , i wondered what in the world am i doing here \? i knew only part of the answer about a year before the november marathon , my husband and i had moved with our five children to gaborone , botswana , just north of the south african border , so i could work as a pediatrician in an hiv clinic there we had been running for several years \( me , slowly he , quickly \) and we continued after our transatlantic relocation slowly we learned how firmly entrenched running was in the southern african culture a marathon was nothing the comrades \( an annual 90kilometer jaunt in eastern south africa \) now was a race we decided to use running as a way to experience a place we wanted to visit , soweto , the largest predominantly black township in south africa home to two million people , it was established under the apartheid regime but has become a symbol of pride and renewal within south africa s struggle to establish itself as a democracy at our home in botswana , we printed marathon training programs and hung them on our refrigerator our nanny laughed at us you 're running long \? why \? do n't you know that everyone will say , why are those white people running \? ' we asked ourselves the same thing while life in south africa is permeated with racial tension , botswana a former british protectorate , never colonized and independent for more than 40 years has virtually none color seemed to me to be largely irrelevant during my time there our running , though , was certainly entertaining for a great many batswana on my 6 am runs i passed the same security guards changing shifts , finishing their 12hour workdays , with some ready to walk farther to get home than i would go that morning in my nikes sometimes i would be passed by a man in a blue jumpsuit the standard uniform of anyone doing manual labor for the government and black hardsoled shoes he was running because he was late to his job cutting roadside weeds with a machete i kept my head down while running , perhaps out of guilt the guards and the laborer in the blue jumpsuit probably had tea for breakfast and soft porridge for their evening meal and that was it by running for exercise , i felt like i was effectively flaunting my riches , saying hey , sorry about your luck if i do n't do this , i 'll get fat at the starting line on race day , i felt absolved of what i had come to think of as runner s guilt the crowd was 20 , 000plus strong , and i was definitely a minority people around me spoke in zulu , sesotho , xhosa , setswana , afrikaans and english the race started , and off we went through the streets of soweto , passing neatly tended homes and yards mixed with corrugated tin shacks spectators were out in force , cheering us on on a pace to finish about 4 hours 30 minutes , i was clearly in the back of the pack rounding the 10kilometer mark , the water stations were out of water orange sports drink was provided , but the water was finished , we were told a lone spectator standing on the median yelled , rule no 1 in soweto bring your own water you got to learn that ! we continued , up and down treacherous hills botswana , home to the kalahari desert , defines flat during our training runs , we could see two or three miles ahead not so in soweto the hills and the weather were merciless , and getting worse as the sun rose , the locals came outside and used their garden hoses to give runners a quick drink or shower others held bowls of water and plastic cups a communal tap occasionally a lone runner would cry out the first line of a traditional callandresponse song , and the crowd of spectators would join in perfect harmony the hills continued , up legendary vilakazi street , where i passed the former homes of archbishop desmond tutu and nelson and winnie mandela \( now the mandela house museum \) rounding the bend at the 20mile mark , i was contemplating how much history was packed into that one kilometer when i saw people surrounding a runner on the ground immediately i could see that the hills had been far too much for him fellow members of his running club , wearing matching red singlets , were trying to resuscitate him as others looked on in tears he was doing fine , and he just fell over , one runner said i stopped to assist with cpr , and was quickly joined by one of my colleagues who was also running the marathon we worked with the people who were attending to the man and then with the paramedics when they arrived the passing minutes felt like an eternity the rules say that the race is supposed to be stopped if a runner is down , one of the fallen runner s exasperated friends said i looked at the police officer watching nearby i called them , he said , referring to the paramedics the race continued bystanders looked on with serious faces what could anyone say \? sure , we were running a marathon , an organized road race , but this was africa there were probably few people on the course , myself included , who had not seen death , grim , horrible death , up close the paramedics came and took him away a local newspaper later reported that the man died i continued for the final 10 kilometers by now the sun was high in the sky , and even my training runs in the cloudless botswana heat seemed feeble preparation i walked and ran the last miles coke served at the waterless water stations kept me going i was sipping a cup when i saw a flatbed truck go by it s the water ! someone yelled indeed , the missing boxes of water had been found , and less than a mile from the finish , there was an abundance i found an older man attempting , like me , to jog rather than walk the last stretch he said he had grown up in soweto , running the marathon every year he lamented his poor training this year as we rounded a bend , an impatient driver overtook us , clipping the toe of my shoe i winced back tears , but how could i complain considering what i saw at mile 20 \? i bid goodbye to my friend \( who had slowed to a walk again \) and finished the race i crossed the finish line with a time of 5 48 fine , considering the punishing hills and the detour to assist the fallen runner i said a quiet word of thanks , as i had most days on that continent , for health , for life , and for the ability to so fully see and feel all of the sharp realities of being in this land , a marathon was just another day
miami the leading organization for cuban exiles here is calling on the white house to expand relations with s government , and funnel much more public and private american money to the cuban people a 14page proposal from the group , the cuban american national foundation , lays out what the document calls a break from the past that would chart a new direction for uscuba policy it is the basis of an ongoing discussion with the obama administration , white house and foundation officials said , and it amounts to the group s most significant rejection of a national approach to cuba that it helped shape and that has been defined by hostility and limited contact with the island foundation officials described it as an effort to direct attention away from fidel and ra l castro and toward the cuban people for 50 years we have been trying to change the cuban government , the cuban regime , said the foundation s president , francisco j hernandez , a veteran of the bay of pigs invasion in april 1961 at the present time , what we have to do is change the emphasis to the cuban people because they are going to be the ones who change things in cuba the stops short of calling for an end to the 47yearold trade embargo the united states has imposed on cuba mr hernandez said the embargo should remain until the cuban government gives more freedom and human rights to people but he also described it as only a symbol and not something that is that important anymore in a reversal from the group s founding principles , he said american policy should focus not on sanctions but on proactive policies that direct resources to the island in addition to recommending an increase in how much money cubanamericans can send to their relatives in cuba which the obama administration has said it plans to enact it says the 1997 ban on cash aid from the american government should also be rescinded it advocates an increase in private aid for prodemocracy groups and a plan for permitting cubanamericans and others , under license , to send cash , building materials , agricultural implements and provide services to independent , private entrepreneurs the proposal also urges the united states to encourage travel to cuba for cultural , academic or humanitarian purposes , returning to the standards of 1999 , before the bush administration tightened limits and it identifies several ways to engage diplomatically for instance , it says that semiannual meetings between cuban and american officials to discuss migration from the island , suspended in 2004 , should be reestablished and that the white house should remove restrictions limiting the travel of cuban interests section employees in washington to within 25 miles from their offices , if the cuban government agrees to remove a similar boundary for american diplomats in havana robert pastor , a professor of international relations at american university , said the document was striking for both its new ideas and its repudiation of policies that the group once favored it basically says previous efforts have failed the embargo did n't work , said mr pastor , who was president jimmy carter s national security adviser for latin america that , from the cuban american national foundation , is a very significant statement mr pastor said the shift in tone could help the obama administration achieve its stated goal of more open relations with cuba momentum for such a change has been building in the presidential campaign , aides to barack obama called president george w bush s policy toward cuba a humanitarian and strategic blunder , and as president , mr obama recently ordered a comprehensive review of united statescuba policy several members of congress have also drafted legislation to lift a ban on all travel to cuba , and this week , a congressional delegation that met separately with ra l and fidel castro said the government signaled a desire for warmer relations mr pastor said the foundation seemed willing to become a partner in greater engagement between the united states and cuba , but he was skeptical of the group s plan to channel money to the island nation from the federal government or from organizations tied to cuban exiles the proposal to support civil society in cuba is theoretically desirable from the us perspective but it s impractical because the cuban government sees it as a new form of regime change , said mr pastor , who visited the island in march it s counterproductive because it makes the dissidents seem like tools of miami rather than independent patriots at caf versailles , a restaurant in the little havana section of miami that has long been a gathering spot for anticastro protesters , the proposal was greeted with familiar , emotional criticism as he offered paintings of the cuban countryside for sale from his van in the parking lot , rodolfo frometa , 64 , could not hide his anger i would open the doors to cuba , mr frometa shouted , but it would be with the use of force to remove the system completely and create a democracy mr frometa said his son , brother and father were all killed by the castro government in 1994 , he was convicted in miami on charges that he and an accomplice tried to buy a stinger missile to attack cuba , and he served 41 months in prison the foundation will also probably face opposition from florida s four cubanamerican republican members of congress senator mel martinez and representatives mario and lincoln diazbalart , and ileana roslehtinen all have historically opposed engagement with cuba unless the government meets strict conditions none returned telephone calls or responded to email seeking comment mr hernandez , however , said the foundation would not be intimidated by the old guard to which it once belonged we have to adapt , he said and that is what we have done
by almost any measure , has had a sensational season driving a stock car in the sprint cup series so far , anyway winning three races and nearly 55 million , finishing in the top five in half of the 26 races and amassing a fat 179point lead in the driver standings and yet , as of sunday afternoon , none of these impressive statistics will make much of a difference in helping stewart win a third series title now begins the playoffs the 10race , 12driver chase for the sprint cup and stewart will have to establish himself again the intensity level comes back like it was at the beginning of the year for us , stewart , in his first season as a car owner , said in an interview thursday in new york from the weekend we got locked in to the chase , it was like a waiting period but here is the hitch stewart will not start the chase in first place , or alone in second all 12 drivers who have qualified for the chase have been awarded 5 , 000 points , a purely arbitrary number , and have been given 10 bonus points for each race they have won so when the sylvania 300 gets under way sunday in loudon , nh , stewart and , who also won three races , will actually be 10 points behind , who was 515 points behind stewart after the most recent race on sept 12 , but who has won four races \( kyle busch also had four wins , tying martin s series lead , but he missed claiming a spot in the chase by 8 points \) martin s lead will probably not hold up through the afternoon , let alone all 10 chase races this is the sixth year of the chase , and the points leader going into the chase has ended up winning the championship only two times stewart in 2005 and johnson in 2007 you 've got to take what you learned over the first 26 races , but it is like starting over again , jeff gordon said thursday as the chase drivers made a pit stop in new york but a closer chase means more viewers tuning in or , to be more accurate , keeps viewers from watching something else , like football were there no chase , stewart would have such a big lead over gordon that he could cruise to the title team sports also start from scratch when the playoffs begin , and upsets are always part of the postseason drama , no matter how well teams have done \( heads up , yankees \) but in team sports , regularseason excellence comes with a tangible bonus , namely homefield advantage , or , as in the case of the nfl , firstround byes i think we can do a better job of celebrating the regularseason champion , johnson , the threetime defending series champion , said thursday if we could show some kind of advantage to the points leader , i 'd be open to that for sure the 10 races in the chase , for all intents and purposes , look the same as the first 26 races of the season , with the 12 chase drivers running in the 43car pack if qualifying is held , the chase drivers are not even guaranteed to start at the front of the field the bonuses awarded for winning socalled regularseason races are negligible in nascar s playmoney points system none of the other 11 drivers in the chase trail martin by more than 40 points , which is the difference between finishing 5th and 16th in one race perhaps more important , the 12 chase drivers are not separated from the other 31 drivers in the field when points are awarded after each playoff race a winner of a sprint cup race , chaser or nonchaser , gets 185 points , plus a 5point bonus for leading a lap \( and , perhaps , another 5point bonus for leading the most laps \) the 43rdplace finisher gets 34 points so any chase driver who encounters mechanical trouble early in a race or is knocked out early by a collision , maybe with one of the 31 nonchase drivers can be eliminated from championship contention we all agree that it s very hard to gain points on somebody , but it s very easy to lose them , said juan pablo montoya , a chase firsttimer early in last year s first chase race , also at loudon , a sway bar broke on busch s car , and he finished 34th despite winning eight races in the regular season , more than any other driver , busch dropped to eighth place that day he had finished the 26race regular season 302 points ahead of johnson , who went on to win his third straight title there are no homefield advantages or byes in nascar s playoff system the regularseason champion does not receive a mulligan after a bad finish , or , as in stewart s case , even the lead since the points have been reset stewart says he is not devastated by losing his lead it is not as if nascar changed the rules in the middle of the season he will live with it as it is when asked if the 12 chase drivers should receive bonuses for winning chase races , stewart shook his head , smiled and said , you get to the point where you start confusing everybody
president hamid karzai s inauguration was a wellmanaged event the afghan presidential press handlers in their shiny tailored suits worked frantically to make sure that none of the local and foreign journalists and photographers got anywhere close to the president as he took the new oath of office after our equipment was sniffed by bombdetecting dogs and our bodies patted down by bombdetecting men for the third time , the press corps was allowed inside the palace grounds for about 30 minutes , able to get only a glimpse of mr karzai as he arrived and walked past a formation of wellgroomed presidential guards moments after the president s entrance we were ushered to the back of the palace hall where president karzai stood about 300 meters away on a dimly lit stage , swearing to serve afghanistan for the next four years this was not the inauguration of a popular president there were no cheering crowds and no parade only handpicked guests and foreign dignitaries attended , and an area of several kilometers around the perimeter of the presidential palace remained in lockdown well into the night
david waldstein , jack curry , tyler kepner and richard sandomir provided live updates during game 2 of the angelsyankees american league championship series no relief pitcher is safe when alex rodriguez comes to the plate this postseason , and because of that the yankees continue to perfect the art of the last atbat victory party in the bottom of the 11th inning , with the yankees trailing by a run , rodriguez hit a gametying home run off angels closer brian fuentes , just as he had off twins closer joe nathan in game 2 of the division series with that reprieve the yankees went on to win 43 on what else an error by the angles at 1 07 am sunday morning at the conclusion of another cold , blustery night , this one with the addition of some rain in the extra innings in the bottom of the 13th inning jerry hairston , jr reached on a single and was sacrificed to second robinson cano was walked intentionally and melky cabrera hit a ground ball to the left of maicer izturis izturis tried to get cano at second but his throw went wide of the bag and third baseman chone figgins could not pick it up before hairston scored the winning run 5 hours 10 minutes after the game started the yankees now lead the bestofseven series two games to none , and the percentages heavily favor them to go on and win the series , which now shifts to anaheim , where the teams will reengage monday at angel stadium for game 3 since 1985 , when the league championship series were extended to seven games , there have been 20 teams that have taken 20 leads , and 17 of them have gone on to win the pennant with two more victories the yankees will make their first appearance in the world series since 2003 with the score tied at 33 in the bottom of the 12th jorge posada , who did not start but played five innings , reached on a bloop single to right and derek jeter reached on a fielder s choice with two outs johnny damon singled to right , sending jeter scampering to third the angels then intentionally walked mark teixeira to load the bases and bring up rodriguez , who flied out to center to end the inning despite the loss the angels played far better saturday than they did in the first game of the series friday when they made four costly fielding mistakes but their return to form may be too late , now the starting pitchers , a j burnett for the yankees and joe saunders for the angels , battled effectively , allowing two runs apiece jeter homered in the third inning to give the yankees a 20 lead , but the angels scored twice in the fifth off burnett dw the new alex rodriguez is a clutch performer and a surpassingly dull interview maybe the two qualities go handinhand , but he has embraced the lessons of crash davisto postgame questions asked by fox s ken rosenthal , rodriguez revealed nothing his reaction to a fascinating game wow , what a great game it was exciting you re just fortunate to come out on top hitting the gametying home run off brian fuentes he made two tough pitches i m just trying to get on base the yankees at 20 over the angels in the alcs every game is important promo alert from joe buck came with this tiein to a chase card alex rodriguez made his mark and you can make your mark with ink rs robertson got guerrero to ground out to end the inning no surprise the angels fading cleanup hitter is 1 for 7 in the game and has stranded eight runners santana still on the mound for the angels he s set to face pinchhitter jerry hairston , jr , gardner and cano dw with two on and one out in the 13th hunter missed a good pitch to hit from robertson , primarily because he was trying to hit a threerun homer instead of a goahead single or double then again , who can blame him no lead is safe with the yankees hitters against the angels relievers \? dw rodriguez came to the plate with the bases loaded and a chance to win it , but popped out what a choker ! ! and if you believe that was written in seriousness , you either haven t been reading this blog , or haven t been watching this postseason anyway , rodriguez couldn t get the winning hit , but unless the yankees lose , he s still the star for his 11thinning gametying home run off fuentes in the bottom of the 12th the yankees had the bases loaded with two outs against ervin santana , but he got rodriguez to hit a towering fly ball to center with the wind and rain , which has died down a bit , it wasn t a gimme but hunter made the catch here in the 13th cano made an error on aybar s grounder , so the angels have a fast runner at first with no outs dw the yankees walked izturis to pitch to matthews , who had never faced robertson before , and robertson struck him out with the rain still falling we go to the bottom of the 12th the righthander ervin santana is on to face cabrera , posada and jeter something in the air says this is it for the angels dw which is the most annoying \? the phil jackson \( and friends \) tmobile ad , the chevy chase tmobile ad \( and snl cohorts \) or promos for george lopez s new talk show on tbs \? during the last two postseasons , tbs flooded us with frank caliendo promos now it s tmobile and lopez any other nominations \? rs damaso marte is in to face morales and izturis with one out in the 12th it s not raining lightly , by the way marte got his man in morales , so girardi is calling on the right hander dave robertson to face mathis dw serendipity struck for fox with rodriguez at bat in the 11th inning fox posted a graphic saying that half of his home runs and half of his runs batted in tied the game or put the yankees ahead during the regular season and on the third pitch from fuentes , rodriguez hit a home run over the right field wall to tie the game at 33 rs rodriguez lined an 02 pitch through the rain to right field that went over the glove of abeu , sending yankee stadium into a fit of celebration the fans are chanting arod , arod dw make that two home runs for rodriguez off fuentes a shot to right field that ties the game at 33 nyt they are grooming the mound and home plate area because of the rain then brian fuentes is coming in to face rodriguez , guzman and gardner rodriguez is 1 for 2 with a home run off him dw angels take the lead , 32 figgins , who didn t have a hit in the series , slapped a single to shallow left after falling behind by 02 against aceves and scored matthews from second base damon got the ball only about 180 feet from the plate , but he doesn t exactly have a cannon of an arm , and matthews slid in ahead of the throw and figgins went to second it all started when matthews drew the dreaded lead off walk off aceves dw shortly after secondbased umpire jerry layne refused to give aybar the neighborhood play in the 10th inning on a likely doubleplay grounder hit by posada , fox s tim mccarver said that aybar had not touched the bag on previous double plays during the game thus , mccarver was saying , aybar should not have been penalized , even though fox s cameras made it clear that aybar not only hadn t been in the neighborhood , he was in another city mccarver s suggestion had me close to shouting , show us the other double plays but moments later , mccarver heard from the production truck that aybar had , indeed , touched the bag on the three other double plays i was wrong , mccarver said a good recovery but i still wanted to see the other replays earlier , the word fisted , so much a favorite of tbs s chip caray , popped out of joe buck s mouth , on a pitch hit without event off a cutter from rivera of course , fisted is not a verboten word it s descriptive and correct , but caray overuses it buck jokingly apologized for using the word after mccarver said that it s so frequent an occurrence when batters swing at rivera s cutter rs figures , here comes the rain but it is assumed that they will play right through hurricane selig lots of empty seats and worse , aceves just gave up a lead off walk with aybar coming to the plate dw aybar did it again in game 1 he watched a ball drop , and just now in the bottom of the 10th he didn t touch second base with his feet on what should have been a double play but thanks to darren oliver s stern pitching , it didn t cost the angels cabrera led off with a bloop single to center and at first appeared to be wiped out on a double play ball off the bat off jorge posada but aybar , who allowed a popup to fall in game 1 , which cost the angels a run , didn t touch second base and cabrera was safe scioscia argued , but replays showed aybar wasn t even close enough to get the socalled neighborhood call anyway , jeter was walked intentionally and damon popped a foul ball into the glove of figgins for the second out oliver then got teixeira to hit a grounder to aybar , who scooped it up and tossed to izturis for the out alfredo aceves pitching in the top of the 11th dw the angels are brining in the lefty darren oliver to face the yankees in the bottom of the 10th he s looking at cabrera , posada and jeter dw tremendous job by kevin jepsen , a righty who faces three lefties in the bottom of the ninth and lived to get the game to the 10th and here s rivera , still pitching in the 10th reminds me of game 7 of the 2003 alcs , when joe torre let rivera work three innings until aaron boone s homer won the pennant tk what a great play by mathis to save the game for the angels with runners on second and third and two outs cano hit a little bouncer in front of the plate as pinchrunner freddy guzman came sprinting toward home from third mathis knew he had to make the play at first , or the yankees would win he jumped out , picked up the ball and fired to first in time to get cano , who slammed his helmet down in disgust dw yankees coming to bat in the ninth burnett is in the back with the whipped cream in the top of the ninth johnny damon made a very big play with a running , tumbling catch of figgins s flare to left not that abreu , who was 0 for 8 in the series , would have driven him home and sure enough , he struck out looking to go 0 for 9 but figgins could still have caused problems on the base paths with nobody out then again , with rivera pitching , he would have had to steal third and home to score rivera just struck out hunter looking he s only thrown 13 pitches , so there s no reason why he can t come out for more if there is more dw jorge posada is in the game he pinch hit for molina in the bottom of the eighth and grounded out to second pinch hitting cold off the bench in august is tough enough , but in this weather it s just not enviable , as matthews , jr will confirm posada is now behind the plate the righthander kevin jepsen relieved saunders in the eighth and retired the yankees in order saunders threw seven strong innings , allowing two runs and six hits and one walk , and he struck out six that s pretty much all scioscia could have asked for dw can the cold weather make the infield more unforgiving \? i m not smart enough to know how a ball hit in 67 degree weather would differ from a ball hit in 47 degree weather , but the infield sure seems to have become more challenging of the last four grounders that have been hit in this game , jeter had one hit off his glove for an error and izturis flubbed one before recovering to get the out at first izturis also backed up and looked uncomfortable as he snared one other grounder jc one pitch was all it took ! with two outs in the eighth and runners at first and second girardi called on mariano rivera in the tie game at home rivera doesn t get a save , but he saved jeter from a sticky situation because egads jeter made an error that prolonged the inning with a runner at first and one out izturis hit a roller to short , custom built for an inningending double play but jeter , who homered earlier in the game , bobbled the ball and the runners were safe hughes struck out gary contract matthews , jr , and rivera was brought int to face aybar with the goahead run in scoring position aybar hit the first pitch slowly on the ground to second base and cano made the play dw saunders is pitching a terrific game for the angels in the seventh he gave up a lead off single to swisher , but only faced the minimum , thanks to a double play off the bat of cano then saunders struck out cabrera and pumped his fist a couple of times before skipping off the mound brett gardner pinch ran for swisher so there are defensive changes gardner went into center field and cabrera moved to right phil hughes is pitching now dw if chamberlain continues to pitch well out of the bullpen like the old chamberlain of 2008 it s going to be pretty tough to send him back to the starting rotation next year as for guerrero , it was the second time he came up with the bases loaded and two outs , and the second time he didn t get the job done still , we re impressed that he didn t resort to gloves in the cold weather , even if he is from the dominican republic , where the weather is rarely anything but tropical and breezy dw hunter s infield single to short loaded the bases but chamberlain comes back to strike out guerrero , and the yankees escape a tough one there nyt coke strikes out abreu for the second out of the inning , but here comes joba chamberlain to face hunter with aybar on second and figgins on first nyt figgins still doesn t have a hit in the postseason , but he has been on base three straight times with two walks and a hit by pitch figgins hasn t scored a run yet in this game , but putting him on base is dangerous for the yankees sooner , not later , figgins is going to create some havoc and score jc joe girardi said the other day he liked the idea of using a lefthander for figgins and abreu backtoback figgins hit just 246 vs lefties this year , and of course , abreu bats lefthanded but walking figgins was not what girardi had in mind that s three times on base for figgins tonight tk cano s fielding error on aybar s grounder with one out brings an end to burnett s night the lefthander phil coke comes on in relief of burnett , who allowed three hits and two runs in six and a third innings burnett needed 114 pitches to get to this point , one more than sabathia needed to get through eight innings friday night coke promptly walked figgins , putting two on with one out and drawing a conference on the mound nyt yankees go pretty quietly against saunders in their half of the sixth teixeira reached on a throwing error by figgins , but rodriguez flied out to right before matsui hit into an inningending double play nyt good job by burnett in the sixth after a rough fifth in which the angels scored twice to tie the game , he bounced back for a 123 saunders is coming back out for the bottom of the sixth smart move , knowing the angels bullpen still no sign of rain , by the way \( hope that wasn t the alltime jinx if it wasn t , how about the announcement they just made in the press box about the yankees workout in anaheim on sunday afternoon \? \) dw scioscia has scrambled his relievers for action as saunders is in deep trouble with runners on first and second and nobody out , but saunders comes through the righthander jason bulger and the lefthander darren oliver are up in the pen as saunders gave up a leadoff walk and a single to molina after going ahead , 02 saunders then got jeter to hit into a 163 double play , but he kind of messed that up , too it looked like he could have easily gotten cabrera at third turns out not to matter as saunders strikes out damon for the third out and pumps his fist he comes through in a big moment bobby valentine used to say that whichever team executes better in situations with runners on first and second and nobody out , usually wins i once asked him why and his replay was , i don t know , it just seems that way , doesn t it \? dw angels tie it 22 on a wild pitch , but it could have been worse burnett got sloppy and wild , but he scrapped and prevented major trouble with one out he got abreu out on a 309foot foul ball to damon in left \( 310 1 2 would have been over the wall , although still foul \) with one out and runners at first and second , scioscia sent the runners \( aybar and figgins \) four consecutive times on the hitandrun play burnett kept his focus and didn t give abreu a good pitch to hit the runners look tired , but maybe also a little bit warmer with hunter at the plate , the crowd rose to its feet as burnett threw a strike on 12 molina went to the mound to talk over the next pitch ball three , and then burnett walked hunter to load the bases with guerrero coming up the key here was to let guerrero get himself out by swinging at pitches out of the zone the 12 should not have been anywhere near the strike zone , and it wasn t in fact , it bounced about four feet in front of the plate and got away from molina as aybar scored still , burnett got guerrero to ground out to short new game dw the angels are finally putting hits together , and it results in their first run of the game yankees still lead , 21 , but the angels are threatening here in the fifth the key was that they finally got a leadoff batter on base as izturis ripped a groundrule double to right before that the angels hitters leading were 0 for 12 in leading off innings napoli flied out , but aybar slapped a high fastball up the middle past burnett for a runscoring single oh , and now the angels also have their first stolen base of the series as aybar grabbed second burnett hit figgins with a pitch , so now it s first and second with one out , which calls for a meeting on the mound dw the angels just can t get a call at first base in their favor in game 1 hunter was called out by laz diaz on a close play that drew arguments from scioscia , and just now hunter failed to get the call from bill miller on another nice play by teixeira , who deserves a lot of credit he s catching everything thrown his way while anchoring his foot to the bag not to pick on anyone , but if jason giambi were playing first base tonight , the angels would be leading by three runs the yankees also got guerrero on a close play at first later in the fourth inning guerrero struck out but molina dropped the ball molina recovered and made a strong throw to teixeira , who positioned himself perfectly in foul territory with guerrero bearing down on him guerrero may have been safe , but it seems the yankees are getting all the calls at first in this series scioscia just looked on in frustration from the dugout he might have been too cold to come out and argue dw before every game , rodriguez walks on to an empty field and gobbles up dozens of grounders mick kelleher , the firstbase coach , hits rodriguez grounder after grounder when the fielding drills are almost finished , kelleher puts his bat down and rolls balls toward rodriguez so he can charge in and field slow rollers one of those slow rollers was exactly the type of play that rodriguez made on a ball hit by hunter to begin the fourth guess the practice worked by the way , teixeira saved rodriguez by scooping a low throw kelleher has told rodriguez to throw toward the outside of the bag , which makes it easier for the first baseman to make a play jc home run jeter ! and , yankees lead 20 in the third that was savvy hitting he got ahead 20 and knew saunders would come in with a strike problem for the lefthander saunders was that the ball was up and jeter got the barrel of the bat on it and lifted it to right field it was his 19th career postseason home run , sending him past reggie jackson and mickey mantle for third alltime on baseball s postseason home run list of course , all of mantle s came in the world series manny ramirez has 29 and bernie williams 22 it was jeter s sixth alcs homer dw figgins walked with two outs in the third it was only his second walk of the postseason figgins has no hits in 17 atbats , so his inability to get on base could become a problem for the angels obviously , it wasn t in the threegame sweep of the red sox , but figgins doesn t have any stolen bases in the postseason , either you can t steal first base , as they say abreu then flied out to center to end the socalled threat , and the angels still can t put together a series of hits against burnett as for the sleeve report , napoli has the midjuly short sleeves as well must be a battery thing dw cano was 2 for 15 in the postseason coming into that atbat oh , those twoout walks sure can hurt and for those who mocked cano s coldweather hood under his hat as a sign of weakness in the face of chilly conditions , it appears to be working for him yankees lead , 10 , and the angels don t look comfortable against burnett dw saunders has to be furious at himself right now two outs , nobody on , ahead on swisher with a strike , and he throws four balls up 02 on cano , and he can t put him away with a slider , which goes to the wall for an rbi triple yankees trailed in all three games vs twins , but they never trailed in game 1 vs angels and now they re up by 10 in game 2 tk something to keep in mind about pitching in the cold as long as they can grip their breaking pitches , which can be troublesome in bitter cold , most pitchers don t mind it i remember david wells , who grew up in san diego and lives in florida , used to love pitching in the cold pitchers are moving around more than anyone else on the field , so their bodies are warm it s oppressive heat that can sap their energy and saunders has experience with chilly temperatures here s what he said in the interview room friday i grew up in washington dc , i pitched at virginia tech for a long time the cold weather , i m used to it the cold weather is not going to affect me and the rain certainly , i dealt with a lot of that in my career for me it s just another bad day , but a great day to play baseball so i m going to go out there and pitch my game the elements probably won t faze me at all tk jeter was firstpitch swinging , but grounded out to third base for the first yankees out of the game saunders , like the angels game 1 starter john lackey on friday night , is out there in short sleeves like an offensive lineman in green bay in december we asked lackey friday night if the angels pitchers coordinated it , but he just laughed it off no , i just didn t think it was that cold , he said we re not so sure johnny damon just hit a high fly ball to the track in right field , but bobby abreu caught it at the wall dw after figgins struck out against burnett in the first inning , he is now 0 for 17 in the 2009 postseason while figgins is one of the angels who helps make them a pesky , resilient team , he usually disappears in october figgins is 18 for 104 \( 173 average in the postseason \) scioscia said , it just takes that one hit , that one bloop , that good at bat to get him on board the angels better hope that hit , bloop or at bat arrives soon for figgins jc tino martinez threw out the first pitch the stadium is completely amped up , and burnett throws the first pitch to chone figgins at 7 57 on the dot for a called strike the game time temperature is 47 degrees , and the fans in the rightfield bleachers are in full voice loud and clearly enunciating figgins has gone down on strikes , and there s one out the angels have virtually every player up against the fence on the top step of the dugout burnett then retired abreu on a fly ball to which the fox announcers pointed out makes abreu and figgins a combined 0 for 10 in this series after giving up a double to hunter , burnett gets guerrero to ground out to end the inning preview the players have taken batting practice , the grounds crew is painting the lines and smoothing out the infield , and in less than half an hour we are expected to have playoff baseball once again , the weather is chilly and raw , but there is no rain it will be aj burnett on the mound looking to follow cc sabathia s example and give the yankees a twogamestonone lead for the angels , the lefthander joe saunders will be on the mound but the angels know they have to play far better defensively than they did in game 1 , when they made three errors and a costly fielding mistake that helped the yankees to a 41 victory that is not the way the angels play most of the time , so they are hoping it was merely an aberration i expect us to play a lot better , angels manager mike scioscia said before the game i do , and i think we will tonight maybe there were some jitters maybe it was just getting used to the environment i don t know , but i expect us to play a lot better baseball , and we ll have to here are the lineups for game 2 angels 1 chone figgins , 3b 2 bobby abreu , rf 3 torii hunter ,

s visit with members of the ' front office at citi field on wednesday included a tour , lunch and a few hours of discussions about his coveted freeagent starters , derek lowe and oliver p rez as expected , it did not produce any contract agreements , but the mets remained confident they will eventually reach one lowe continues to be the mets' top choice , but the team is reluctant to sweeten the threeyear , 36 million proposal it offered last week that bid was rejected , and boras apparently believes lowe could command a better contract elsewhere teams that have been linked to lowe include the boston red sox , the milwaukee brewers and the atlanta braves , though none of them seems interested in matching the mets' offer in the end , should the mets offer another 1 million annually and or a fourthyear vesting option , boras and lowe may find that suitable the mets rank p rez second , believing lowe to be more durable and apt to stay consistent , but would not be disappointed if they resigned him at a lower price than lowe the mets are also interested in another of boras s clients , the utility infielder lex cora boras and his longtime associate , mike fiore , arrived after noon and met with a threeman mets contingent jeff wilpon , the chief operating officer , general manager omar minaya and his assistant , john ricco jason giambi and the oakland athletics completed a oneyear , 525 million contract with an option , bringing giambi back to where he began his bigleague career the sides reached a preliminary agreement this week , but giambi , a freeagent designated hitter and first baseman , still needed a physical to complete the deal giambi , who turns 38 on thursday , left the a s after the 2001 season , signing a sevenyear , 120 million contract with the yankees he was slowed by injuries and investigations into performanceenhancing drugs with oakland , giambi gets a 4 million salary this season and the a s hold a 65 million option for 2010 with a 125 million buyout the former pirates managing general partner kevin mcclatchy has sold his remaining shares in the team , ending a 13year relationship that began with his probably keeping the club from relocating mcclatchy assembled the shareholders and cash to buy the pirates in 1996 , after local ownership could not be found and it appeared the moneylosing team might leave pittsburgh
tampa , fla before helped his temporary team defeat his regular team tuesday , he discussed his diplomatic duties as the captain of the united states team for the world baseball classic jeter s locker in the american team s clubhouse is between those of jimmy rollins and david wright in that rollins plays shortstop for the world series champion philadelphia phillies and wright is the third baseman for their bitter rivals , the mets , jeter joked about arbitrating between the two stars whose national league east teams sometimes trade trash talk if they want to get at each other , they have to come through me , jeter , the shortstop and captain of the , said , before his two hits and two runs batted in helped the american team to a 65 exhibition victory over the yankees at steinbrenner field wright and jeter each played nine innings wright spoke afterward about jeter s role as arbitrator as the united states prepared for its opener on saturday against canada in toronto we signed the treaty , the threeweek treaty , wright said , referring to himself and rollins we promised not to talk about who s the team to beat once those three weeks are up , we 'll be back to , i'm sure , the same old rivalry there was plenty of lighthearted banter about such things , but also an undercurrent of seriousness , for this is a team of rivals about to enter a highprofile competition as preseason allies the right side of the infield for the united states on tuesday included second baseman dustin pedroia and first baseman kevin youkilis , both of the boston red sox , the yankees' historic foes in the american league east on one level , there was some curiosity to tuesday s game it was the first time jeter played in a different uniform against the yankees , the only team he has played for in his 14 previous major league seasons but it also was a rehearsal for an american team with something to prove in the first world baseball classic , three years ago , the united states went 33 and was eliminated in the second round before japan beat cuba for the championship although not every top american player is on this year s team , it is a talented group the leadership role clearly falls to jeter , who , at age 34 , has evolved into an elder statesman among his peers both pedroia and wright spoke tuesday of how they wanted to pick jeter s brain this month pedroia seemed a bit awestruck between innings , they were showing his highlights and he s right next to me , pedroia said it s a little different in that jeter has four world series rings and wright none , wright said he wanted to learn from a crosstown rival with new york savvy as a young player in new york , you try to emulate certain guys , wright said i'm excited to have a locker next to him and play next to him obviously , he s a class act i'm interested to get in his head a little bit this is a huge learning experience in jeter s first atbat tuesday he hit second behind pedroia he grounded into a double play against yankees starter phil hughes in his second atbat , he grounded a 21 pitch up the middle for a tworun single off hughes that went past the outstretched glove of ngel berroa , playing in place of jeter it gave the united states a lead it never relinquished later , some fans booed youkilis for dropping jeter s bounced throw after jeter did a pirouette after fielding a ground ball by cody ransom he said he just gave the fans another reason to hate him , jeter said you ca n't tell if they 're booing or saying youk ! ' hughes , whose first pitch to jeter was an inside fastball , said , it got away from me and ran in on him , not intentional by any means then hughes joked that if jeter has something to say , he can approach me like a man down the hall , jeter joked that he promised hughes he would hit into a double play to help him end his day quickly got to take care of the pitchers , jeter said of hughes , who will be his teammate again soon such conflicted loyalties get complicated in international play roy oswalt of houston , the starting pitcher tuesday for team usa , said some national teams can have too many superstars , but that this clubhouse atmosphere is awesome , everyone s clicking but when someone asked oswalt which teammates he hoped to become friendly with , he replied i stay away from the hitters as much as possible i do n't want to get to know them too well he will have to get them out again in april bob watson , the general manager of team usa , said the responsibility for balancing the egos of stars like jeter and rollins , both shortstops , would fall to manager davey johnson that s what he s paid all the big bucks for , watson said i wanted to just assemble the talent these guys said they want to play and they did n't care how it worked out , who started , who backed up and davey said he can handle it jeter , who can sense the fish hook in any piece of journalistic bait , flashed a wideeyed smile when asked about how he and rollins might share the role he advised the questioner to talk to davey and also asked , what did he tell you \? some fans regard rollins as the better player and could clamor for him if jeter slumps jeter seemed unconcerned we 'll both get atbats , the captain said , diplomatically
last week , as the unemployment rate hit a 25year high and nearly one in 10 americans was receiving food stamps , 10 democrats in the senate joined all 41 republican senators to cut estate taxes for the wealthiest families the provision would funnel an additional 91 billion over 10 years to the heirs of megafortunes , money that would otherwise have been paid in federal taxes or donated to charity with economic pain and suffering on the rise , how do the senators justify a big tax cut for multimillionaires \? by asserting that an estate tax cut is just what struggling americans need senator blanche lincoln , a democrat of arkansas , cosponsored the measure with senator jon kyl , a republican of arizona she said it was critical to creating jobs through small businesses with all the money we 've spent to help the economy , very little of it has filtered down to main street and familyowned businesses , she said the implication is that upon the death of an owner , estate taxes typically devastate small businesses and the jobs they provide that is swill under today s estate tax , which is retained in both the house version of the budget and in president obama s version , 998 percent of estates will never owe any estate tax that s because the tax applies only to estates that exceed 7 million per couple or 35 million for individuals , and a vast majority of american families are not and never will be that wealthy of the tiny number of estates that are taxable , almost none are small businesses a new analysis by the tax policy center found that under 2009 law , only 100 small businesses and family farms would owe any estate tax in 2011 and almost all such estates are able to pay the tax bill without having to sell business assets , according to a report by the congressional budget office the lincolnkyl tax cut would raise the estatetax exemption to 10 million per couple \( 5 million for singles \) and , in an even bigger giveaway to the superrich , lower the top rate from 45 percent to 35 percent that sure would enrich the heirs of america s biggest fortunes it would not jumpstart job creation on main street in addition to ms lincoln , other democratic senators voting for the estate tax cut were max baucus and jon tester of montana , evan bayh of indiana , maria cantwell and patty murray of washington , mary landrieu of louisiana , ben nelson of nebraska , bill nelson of florida and mark pryor of arkansas
i m always mystified that more people don t know about times reader , which is by far the best way to read the new york times on line i still prefer the physical newspaper to the cyber version , but if i m on the road and can t get the newspaper then i live by times reader it s a 10minute download of the entire paper , and then it sits on your laptop and you can read it on a plane or in a car there s none of that infuriating waiting for a page to open , and you can read the paper systematically from beginning to end but almost nobody seems to know about it i meet lots of people around the world who read the times regularly through the website but don t know about times reader , which is an incomparably better way of reading the paper there is a charge if you re not a hard copy subscriber , but it s pretty modest so i was pleased to see jack schafer of slate also weigh in on times reader it turns out he s a huge fan , too he discussed it in the context of a larger issue the dialogue that david carr started about whether newspapers can develop a business model a bit like the one that apple helped music companies develop and that s a huge and important issue but what he said about times reader reminded me that i had intended to evangelize about it and had never gotten around to it here s what shafer wrote in building the times reader , its makers thought outside the browser to create a platform that is 150 million times more readable than the standard web page and 450 million times more attractive than a kindle page a times reader edition downloads in a couple of minutes and can be read offline i d go on with my praise , but my review adequately explains why you should try the times reader you won t be disappointed \( the times reader goes for 1495 a month times subscribers get the service for free \) shafer also raved about times reader back in 2006 anybody out there reading this on times reader \? don t you find it infinitely better than the website \? is that our future \?
with just a month to go before the first regularseason game at citi field , the are doing all they can to sign up seasonticket holders , including  thus far , a healthy number of fans seem willing to visit the unfinished park to look at seats it is unclear , though , how many of them are committing to ticket plans , particularly in the most expensive sections on wednesday afternoon , tours were running a halfhour late because the team did not have enough hard hats for visitors to wear about two dozen fans , some wearing team jerseys and hats , were left to mill around a thirdfloor lobby groups of about six customers were eventually led to the caesars club the room was set up for a presentation to bartenders and foodservice workers who were going to see a slide show that included one slide on the benefits of serving food fast ticket agents were friendly , but not pushy they took fans to whatever sections they wanted to see and did not ask for any commitments at the end of the tour one guide was reluctant to say how much a luxury suite cost on a pergame basis a reporter on one tour saw many groups visiting the upper deck , and a few in the middle decks and outfield sections , but none in the more expensive lower bowl the search for cheaper seats is consistent with the sale of singlegame tickets on for games in april and may for games against the nationals in april , there are plenty of fieldlevel seats for 180 and a sprinkling of upperdeck outfield seats for 15 , but fewer in between we 've been saying that price is certainly an issue , and our customers are shopping price , and that is attributable to the economy , said dave howard , the team s executive vice president for business operations the mets are not alone in trying to find buyers for their expensive seats the yankees hired a division of a manhattan residential real estate brokerage , prudential douglas elliman , at the new yankee stadium those seats cost 350 to 2 , 500 a game the mets sold out their two exhibition games with the boston red sox in less than an hour another baseball game between st john s and georgetown , with tickets at 5 each , sold out as quickly the mets have sold the equivalent of nearly 25 , 000 full seasonticket packages and another 500 , 000 tickets in partial packages , about 70 percent of available seats the saturday and weekday 15game packages are sold out , and the sunday packages are nearly gone seats in the sterling level and field level run as high as 18 , 325 each for a season ticket the cheapest season tickets on the field level are 4 , 080 the excelsior level one deck above starts at 3 , 264 a seat and runs as high as 14 , 275 a seat in the lobby , the former mets first baseman was seen talking with a receptionist asked if he expected his number to be retired some day , he said with a chuckle that because it was not retired at , where he played from 1964 until 1979 , there was no reason to expect it would happen in the mets' new home
the obama administration announced on tuesday its decision to transfer terrorism suspects held at guant namo bay to an empty state prison in illinois the move would help fulfill president obama s campaign promise to close the guant namo detention center , which has drawn international criticism since it received its first prisoners nearly eight years ago the decision is also welcomed by some illinois leaders as an economic boon for a jobchallenged part of that state what does this move accomplish \? will a change of venue cure the legal issues surrounding detentions at guant namo \? or is this a symbolic gesture that will make no difference politically or legally in resolving the fate of the detainees \? is a professor at georgetown university law center , and the author , most recently , of the torture memos rationalizing the unthinkable president obama s decision to close guantanamo and move its remaining detainees to a federal prison in illinois is a welcome and important step in rejecting the central symbol of the bush administration s overt contempt for the rule of law guant namo need not have become a recruiting tool for al qaeda , had the bush administration not sought to exploit it as a lawfree zone where it could hold people without hearings , subject them to torture and other abusive treatment but thanks to these policies , guant namo will forever be tainted in the eyes of the world , and every day it remains open we give al qaeda a propaganda gift it is high time that it be closed but while symbols matter , so does substance closing guant namo will be dismissed as merely symbolic if it s not accompanied by substantive reform of our detention policies as well the obama administration has still not made clear the terms under which it intends to hold prisoners there it need not try or release everyone there , as some have argued the law of war permits military detention of those fighting against us in an ongoing armed conflict , and our involvement in afghanistan certainly qualifies read more but the definition of who we may detain must be narrowly tied to that ongoing conflict we must provide fair hearings and afford detainees a meaningful opportunity to defend themselves the burden of proof for detention should be stringent , and should rise as the detention gets more prolonged and we must treat the detainees humanely the latter condition may be the most difficult politically for the obama administration to satisfy the american public is likely to accept the detention of alleged al qaeda fighters on home soil only under the strictest supermaximum security conditions , which in our system amounts in effect to solitary confinement , 23 hours a day in a single cell whether such conditions are humane for convicted killers who have proven themselves unwilling to live in a prison s general population , they are certainly not humane for persons being detained preventively , who have never been convicted of any crime thus , president obama will be faced with a choice to honor our obligations under international law and demonstrate leadership by explaining those obligations to the american people , or to bend to domestic political pressure and violate international law only time will tell , a former federal prosecutor and author of willful blindness memoir of the jihad , is legal affairs editor at national review the obama administration s decision to transfer detainees into the us accomplishes three things , none of them good first , it shows our enemies that our government is not serious about the war a principal argument offered in favor of the move is a halfbaked economic one that it will spur development in a rural illinois town there are better ways to stimulate the economy than for uncle sam to buy thomson s white elephant penitentiary while shuttering a secure detention center that has cost taxpayers tens of millions but the fact that we are thinking about jihadism as a shovelready jobs program rather than a nationalsecurity challenge speaks volumes also conveying a lack of seriousness is the fact that 17 years into radical islam s war against us , we still don t understand our enemies the absurd claim that the existence of the guantanamo detention center causes terrorism shows our enemies their propaganda works we don t recognize the difference between a cause and a pretext read more terrorists will use anything pretextually gitmo , israel , abu ghraib , etc but the drivers of terrorist recruitment and attacks are islamist ideology , american weakness , and the sense that the terrorists can win jihadists attacked us before there ever was a gitmo or a george bush and it makes no difference to their perception of us that we detain them in federal prisons after civilian trials rather than in military brigs under the laws of war finally , tuesday s decision brings closer the day that federal courts will begin releasing trained terrorists to live , and plot , among us most \( though not all \) judges have been reluctant to issue such orders because the terrorists have been outside the us and their admission is barred by statute once they are physically here , that reluctance will vanish is the director of the jesse m unruh institute of politics at the university of southern california he was the communications director for john mccain s 2000 presidential campaign on the question of closing the prison at guant namo bay , candidate barack obama and his advisers may have been lulled into a false sense of security during last year s presidential campaign because john mccain , their republican opponent , had also called for the military detention facility there to be closed , it became easy for them to assume that most americans would be willing to accept the transfer of terrorism suspects from gitmo to a maximum security prison somewhere on the us mainland buoyed by the overwhelming tide of public and world opinion against the bush administration s use of the controversial interrogation techniques employed there , mr obama s campaign team clearly underestimated the level of opposition they would face when the newly inaugurated president vowed to close the prison within a year but the promise was made , and now they re stuck the administration has already delayed the closure of guant namo once other nations have been predictably reluctant to take on large numbers of these prisoners and congress has voted in overwhelming and bipartisan numbers to prevent the transfer of detainees into this country read more the willingness of the president s home state of illinois to take on this responsibility allows president obama to escape this mess without too much damage but this isn t a political win for the white house by any stretch of the administration , just less of a hit than it would have taken had it been forced to deal with a community rallying against the placement of potential terrorists in their midst the shortterm political fallout for president obama himself is minimal he has probably handed his old senate seat over to republicans , who will benefit from leading the criticism against the decision because the correctional facility is located only a short distance from the iowa border , that state s embattled democratic governor is probably finished as well but for the president himself , the only significant political risk is if either a prisoner escapes or some other type of terrorist activity occurs in the area if that happens , the national security credentials that democrats have gradually built over the last several years will disappear faster than you can say willie horton is a law professor at university of california , davis the obama administration letter announcing the plan to move guant namo detainees to a tiny illinois town leaves much unanswered how long will it take , one might ask , to acquire the state prison in thomson and retrofit it to federal supermax standards \? the process likely will extend months , perhaps years , past the january 22 , 2010 , deadline the president set the day after his inauguration after the limited number of detainees described in the letter arrives at thomson , how many will remain at the us naval base in cuba \? at times the letter speaks more of an urgent need to house federal convicts than it does of the president s order to close the place where hundreds have been in military custody for years this surprising emphasis begs the question of just how much the thompson plan advances the goal of ending detention at guant namo read more and for how long will the government maintain a regime at gitmo , thomson , or elsewhere under which suspected terrorists are detained without charge \? legal norms cited to justify such an extraordinary measure typically require an expiration date , a promise that as soon as possible the government will make a full return to its rightsbased legal tradition the answer to this last question will reveal the degree to which the thomson move puts an end not only to the cuba camp , but also to the policy that bears the name guant namo , a law professor at washington college of law , american university , is a research fellow of the hoover institution the decision to send about 100 of guantanamo s remaining detainees to a prison in illinois seems to me not so much wrong as just hopelessly muddled if it is intended to send a signal to the world and to president obama s supporters that he was going to keep his promise to close guantanamo and do something different , well , this isn t something different and nobody seriously sees it as that whatever the symbolism is supposed to be on a new policy , exchanging guantanamo for illinois means little the only people likely to take a signal are enemies of the united states , who will correctly see this as another sign of american vacillation and weakness , and plan accordingly indeed , it is likely that many of these detainees would and will far prefer their lives in cuba than in illinois , particularly if the location is irrelevant to the legal terms of trial , if there is to be one so perhaps the move is intended to send another kind of signal to americans there will be no more coddling of detainees in cuba and they will do hard solitary time in illinois read more but given that they have been convicted of no crime , hard time for its own sake is hard to justify , even by my own conservative national security standards yet what is justified is holding them in detention in any case , americans have already given clear signals to the administration and congress that they think these detainees should remain outside the territorial united states politicians in illinois or the administration might think creating a few hundred jobs is a compelling reason to bring the detainees to the mainland , but the rest of america scarcely thinks that the muddled signals sent by this move could , however , cause real damage through the federal courts any court will certainly be considering the significance of the move if it is supposed to be more than symbolic , a court might ask , what else could it mean than to extend to the detainees rights that go along with physical presence in the territory of the united states \? it seems to me inevitable that the courts will see it that way and perhaps that is the ultimate intention of the administration in that case , the move , symbolic or not , will show that the obama administration did not step up to the challenge of guantanamo and the serious tradeoffs involved in national security versus rights and it will not have reversed course on the bush administration s fatal tendency to do things by executive discretion , without seeking appropriate legislation from congress instead , the transfers will merely show that the obama administration tried to make a public relations gesture with various constituencies and when that failed , decided to split as many differences as possible , producing as many muddles as possible , and then kick the can down the road for the courts to decide as a matter of either symbols or substance , that s not leadership
detroit justin verlander bounded down the clubhouse steps toward the ' dugout late tuesday afternoon , clutching a toy befitting a motor city icon a deluxe remotecontrolled monster truck , purchased just that morning it zoomed around the comerica park outfield , dodging teammates and groundskeepers before slowing by the leftfield line come on , man , his teammate clete thomas yelled hammer it shooting him a look , verlander flipped a switch , and the truck rocketed along the grass , almost out of sight know this about verlander , the tigers' ace no one responds to a challenge quite the way he does , especially when it comes to matters of speed he throws harder than any other starter in the american league he works so quickly that hitters have barely finished wondering where that pitch went before he is ready to fire another one my parents used to get mad at me and said i was in a race to eat my food , verlander said everything i 've ever done , i 've done it quickly he leads the al in strikeouts with 239 , in pitches per start and in compliments awarded by boyhood idols enshrined in cooperstown the rangers' president , , watched verlander dismantle texas in a on july 29 this still holds true today it was the best stuff i 've seen all year , ryan said in a telephone interview just overpowering like ryan , verlander throws a scorching fastball , complemented by a tantalizing curve and a changeup deployed anytime in the count he also shares ryan s sense of duty to last deep into games and his distaste for pitch counts , qualities this season that have helped him outduel cliff lee \( twice \) , john danks , yovani gallardo , scott feldman , clay buchholz and c c sabathia that last one sabathia is particularly relevant because the tigers , as long as they withstand a late charge from the twins in the al central , would most likely face the yankees in an openinground playoff series the yankees , presuming they finish with the best record in the al , can opt for a division series schedule featuring an extra day off , allowing them to use only three fully rested starters sabathia would be in line to pitch in games 1 and 4 , but , then again , so would verlander in two starts against the yankees this season both opposite sabathia verlander has held them to two runs in 14 innings in his verlander did not allow any of the yankees' seven lefthanded hitters to pull a fly ball until the sixth inning he knows that our season revolves around how well he pitches , reliever bobby seay said he s taken that to heart every time out verlander politely disagrees , saying that he tries to pitch the same way every start that is to say , relentlessly relievers like the dodgers' jonathan broxton , the rangers' neftali feliz and the marlins' matt lindstrom routinely throw in the upper 90s but they pitch one , at most two , innings each outing rare is the starter who can pitch that fast , that late and with such precision verlander s average fastball velocity , 955 miles per hour , is the second fastest among starters , behind only colorado s ubaldo jimenez \( 960 \) , according to but verlander has thrown the fastest pitch recorded by a starter this season , a that struck out baltimore s nick markakis on may 30 it s like he was put on this planet to throw gas , reliever zach miner said verlander has always thrown hard as a high school freshman in goochland , va , he threw in the low 80s by graduation , he topped out at 93 but an illness during his senior year weakened him , scaring away some scouts , and verlander , undrafted , pitched for old dominion , shining in three seasons before being selected no 2 over all in the 2004 draft he credits jon matlack , the tigers' roving minor league pitching instructor , with honing his mechanics into the fluid delivery that allows him to reach triple digits at will you look at him , and it does n't jump out like it would with clemens or someone who s really built , said the bullpen coach jeff jones , referring to roger clemens but justin has very , very strong legs he has huge quads , and he trains like a madman that strength helped verlander , who carries 225 pounds on a 6foot5 frame , withstand a tremendous swell in his workload during , when he pitched 207 2 3 innings including the postseason up 77 2 3 innings from 2005 such a dramatic increase often makes a young pitcher susceptible to injury or a dropoff in performance the next year , but verlander went 186 in 2007 with a 366 earned run average he struggled in 2008 , his walk rate soaring and strikeouts plunging as he went 1117 with a 484 era , though he said his problems were more mechanical and mental verlander \( 168 , 334 era this season \) is an exception to the rule becoming commonplace around baseball that organizations typically try to limit young pitchers' annual increase to 30 or so innings considerable attention surrounds the case of joba chamberlain , whose innings have been strictly monitored by the yankees to keep him fresh for the playoffs and years to come shoulderstrengthening exercises aided verlander , as did a chat after the 2006 season with chuck hernandez , his pitching coach at the time he showed verlander pitchers who logged even more innings at young ages but remained mostly durable ryan and bert blyleven were among them i said you know what \? these guys did it why ca n't i do it \? ' verlander said it helped me go out there and just pitch he takes great pride in his stamina , averaging a majorleaguehigh 1108 pitches per start while throwing 115 or more in 15 of his 31 starts when he feels his pitch count rising , he said , he pitches more to contact to conserve energy teammates , coaches and opponents marvel at his ability to maintain velocity cruising speed , as he called it and yet throw even harder in tight situations after pitching a nohitter in 2007 , verlander told reporters about all the attention he had received from fans and from a drug tester i guess that happens when you throw 100something in the ninth inning , he said at one point on monday night against toronto , verlander struck out edwin encarnacion on a 99mph fastball , froze jose bautista on an 81mph curve \( set up by three 99s \) and retired kyle phillips in an eightpitch atbat with seven fastballs , none slower than 99 the scoreboard read , justincredible more incredible , miner said , was at fenway park the red sox had thrashed the tigers in the first three games , and in the series finale verlander came out to pitch the eighth inning protecting a 20 lead he threw 18 straight fastballs the final batter , jason bay , swung through two 100mph fastballs to end the inning those were verlander s 122nd and 123rd pitches we got a guy , daniel bard , who can do that , but he does it for an inning , bay said for a guy to do it for that long , i do n't think there s anyone else in the league that can do that that s what makes him so special in the team photograph taken tuesday , verlander was placed directly in the center at 26 , in addition to the nohitter , he has already made the allstar team twice and started two world series games , in 2006 weary from a long season , verlander lost both those games , and he relishes another chance as he spoke , a few teammates were preparing a makeshift ramp to test the truck s suspension verlander grabbed the remote as jeremy bonderman , sitting nearby , asked him how fast it could go fast , verlander said very fast just like its owner
while there s been some support on capitol hill for the idea of creating an independent , bipartisan commission to figure out what to do about the nation s growing debt , don t look for senator max baucus to sign on the montana democrat and chairman of the senate finance committee took the senate floor thursday morning to assail the notion of handing over the responsibility to an outside panel made up of lawmakers and administration officials congress would then be allowed an upordown vote on any recommendations after the 2010 elections if congress is going to outsource its core fiscal responsibilities , why stop with just those responsibilities \? mr baucus asked why not cede to this commission all the legislation in the next congress \? why don t we outsource the entire year s work and then adjourn for the year \? mr baucus has special reason to dislike the idea in effect that kind of commission might usurp much of the power of mr baucus s very powerful committee , which is currently responsible for many of the tax and spending issues that the commission would be examining eager to prevent that from happening , mr baucus on thursday aimed the big political guns at the commission , which was proposed earlier this week by senator kent conrad , the north dakota democrat who chairs the budget committee , and senator judd gregg of new hampshire , its senior republican it is clear from their press release that senators conrad and gregg have painted a big red target on social security and medicare , mr baucus warned that s what this commission is all about it s a big roll of the dice for social security and medicare the authors of the commission plan , which is also being resisted by the obama administration and speaker nancy pelosi , say it is needed because congress has proven unable or unwilling to make the very hard decisions needed to reduce the deficit under the commission approach , both parties would share responsibility equally mr baucus was having none of it i can see that a commission may be attractive to some , he said it is an easy way out
marcus brown had played 27 games over two seasons in the and moved on to european leagues when , in 2004 , he received a multimilliondollar contract from cska moscow that made him one of the highestpaid american players in europe now playing in lithuania , brown would like some form of a retirement plan to show for his 13year basketball career it justifies that i worked hard to get where i'm at , he said as basketball becomes increasingly global , teams throughout the world are competing against the nba for top players many european teams pay most , if not all , of the salaries for their american players up front , and often pay their local taxes but many european teams do not provide a pension brown is not alone among american basketball players abroad with scant nba experience who realize , perhaps too late , the benefits of a pension system there is nothing like what the nba provides to whoever qualifies for the minimum pension , said maurizio gherardini , assistant general manager for the toronto raptors and former general manager for the italian team treviso leagues in spain , italy and france offer versions of pensions to their players , according to nar zanolin , the secretary general of european basketball s governing body but zanolin noted that enforcing a standard pension policy throughout the organization s 51 member countries was a complicated endeavor every country runs its own system , has its own laws , and they vary from progressive to regressive , zanolin said in a telephone interview from his office in munich the nba s pension program is seen as one of the most reliable in professional sports a player qualifies or becomes vested for his pension after three seasons , when he is on a team s active roster for at least 50 percent of the season s games or is on the roster by feb 2 of that season , according to tim frank , a league spokesman players with 11 or more years of service retiring at age 62 would receive the federally mandated maximum annual benefit , 195 , 000 like brown , alex acker spent two seasons in the nba before finding more playing time and a higher salary in europe now living in milan and playing for milano in italy s lega basket serie a , acker wants to return to the nba to qualify for his league pension to play in the league for three years and the organization will provide you with a check for the rest of your life , acker , 26 , said in an email message that is a good plan in my eyes if acker is vested for the threeyear minimum and retires at 62 , he would receive an annual benefit of 56 , 988 j r bremer has been playing in europe since being waived by the charlotte bobcats in 2005 he received more than 1 million in net salary from triumph lyubertsy in russia in 2008 he would stand to make the nba minimum for twoyear players 825 , 497 before taxes if he finds his way back into the league this season i just need a year to get my pension , but at the same time , i ca n't pass up great money here to get less money later on down the road , bremer said in addition to the pension , nba players are provided with a program , with teams matching player contributions by 140 percent , as of the 20001 season , frank said players accustomed to the guaranteed medical and retirement benefits of the nba often find europe to be lacking , said ketih kreiter , an agent who is founder and chief executive of edge sports international we have recommended to kids many times before they go over , not only do you have to worry about your pension , you have to worry about your health insurance , your tax planning , said kreiter , who estimated that 70 percent of americans playing abroad were not properly filing their taxes no one is going to step up in europe to help you gherardini said he believed that the absence of a pension should not prevent an american player from independently planning his retirement there are players that can end up playing 8 , 10 years in europe at salaries that , at the end of the day , if you 're smart saving and investing , you 're set for the rest of your life , he said europe continues to open its borders and its checkbooks to nba free agents looking to leave the league for better pay in 2008 , the greek club olympiacos signed the former atlanta hawk josh childress to a 20 million net income deal , and then signed the former denver nugget linas kleiza to a twoyear , 122 million contract the next summer both players passed up lucrative deals with their respective teams to play in europe for the american castoffs of regularseason rosters who seldom receive such offers , playing in europe is still an attractive option in the eyes of tim bassett , a retired nba player who spent four seasons with the nets and the san antonio spurs in the 1970s and '80s , a player should jump at any opportunity to vest if i'm this guy who has two and a half years , or if i got two years , i want to get that third year , even if i'm sitting on the bench , said bassett , 58 , who claimed his pension three years ago to have some money come in after all the years go by is better than to have none casey jacobsen , who played four seasons with the phoenix suns and the memphis grizzlies and is now playing in germany , said he thought little about his pension during his nba days now i'm really glad i have it , he said my body ca n't do this forever
here is the text of the prepared testimony of adm michael g mullen , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , before the senate armed services committee on wednesday , as released in advance by his office chairman levin , senator mccain and distinguished members of the committee , thank you for the opportunity to testify on the subject of the president s newly announced strategy for afghanistan and pakistan the president s tuesday evening announcement at west point of our strategy and increased military resources for afghanistan culminates a process of deliberate strategic review that began with the arrival of general mcchrystal s interim assessment in early september i believe this nationallevel review has been sober and essential the challenges we face in afghanistan and pakistan are great , and our interests there are significant this administration needed to take the time to look at all the options and craft a balanced and sustainable approach i believe that the review has met this aim i support fully , and without hesitation , the president s decision refining the strategy the facts compel us to act our strategic review confirmed that the overarching policy goal remains the same to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan , and to prevent its capacity to threaten america and our allies from either country in the future south asia is the epicenter of global islamic extremism the location of al qaeda s core leadership and the terrain that dozens of islamic terrorist groups call home it is the location from which the 9 11 attacks on america were planned and driven if the united states should be hit again , i remain convinced that the planning , training and funding for such an attack will emanate there it is a region where a nuclear weapons state , pakistan , is under direct threat from al qaeda and affiliated pakistanitaliban groups that aspire to acquire and use nuclear weapons against the united states and our allies thus , it is a region with a unique and deadly combination of the most dangerous terrorists and the most dangerous technology in the world our actions in pakistan and afghanistan seek to prevent catastrophic outcomes from these toxic forces , and constitute a most critical national interest our strategic review paid particular attention to pakistan the people of pakistan are under as much , if not greater , threat from al qaeda and islamic terrorism than are we we must encourage and aid the pakistani military fight against these extremists in south waziristan , in swat , and across pakistan we must also help pakistan widen its aperture in seeking out and eliminating all forms of extremism and terrorism those who threaten not only pakistan , but also afghanistan , the wider south asia region , and the globe we are deepening ties with the people of pakistan as well as with their security forces we see progress with our pakistani allies as paramount to the way ahead in afghanistan , we narrowedin on a challenging , but attainable goal to deny al qaeda safe haven and the afghantaliban the ability to overthrow the duly elected afghan government to achieve this refined strategic aim , we must continue to deny al qaeda any afghanistan toehold , reverse the momentum of the taliban insurgency , and build sufficient afghan government and security capacity to eventually defeat the insurgent threat our review also narrowed and refined the military objectives for general mcchrystal s natoisaf force focusing it on security of key population areas while afghan forces grow in size and capability , prioritizing a robust natoisaf program of training and mentoring afghan military and police , and establishing the conditions necessary for afghans to assume their own security each of these objectives will hasten the day when we can begin thinning the us natoisaf security forces presence , turning the internal security of afghanistan over to the afghans this strategy provides the time and space for the afghans themselves to build sufficient security and governance capacity to stabilize their country our refined military objectives for afghanistan complement those in the political and economic spheres they also support diplomatic , political , and military programs that the president s strategy calls for us to undertake with neighboring countries especially pakistan that increase pressure against al qaeda s leadership that expand counterinsurgency operations against taliban insurgents who threaten afghanistan , pakistan and the wider region and that help set the conditions for improved regional security and stability matching strategy and resources throughout this strategic review , i advised the secretary of defense and the president that our commitment of military resources must match our strategy i am pleased to inform this committee that the president s decision accommodates this advice the strategy he approved commits 30 , 000 more us forces , with some number of additional enablers , while calling for our nato and nonnato allies to generate additional forces this rapid , coalitionwide buildup of force aligns with general mcchrystal s recommendations , even more so in light of the narrowing of objectives for afghanistan that the president announced tuesday night
peace has returned to the yankees universe the champagne celebrations are over , the confetti has been cleaned up along the canyon of heroes and for the first time since last spring , the urgency has vanished from yankee stadium on saturday morning , yankees employees , who would have normally been scurrying around preparing for the next game , took the field for a casual pickup game of their own and inside the home clubhouse , it was baggie day , the day when players usually clean out their lockers and reporters ask them for one final postmortem on their season but on the first baggie day in nearly a decade when there was little to grill the players on after all , their season ended free of disappointment none of them showed up from 10 am and 2 pm , when the clubhouse was open to the news media , not a single player came to collect his belongings according to the yankees , several players had already swung by the stadium after friday s parade , but all over the clubhouse , relics of the season remained for instance , there were still a few pairs of shoes left in derek jeter s locker , some family photographs in andy pettitte s and a box full of fan mail in joba chamberlain s , and many still had an assortment of yankees gear hanging inside but a few lockers contained some more interesting things that were not necessarily standard yankees issue here is a list of some of the choice items that still need to be packed up by players or more likely by clubhouse attendants
what if one of the many organizations that present handel s messiah around this time every year in new york were to offer something else for a change \? perhaps something actually written for christmas time \( unlike messiah , which handel typically performed during the easter season \) , like bach s christmas oratorio bernard labadie and his orchestra and chorus from quebec city , les violons du roy and la chapelle de qu bec , presented a sort of test case at carnegie hall over the weekend on friday evening they performed messiah , the third highprofile account of the work last week in new york \( with at least eight to follow this week and three the next \) on saturday evening they performed bach s christmas oratorio , seemingly the only major complete rendition of the season here \( if you have n't announced yours , do it now \) this least scientific of comparisons suggested , as feared , that the more adventuresome organization would draw a substantially smaller audience the house for messiah , though by no means full , was respectable that for the christmas oratorio was considerably smaller , though , after two lateseating breaks , not as thin as it initially appeared more s the pity the christmas oratorio actually a gathering of six individual cantatas written for the liturgical feast days of the christmas season , extending to the epiphany , on jan 6 is a piece of similar scope and scale to messiah , with even a little pastoral sinfonia at a parallel juncture it is at least as rich and varied in melody , brilliance and exuberance but it is painted in fine strokes , with an abundance of detail , almost a surfeit when performed in a single sitting it lacks the immediate appeal of messiah , which is painted in broad strokes , none broader than the hallelujah chorus still , both works can be endlessly satisfying in performances as fine as those mr labadie presented here this messiah in particular was , for the combined excellence of the choral singing and the orchestral playing , the best i 've heard in years mr labadie , who conducted the new york philharmonic in messiah in 2006 and made his metropolitan opera debut with mozart s zauberfl te in september , is an earlymusic specialist of a pragmatic bent his players use conventional instruments with modern fittings , for the most part , but revert in many ways to period practice the string players fit for a king indeed , as the band s name might suggest use baroque bows and apply vibrato only sparingly , for specific expressive purposes mr labadie s chorus of 32 flouts current minimalist notions of bach orthodoxy but it performed with revelatory transparency and balance at certain cutoffs in each work you could imagine that you were hearing each individual voice reverberate , perfectly weighted , through the seamless harmony the orchestra \( 24 players in the handel , 31 in the bach \) , too , was superb the strings positively blazed as the refiner s fire burned and the nations raged in messiah , and solo players acquitted themselves beautifully , right down to the trumpet tour de force by benjamin raymond in the closing chorale of the christmas oratorio unfortunately , the vocal soloists even the star presence , the countertenor david daniels , who sometimes showed strain were not always on the same level the soprano rosemary joshua , who , like mr daniels , performed in both works , projected unevenly and was sometimes a bit wild in tone and intonation most effective was andrew fosterwilliams , the bassbaritone in messiah , who dispatched the quavering figures depicting fire and rage with fullbodied tone despite mr labadie s brisk tempos and was just as effective intoning the serene great light seen by the people that walked in darkness joshua hopkins , the baritone in the christmas oratorio , sang with attractive tone quality but less weight of the tenors , the clearvoiced alan bennett , in the handel , fared better than jan kobow , in the bach mr kobow , though he produced lovely sounds , seemed overmatched from the start singing both the role of the evangelist and the tenor arias , and lost all substance to his voice in the late going none of which will detract in the end from memories of two eloquent performances by mr labadie and his forces , who took the measure of two great masterpieces and played them to a draw
to the editor joshua foust is right to stand up for the rights of afghans working as american military linguists \( , oped , sept 22 \) , but his criticism of mission essential personnel , the united states government s leading supplier of afghan interpreters , missed the mark judged fairly , mission essential personnel has done a difficult job well and ethically , filling the military s fastgrowing need for qualified and vetted linguists in a war zone better than its competitors , while treating our linguists whom we regard as colleagues and heroes as we would any american employee none of our linguists have been denied medical treatment after being injured in the case cited , we not only made sure our linguist received full treatment , but we also made special effort to get him into an american military hospital for the best available care regarding the assertion that we tended to hire elderly interpreters , 75 percent of our afghan linguists are between age 18 and 54 finally , our company has an ethics officer and a system in place to receive harassment or mistreatment complaints and has acted on all such complaints chris taylor chief executive officer mission essential personnel chantilly , va , sept 22 , 2009
game 5s are pivotal and game 7s are forced every sportswriter knows that but game 5s can also be magical in boston , the celtics were down by 14 in the fourth quarter on tuesday night when they came back to beat the orlando magic and take a 32 lead in the eastern conference semifinals with kevin garnett sidelined , the celtics have needed role players like rajon rondo and glen davis to step into starring roles to keep their championship hopes chugging along so , whose turn was it tuesday night \? \( look away , knicks fans \) as the magic slipped into a prevent offense , in the fourth quarter s chris sheridan traces marbury s comeback to three months ago after tuesday s game , magic center dwight howard , who took only 10 shots , , which were limited to one in the final 6 minutes 50 seconds , according to espn by coach stan van gundy , who in postgame remarks said , we looked like we were trying to run the clock out secondguessing your coach \? says that officially makes howard a superstar and it puts the celtics , who are 320 in franchise history when leading after game 6 , right where they want to be tactical fouling in the nba has elbowed its way into casual fans' conversations , and the legal blog wonders and whether the expectation of having an intentional foul called is legitimate sounds like required reading for the mavericks in college basketball , yahoo reports that the southern cal coach tim floyd to a man who helped deliver o j mayo to the team , according to a former confidant of mayo s sports illustrated spoiler do n't look for the knicks' owner , cablevision , on the best list and there may be more than the listed reasons that the raiders' al davis is  bobby jenks , the chicago white sox closer who threw behind ian kinsler of the texas rangers in the white sox' 32 victory saturday , was by major league baseball for the incident makes you wonder how much the fine would have been if jenks said he threw behind him on purpose in the nhl , damien cox of the star in toronto has , and it is not good news for the wannabe owner jim balsillie to have wayne gretzky line up against him on the ice , game 5s are so two games ago the boston bruins beat the carolina hurricanes , 42 , on tuesday and the anaheim ducks beat the detroit red wings , 21 , to force game 7s calls the bruinshurricanes series an odd one , 33 , but none of the games have been truly close , if you are n't enjoying these stanley cup playoffs , you 're not breathing , and notes that people in detroit are breathing heavily but the game 7 everyone is talking about is wednesday night penguins at capitals the times' jeff z klein calls hockey heaven , and says their rivalry is sparking a renaissance in scoring in the nhl alexander ovechkin predicts , and that the game , on versus , is the biggest the sport has to offer if the nhl ca n't get any mileage out of this series , it might as well put up the sticks and pucks and reintroduce itself as the ice capades so ignore the season finale of lost and the semifinal results of because the only thing better than a game 5 is a game 7
brussels the position will undoubtedly bring prestige , limitless travel and the chance to head a network of diplomats stretching around the globe yet none of europe s big three powers in foreign policy , and appear to want it with a deadline approaching to fill senior posts created for the european union by the lisbon treaty , filling the bloc s leaders will meet in brussels on thursday to try to decide who should win the job , along with who should become the first permanent president of the european council , the body that represents the 27 member states but with the new european commission being created at the same time as the new senior posts are being filled , the negotiations are complex and , amid fierce horsetrading , the union s most powerful foreign policy nations have kept their attention fixed on other jobs britain , france and germany have indicated so far that they would prefer to secure lowerprofile , but influential economic posts inside the european commission the british government s priority is to get one of the economic portfolios , said charles grant , director of the center for european reform in london that is also the priority of the french and german governments diplomats expect the union s new , more powerful president to come from a centerright party and , to maintain political balance , they expect the foreign minister to be selected from the centerleft under , each of the member states will continue to have a seat at the european commission but because the new foreign policy chief will also be a vice president of the european commission , he will also be his nation s sole appointee there france has so far not put forward potential contenders from the centerleft for the foreign policy job germany has already nominated as its european commissioner g nther oettinger , who is from the centerright and has no substantial foreign policy experience one possible compromise would have involved the british foreign secretary , david miliband , being selected as the foreign policy chief , complementing the choice of prime minister herman van rompuy of belgium , a member of a centerright party , as president but mr miliband appeared to rule himself out and , according to diplomats , one reason that britain was reluctant to propose him for the post was a concern that his selection would then clear the way for france and germany to get key economic positions in the european commission of particular concern to the british is the prospect of france winning the internal market portfolio , according to a european union diplomat this is viewed as a vital job , because it oversees efforts to maintain a level playing field in the bloc s internal market and because it also includes financial regulation , an area certain to be more important in the aftermath of the financial crisis however , some diplomats believe that , if britain wins some safeguards on economic policy , it might be prepared to put forward as foreign policy chief its former european commissioner , peter mandelson , or even prevail on mr miliband to change his mind
so many of the ' core players have dropped from sight , off to rehabilitation with injuries , that only remains out went first baseman carlos delgado , shortstop jose reyes , center fielder carlos beltran their absences have left wright unprotected in the lineup , and because of that , wright s streaky season has taken a recent , drastic plunge at least that was the view of manager jerry manuel , who said wednesday that wright was pressing , trying to score runners instead of advancing them and drawing too few walks you just see him trying to do too much , manuel said point blank and when you try to do too much , you begin to get out of the things that you 've had success with , get out of character and that s where he is now heading into wednesday night s game against the los angeles dodgers , had last recorded a hit on july 2 he had no hits in his last 16 atbats , one hit in his last 23 atbats and eight strikeouts and three walks in july his batting average dropped 23 points in the first six games of the month , to 322 , before he hit a runscoring single in the third inning wednesday ever since wright recorded three hits on june 30 against milwaukee , he had turned in a slump that mirrors that of his team , which had gone 23 consecutive innings without scoring before scoring in the second inning wednesday since saturday , the mets had more strikeouts \( 21 \) than total bases \( 14 \) heading into wednesday s gameafter the mets' 80 loss to the dodgers on tuesday , wright did not sugarcoat his play or his team s play he said the mets stink and had not pitched well , hit well or played good defense lately i do n't think anyone is having much fun right now , he said wright sounded like a man who needed a day off , but manuel said he did not plan to give him one in fact , as much as wright has struggled lately , manuel said he would be better for it in the end first , though , manuel said wright needs to stop pressing and start taking more walks entering wednesday , he had 46 walks and 84 strikeouts he is on pace for career lows in home runs and runs batted in , while on pace for a career high in strikeouts while wright can control much of what happens to him at the plate , manuel said , the absence of other core batters had obviously affected him but help from those players is a ways off none are expected to return soon despite the struggles that he s having right now , and the frustration that he s having , this is going to be a positive thing for him , manuel said trying to do too much is not the answer doing the little things , that s going to be the answer asked if his entire team , not just david wright , could be pressing , jerry manuel said it remains a possibility that not hitting is as contagious as hitting is sometimes believed to be a reporter then asked manuel if he sought counsel from other managers , or coaches in other sports had anyone been through a season like the one the mets are going through and say anything to help \? manuel laughed long and hard at that one counsel , manuel said shoot , i need gandhi and king he meant the , who , along with , is one of manuel s great influences that s what i need to get through what i'm going through , i need gandhi and king , he said they went through some stuff then he laughed long and hard again manuel said he needed to retain his passion for baseball even during slumps like this one he said he hoped that attitude would carry over to the clubhouse before oliver perez made his return against the dodgers on wednesday night , jerry manuel talked about perez s high ceiling , with a catch obviously it s going to depend on how well he pitches , manuel said but historically , with a guy being in the situation that s he s in , has had some success here in new york , he does give us a lift , especially in the starting rotation we feel like he can be a dominating type guy , when he s right and anytime you go into the game with that , the prospects of somebody being able to dominate , you 've got to feel good about it
atlanta efforts to force the public hospital here to continue providing free treatment to a group of immigrants , most of them illegal , suffered a setback on tuesday when a judge dismissed a lawsuit challenging the recent closing of the hospital s outpatient renal clinic a lawyer for the roughly 50 patients said he would appeal but the ruling for grady memorial hospital brings the patients closer to a jan 3 deadline for finding new sources of the lifesustaining dialysis treatment when the struggling hospital closed the clinic for fiscal reasons in early october , it agreed to pay for three months of dialysis for the patients at private clinics , either in the united states or in their home countries that reprieve has nearly expired , and most of the patients have not taken steps to seek treatment elsewhere a hospital spokesman disclosed tuesday that three of the patients had died since the clinic s closing , two of them in mexico and one in atlanta none of the deaths , he said , appeared related to inadequate access to dialysis based on the best information that we have , the patients' deaths were not caused by a lack of dialysis care but by other health issues , said matt gove , the grady spokesman the hospital , which provides charity care to patients regardless of their status , has lost five dialysis patients in each of the last two years , mr gove said nationally , about one in five dialysis patients dies within a year of starting treatment , and about two in three die within five years , according to government figures the hospital has said its offer to assist patients in relocating will end on jan 3 , and patients have signed forms stating that they understand as much but that may not mean they will be cut off from care after that date grady has a contract with a large dialysis provider , fresenius medical services , that covers the patients' treatment until september 2010 if the patients continue to go to fresenius clinics , and the clinics continue to treat them , grady will presumably be billed for their continuing care because of their immigration status , the patients are not eligible for , the federal insurance program , which covers the prohibitive costs of dialysis for american citizens and longtime legal immigrants at a hearing on tuesday morning , judge ural d glanville of fulton county superior court provided little reasoning for granting the hospital s request to dismiss the patients' lawsuit the patients' lawyer , lindsay jones , had contended among other claims that grady had illegally abandoned the patients a lawyer for the hospital , bernard taylor , said the patients were asserting a constitutional right to medical care that does not exist in law several patients said they were saddened by the ruling i'm a person who loves life , who wants to live , said reina andrade , 32 , one of the plaintiffs if i return to my village in honduras , i know i will die mr gove , the hospital spokesman , said he could not name the three patients who had died or discuss details of their cases but one of them is adriana r os fern ndez , a 23yearold mother of two whose father said she died in durango , mexico , on nov 28 ms r os was receiving only two dialysis treatments a week , rather than the standard regimen of three , said her father , adrian r os zu iga five or six hours after each treatment , he said , her lungs would fill with fluid , making it difficult to breathe mexican nephrologists briefed on her case said it was possible that more dialysis would have made a difference but ms r os left atlanta in august , shortly after grady announced that the clinic would close and before the hospital offered its deal for three months of paid dialysis , mr r os said he said his family had paid the 118 cost of her treatments out of pocket and could not afford more than two sessions a week we sold rings , we sold chains , we got money from cousins and friends , he said a lot of people did try to help us , but unfortunately it came to an end mr gove would not comment on whether the hospital kept track of ms r os after her departure , or whether grady felt any obligation to patients who left the country before the hospital made its offer of assistance we 've done everything we can to see that patients , if they chose to go back home , had safe travel and the support they needed , he said
the reign of sarah palin , alaska s governor , as a vicepresidential candidate may have lasted only two full months , but the internecine warfare that her national political debut unleashed among republicans and within the mccain camp continues to have a life of its own a new article in vanity fair magazine exposes more of the internal upset among her handlers , who were top advisers to her running mate , senator john mccain , the republicans' presidential nominee the article , by todd purdum , explores the deepening estrangement of advisers like tucker eskew , steve schmidt and nicolle wallace from ms palin as she stumbled in public interviews and in campaign appearances none of them spoke on the record to mr purdum , but he cites interviews with several in the top command of the campaign team by election night , the advisers and ms palin were barely speaking , the article says while some of the animus between the palin and mccain camps had been aired publicly , the article immediately set off a nasty feud online between mr schmidt and one of ms palin s earliest admirers , william kristol , the editor of the weekly standard the politico on wednesday published an article detailing the accusations and counteraccusations on the weekly standard s blog , mr kristol accused mr schmidt of spreading falsehoods in the vanity fair article that ms palin may have suffered from a personality disorder or postpartum depression \( her youngest son was born with down syndrome in the spring of 2008 \) no one had raised such issues publicly before mr kristol said the article was filled with dubious claims , and he vehemently protested the inclusion of personality problems in the article , which he denounced as a hit piece \( ms palin has not commented publicly on the article , but had , in postelection interviews , expressed dissatisfaction with the way her candidacy had been managed by top campaign officials \) mr schmidt told politico that mr kristol s accusations were categorically untrue then mr schmidt was informed by politico that another mccain adviser , randy scheunemann , said he had heard mr schmidt speculate about ms palin s mental state in the same politico article , mr scheunemann said that hearing some of mr schmidt s utterances during the campaign was like meeting tony soprano mr schmidt retaliated by alluding to efforts to fire mr scheunemann from the campaign kate phillips photo \( photograph by mark kelley for the new york times \)
indianapolis history is the best judge of trades , and the mets swap with atlanta of outoffavor right fielders looked much better tuesday when the braves designated ryan church for assignment in the deal last season , the mets got jeff francoeur , whose energy , defense and production meshed nicely at citi field he is assured of being the mets opening day right fielder , and church is searching for a job the mets acquired church , along with brian schneider , in a november 2007 deal that sent lastings milledge to washington none of those players have flourished since schneider was limited to 169 games over two seasons because of injury and poor performance , and the mets let him leave as a free agent milledge , after an encouraging season in 2008 , struggled offensively and defensively in 2009 and was banished to the minors before being traded in june to pittsburgh church s travails in new york are well known , and despite the endless space of the internet , there may not be enough room here to list them all one word concussions omar minaya , who made both trades involving church , said that he heard about the decision early tuesday afternoon and that he was not surprised because the braves were not going to offer church a contract for next season when a reporter mentioned to him that he had gotten a gold star and a w for winning that trade , minaya laughed heartily i haven t had too many w s so i ll take it , minaya said at the time of the trade , he credited his assistant , john ricco , with proposing it when he was reminded of that , as ricco stood across from him , minaya playfully played dumb oh , i forgot , that wasn t ricco , he said that was me i made a mistake
the dodgers erroraided comeback against the cardinals in game 2 of their division series is hard to top but the angels pulled off a riveting twoout rally of their own in the ninth inning on sunday to finish off the red sox after boston closer jonathan papelbon retired the first two batters in the inning , los angeles had a mere 13 percent chance to win , according to fangraphscom but the angels strung together a single , a walk , a runscoring double , an intentional walk and a twoout single by vladimir guerrero to take the lead brian fuentes tossed a 123 ninth , and the red sox were swept out of the playoffs papelbon s surface numbers this year were excellent a 185 earned run average , 38 saves and a 488 win probability added that led all relievers but his peripheral stats revealed some chinks in his armor after walking only 48 percent of opposing batters from 2006 to 2008 , he handed out free passes to 84 percent in 2009 that mark is still better than the league average and might be nothing more than a statistical blip in a small sample size nonetheless , his newfound propensity for wildness got the best of him sunday chone figgins probably earned himself a few extra million on his next freeagent contract by working a sevenpitch walk against papelbon and later scoring the tying run none of the balls were even particularly close to the strike zone additionally , papelbon showed an uncharacteristic ability to put hitters away his strikeout rate this year of 10 per nine innings was right in line with his career mark , but he has shown an increasing tendency to rely on his fastball he threw the pitch 815 percent of the time in 2009 , versus 735 percent in his breakout 2006 in this appearance , he didn t trust his offspeed stuff enough to throw a single breaking ball all 25 pitches in the inning \( excluding the intentional walk \) were heaters major league batters will always be able to hit 96mph fastballs if they don t have to worry about anything coming in under 92 particularly a team like los angeles that emphasizes making contact three different angels faced two strikes with two outs , and all of them reached base after dispatching the red sox with atypical ease , the angels will now have to contend with the game s undisputed juggernaut the yankees astonishing lineup has no weaknesses , but it is particularly proficient at clubbing home runs the club s 244 longballs put it 20 ahead of the secondplace rangers  keeping them in the park requires a staff with strong groundball tendencies the rockies , who built a rotation around sinkerballers to mitigate the effect of their highaltitude home park , allowed flies on only 33 percent of batted balls if they wind up facing the yankees in the world series , they might have some success at preventing new york s trademark powerfueled big innings \( like the homers by alex rodriguez and mark teixeira that propelled the team to an 11inning comeback win in game 2 against the twins \) but the angels flyball rate of 40 percent was the sixthhighest in the majors the starter jered weaver , who allowed more than half of his batted balls in the air , could be in for a particularly rough time if the angels hurlers cannot adapt their approach to counter the slugging strength of their next opponents , they will most likely find themselves sent home every bit as quickly as the red sox were in the first round
washington senator is rewriting the part of presidential loser unwilling to vanish into retirement like bob dole , or retreat into academia like al gore , or even quietly convalesce like john kerry , mr mccain has quickly reclaimed a place on center stage in washington , some days skewering president obama and the democratic party , and on other days standing by their side i'm the , as i said , loyal opposition , mr mccain , republican of arizona , proclaimed this week and both words , i think , are operative if anyone wondered which john mccain would return to the senate the coalitionbuilding dealmaker or the glovesoff bruiser from the campaign trail the answer is now clear both it was mr mccain , as much as anyone else , whose crusade against earmarks dealt a major setback to democrats when republicans succeeded on thursday night in stalling a 410 billion spending bill in mr mccain s scathing words , mr obama s amounts to generational theft and yet mr mccain has endorsed mr obama s plans to withdraw combat troops from iraq , and even has gone so far as to appear by mr obama s side when the president ordered increased competition in awarding government contracts mr mccain promised on election night to do all in my power to help mr obama some historians say the two men could yet forge the strongest alliance between a president and his election rival since wendell l willkie helped franklin d roosevelt oppose isolationism in the 1940s but in his first weeks back in the senate , mr mccain has been quintessentially unpredictable , at times offering quiet counsel to the white house , at others jabbing in all directions on some days , he seems bitter , more certain than ever that he could do a better job running the country than mr obama i have a record of bipartisan work within the senate he does not , mr mccain said on feb 19 in an interview with a newspaper in kingman , ariz , criticizing the president for what he called a lack of bipartisanship on the stimulus plan there are also signs that he still harbors grudges from the 2008 presidential campaign in the debate over the stimulus bill , he did not mask his fury at the three republicans who backed the democrats , particularly senator susan collins , of maine , once a friend , who won reelection in november in part by distancing herself from mr mccain and his campaign tactics he drew a distinction between his own history of forging coalitions and what he portrayed as a betrayal on the part of ms collins , and senators olympia j snowe of maine and arlen specter of pennsylvania , as the only three lawmakers who broke rank with their party i am proud to have been a member of a number of bipartisan resolutions , mr mccain barked that is when republicans and democrats have sat down together and came out in equal numbers by contrast , he said this is three members of the senate , none on the house side , who have joined democrats for partisan agreement at a white house summit meeting last week on fiscal responsibility , mr mccain seized the moment to chide mr obama on cost overruns for a new fleet of presidential helicopters but on many days , mr mccain seems to have put his defeat behind him , and even to be enjoying himself , as he writes a new chapter in his unusual career he has joked that he cares less about presidential helicopters than he did a few months ago asked how he felt after two months back , mr mccain said it s terrible it s awful i am in a constant state of despondency ca n't you tell \? there was a giant smile on his face mccain has decided that he is not going to morph into the role of embittered excandidate but to embrace the kind of senior statesman , loyal opponent role , said ross k baker , a professor of political science at rutgers professor baker added , his support will come at times and places of his choosing after a number of younger senate colleagues announced that they would retire after this congress , mr mccain held a news conference saying he would run for reelection in 2010 already , mr obama has reached out for his support on national security matters and on some trade issues \( out of respect , the requests come in calls from mr obama himself \) i think he is enjoying helping where he can , saying no where he must , said senator lindsey graham , republican of south carolina , who was often at mr mccain s side during the campaign i think john s respectful of the fact that he lost , president obama won , but he is also a united states senator , mr graham added john s going to call them as he sees them there will be no better ally for president obama than senator mccain when they can find common ground , and , quite frankly , there will be no stronger or more credible critic that s the role he enjoys and the burden he carries senate democratic leaders say they hope mr mccain will eventually join them in developing legislation on , health care and other issues so far , though , they have tread lightly , intent on letting him recover before fully engaging him losing elections is hard , the majority leader , senator harry reid of nevada , said i think senator mccain has conducted himself very well in resuming work on his favored issues , including national security and fiscal austerity , mr mccain has rejoined the senate s rank and file , teaming with senator carl levin , democrat of michigan , to call for revamped military contracting , and with senator russ feingold , democrat of wisconsin , to propose lineitem veto legislation to let the president remove earmarks from spending bills mr mccain s quick reentry contrasts with the path taken by mr kerry , who returned to the senate from his 2004 defeat but continued traveling the country , keeping alive speculation that he would run again there is no such speculation about mr mccain , who at 72 , has had his presidential aspirations dashed twice some of mr mccain s closest friends in the senate , including joseph i lieberman , independent of connecticut , said they expected mr mccain to emerge as a leader on numerous issues but in the senate , friendship has limits while mr lieberman , the former democratic vicepresidential nominee , stood behind mr mccain in the campaign , mr mccain recently opposed legislation by mr lieberman that would grant the district of columbia a voting member of the house john wants to be productive he wants to be part of making this place work , mr lieberman said , adding , he 'll be there to help us get some big things done for the country

ben bernanke , the federal reserve chairman , recently had some downbeat things to say about our economic prospects the economy , he warned , confronts some formidable headwinds all we can expect , he said , is modest economic growth next year sufficient to bring down the unemployment rate , but at a pace slower than we would like actually , he may have been too optimistic there s a good chance that unemployment will rise , not fall , over the next year but even if it does inch down , one has to ask why is n't the fed trying to bring it down faster \? some background i do n't think many people grasp just how much job creation we need to climb out of the hole we 're in you ca n't just look at the eight million jobs that america has lost since the recession began , because the nation needs to keep adding jobs more than 100 , 000 a month to keep up with a growing population and that means that we need really big job gains , month after month , if we want to see america return to anything that feels like full employment how big \? my back of the envelope calculation says that we need to add around 18 million jobs over the next five years , or 300 , 000 jobs a month this puts last week s employment report , which showed job losses of only 11 , 000 in november , in perspective it was basically a terrible report , which was reported as good news only because we 've been down so long that it looks like up to the financial press so if we 're going to have any real good news , someone has to take responsibility for creating a lot of additional jobs and at this point , that someone almost has to be the federal reserve i do n't mean to absolve the obama administration of all responsibility clearly , the administration proposed a stimulus package that was too small to begin with and was whittled down further by centrists in the senate and the measures president obama proposed earlier this week , while they would create a significant number of additional jobs , fall far short of what the economy needs but while economic analysis says that we should have a large second stimulus , the political reality is that the president faced with total obstruction from republicans , while receiving only lukewarm support from some in his own party probably ca n't get enough votes in congress to do more than tinker at the edges of the employment problem the fed , however , can do more mr bernanke has received a great deal of credit , and rightly so , for his use of unorthodox strategies to contain the damage after lehman brothers failed but both the fed s actions , as measured by its expansion of credit , and mr bernanke s words suggest that the urgency of late 2008 and early 2009 has given way to a curious mix of complacency and fatalism a sense that the fed has done enough now that the financial system has stepped back from the brink , even though its own forecasts predict that unemployment will remain punishingly high for at least the next three years the most specific , persuasive case i 've seen for more fed action comes from joseph gagnon , a former fed staffer now at the peterson institute for international economics basing his analysis on the prior work of none other than mr bernanke himself , in his previous incarnation as an economic researcher , mr gagnon urges the fed to expand credit by buying a further 2 trillion in assets such a program could do a lot to promote faster growth , while having hardly any downside so why is n't the fed doing it \? part of the answer may be political ideological opponents of government activism tend to be as critical of the fed s credit expansion as they are of the obama administration s fiscal stimulus and this has probably made the fed reluctant to use its powers to their fullest extent meanwhile , a significant number of fed officials , especially at the regional banks , are obsessed with the fear of 1970sstyle inflation , which they see lurking just around the bend even though there s not a hint of it in the actual data but there s also , i believe , a question of priorities the fed sprang into action when faced with the prospect of wrecked banks it does n't seem equally concerned about the prospect of wrecked lives and that is what we 're talking about here the kind of sustained high unemployment envisaged in the fed s own forecasts is a recipe for immense human suffering millions of families losing their savings and their homes , millions of young americans never getting their working lives properly started because there are no jobs available when they graduate if we do n't get unemployment down soon , we 'll be paying the price for a generation so it s time for the fed to lose that complacency , shrug off that fatalism and start lending a hand to job creation
baghdad s military showed on sunday what it called the confession of a mastermind of last week s deadly attacks on two government ministries , and it announced the arrests of police and army officers the man said had been bribed to allow a through checkpoints into baghdad in brief , edited excerpts of videotaped remarks , the man , identified as wisam ali khazim ibrahim , calmly explained how he had organized one of the two bombings , which killed almost 100 people on wednesday and wounded hundreds more he said he did so on the orders of a man in syria who wanted the attacks to shake the administration he described himself as a former police officer in diyala province and a member of saddam hussein s , which is banned in iraq and which officials in prime minister nuri kamal almaliki s government routinely blame for much of the violence in the country the videotaped confession , broadcast on state television channels , appeared to be part of an effort by security officials to ease public outrage and fear since the bombings , iraqi officials have of who was to blame , trying to shift responsibility internally for security lapses and accusing insurgents they say have support from abroad none of mr ibrahim s remarks could be confirmed independently , and what was shown left many questions about the bombings he did not identify the bomber who drove the truck that attacked the finance ministry he did not address the bombing at the foreign ministry a link to syria , if confirmed , would most likely worsen relations between the two countries mr maliki has long accused syria of providing a haven for former members of saddam hussein s government and allowing fighters to cross the border only days before the bombing , mr maliki traveled to syria to demand that officials hand over those accused of backing the insurgency iraq s foreign minister , hoshyar zebari , on saturday bluntly criticized the government and security forces for lapses that led to the attacks , including the one aimed at his ministry he , which the confession appeared to confirm at least on a local level in the video , mr ibrahim described carrying out the attack that struck the finance ministry , the first of the two bombings appearing seated in a striped , opencollar shirt before a plain white background , he said the bomb had been prepared in khalis , a town in diyala northeast of baghdad , and driven to baghdad after he paid 10 , 000 for bribes to ensure safe passage we have a person who knows all the checkpoints , and he asked for 10 , 000 , mr ibrahim , 57 , said and we gave it to him as bribes to get through the checkpoints on the heavily guarded road to baghdad a military spokesman , maj gen qassim ata almoussawi , announced the arrests of an unidentified number of officers from three checkpoints along the road from diyala , but officials did not elaborate mr ibrahim described contacts with a network of baath party leaders in exile in syria , led by izzat ibrahim aldouri he said he spent seven months in syria in 2006 and early 2007 before returning to his hometown in diyala , muqdadiya , in an effort to revive the baath party general moussawi described him as a prominent leader of the party , but according to his own remarks , mr ibrahim appeared to have little success reviving baath fortunes in diyala two of six party members were arrested , and four others fled back to syria general moussawi said that additional details about the bombings would be provided also on sunday , the united states military command announced that an american soldier was killed while on patrol in baghdad , the second death caused by hostile fire in august and the seventh in iraq since most american forces withdrew from cities on june 30 the announcement provided no additional details , pending notification of the soldier s family
it s important for americans to recognize our national heroes , even those who have been despised by history take john brown today is the 150th anniversary of brown s hanging the grim punishment for his raid weeks earlier on harpers ferry , va with a small band of abolitionists , brown had seized the federal arsenal there and freed slaves in the area his plan was to flee with them to nearby mountains and provoke rebellions in the south but he stalled too long in the arsenal and was captured he was brought to trial in a virginia court , convicted of treason , murder and inciting an insurrection , and hanged on dec 2 , 1859 it s a date we should hold in reverence yes , i know the response why remember a misguided fanatic and his absurd plan for destroying slavery \? there are compelling reasons first , the plan was not absurd brown reasonably saw the appalachians , which stretch deep into the south , as an ideal base for a guerrilla war he had studied the maroon rebels of the west indies , black fugitives who had used mountain camps to battle colonial powers on their islands his plan was to create panic by arousing fears of a slave rebellion , leading southerners to view slavery as dangerous and impractical second , he was held in high esteem by many great men of his day ralph waldo emerson compared him to jesus , declaring that brown would make the gallows as glorious as the cross henry david thoreau placed brown above the freedom fighters of the american revolution frederick douglass said that while he had lived for black people , john brown had died for them a later black reformer , w e b du bois , called brown the white american who had come nearest to touching the real souls of black folk du bois was right unlike nearly all other americans of his era , john brown did not have a shred of racism he had long lived among africanamericans , trying to help them make a living , and he wanted blacks to be quickly integrated into american society when brown was told he could have a clergyman to accompany him to the gallows , he refused , saying he would be more honored to go with a slave woman and her children by the time of his hanging , john brown was so respected in the north that bells tolled in many cities and towns in his honor within two years , the union troops marched southward singing , john brown s body lies amouldering in the grave , but his soul keeps marching on brown remained a hero to the north right up through reconstruction however , he fell from grace during the long , dark period of jim crow the attitude was , who cares about his progressive racial views , except a few blacks \? his reputation improved a bit with the civil rights movement , but he is still widely dismissed as a deranged cultist this is an injustice to a forwardthinking man dedicated to the freedom and political participation of africanamericans ok , some might say , but how about the blotches on his record , especially the murders and bloody skirmishes in kansas in the 1850s \? brown considered himself a soldier at war his attacks on proslavery forces were part of an escalating cycle of preemptive and retaliatory violence that most historians now agree were in essence the first engagements of the civil war besides , none of the heroes from that period is unblemished lincoln was the great emancipator , but he shared the era s racial prejudices , and even after the war started thought that blacks should be shipped out of the country once they were freed andrew jackson was the man of his age , but in addition to being a slaveholder , he has the extra infamy of his callous treatment of native americans , for which some hold him guilty of genocide john brown comes with buts but in that he has plenty of company he deserves to be honored today for starters , he should be pardoned technically , gov tim kaine of virginia would have to do this , since brown was tried on state charges and executed there such a posthumous pardon by a state occurred just this october , when south carolina pardoned two black men who were executed 94 years ago for murdering a confederate veteran a presidential pardon , however , would be more meaningful posthumous pardons are by definition symbolic they 're intended to remove stigma or correct injustice while the president cannot grant pardons for state crimes , a strong argument can be made for a symbolic exception in brown s case by today s standards , his crime was arguably of a federal nature , as his attack was on a federal arsenal in what is now west virginia his actions were prompted by federal slavery rulings he considered despicable , especially the supreme court s dred scott decision brown was captured by federal troops under robert e lee and the virginia court convicted him of treason against virginia even though he was not a resident \( he was tried in virginia at the orders of its governor , probably to avert northern political pressure on the federal government \) there is precedent for presidential pardons of the deceased in 1999 , bill clinton pardoned henry o flipper , an africanamerican lieutenant who was courtmartialed in 1881 for misconduct last year , george w bush gave a posthumous pardon to charles winters , an american punished for supplying b17 bombers to israel in the late 1940s in october , senator john mccain and representative peter king petitioned president obama to pardon jack johnson , the black boxing champion , who was convicted a century ago of transporting a white woman across state lines for immoral purposes justice would be served , belatedly , if president obama and governor kaine found a way to pardon a man whose heroic effort to free four million enslaved blacks helped start the war that ended slavery once and for all , rescue john brown from the loony bin of history
kabul , scattered rocket attacks and taliban intimidation suppressed turnout in afghanistan s presidential election thursday but enough voters cast ballots that afghan officials said they had thwarted efforts by the insurgents to derail the vote the election is the second in the nearly eight years since an americanled invasion ousted the taliban , but the security situation in the country has deteriorated so sharply , and the credibility of the afghan leadership has sunk so low , that the ability of the government to hold the election at all was in doubt american officials were quick to declare the poll a success worth the expanding commitment of troops and money to an increasingly unpopular and corruptionplagued government but it was still too soon to say how many afghans actually cast ballots , leaving questions about whether the low turnout would affect the legitimacy of the vote , skew the results , and resolve multiple claims of fraud early accounts put the total far below the 70 percent who cast votes in the 2004 election in some parts of the heavily embattled south , only a trickle of men and almost no women defied taliban threats to bomb polling stations and cut off fingers stained with the indelible ink used by election monitors but taliban attacks killed at least 30 people , and those who did vote wavered between resolution and terror i am happy to use my vote , and i hope things will change and peace will knock at our door , said zainab , a 40yearold voter in the southern city of kandahar yes , i am scared ! akhtar mohmmad , who voted in the southern town of khan neshin , said , fearing his purplestained finger would make him a target slowed by insecurity across afghanistan , declaring a winner could take at least two weeks or more , although afghan officials said they would release preliminary results by saturday it remained unclear how a low turnout would affect president s chances of winning reelection in the first round of voting but early reports showed more voters in the north than in the volatile south a pattern that would favor mr karzai s main challenger , , and raise the chances of a runoff especially in the south , the taliban made good on their threats to try to disrupt the vote and even in the places where insurgents failed to stop the voting , they did a good job of putting a scare into everyone who did vote in garmser , a dusty town in the insurgency s heartland in the southern province of helmand , the signs of the taliban s strength were evident the bazaar which now , on the eve of ramadan , would ordinarily be bustling was mostly closed , just as the taliban had demanded inside the polling center , voters and election workers covered their faces whenever they were approached by someone with a camera they said they were fearful of retribution at the only polling center in southern helmand , set up in the forecourt of a mosque in khan neshin , election officials estimated that no more than 300 people voted all day and not a single woman on tuesday , the taliban distributed a warning to surrounding villages if we see anyone on the street or outside your house from today until friday noon , you will be punished severely , it said in kandahar , witnesses said , the taliban fired nine rockets near polling stations and hanged two people who had inkstained fingers at a news conference at the presidential palace , mr karzai thanked those who braved the taliban threats , saying there had been 73 attacks in 15 provinces nevertheless , 94 percent of the polling centers opened , election officials said i am very grateful to our people , who tolerated the suicide attacks , rockets attacks , and bomb attacks , mr karzai told journalists let s see what the turnout was he said they came out and voted that s good , that s good ballot counting started immediately at polling stations after voting closed at 5 pm but united nations officials , who were assisting in the process , said official returns could take up to a month if complaints of fraud or irregularities needed to be adjudicated mr abdullah , a former foreign minister , said his supporters would lodge complaints of fraud , in particular from the southern province of kandahar he called the low turnout in kabul unsatisfactory , but also said the early returns were hopeful and offered his own praise despite all the difficulties , despite all the security problems and other problems , people went to the polls , and they participated in this day , he said at a news conference in the garden of his home and in fact they stood up to those who wanted to take away the people s right to choose their destiny two polling stations visited for the count in kabul showed that the contest might be close male voters in one polling station gave mr karzai 45 percent and mr abdullah 38 percent a women s polling station next door , where only 41 women voted all day , gave mr karzai 56 percent and mr abdullah 26 percent other candidates made a very small showing , and only one woman in 41 voted for one of the female candidates in kandahar , mr karzai s home city , a selection of four polling stations showed mr karzai with 48 percent and mr abdullah with 18 percent the turnout in kabul , which officials said was lower than in 2004 in the last election , stemmed as much from disillusionment with progress since 2001 as with fear of violence , residents said in one area of western kabul , where four small bombs exploded in the early morning , few people ventured out early but by midmorning , election officials said , voting was brisk why should we be scared \? said nurzia , a mother of four who brought her daughter and nieces to vote like many afghans she has only one name we came to have a say in our

election commission , said that counting would take place at polling stations , with the results called in to the election headquarters in kabul and collated in the coming days but insecurity in some areas made it necessary to transfer some ballot boxes to district centers , officials said in the most insecure areas , not even afghan election monitors could attend the voting , raising concerns of fraud even as officials from the obama administration , who were also on hand to observe the elections , expressed reserved optimism that the voting was transparent , they fretted about whether the ballot counting would be equally so the test is going to be in the counting , richard c holbrooke , the american special envoy to the region , said in an interview after he toured four polling stations in kabul if the will of the electorate is going to be thwarted , it will happen in the counting at the same time , he was clearly pleased that the vote had come off on the basis of what we 've seen so far , it seems clear that the taliban utterly failed to disrupt these elections , he said president obama , in a radio interview , said that the election appeared to be successful despite the taliban s effort to disrupt it , and that we 've got to make sure that we are really focused on finishing the job in afghanistan one candidate , , the former finance minister , sent an email message to american officials to say that he had reports that his opponents were stuffing ballot boxes other presidential candidates were making similar complaints , which competed with reports of sporadic violence throughout the day in kabul , the capital , police fought a gun battle with people suspected of being taliban infiltrators who took over a house overlooking a police headquarters , killing two of them and capturing a third , as bystanders applauded the officers in the southern province of paktia , two wouldbe suicide bombers were shot to death before they could detonate their explosives , zahir azimi , a defense ministry spokesman , said in wardak province , an hour s drive south of kabul , a barrage of six rockets fell just before the polls opened , and three more soon afterward a mechanic , qudratullah , 32 , said he encountered taliban representatives on the road from narkh district , just over a mile from the provincial capital of wardak they were standing on the road telling people not to vote , he said of course i am scared , he said but , like a good number of others , he voted anyway we want to see change and a younger generation in a better condition , qudratullah said

beijing soaked in sweat , his heart racing , chen guang descended the steps of s great hall of the people and aimed his automatic rifle at the sea of student protesters occupying a 17yearold soldier from the countryside , mr chen and his comrades had just been given chilling orders to clear the symbolic heart of the nation , even if it meant spilling blood we were assured there would be no legal consequences if we opened fire , mr chen recalled in an interview on tuesday my only hope was that the students would not put up a fight twenty years after chinese troops shot their way into the center of beijing , killing hundreds of people and wounding many more , mr chen provided a rare window into the military crackdown that reestablished the communist party s supremacy after six weeks of mass unrest and then , for most chinese , disappeared in an official whitewash speaking publicly for the first time and defying security officials who have told him to keep silent he explained how soldiers from the 65th group army dressed in civilian clothes on june 3 and stealthily made their way to the great hall on tiananmen square s western edge at midnight , with clips of ammunition slung across their chests , they faced off against demonstrators , the air filled with the singing of students and the sound of gunfire i can assure you i did n't shoot anyone , he said now an artist and a bit of a provocateur living on the outskirts of beijing , mr chen said he spent the next 20 years suppressing memories of that day but last year he began working on a series of paintings based on hundreds of photographs , taken at his unit s request while he was on the square they include gauzy images of protesters commandeering a public bus , exuberant students parading with prodemocracy banners and soldiers feeding their abandoned encampments into bonfires for 20 years i tried to bury this episode , but the older you get the more these things float to the surface , he said , chainsmoking in his apartment i think it s time for my experiences , my truth , to be shared with the rest of the world but by publicizing his experiences through his art , mr chen risks provoking the authorities , who are eager to suppress discussion of the episode and excise june 4 from public memory in recent weeks , as the anniversary of the crackdown approached , the police have harassed or detained dissidents who they feared might draw attention to june 4 last spring , , a former soldier from north china , was arrested after telling the associated press that he regretted his role in crushing the prodemocracy protests last summer , after local galleries refused to show his paintings , mr chen posted them on the internet within hours , however , they had been taken down a slightly built man who talks softly and without emotion , mr chen says he is not worried about the consequences of speaking out , even if he has received warnings to keep his paintings to himself i'm not doing anything wrong , he said i'm just talking about my experiences raised in rural henan province , the son of a factory worker , he dropped out of high school at 15 because , he said , he was a poor student he wanted to be an artist , but everyone told him that was no way to make a living the pressure from my family was intense so i decided to join the army , he said because enlistees had to be at least 18 , he lied about his age less than a year later , in midapril , beijing was convulsed by protests touched off by the death of hu yaobang , the communist party chief who had been forced to resign to take responsibility for what some rival leaders viewed as reckless economic and political reforms isolated in their barracks three hours north of the city , mr chen said he and his fellow soldiers understood little about protests they knew only what military officers told them that bad people were trying to destroy the nation that was established with the death of martyrs , he recalled on may 19 , they were given orders to enter the city but their path was blocked by throngs of students and average beijing residents supporting the demonstrators for two days the troops were lectured to and fed by strangers while the nation s military leaders debated what to do on the third day , his unit withdrew , but mr chen said the episode left him confused we were told they were bad people but the students seemed so honest and earnest , he said after nearly two weeks isolated in their barracks , the soldiers were given civilian clothes and told to make their way to the great hall in groups of two or three mr chen said his assignment was far more unnerving he said he was the only passenger in a doublelength bus with its seats removed and its interior filled to the windowsills with guns and ammunition unfed and terrified , the soldiers , most of them teenagers , waited inside the great hall while military commanders , perched at a secondfloor window , strategized the assault around midnight , power to the square was cut and the soldiers eased their way down the broad steps to the street to frighten the students into leaving , he said , the men were told to fire into the air the tactic had the desired effect by 2 am , tens of thousands of students were weeping and singing the internationale as they filed out of the square not long afterward , armored vehicles rolled in one went to work on the goddess of democracy , a papierm ch statue that art students had built just days earlier it took them three rams before it fell to the ground , mr chen said most of the deaths in the crackdown , according to multiple accounts of the incident , occurred in the streets leading toward the square , not in the square itself less than a year after the suppression , mr chen enrolled in the military s art school , then transferred to the chinese academy of fine art in 1995 , he left the army in those early years , mr chen was drawn to photography and performance art , creating work that was lurid and provocative he spent months filming prostitutes and took photographs of himself copulating on the great wall he also produced a series of sexually explicit photos of himself posing with an elderly intellectual man who had been persecuted by the communist party i wanted to portray myself having a visceral connection to someone who had experienced china s tumultuous history , he said although none of his early work refers directly to tiananmen square , he said most of it had been influenced by the trauma there even if a connection is hard to see , everything i do is touched by that experience , he said mr chen said he saw soldiers bloodied by rocks and a protestor having his head rifle butted by soldiers but the image that haunts him most is rather mundane as he was cleaning up the square that morning , he spotted a luxuriant ponytail amid the detritus of crushed bicycles and tangled blankets the clump of hair , held by a purple band , had been crudely shorn , perhaps as an act of protest but possibly the result of something more sinister it was a startling image , he said i ca n't stop thinking about that hair and why it had been cut off in recent months , he has produced a score of selfportraits in each , his neck , shoulder and chest are littered with scraps of hair he cuts his own hair only every year or two and then stores the clippings in his apartment so far he has filled the equivalent of two dozen coffee cans , raw material for a future project he said he did his most intense work every june , around the same time that he was hit with wrenching stomach pain it is the same twisting of the gut that he first experienced on the square , he said it was around this time last year that mr chen decided to revisit the cache of photographs he had taken in 1989 just before the assault on the square began , mr chen s commander handed him a camera and 20 rolls of film and told him to wander freely when it came time to hand back the film , he hid three rolls in his armyissued satchel he said the photographs inspired him to take on a subject that few in china care , or dare , to touch his paintings are artistic depictions of history , he insisted , not expressions of right or wrong the images are largely dispassionate , although mr chen has rendered them in a washedout , melancholy blue i have no regrets about what i did , he said but i feel that this tragedy could have been avoided maybe if we start talking about this event , we can prevent it from happening again
munich every visit to the lost and found has a story behind it , but not every visitor can remember exactly what that story is kikki friedensburg let out a squeal of unconcealed joy on a recent afternoon at the sight of her scratched gray samsung cellphone , which had slipped from the pocket of her traditional it was , she conceded , hard to say exactly when over the course of a very long evening the phone had disappeared , because the 139pound , 22yearold student drank nearly 10 pints of strong oktoberfest beer i 'd given up , said a visibly relieved ms friedensburg , who found her phone and more important , the phone numbers of all her friends in one of the drawers , carefully segregated by manufacturer , next to the umbrella stand that also held a pair of crutches and a fishing rod waiting to be claimed i just did n't have it in me to start over with everything , she said many festival visitors do not even realize that there is a , run by the city workers who run munich s yearround lost and found and reinforced by temps and interns from other departments but the fundb ro , as it is called in german , is locally famous for what has ended up there over the years , including a prosthetic leg , a wheelchair , a superman costume , handwritten notes by the composer johann sebastian bach and 15 , 000 marks in a soiled pair of lederhosen , eventually returned to the embarrassed owner who abandoned them but as the staff must tell tearyeyed teenage girls every year , they do not keep track of lost boyfriends the police , waiters and partygoers bring in the items discovered under the benches of the cavernous oktoberfest tents , the biggest of which hold up to 10 , 000 singing , inebriated revelers the halfdozen workers at the lost and found , some themselves clad in lederhosen and dirndls , peck away at old typewriters as they fill out the index cards detailing where and when the traditional bavarian janker jacket or brandnew was discovered , doing their best to bring order to disorder oktoberfest proves that germans can , in fact , loosen up and have fun but they are going to have a system in place and prepare themselves for every eventuality first preparedness turned into an unexpectedly significant theme at this year s oktoberfest after were made against the festival , part of an effort by islamist militants to intimidate germans over the country s troop presence in afghanistan ahead of last sunday s election to discourage wouldbe attackers , the munich police increased the number of officers to 700 from 400 and closed more streets around the party but the menacing intrusion of the outside world does not seem to have dampened the moods of visitors organizers estimated that in the first week of the twoweek festival , which ends this sunday , 33 million people , 100 , 000 more than in 2008 , came to sample the products of the city s famous breweries like , and the among them they downed nearly a million gallons of beer oktoberfest , which got its start with the marriage of crown prince ludwig in 1810 , is more than just an exercise in binge drinking and loud renditions of favorite songs like and , somewhat improbably , john denver s children dash from roller coaster to carousel rides and families dig into heaping plates of ox and chicken but the party mood is dominant strapping men in leather shorts with suspenders and brightly checked shirts and women in peasant dresses are ready to forget not just their troubles , but also their wallets and wedding rings , or as stephan weiler did , the keys to his apartment like one of the characters in the recent hit film mr weiler , 28 , a bioengineer , was piecing the events of the previous evening together with the help of photographs on his digital camera as he surveyed the white wall by the entrance studded with hooks bearing over a hundred keys , none of them his , he said he had not given up hope employees said they were bracing for the coming final weekend , when thousands of people would descend on the lost and found to search for their missing objects , most operating under the false impression that it would be their last chance in fact , the staff spends months working with consulates to return passports , banks to find the owners of atm cards and telephone companies to hand over the misplaced cellphones according to maik m ller , deputy director of the lost and found , while only a fifth of all the roughly 5 , 000 objects lost each year are reunited with their owners , the rate of return for cellphones and wallets was between 60 and 70 percent the remainder are auctioned off to help cover expenses or given to charities for sam sealy , 19 , from bellevue , wash , it was relatively easy to prove ownership , since his passport was in his gray and blue backpack an alert staff member actually recognized him from his photograph before he even made it to the counter to inquire mr sealy , who came to oktoberfest while studying abroad in the czech republic , could not believe his luck , that not only his bag had been found but also his passport , ipod , camera and two 100 bills mr sealy had to sign forms and hand over 60 to get them back the fee is 5 percent of the value of the goods up to 725 and 3 percent after but he said it was worth it praising german efficiency , mr sealy said , i'm amazed i went to a lost and found and actually found what was missing that never happens in america the stream of increasingly inebriated visitors as day turns to night can be trying for the staff at times in one episode , a young man , unsteady on his feet , refused to leave but instead mumbled , nein , nein , nein , for several minutes , before resting his head on the counter and switching to his first name , maximilian , maximilian , maximilian , as though it were an incantation to summon his lost wallet an equally distraught and intoxicated young american man was escorted to the police by tobias wenk , 35 , who works full time in the main lost and found , to get him help canceling the credit cards in his lost wallet we finished canceling them , mr wenk said upon returning to his station , and the wallet was in his pocket all along

tell all the truth but tell it slant success in circuit lies too bright for our infirm delight the truth s superb surprise as lightning to the children eased with explanation kind the truth must dazzle gradually or every man be blind i was talking to ricky jay about lying and deception i had an example from the bible , specifically about jacob and his 12 sons \( five of them are depicted by velazquez , above \) ricky interrupted which one \? reuben , simeon , levi , judah , dan , napthali , gad , asher , issachar , zebulon , joseph or benjamin \? uh joseph ricky jay is an actor , bibliophile , historian of magic , arguably the greatest living sleightofhand artist , and a master of the art of deception he seemed to be the perfect person to consult on the relationship between deception and lying after all , it s his business i was telling the story about how the brothers sell joseph into slavery errol morris they take his coat , rip it , smear it with blood , and show it to jacob they don t tell jacob that joseph was eaten by a wild beast jacob makes the false inference himself my theory is that deceit does not require language to lie , you have to make a statement you have to say something in words for it to be a lie but deceit only requires misdirection all it requires is the intent to have someone think something that is different from what you believe ricky jay right , it can be verbal errol morris it can be , but it doesn t have to be whereas lying has to be verbal ricky jay lying has to be verbal do i believe that \? a pause errol morris and it can t be accidental you can accidentally deceive somebody , but you can t accidentally lie to somebody if you re lying to somebody , you have to know you re doing it ricky jay i ve written about verbal deception , for example , the pt barnum sign to the egress to make someone believe something that was other than what was intended even though there was nothing wrong with it it s deceptive the sign is intended make people believe that they are about to visit some exotic animal , rather than heading to the exit i wrote an article about verbal deception in jay s journal on the bonassus the bonassus was presented in 1821 as this extraordinarily exotic creature i ll read just the opening the bonassus , according to contemporary handbills , has been captured as a sixweekold cub deep in the interiors of america blah , blah , blah it was presented to a populous eager for amusement and edification this was in london whose appetite for curiosities both animal and human was insatiable the attraction said , a newly discovered animal , comprising the head and eye of an elephant , the horns of an antelope , a long black beard , the hind parts of a lion , the foreparts of a bison , clovenfooted , has a flowing mane from shoulder to fetlock joint and chews the cud and underneath the line , take him for all in all , we ne er shall look upon his like again shakespeare and i say , using every conceivable method of prevarication , the playbills of the day unabashedly conceal the true identity of the newly discovered bonassus , this new genus that s a quote of the african kingdom had never before been seen in europe he was none other than the american buffalo as for never seeing his like again , in 1821 the buffalo was the most numerous hooffooted quadruped on the face of the earth errol morris perfect ricky jay this is an issue called verbal deception deciphered errol morris you were also telling me about a magician who refuses to lie ricky jay he died recently his name was jerry andrus , and he lived in albany , ore and he always claimed that it was because he lived in oregon that he had to invent his own stuff he really was an original thinker in terms of magic he just died he was almost 90 1  but he wouldn t lie in doing an effect so if he said , i m going to place this card in the middle of the deck , then that s what he did ricky picked up a deck of cards and proceeded to offer an impressive display of legerdemain if i say to you , i m going to take this card , whatever it is , the king of clubs , and you can see that i m going to push that , right , into the center of the deck ok , you saw me do that clearly \? errol morris yes ricky jay and yet , the king of clubs is right here it is sitting at the top of the deck so i truly did not push it into the center of the deck i made you think that i pushed it into the center of the deck but i didn t push that card into the center of the deck and then show it to you on the top of the deck errol morris you may not be lying , but you re still deceiving me ricky jay right , i m absolutely deceiving you he would also deceive you he might go so far as to say , it may appear as though i m putting the card in the center of the deck but he would never say , i am putting the card in the center of the deck he would not lie errol morris but doesn t that alert people to the fact that they are being deceived \? doesn t that make it more difficult to perform the trick \? ricky jay yes ! it does make it more difficult , but that s just the kind of guy he was so he would never say , i m dealing the king of clubs on the table , and deal the bottom card and not the king of clubs he would not lie he was an enormously principled fellow errol morris but do you have a problem lying \? ricky jay not only do i lie , i take real pleasure in lying , in the transmission of magic effects it s creative , how you do it i could , indeed , put the king of clubs in the center of the deck so in this case , i want you to see that the king of clubs is in the center of the deck all right \? that s not a lie and yet the king is now on top i don t think this was in his repertoire but in that effect i did not lie to you at all so that s kind of fascinating errol morris i wonder if this bears out what i was saying before , the difference between a lie and a deception , that he would not allow himself a verbal lie ricky jay but he would still absolutely deceive you errol morris but not lie ricky jay you could wonder whether i m lying to you now , about those two things and how they differ , because you don t know because i know that you can t follow the sleight of hand i m doing to absolutely know for certain and i m not going to expose the method to show you that , but as your friend , i m going to tell you that nothing about this was a lie everything i said in the transmission of these two effects was true but in magic , there is magician to magician lying and obfuscation to obfuscate the reconstruction of the effect when a magician is fooled by another magician doing magic in my career that s not been the major passion , but it s been the passion of a number of my mentors the crowning achievement for them would be to create magic good enough to fool other magicians for me , the most exciting thing is to create good magic that s entertaining for an audience , and it would be lovely if a magician was fooled as well but it s an entertainment art dai vernon , the greatest sleight of hand figure in the history of the art , rarely performed but he invented magic and had an enormous influence on the whole range of sleight of hand and so often the magic he was doing was to fool other magicians you don t want the magicians to be able to reconstruct it so in the course of it , the other magician is not only being fooled by the physical deception , but made to think that something might have happened which did not happen , and if you thought that , you could never reconstruct how the effect was done errol morris so there s a misdirection followed by a lie ricky jay in any order but you re right , the lie part is verbal you re saying , remember , you shuffled the cards remember , you divided the deck and in this list of things you re doing , one of them may be untrue you may be lying ah , i did shuffle the cards i did this but i didn t do that you re reinforcing something that never happened errol morris a deception and a lie ricky jay deception is one of the things that i m interested in it s a major component of my work if someone said you had to sum up your interests in life in one word , the word would probably be deception i think it encompasses more things i m interested in than any other single word i can think of brindemour s illusion of levitating a man a 17th century engraving of a twoheaded archer , which portrays him as a legitimate human anomaly that clearly can not and did not exist right \?

location stillwater , okla nickname cowboys 2008 countdown ranking  no 38  what i said in last year s preview  the schedule at least out of conference gives the cowboys a bit of a break this fall , so all indications are that oklahoma state will improve upon its string of sevenwin seasons when it comes to big 12 play , is there any reason to think oklahoma state will finish worse than the 44 mark they posted a season ago \? in which area have the cowboys gotten worse \? the defense may have trouble with texas tech and oklahoma , but who won t \? i don t think the cowboys are a favorite for the big 12 crown , but i predict an 84 regular season , 53 in the big 12 postseason reranking no 18 2008 record and recap \( 94 , 53 \) oklahoma state entered its oct 25 road date with texas with a 70 record and a no 6 ranking nationally , its highest spot in the ap poll since 1985 so the cowboys lost that game \( narrowly \) , as well as three others over its last five , but the program has clearly turned a corner after scuffling in its efforts to crack the sevenwin mark under coach mike gundy much of this improvement came from a spectacular offense , even by big 12 standards some may malign gundy s game day approach which often includes dereliction of his defensive duties \( such as they are \) but it s clearly working the cowboys finished in the top 10 nationally in scoring offense \( 408 points per game \) , total offense \( 4877 yards per game \) , rushing offense \( 2455 per game \) and passing efficiency \( 1647 over all rating \) this attack overshadowed a poor defensive effort , which conversely saw the cowboys rank no higher than 76th in scoring , total defense and pass defense for a reason why osu fell to the top teams on its schedule thenno 1 texas , no 2 texas tech and no 3 oklahoma look no further than the defensive side of the ball yes , oklahoma state has very clearly turned a corner unfortunately , if it cannot begin to get stops , it may very well hit a dead end high point the 70 start , though only one win came over a ranked opponent by 2823 at thenno 3 missouri oklahoma state took care of business against the lesser teams on its schedule \( beating texas am and baylor by 28 , iowa state by 32 \) , as well as beat two pretty solid teams in houston and troy during nonconference action low point four losses , three to teams thenranked in the top three in the nation the game in austin was the closest , a 2824 defeat that saw oklahoma state draw within that final fourpoint margin with roughly 12 minutes to go but fail to score again the rest of the way the losses became progressively more onesided as the regular season progressed by 5620 to texas tech and by 6141 to oklahoma tidbit for the last time , a foreign language preview \( i think i ve said this before \) gundy is one of 15 coaches in the fbs to currently serve at his alma mater i won t ask you to name those coaching at nonbcs conference schools \( air force s troy calhoun , colorado state s steve fairchild , marshall s mark snyder and nevada s chris ault \) , but i will ask you to name the ten other coaches at major programs this is the last chance , people there are only 14 teams remaining , so hopefully your favorite is still on the board as always , the first to correctly answer the question wins the opportunity to write a 100word preview of his or her favorite university to be included in the countdown s larger preview it must be in a foreign language , however former players in the nfl 16 te billy bajema \( st louis rams \) , fb julius

division head coach mike gundy \( oklahoma state 90 \) , 2723 after four seasons with the cowboys the program has made clear and steady progress over this span , going from 17 in big 12 play in 2005 to 35 in 2006 , 44 in 2007 and 53 a season ago the cowboys had been mired in a string of two consecutive sevenwin seasons from 20067 , when it had showed flashes of brilliance but remained unable to beat the toprated teams on its schedule that did not completely change last fall osu did defeat one top five team though it was obvious that the cowboys had made great strides since the 2007 season the future looks even brighter gundy was a fouryear starting quarterback for the cowboys \( 198689 \) , and remains the most successful \( backtoback 10win seasons in 198788 \) and productive quarterback in team history he still holds the program record for career passing yards \( 7 , 997 \) , and ranks second alltime in touchdown passes \( 54 \) and total offense \( 7 , 749 \) gundy entered the coaching ranks immediately after his graduation , taking on the oklahoma state receivers coach job , skipping the normal graduate assistant apprenticeship that usually accompanies the move into fulltime coaching he remained at his alma mater through 1995 , moving up to the quarterbacks coach \( 199193 , 1995 \) and offensive coordinator \( 1994 \) , before spending one year at baylor \( quarterbacks \) and four more at maryland \( receivers from 199798 , quarterbacks from 19992000 \) he returned to his alma mater in 2001 as les miles s offensive coordinator , a position he held through the 2004 season he was promoted after miles left for lsu after experiencing a 37822 record as an assistant from 19902000 , gundy has gone 4740 as both an assistant and head coach since coming back to stillwater in 2001 with his familiarity with the program and his growing success as the head coach , gundy is a good fit with the cowboys tidbit \( coaching edition \) the biggest addition to the oklahoma state program is not an incoming recruit , but defensive coordinator bill young the former usc , ohio state and kansas coordinator spent the 2008 season with miami , where he molded a very young hurricane unit into one of the best groups in the acc he returns to his alma mater \( where he also spent time as an assistant \) as a replacement for tim beckman , who left after two seasons in stillwater to take the head coach position at toledo no offense to beckman , who did a good enough job to earn an fbs head coaching job , but young is an upgrade at defensive coordinator returning starters 14 \( 8 offense , 6 defense \) key losses the biggest loss on offense is tight end brandon pettigrew , one of the nation s finest at the position he s likely also the best tight end in school history pettigrew was a classic college tight end , a tremendous passcatcher who doubled as a tough , physical run blocker in an age when the position is trending towards merely larger wide receivers his numbers as a senior 42 receptions for 472 yards may not have been jawdropping , but anyone who saw osu play knew that pettigrew could have easily made double that many grabs he is not the only receiving option lost off last year s team osu must also replace damian davis \( 19 catches for 414 yards \) and bo bowling \( 10 for 200 \) , the team s fourth and fifthleading receivers , respectively their departure opens up two spots at wideout two starters are lost up front center david washington and right guard steve denning washington made a stellar return to the starting lineup after missing all but three games of 2007 due to injury , earning secondteam allconference honors in starting all 13 games he started every game of his career but the ten he missed as a junior after suffering a broken leg denning was a twoyear starter on the interior of the cowboy offensive line five more starters , three from the secondary , are lost off the underwhelming oklahoma state defense those three starters from the defensive backfield , cornerback jacob lacey and safeties ricky price and quinton moore , were often victimized by opposing offenses , though you could certainly say the same about the entire osu secondary not that the trio didn t give their all price , for example , finished his final season with 81 tackles \( 45 for loss \) , 2 sacks , an interception and a teambest three fumble recoveries lacey added a pair of interceptions , tying for the team lead , while adding a teamleading 14 pass breakups however , by and large , the secondary was what prevented oklahoma state s quest for a conference title last fall perhaps this year s starting quartet will fare better than its 2008 version the cowboys also face two open spots on the interior of the defensive line following the departure of tackles tonga tea \( sounds delicious i think i used this joke last year \) and jeray chatham tea , a former juco allamerican , started in each of his two seasons in stillwater , earning honorable mention allbig 12 honors as a senior chatham also received honorable mention accolades last fall despite missing two starts due to injury players to watch oklahoma state s trio of offensive skill players is unparalleled in the fbs yes , another team might have a better quarterback , running back or receiver \( perhaps not the last \) , but none have such a talented combination the soontobe most prolific passer in school history and a pair of allamericans in the backfield and out wide zac robinson s the quarterback , a senior , and only the big 12 s stacked corps of signal callers prevents him from being a household name perhaps he should be one anyway last fall , robinson finished fifth in the fbs with a 1665 passer rating thanks to his sterling 2510 touchdown to interception ratio and 650 percent completion percentage he threw for 3 , 064 yards while adding another 562 yards and 8 scores on the ground , making him one of the nation s most capable dualthreat quarterbacks as if robinson wasn t underrated enough , the lack of publicity for his running back , the junior kendall hunter , is downright criminal how could a firstteam allamerican go largely unnoticed on the national stage \? all hunter did last fall , his first as the starter , was rush for 1 , 555 yards and 16 scores , ripping off sevenyard totes seemingly each time his number was called he s a good one , a player certainly worthy of continuing oklahoma state s fine history of standout running backs perhaps , with another strong season , he ll hear his name bandied about outside the big 12 and that brings us to dez bryant , the allamerican wide receiver i ve got bryant as a genuine heisman contender , just like michael crabtree before him , because of his topnotch ability as a passcatcher and his gamechanging ability in the return game while he had an immediate impact as a freshman \( 43 receptions for 622 yards \) , bryant was nothing short of outstanding last fall 87 grabs for 1 , 430 yards and 19 scores he added 179 yards per punt return with two touchdowns , and was named the big 12 special teams player of the year all in all , a monster talent with offthecharts potential while his teammates star in the highlight reels , the senior left tackle russell okung holds together a solid offensive line okung is beyond solid , however he s an allamerican talent and , perhaps , the best left tackle in college football and you wonder why the osu offense gets so much respect \? okung s the glue of the line , where he s joined by the senior right tackle brady bond and the senior center andrew lewis , who moves inside from guard to replace washington lewis played center in 2007 after washington s seasonending injury the situation is a little less clear at guard , where the sophomores jonathan rush and nick martinez will battle on the left side and the senior noah franklin attempts to hold off the highlytouted juco transfer anthony morgan on the right if this is not the best offense in the fbs , it s certainly in the top five if that s the case , all the defense needs to do is show up , right \? well , as we learned last season , that won t be good enough osu will need to be better on this side of the ball , and i m not entirely sure if we ll see a significantly improved unit in 2009 \( young s arrival will help \) the strength will be at linebacker , where all three starters return from a season ago two of those cowboys outside linebackers andre sexton and patrick lavine are fouryear starters sexton , who starts on the strongside , led the cowboys with 100 stops last fall , adding a sack and an interception lavine finished fourth with 70 tackles \( 55 for loss \) , but one of this pair has led the team in total tackles in each of the last three seasons they ll again be called upon to lead this defense the senior orie lemon stepped into a starting role in the middle last fall , making 90 tackles \( 4 for loss \) the key to the entire defense will be getting a better pass rush , as the cowboys combined to post only 15 sacks a season ago much attention should be paid to the junior end ugo chinasa , who led the team with 85 tackles for loss he ll man one starting end spot , but increased production will need to come from the sophomores richetti jones who arrived with enormous billing and jamie blatnick \( as of now the second starter \) and the senior jeremiah price , who led the team with three sacks in an attempt to replace its departed starters at tackle , osu chose to move the senior derek burton inside from end , where he made 23 stops \( 55 for loss \) last fall the senior cornerback parrish cox \( i can t believe he s already a senior \) is the lone returning starter in the secondary , and he ll be asked to cover the opposition s top receiving target there is some returning experience , however , such as the senior corner terrance anderson , who will ascend from his nickel back spot into a starting role the senior maurice gray , a former juco transfer , is another option at cornerback position \( s \) to watch could i go with the entire defense \? yes , the unit itself is a concern , but let s focus at safety , the only group without any starters from a season ago the lack of experience is an issue , though oklahoma state does have the luxury of inserting two athletic , talented underclassmen the first is the sophomore victor johnson , widely expected to earn the starting nod at strong safety he was used as a reserve during his debut season , playing in certain packages and as a third safety behind price and tj bell though not given a great amount of time to make his mark , johnson certainly didn t disappoint as a rookie , and has played well enough in the spring and through early fall practice to have a solid grasp upon the position he has the talent to represent an upgrade over his predecessor , but johnson lacks the game experience to truly tell how well his sophomore season will play out the senior lucien antoine , a former juco transfer , is the favorite to take over at free safety he was poised to play a large role last fall perhaps even as the starter before suffering a seasonending injury during the second game of the season now fully recovered , osu hopes antoine s bighitting ability will give the secondary the intimidating presence it will need to combat the explosive passing offenses of the big 12 the sophomore johnny thomas , who has better speed than antoine but is not quite the tackler , will be his reserve markelle martin , another sophomore , entered the fall as the backup at strong safety but may also see snaps at cornerback 2009 schedule  sept 5 georgia sept 12 houston sept 19 rice sept 26 grambling state oct 10 texas am oct

texas and oklahoma are for a shot at the national title season breakdown prediction it s truly unfortunate that a team as offensively skilled as oklahoma state clearly remains the thirdbest team in its own division to be fair , ranking third in the big 12 south is nothing to be ashamed of , as both texas and oklahoma are national title favorites in addition , despite coming in behind that pair in the south the cowboys are the thirdbest team in the superb big 12 , which makes them an easy pick for top 15 status in the fbs but i can t shake the feeling that even with this tremendous offense , oklahoma state will struggle increasing upon its win total from a season ago not that there s truly anything wrong with that the cowboys are only one year removed from ending a frustrating string of sevenwin finishes , and a 62 finish in big 12 action would represent the program s best conference record since the league s formation so here s my prediction 93 , 62 in the big 12 , with losses to georgia , texas and oklahoma for those keeping track at home , that means the cowboys would lose to three teams ranked in the countdown s top 14 teams minus texas tech , i m convinced oklahoma state will blow the doors off the rest of its schedule dream season the offense simply cannot be stopped while the defense is not as strong , it does enough to propel the cowboys to a big 12 south title and a shot against nebraska in the conference championship game nightmare season a 75 regular season finish , with this offense , raises concerns about oklahoma state s longterm ability to challenge texas

kellen clemens was in a tough spot today he knows the score mark sanchez will be the starter unless he falls on his face in training camp and in the preseason and he gave the correct political answers in an interview with reporters he also touched on other topics , so here s the transcript , courtesy of the jets media relations department on the jets draft picks i am excited about all of them fortunately i d met mark \( sanchez \) prior to the draft he s a great dude he s obviously a very talented quarterback i think it will be a good working relationship between he and i i will certainly try to be as helpful to him as chad \( pennington \) was to me it will be good i have been told right now that it s an open competition and the best player will play we ll compete , and keep doing what we ve been doing on whether he wonders about his opportunity with the jets my opportunity , it s right now we ve got a great football team great coaches are in place in speaking with coach ryan , it s an open competition i m going to get a fair shot at the starting job that s everything you can ask for \( is \) to have a chance to come in and compete for a starting spot on a team you look around this is not a team that is rebuilding we ve got some talent this is a great opportunity regardless of who i am competing against on whether the opportunity changes with the jets drafting mark sanchez there s some weight that goes along with being the number five pick everybody knows that again , i go back to what coach said , and i think he s said it publicly it s an open competition and the best player is going to play regardless of all the other businessside of things , the best player is going to play that s all i m hoping for that s all i d ever ask for and we ll just keep going on having the same agent as sanchez i thought about that it was something that i even thought about prior to the draft , something my wife and my family considered , because dave \( dunn \) has a lot of quarterbacks it s not something that is concerning \( to me \) at this point i feel very confident in him , and mark does as well they are going to handle their business between those two , and dave and i will handle our business between he and i , and i am confident there won t be any conflicts of interest on his approach for me , it comes down to a simple choice i can get mad or frustrated or whatever , or i can get better i am choosing to get better i am going to keep working the beautiful thing about my approach \( is that it \) has been the same since dec 29 when the season ended i laid out my approach , and my plan about how i am going to get better , and that carried me through the first minicamp , through otas it s shortterm and it s longterm so it doesn t matter much if it s brett ratliff or mark sanchez , the beautiful thing when you are competing with yourself \( is \) it doesn t matter who the other guy is there is all that other stuff , but it s not going to help me get better it s not going to help me be a major contributor on a team whose goal is to be world champions at the end of the year so it s outofmind i don t worry about it on competing against mark sanchez instead of brett ratliff he s a totally different guy but it is the same competition , because it s an open competition and the best player is going to play that s all i would hope for or ask for from coach ryan and that s what he said so we just continue to progress on whether he watched the draft i did not watch the draft my folks were in town we were out running errands , hanging out i got a phone call the first phone call was from my agent , who is also mark s agent he said hey , are you watching \? do you know what s going on \? i said , no he said , the jets just traded up to pick sanchez it was actually right as i walked in the door so we flipped on the tv and watched it for 10 or 15 minutes just to see what happened i m a guy who it takes a while for things to really set in so first i was just like , wow we ve got players coming in , we ve got three players going out it took a while for it to set in on what it meant then you reset your mind on what you have to get done and just go forward on whether he assumed the jets would draft a quarterback i assumed because we only had three \( quarterbacks \) on the roster you want an extra guy to go into training camp \( with \) because it s a lot of stress on your arm so i assumed we were going to take one at some point but as far as communication between \( the jets front office \) and i , there is a lot of stuff that comes up draft day spurofthemoment they can t give you any indication of what they are going to do there was not any communication of what they were planning on doing \( before the draft \) and i didn t ask either on when he heard from mike tannenbaum and rex ryan immediately after \( the pick \) i was on the phone with dave \( dunn \) , and got a callwaiting from both mike and rex on conference call they said , hey , this is what we did just reiterated that is was still an open competition and the best player is going to play they had other things to get back to for the day , so they went on brett favre i have seen him on espn but i haven t talked to him recently he s a competitor he loves to play what he s going to do with it i don t know i don t want to speculate what s going on there he s as competitive a person as i ve ever met so i am sure that has something to do with it on whether he can identify with current minnesota quarterbacks sage rosenfels and tavaris jackson i know what they are going through a little bit on rex ryan saying that he has a good idea how the quarterback competition will go i take that literally he s got an idea on who he thinks is going to start i don t know who that is i hope it s me on being aware of the fans expectations of mark sanchez i d be lying if i said i am not aware of that he s the no 5 pick , everybody is excited to see him play , to see what he can do but again , if it s not going to help me , if it s not going to help me move forward , i am not worried about i am going to do the best i can to not think about it and keep working on \( what i can control \) on his communication with mark sanchez mark called me that night \( of the draft \) which meant a lot that s a really classy thing for that kid to do we had a five or 10minute conversation about things going forward that s our only correspondence so far talk about getting a competitive relationship off on the right foot that was a neat thing that he did he just said , hey kellen , this is mark sanchez , i just want to say hello i didn t know the number and i answered it it kind of surprised me at first i said , welcome to the jets family we had a chance to meet prior to this i just said , we re competing and it s going to be fun i just want you to know i will do anything i can to help you out and if you have any questions i ll try to do the same for you as chad did for me on how his family and friends handle his situation they are learning , much like my wife and i did earlier the best approach , just for their sanity , is to block it out it s probably harder on our family and friends because they have less control over it than we do i don t have much but i have a little bit and they have none so it may be a little harder on them on gaining confidence from previous situations such as drew brees in san diego you go back to the drew brees example they drafted phillip \( rivers \) \( fourth \) after the trade it worked out for drew sometimes when things come up in this business , it s so unstable , if you will , you have to have some faith that god s got a plan out there sometimes hindsight will tell you if it s a good thing or a bad thing the best thing for me is from a faith standpoint this whole thing has boosted my life in that area on brian schottenheimer being on that staff with brees and rivers coach schottenheimer has a lot of respect for drew and the things that he has done , so we ve talked a lot about drew since the day he got here that situation hasn t specifically come up but it may in the future on thinking beyond this year i d be lying if i said i don t think that mark being here changes things there is a reality to this business but again , i go back to my approach i am in the fourth year of a fouryear deal i love my teammates , my coaches , this area i am going out this year and my expectations haven t changed since the draft i expect to be under center opening day in houston is it longterm \? what is longterm in the nfl \?
last week , hofstra s president , stuart rabinowitz , announced the university was dropping its 72yearold football program , one that sent wayne chrebet , marques colston and a handful of others to the nfl this followed northeastern s decision to do likewise last month , and sparks a larger debate about the state of athletic departments at lowerprofile division i universities and what the future may bring hofstra athletic director jack hayes sat down with the quad s jack styczynski this week to discuss the situation at his university and what may be on the horizon how would you describe the state of hofstra athletics following last week s announcement \? the state of the department is strong it s as healthy as ever , knowing that we also have this issue that we are working through , that we are trying to help the members of the team , some of which will stay at hofstra we re trying to help them through that and some of which will want to continue playing we re trying to help them through that transition of transferring to another institution in terms of the impact on our other sports , i don t see one i see us continuing to move forward and remaining as competitive as we can be and continuing to try to win and win the right way put us in the room last thursday when you had to break the news to coach dave cohen and the players i spoke to coach cohen at 9 o clock , right in here \( hayes office \) , and then about 9 15 or 20 past nine , by going to the assistant coaches , we set up a meeting at 10 o clock with the team i would say we probably had 55 to 60 of the 84 team members they were in class they got the message quickly they didn t know what it was about i think those who could get there , got there they definitely didn t know what it was about it was the most difficult conversation i ve ever had in this business and one that i hope i don t ever have to have again disappointment frustration anger , on their parts rightly so they didn t see it coming so it was tough it was very tough since then , i ve had an opportunity to meet with several of them individually , and those conversations have been positive not in the sense that they understand it any better but that they ve started to move forward some may stay at hofstra some have already begun speaking with coaches at other schools , and we re trying to figure out how we can help them and what s in their best interest i heard you say on wrhu that you had the opportunity to provide information during the twoyear board of trustees study that resulted in the decision did you also have an opportunity to advocate for keeping football \? there were many questions asked of me everything from the makeup of the team in terms of students who were from new york , students who were not from new york , attendance figures , financial figures in terms of the cost of operating the football program , contributions and how contributions and ticket sales offset cost we looked at conference affiliation and explored with the caa s \( colonial athletic association \) understanding , was there a football option that was less costly \? all those things did come into play those were all things that were discussed at length during that process was there any talk about any specific league that might be more cost effective \? in the press conference , it was asked if we pursued the pioneer league it s a nonscholarship league , but almost every game requires a flight and the idea of competing against the best programs in the country as we have the opportunity to do in some of our other sports it just didn t seem to be the right way to go so let s say , the patriot league the patriot league , yeah , that was another one that we had some conversations it was more information gathering from the patriot league about what do those programs offer in terms of funding to see if that was an opportunity to be competitive very exploratory conversations , but did not go any further than that i know there s no easy way to cut ties with a football team , but was there any idea of how this may have been handled differently \? giving the program any kind of advance notice that this might be possible , or even more radically , saying , ok , we ll let our current scholarship players finish , and then we ll stop the program , or anything of that nature \? yeah , we looked at all that in all these decisions , everything can be analyzed after the fact i understand that if you re out publicly saying that you may drop a program , i think it s an unbelievable distraction to the team and to the coaching staff , and i m not quite sure how many people would stay , and i m not quite sure how many people would come to school here if you tried to finish out a year knowing that that was happening , or a class , you d never get anybody to come in after that so you d have to have walkons yes , and you d have difficulty putting a schedule together against opponents who d know that you would not be able to return that game down the road there were so many of those factors that would have made it difficult and in terms of putting that out , part of going through the process was not knowing if that decision would be made anyway , so i think it was impossible to carry on with our daytoday operation if that was something that was known to the public and known to potential recruits and known to current team members that it was being explored i ve heard a couple of things in the past week that i m not really sure if they jibe first , that the football decision was based largely on a cost benefit analysis , and second , that none of hofstra s other 17 sports are in danger of being cut we both know that a school of this size or really any size only needs 14 sports to remain a division i school so why would hofstra or any other school that was concerned with cost benefit not say , ok , let s just keep the minimum to stay division i \? in other words , in your case , cut down from 17 to 14 the best 14 as the president made clear , this was a reallocation of resources it wasn t an economic crisis i think it would give the impression if more and more programs were cut , that maybe there was a crisis , and that wasn t the case at all certainly , the program that was ultimately looked at was the one that was the most expensive and the one that provided the most resources to be utilized for other areas of the institution it was made clear that day in the press conference and then in a meeting with the president and the rest of the athletic department following that , that this wasn t phase one of reductions or reallocations it was the decision that was made after two years so the other programs , the other 17 , remain intact so it would be accurate to say that from a cost benefit analysis standpoint , none of the programs other than football failed \? well , i think that when you look at the decision , it wasn t based solely on attendance , it wasn t based solely on the cost and it wasn t based solely on the level of competition when you start to put all those things together , then that was the program that was looked at so if another sport is looked at and one were to say , well , they re not nationally competitive , well , they may not be nationally competitive right now , but they re also a sport that s relatively inexpensive to operate or this sport , their attendance figure may not be the 4 , 200 that football was , but it may not be as expensive to operate so the combination of those different aspects sure , some of those programs that remain in the 17 may not have had the attendance or might not have been able to compete against the best programs in the country in their sport , but a lot of them do and all of them were not as expensive we ve talked about conferences pioneer league , patriot league , etc i ve heard some interviews with both basketball coach tom pecora and president rabinowitz recently on wfan where mike francesa was advocating , you ve got to get out of the caa and neither one of them pecora or rabinowitz seemed to say , no , no , you re wrong so i m kind of getting the impression at least they re open to it if not advocating it what s your opinion on the whole conference situation \? i think if you look at hofstra s time in the caa , it would be hard to argue that our programs haven t gotten more competitive now what does that mean \? in the basketball sense , if you re more competitive but in a more competitive league , it may not translate , or at least it hasn t translated yet to a conference championship or an ncaa tournament appearance , but we are very competitive in this conference and i think the conference has elevated many of our sports to the point where we can get atlarge bids to ncaa tournaments , and when we ve gone to ncaa tournaments , we ve had better seeds than we ve had in the america east , our previous affiliation what does that mean \? well , it s allowed us many times to be in a game in the first round that you can win i am well aware that measure is much more visible when it happens in basketball , and it will it will happen in basketball , and i think we would also here say that in 2006 , it should have we should have been in the ncaa tournament and tom knows that , president rabinowitz knows that , i know that and i think most people know that we all know the story when george mason goes to the final four \( hofstra had beaten george mason both times the teams played \) and we beat nebraska and st joe s \( in the nit \) , there s some people that know that a mistake was made what can we do about that \? nothing but move on but by being one of those teams that did not win the conference tournament in a competitive league , one , we should have been in , and two , when we weren t we got a home game in the nit against a team from the big 12 so there certainly were some benefits from being in the position we were in , and if we go through our other sports , you can see where when we ve won conference championships , we have gotten in with a seed that s allowed us to be very competitive to win many of those first round games you mentioned basketball and that s the highestprofile sport hypothetically , if you had a choice of getting to several ncaa tournaments over a 10year period or maybe getting to one with a better seed , what would you prefer \? i don t know it s hard to answer that because if you went with a better seed and actually advanced , it s quite a story although 14 and 15 seeds occasionally win , and hofstra as a 13 came close once right , that s an interesting one i think you d probably want to live through three or four times going , and one time going , but advancing and when i say advancing , i mean beyond even the first round , but i don t know sometimes teams go and i ve been fortunate to be at institutions that have , if you play in that noon game on thursday , somebody s out of that tournament fairly quick not to say that wasn t still a great experience for that team , that coaching staff , that student body and that school , but somebody else may not go as often and win a few games and last beyond that first weekend , it s quite an experience also i don t know last but not least , northeastern and hofstra within a matter of weeks both dropped football can you envision more schools following suit \? is it the beginning of a trend \? i don t know it certainly is coincidental that the two did it 10 days apart hofstra s decision wasn t based on what northeastern did it just happened to come 10 days later i would imagine there are a lot of schools looking at what hofstra did or what northeastern did the interesting thing for those schools that look into that is that the two schools did it for different reasons so it may provide more discussion for all those schools on where they stand what can you take from the northeastern situation that s applicable to this school or what can you take from the hofstra one that s applicable to that school \? i would imagine so
good lighting is even more necessary onstage than it is in life but a few fortunate actors require little in the way of flattering illumination instead of reflecting light , their faces seem to emit it charlayne woodard is among them i do n't want to steal any credit from her lighting designer , geoff korf , but in her latest solo performance , the night watcher , ms woodard roams the stage of the 59e59 theaters like a human searchlight , casting a permanent glow that reaches all the way to the back rows perhaps a porch light is a better analogy , for ms woodard is a performer as warm and inviting as she is luminous in the night watcher , presented by primary stages , she tells tales of her many brushes with nearmotherhood , inflecting each with the mixture of exuberant feeling and sly humor that have marked her three previous autobiographical shows \( you might think ms woodard would be running dry of stories by now , but she seems to be a woman who collects colorful experience the way the rest of us pile up cans and bottles for the recycling bin \) a phone call from a certain emmy awardwinning , oscarnominated actress kicks off ms woodard s recollections of the various forms of surrogate motherhood \( none of an actual biological kind \) that have warmed , informed , illuminated and occasionally darkened her life ms woodard amusingly confesses that she was hoping the actress in question was passing along a part she had rejected , but in fact she had something else to offer a baby dizzy fantasies of the excitements of adopting what an adventure ! abruptly fizzle when ms woodard s husband , harris , reminds her that the circumstances of their life would not comfortably accommodate a child , and that in any case childrearing is not an enterprise to be embarked upon as if it were a thrilling new lark but ms woodard s friends and family find in her an enthusiastic and amiable aunt , godmother and general confidante a welloff couple in los angeles recruit her as godmother to their daughter , indira , an arrangement that satisfies all parties until indira turns to her godmother in distress when she finds herself in serious trouble in adolescence this does not please her mother ms woodard gives stern lessons in morals and manners when her inlaws' adopted daughter , a cheeky 11yearold , recoils at the idea of hanging out with a whole bunch of black people when her aunt points out , stupefied , that both of them are in fact black , the little dear responds i'm not black ! i'm mixed race her aunt s rejoinder to that is one of the evening s tarter moments another is her own mother s dismayed reaction to ms woodard s announcement that she has finally decided to adopt a new puppy after the death of her beloved maltese terrier , max i'm so disappointed in you and harris , her mother scolds the world is full of kids who need some real attention , and you up at the doggie boutique all the other stars are adopting kids black kids even but as the stories in the night watcher illustrate , ms woodard learns through fruitful and sometimes traumatic experience that parttime mothering , which is to say playing the doting , helpful and occasionally demanding aunt or godmother , is both a consuming interest and sometimes a desperate necessity in the second act of the show , the stories turn a little darker , as ms woodard tells of a friend s 15yearold daughter s sexual encounters with a relative and her nephew s trouble with insecurity and schoolyard harassment ms woodard moves among the personalities in her stories with an ease born of experience , changing up the many colors in her rich voice and using her elegant limbs to add filigreed physical detail to the various portraits actors impersonating children is a stage convention that i tend to endure with gritted teeth and a pained smile , but ms woodard does it more fluidly and naturally than most she has a whole brood of inner children panting to get out , it would seem directed with sensitivity by , ms woodard s collaborator on all of her previous solo forays , the night watcher feels a little padded here and there the stories of ms woodard s relationships with her own aunts feel unnecessary , for instance and the culminating story , in which she encounters an african man on the subway who admonishes her for not having her own children , almost feels too good to be true it allows ms woodard to conclude the show with a rousing peroration defending her right to nonmotherhood , and attesting to the value of taking care of all the world s children this feels both selfrighteous and unnecessary the show itself has made the point beautifully but ms woodard punctures her own piety with a joke after concluding her eloquent speech to the subway scold , she relates , i looked up and realized i was on the wrong train a solo show written and performed by charlayne woodard directed by daniel sullivan sets by charlie corcoran and thomas lynch costumes by jess goldstein lighting by geoff korf music and sound by obadiah eaves projection design by tal yarden associate artistic director , michelle bossy presented by primary stages , casey childs , executive producer andrew leynse , artistic director elliot fox , managing director at the 59e59 theaters , 59 east 59th street , manhattan \( 212 \) 2794200 or through oct 31 running time 2 hours
moscow sergei bagapsh wants to make it perfectly clear is not now , and will not become , part of the russian federation almost five years after being elected president of the breakaway georgian territory , mr bagapsh owes an enormous debt to , his northern neighbor russia went to war last august to support abkhazia s and south ossetia s claims to independence from georgia , and the kremlin recognized both territories as sovereign nations , fulfilling the wish that has driven separatists through two decades of war and privation no other country , he said , has shown any concern for the abkhaz people but his gratitude is not without limits with russian border guards taking up longterm positions on abkhazia s periphery and russian investors eager to buy up beachfront property , mr bagapsh said abkhaz independence remained a central worry he also said he had been forced to push back on several occasions when russian partners asked too high a price for their assistance a small country is obliged to defend its statehood , he said , in an interview in moscow this is our main question now that we should never again experience the kind of assimilation that georgia forced on us last summer , after russia threw its weight behind separatist governments in south ossetia and abkhazia , it was easy to conflate the two enclaves but they are fundamentally different in south ossetia , a landlocked valley whose prewar population was 70 , 000 , many people long to unite with ethnic kinfolk within russia , which they see as the only way to guarantee permanent military and financial support abkhazia , by contrast , is a piece of land so desirable that its residents compare it to a beautiful woman , with the protective jealousy that implies it has an ethnically distinct population as well as a potentially abundant source of income before the collapse of the soviet union , two million tourists vacationed there every year and its leaders pride themselves on stubbornly resisting the rule of larger nations most recently georgia , but before that the soviet union and the russian empire mr himself is testimony to that resistance when he ran for president in 2004 , russian consultants threw their weight behind his opponent , raul khajimba , a former agent with the russian fsb security force billboards showed mr khajimba with vladimir v putin , then russia s president russian pop stars held free concerts in his honor , and vladimir v zhirinovsky , a nationalist russian politician , warned voters that if they did not back mr khajimba , russia could cut off their pensions and stop the import of abkhaz tangerines , severing an economic lifeline but to the shock of strategists in moscow , the effort backfired mr bagapsh , an energy tycoon , won more than 50 percent of the vote russia challenged the results and imposed a blockade , so that much of that year s citrus crop rotted in trucks at the border but mr bagapsh simply moved into the presidential headquarters and set about negotiating , finally forming a coalition government with mr khajimba almost five years later , mr bagapsh said there was no bad blood over the election i understood that it was politics , and it would pass , and i was right , he said all the people who swore at me , said i was a mafioso and a bandit and so forth today , they are my friends political observers say the episode revealed much about mr bagapsh , 60 , whose affable manner masks a chess player s calculation a former leader in the sovietera komsomol communist youth wing , he married into a large georgian family and has remained close to his inlaws in tbilisi , georgia s capital , even as war split the country there may be more intelligent candidates in abkhazia , said paata zakareishvili , a georgian political analyst , but none with mr bagapsh s political instincts he is able to maneuver and reach the goal , mr zakareishvili said he always tries to take the right and careful steps he measures a hundred times and then he cuts like his counterpart in south ossetia , eduard kokoity , mr bagapsh has cemented his government s ties to russia with a series of treaties russia now has 49year leases on a naval base at ochamchire and an air base at gudauta , and about 800 russian border guards patrol abkhazia s boundary but he has also complained loudly when he felt abkhaz interests were ignored the clearest example came in december , when the russian state energy company interrao announced an agreement with georgia to jointly operate the inguri hydropower plant , which straddles abkhaz and georgian territory mr bagapsh reacted angrily , telling the state news agency that the plant belongs to us , and no agreements or accords signed behind our back and without due consideration of our interests will have any force mr bagapsh said he insisted on renegotiating the deal with interrao , which he said had a very big desire to buy everything and privatize everything since then , he said , he has had to rebuff efforts to privatize important assets , offering russian partners 5 or 10year leases instead as far as energy is concerned , they wanted to privatize practically everything in abkhazia , he said we did not agree to this variant the same thing happened with sukhumi airport they wanted to privatize it , and we said that it would be stateowned same with the ports another pressure point is real russian buyers have shown a very great desire to build houses near the sea , mr bagapsh said , but they are hampered by a law that prevents noncitizens from owning real estate , and must become abkhaz citizens , a process that takes 10 years , or work through an abkhaz partner but mr bagapsh s maneuvering room is becoming increasingly limited by his own calculation , 99 percent of investment flowing into abkhazia comes from russia on thursday , he visited mr putin , now prime minister , to request a credit of about 46 million to build an abkhaz banking system , according to the rianovosti news service on friday , he announced that sukhumi s airport and railroad would be put under temporary russian management and though mr bagapsh has been adamant about maintaining a multivector foreign policy , ties to the west are fraying badly over the policy of nonrecognition and could decline further this summer , when the united nations mission there could be forced to close domestic critics like inal khashig , an opposition journalist , worry that if the law regulating real estate sales is changed to allow foreign ownership , within a week , all of abkhazia will be sold , and they despair of the region s dependence on russian money even if the authorities had a plan , they would hardly cut off the branch that they are so comfortably sitting on , mr khashig wrote in his newspaper , chegemskaya pravda , in december nothing is worse than uncertainty for them even a golden cage much will depend on mr bagapsh himself , who is expected to run for reelection in december he was coy about his plans in an interview , saying only that he will not run as a candidate of united abkhazia , which has partnered with mr putin s united russia , but instead collect signatures and appear on the ballot as an independent candidate he said he had no interest in endorsements from russian celebrities there is n't a person who has experienced greater pressure than me , he said this is why i am categorically against this i am offered assistance if i run from united abkhazia no assistance , thank you when somebody comes and starts campaigning for one candidate , the result is a protest vote
east rutherford , nj what did tom barrise do to deserve this \? who knows \? he is in his 14th season with as an advance scout and an assistant , but only now has he been asked to temporarily run the team as it races headlong toward nba infamy in a thankless assignment that fits in just perfectly with the franchise s history of foibles , high jinks and missteps , barrise , a loyal native of new jersey who hails from paterson and was a twosport athlete at fairleigh dickinson , was put in charge of the nets on sunday after lawrence frank was dismissed barrise was told to coach two games and somehow try to win one of them so far he is 0 for 1 if he loses again on wednesday night , in a home game against the dallas mavericks , the nets will set an nba record by reeling off 18 consecutive losses to start their season even if he does pull a victory out of his pocket , or his shoes , or his backup center s sneakers , barrise will then go back to his old duties , probably happily at that point , the burden of coaching the nets through the rest of this unsightly season will fall on the team s general manager , kiki vandeweghe , who , when asked at a news conference tuesday if he ever wanted to be a head coach , replied it was n't a basic plan , but it s a challenge you embrace the challenge vandeweghe has a distinguished nba pedigree he was a twotime allstar during his 13year playing career he was the general manager of the denver nuggets from 2001 to 2006 when he joined the nets as an assistant to the team s president , rod thorn , in 2007 , he could never have envisioned what he confronted on tuesday morning a team sometimes neglected by the news media , with a fan base that has long been feeble , was suddenly surrounded by cameras and reporters , all of them wanting in on the 017 train wreck that may soon be 018 for the nets , it is really nothing new yes , they did make the nba finals two years in a row , in 2002 and 2003 , but they are used to generating headlines only when they trade away a star player , seek a new home in brooklyn or attract an exotic billionaire the russian oligarch mikhail d prokhorov as their potential new owner now they are attracting attention through outright ineptness maybe it is all in their dna in their four decades , they have played home games in new jersey \( teaneck , piscataway and east rutherford \) and on long island in new york \( west hempstead , commack and uniondale \) brooklyn , they hope , is next , in time for the 201213 season in their inaugural 196768 campaign , as the new jersey americans of the american basketball association , they ended the season tied with the kentucky colonels for the final playoff berth a circus booked the homesite teaneck armory on the scheduled date of a onegame playoff , and the game was shifted to long island s commack arena when the teams arrived , they found the court in shambles floorboards were loose and baskets were not padded kentucky won through a forfeit two seasons later , the aba awarded the newly named new york nets the draft rights to a hometown center named lew alcindor alcindor , in turn , notified the nba and the aba that he would accept one sealed bid from each league the nba s milwaukee bucks bid higher than the nets alcindor , later known as kareem abduljabbar , joined milwaukee julius erving later became the nets' jewel , but he was sold to the philadelphia 76ers for 3 million in 1976 after a contract dispute it was just months after the nba and the aba merged in 1983 , the nets were having their best season since the merger when the famously restless larry brown decided to walk away from the nets' coaching job late in the season to take over at the university of kansas the nets then lost in the first round of the playoffs there is more , much more , interspersed with fleeting moments of success , but for vandeweghe and thorn , all that really matters right now is the dreary present vandeweghe plans to coach this season only , and with prokhorov awaiting as the new owner , much could change next season , anyway helping vandeweghe will be the veteran del harris , who is 72 , has coached the bucks , the los angeles lakers and the houston rockets and will arrive on thursday \( his hair is already white , so anything the nets do will not make matters worse \) vandeweghe will then coach his first game on friday suitably , the opponent will be the charlotte bobcats , coached by none other than brown for that matter , wednesday s opponent , the dallas mavericks , has the former nets star jason kidd in the backcourt thorn , who built the kiddled teams that went to the finals and then pared payroll at the direction of the current owner , bruce c ratner , talked bravely tuesday of the very good pieces on the nets that will make the team attractive for free agents at the end of the season but it is not clear who would want to join a team that may not win a game until who knows when for the moment , the nets are tied with two other nba teams that started a season 017 the 198889 miami heat ended up with 18 victories and did not make the playoffs for three more seasons the 199899 los angeles clippers notched only nine wins in a 50game lockoutshortened season they did not make the playoffs until 20056 and if the nets continue to lose every game \? well , the longest losing streak in nba history is the 23 games in a row the denver nuggets dropped in the 199798 season during that skid , the reporter from the rocky mountain news who covered the team began every game story with one word kaching ! vandeweghe has his own word in mind victory
location denton , tex nickname mean green last year s preview ignited some controversy over the true origin of this nickname i offered the theory that perhaps the name originated from mean joe greene

102  what was said  the mean green open up 2008 with a trio of difficult games , and will need to defeat rice to prevent entering conference play at 04 if that were to occur , north texas would have an extremely difficult time fighting their way back to 500 the big picture in 2008 for the mean green is the team will only improve as much as its defense improves , and it is hard to predict now how much better their defense will be , if better at all the offense may be good enough on its own to win three or four games a better defense can get them to 500 reranking no 117 a 15slot miss , the

western kentucky , giving him a grand total of one career win over fbs opponents \( wku doesn t join the fbs fulltime until this coming season \) i don t believe this is what unt was expecting what they snagged dodge from the high school ranks , where he was widely held to be the closest thing to a texas coaching legend this side of friday night lights dodge went 9811 over seven seasons at southlake carroll high school , including a remarkable 791 over his final five seasons that stretch included four state championships , with the lone loss coming by a single point in the 2003 championship lofty numbers , even if it is high school his most famous prot g , quarterback chase daniel , went on to great success at missouri , running a offense similar to the one he piloted under dodge so the potential for good things is obviously there what s the holdup \? with a hefty fiveyear contract in tow , one that would obviously hamstring the north texas athletic administration were they to fire the thirdyear coach , dodge is most likely safe through this season and into 2010 but after winning only three games in two seasons , and lacking any semblance of development , there are signs that dodge may be over his head on the fbs level seat temperature check at a rolling boil returning starters 17 \( 8 offense , 9 defense \) key losses the biggest loss on offense is wide receiver casey fitzgerald , a former walkon who transformed himself into the most accomplished receiver in school history with the help of the spread offense after wallowing in obscurity his first two years in the former coach darrell dickey s runheavy offense , fitzgerald exploded for 229 receptions over his junior and senior seasons , including 113 receptions \( for an fbsbest 99 per game \) in 2008 his 2007 season was even more impressive 116 receptions for 1 , 322 yards and 12 receiving touchdowns , all school records the quarterback responsible for getting fitzgerald the ball each of the last two seasons , the potential junior giovanni vizza , opted to transfer despite starting each of the last two seasons he threw for 5 , 146 yards in two seasons , including a school freshmanrecord 2 , 388 in 2007 while he didn t make any monumental improvement during his sophomore campaign \( 2 , 758 yards passing , 15 touchdowns against 16 picks \) , his departure leaves the team with only two players who have attempted a pass on the roster \( more on this in a moment \) on defense , north texas must replace only two starters , though both come on the line end ryan davenport , mainly a backup prior to 2008 , tallied 23 tackles \( 2 for loss \) and a sack tackle isaac thomas , who started five games in 2007 before stepping into the starting rotation fulltime last fall , had 29 stops , a linebest four and a half of which went for loss players to watch vizza s departure opens up the quarterback position , but the spot will likely be filled from within the family the dodge family , that is , as the coach s son , riley , a redshirt freshman , is widely expected to ascend to the starting spot when the season opens in september this is more than pure nepotism , however riley dodge , who played for his father at southlake carroll , was heavily recruited out of high school , actually committing to the university of texas before a lastminute change of heart led him to sign with unt though somewhat undersized \( listed at 6 feet , 182 pounds \) , dodge has the requisite skills and experience to excel in this offense he is the player to watch on the north texas offense he ll be the beneficiary of a young yet tested offensive line , one that returns all five starters from a season ago despite only featuring one upperclassman \( the senior guard gabe hollivay \) the best of this bunch is the junior esteban santiago , a starter for each of his first 24 games a contender for allsun belt honors , santiago must embrace a leadership role on this youthful offensive front santiago , hollivay , the junior tackle victor gill and the sophomore center jj johnson started all 12 games last fall , while the sophomore guard coleman feeley started the last seven the countdown s obvious statement of the day this type of continuity is good the big conundrum facing dodge and his offensive staff will be replacing both fitzgerald and brock stickler at wide receiver , a duo that combined for 159 receptions a season ago \( fitzgerald did the heavy lifting \) while the hope is that the junior alex lott \( 26 receptions for 201 yards \) and the sophomore sam roberson will pick up most of the slack , the answer at receiver likely lies in quantity depth more than quality adding depth will be the transfers jamaal jackson \( northwestern state \) and tyler stradford \( oklahoma \) , each of whom nudged their way into a starting spot in dodge s base fourreceiver set another name to watch for is the sophomore bj lewis , who missed all of the 2008 season due to injury he had 10 receptions for 86 yards as a freshman in 2007 you d imagine that in this passhappy offense the running back would be an afterthought , even in this 2 , 500word opus even casual readers of the countdown know better the senior cam montgomery put some impressive numbers 928 yards on 55 yards per carry , 9 scores despite being a secondary option he also chipped in with 18 receptions , making him one of the sun belt s premier threedown running backs on defense , the mean green must get a sizeable improvement from the defensive line , the only defensive unit to lose starters off last year s squad the player to watch up front is the senior eddrick gilmore , who led unt with three sacks in 2008 gilmore will move outside from tackle to end this fall , potentially giving him better opportunities at getting to the quarterback they ll need a big season from him at tackle , north texas will look for the senior draylen ross \( 22 tackle and a sack \) and the junior jessie desoto \( 12 stops , 15 sacks in 9 games \) to provide leadership and experience dodge and his staff have signed nearly a dozen defensive linemen in the last two recruiting classes combined , so finding bodies may not be a concern lack of game experience is troubling the entire back seven of the 2008 mean green starting defense returns , led by the senior tobe nwigwe , the team leader in tackles \( 111 \) and interceptions \( 3 \) his interception , which he returned for a touchdown , sealed the mean green s lone victory of the season nwiwge will man the middle , with the junior craig robertson \( 93 stops , a teambest 65 for loss \) and the converted safety kylie hill on the outside the north texas secondary features a nice blend of senior leadership \( antoine bush , a potential allconference performer \) and young potential \( the sophomores royce hill and darien williams \) hill seemed to turn a corner in the second half of the season after struggling through a tough first four games he ll team with bush at cornerback , while williams will team with dewaylon cook , who moves over from corner to the free safety spot the secondary will also receive a boost from the minnesota transfer justin chatman , who should make a strong push for early playing time come september position battle to watch while the ongoing tussle at wide receiver is intriguing , the simple truth is this the players at the top spots are going to put up video game numbers , regardless of who it may be taking that into account , the key position battle will be along the defensive line , which must improve in both stopping the run and getting to the quarterback if the mean green hope to increase its win total more so than finding starters deloach seems to have settled on a starting front four locating quality depth will be a primary concern the senior kyle russo and the sophomore mack cole iii are expected to be the primary replacements at end , but neither brings any considerable playing experience to the table the tackle spot lists a plethora of potential gamechangers on the two deep , but similarly to end , only three players ross , desoto and franklin have notched any meaningful game experience the potential is there , especially when considering the young linemen signed in each of the last two recruiting classes what remains is good coaching , and maybe some good luck , for this previously maligned unit to become a strength 2009 schedule  sept 3 ball state sept 12 ohio sept 19 alabama oct 3 middle tennessee state oct 10 louisianalafayette oct 17 florida atlantic oct 24

alabama will be fun , but the most important game on the schedule is western kentucky , a team the mean green will be battling to stay out of the bottom of the new eightteam sun belt unt was able to beat the hilltoppers on the road last year and in denton in 2007 , so a home victory should be well within the realm of expectations season breakdown prediction i had hopes that the mean green would begin to put it together in their second season under todd dodge , but the team s complete lack of progress leaves me skeptical about their future under the former high school coach i remain optimistic that the offense , now under the direction of the coach s son , will become more potent , but the program s recent aversion to any form of defense leads me to predict more struggles for unt in 2009 making matters worse , the growing competitiveness of the sun belt means no easy weeks in conference play though western kentucky could be a win meaning the mean green will have to scratch and claw its way to every victory the pressure is really on dodge to show some progress his contract will likely keep him around regardless of their final record , but another one or twowin season makes his future very bleak i see north texas finishing 210 , with a win over wku keeping them out of the basement in the sun belt dream season the mean green finally put it together under todd dodge , winning seven games and advancing to bowl play nightmare season more of the same 111 , with the lone win coming over western kentucky \( again \) where do north texas fans congregate i m partial to both gomeangreencom and insidenorthtexascom of course , i couldn t find any other mean greenrelated message boards did i miss anyone \? who is no 115 \? according to 2005 and 2007 reports , this

these sorts of groups are at the negotiating table and not loudly opposing health care reform but some in capitol hill are beginning to wonder if the outside groups are driving a harder bargain than the white house i m delighted to hear that people are stepping up to help reduce costs , said senator christopher j dodd , democrat of connecticut , but i want to know what the ask is , and the ask sometimes can exceed the value of your cost savings walmart , for example , which recently endorsed the idea that big companies like itself should insure all of its workers , is said to be seeking assurances that any health care deal would not force it to pay part of the cost for workers covered by medicaid , mr herszenhorn and ms stolberg report mr herszenhorn also reported on another big

do i tell them to just step aside \? the international ice hockey federation s deadlines for announcing olympic rosters fall between christmas and new year , ahead of the winter games in february in vancouver but unlike the powerhouses of world hockey , secondtier countries like germany , currently 12th in the iihf world rankings , behind norway and just ahead of denmark , must find a more delicate balance than simply picking the best players with the appropriate passport we have 10 players in the nhl and ahl , but none of them took part in qualifying , krupp said , referring to the brief tournament in hanover , germany , last february that got germany into the olympics with nailbiting 21 victories against austria and slovenia all the players on that german roster were domestically based it could be disruptive if i left off some of those guys who battled to get us into the olympics , krupp said , and whatever chance of success we have in vancouver will be the result of our whole team , not a few individuals it seems certain that when krupp announces his 23man roster dec 30 , he will pick players who are topline players with their nhl clubs , like forwards jochen hecht of the buffalo sabres and marco sturm of the boston bruins , and defensemen christian ehrhoff of the vancouver canucks and dennis seidenberg of the florida panthers but some germans playing in north america may not be called , said krupp , who played 15 seasons as an nhl defenseman and scored the stanley cupwinning goal for colorado in 1996 if a player is on an nhl roster but is n't getting a lot of ice time , he may not be ready to step in for us , krupp said he likened the situation to international soccer , in which players may be on prestigious clubs but cannot get off the bench and into games , hindering their chances of being selected to play for their country such players may include philip gogulla and felix sch tz , two 22yearold draft choices of the sabres now playing with portland of the american hockey league christoph schubert of the atlanta thrashers may be another such player he is on the thrashers' third defense pairing and skates an average of 15 minutes a game , on the bubble in terms of significant ice time even though schubert , 27 , played for germany in the last two olympics and at several other competitions in recent years , he said he was not sure whether krupp would take him to vancouver he s said it often enough just because you play over here does n't mean you 're going to make the olympics , schubert said it s his decision , he s the coach the only thing i know is that i expect he s going to call in the next couple of weeks if i make the team or not in vancouver , germany will play in a difficult preliminary group with sweden , finland and belarus sweden s lineup will consist almost entirely of nhl players , and about 75 percent of finland s will be from the nhl most of germany s players will come from the deutsche eishockey liga , considered only the seventhbest league in europe krupp said germany s no 1 goalie would probably be dimitri patzold , who played briefly with the san jose sharks and is having a rough season for erc ingolstadt of the del krupp said he might also call on thomas greiss , san jose s littleused backup , or dmitrij kotschnew of spartak moscow in the russian kontinental hockey league another ingolstadt player , thomas greilinger , is a candidate at forward greilinger is the del s leading scorer this season , five years after dropping out of hockey because of a knee injury and ballooning to more than 280 pounds in 20067 , he was playing in germany s fourthtier league in 20078 , he was in the third tier krupp said he was hoping to add another highly regarded forward , florian busch of perennial del champions eisb ren berlin busch was suspended last summer for two years for refusing to take a drug test when called upon at his home because he and his girlfriend had a dinner date , although he submitted to the test a couple of hours later the suspension was upheld by the court of arbitration for sport in switzerland but a swiss court overturned the decision last week , leaving busch potentially eligible for the olympics krupp refused to set a goal for what would constitute success for the germans in february , although a realistic one may be to beat belarus and get a point off sweden or finland to make it to the knockout round , as they did at the 2002 salt lake games to get anywhere in vancouver , we 'll need a hot goalie and we 'll need everyone to be playing well , krupp said but we 'll want to do it with as many of the guys who got us here as we can for most players in europe , the idea of winning the stanley cup is only a distant idea but for them the olympics is a tangible dream we want to preserve that , especially for some of the older players and once we get to the olympics , you never know what can happen
washington civil libertarians recently of acting like former president , citing about mr obama s plans to detain terrorism suspects without trials on domestic soil after he closes the guant namo prison it was only the latest instance in which critics have argued that mr obama has failed to live up to his campaign to restore our constitution and the rule of law and raised a pointed question has he , on issues related to fighting terrorism , turned out to be little different from his predecessor \? the answer depends on what it means to act like mr bush as they move toward completing a review of their options for dealing with the detainees , obama administration officials insist that there is a fundamental difference between mr bush s approach and theirs while mr bush claimed to wield sweeping powers as commander in chief that allowed him to bypass legal constraints when fighting terrorism , they say , mr obama respects checks and balances by relying on and obeying congressional statutes while the administration is considering a series of options , a range of options , none relies on legal theories that we have the inherent authority to detain people , robert gibbs , the white house press secretary , this week in response to questions about the preventive detention report and this will not be pursued in that manner but mr obama s critics say that whether statutory authorization exists for his counterterrorism policies is just a legalistic point the core problem with mr bush s approach , they argue , was that it trammeled individual rights and they say mr obama s policies have not changed that president obama may mouth very different rhetoric , said anthony d romero , executive director of the he may have a more complicated process with members of congress but in the end , there is no substantive break from the policies of the bush administration complicating the analysis , mr bush s policies evolved over time much of the legal controversy that initially surrounded his administration s efforts to prevent terrorist attacks had drained away by the time mr obama took over on jan 20 the bush team stopped using its harshest , like , years before leaving office and in mr bush s second term , congress passed legislation bringing federal statutes into alignment with policies like and surveillance without warrants as a senator , mr obama for the 2008 bill authorizing the surveillance program , which he has continued since taking office he against a 2006 bill authorizing military commissions , but it passed anyway while mr obama initially halted the trials , he has since proposed reviving them in a revised form mr obama has also drawn fire from human rights advocates for fighting to prevent detainees in afghanistan from having rights but his legal team notes that the 2006 military commissions act contains a provision saying such prisoners may not challenge their detentions in court still , mr obama has also continued other bushera policies where statutory law is murkier or absent like the cia s program in which detainees are transferred to other countries and the invocation of the state secrets privilege to shut down some lawsuits \( the administration is reviewing both policies \) and after grappling with how to close the prison at the naval base in guant namo bay , cuba , mr obama proposed a new system of preventive detention to deal with those terrorism suspects who , he says , would be hard to prosecute and dangerous to release but mr obama s insistence that he would create such a preventive detention regime only with congressional authorization may pose little pragmatic obstacle , because he can claim lawmakers have already granted it in 2004 , the supreme court , 5 to 4 , that mr bush could detain indefinitely , without trial and on domestic soil a man accused of fighting for the taliban it cited congress s authorization to use military force against the perpetrators of the 2001 attacks , which remains on the books to be sure , mr obama has made some significant changes to bush policies he closed the central intelligence agency s longterm prisons and required strict adherence to antitorture rules he also released secret legal memorandums about interrogation those changes have opened him up to attacks from the right in particular , former vice president dick cheney mr obama of abandoning the bushcheney strategies , suggesting that mr obama would bear direct responsibility for any future terrorist attack mr obama has embraced mr cheney s premise that he is an agent of change , as his campaign rhetoric suggested he would be in a in may , mr obama described his policies as a new direction from the last eight years but , a top legal official in the bush administration , said the claim of a vast gulf between mr obama s counterterrorism policies and those at the end of mr bush s tenure was false there is a faux debate that something new is afoot and both the obama administration and cheney have an interest in that being the case , but it s just not true , he said it just serves almost everyone s political interests to make it seem like something brand new is happening , but it s mostly window dressing for just what was going on before , a clinton administration lawyer , said that even if mr obama s policies look similar to mr bush s , his show of greater respect for congress was important because he is not creating precedents that future presidents can cite to bypass unrelated laws mr obama has not always been consistent in that respect in a last week , for example , he claimed a right to ignore five sections of an appropriations bill related to international financial institutions such statutory limits , he said , would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations in any case , , a yale law school professor , said mr obama s ratification of the basic outlines of the surveillance and detention policies he inherited would reverberate for generations by bestowing bipartisan acceptance on them , mr balkin said , mr obama is consolidating them as entrenched features of government what we are watching , mr balkin said , is a liberal , centrist , democratic version of the construction of these same governing practices
black metal and doom metal are musical styles , but they are also modes of being they 're body and brain and nature that furious blackmetal clog of screams , strums and beats is rain or wind or anxiety or catatonic excitement that deepfrequency doommetal drone is the unfathomable drag of eternity the creator s cello sawing away for a billion more choruses than you 'll ever get to hear one s a head sound , one s a chest sound they 're infinite wells of culture and meaning they wo n't go away epiphanies can be struck from violating their protocols during blackened music weekend three shows presented by blackened music at union pool and krallice and shrinebuilder were among the headliners both bands are fairly new and both are brain trusts , collaborations among musicians who 've proved themselves in other groups both made careful , excellent music , referring to and slipping away from a style krallice , from new york , does n't do occultism , face paint or wardrobes three of its members look like casual metalheads , and the fourth , mick barr , a guitarist with a beard and glasses , looks like an english professor , or trey anastasio he s made instrumental , abstracted versions of blackmetal before , sometimes on his own he s into the nirvana of repetitive strums at blender speed , and pushes them through complicated structures but krallice is not a conceptualart project it s a real rock band , complete with singing actually , screaming by mr barr and the bassist nick mcmaster its songs at union pool on friday were long but powerful , with heroic crescendos and snaking counterpoint between mr barr and colin marston s guitars lev weinstein s drumming had its classically blackmetal touches \( the long tattoos of bassdrum beats made with two pedals \) , but felt bigger , clearer and more propulsive than the norm of unending rapid palpitation it was a show of stamina , especially the set s one instrumental , monolith of possession , which required mr weinstein to play a twobeat thrash for 10 minutes with no letup and where there was virtuosity , there was no glibness on sunday at le poisson rouge , shrinebuilder played an overwhelming show almost meditatively focused , one whose afterimage is likely to stay with those who saw it it s a band of willful musicians in their 40s from around the country who have given their adult lives to slowandheavy music scott kelly of neurosis , scott weinrich of the obsessed and saint vitus , al cisneros of om and dale crover of the melvins shrinebuilder is as loosely based in doommetal as krallice is in blackmetal it might be the starting place , but it s not the ending place if krallice s music with its bright distortion , sprinting drums and needling guitars suggests insanely crosshatched surfaces , shrinebuilder s is all solid interiors its tempos were slow and cruising , and its sound was loud but spacious and clear , with mr weinrich playing slow , sliding leads over mr kelly s lowpitched riffs all band members sang in their varied voices , from mr cisneros s dire , syncopated monotone to mr kelly s gruff gurgle but none of them yelled this music , and their demeanor , was some sort of zen lesson these were teachers who could quell the class with calm but decisive gestures in a set that lasted about an hour and a quarter , the band elongated all the songs from its new , selftitled first album , and played a cover of joy division s droning 24 hours a perfect and surprising choice \( it s hard to imagine the two scotts , stolid american grizzlies , as secret anglophiles \) as the last song , pyramid of the moon , swept to its end and mr crover socked the last beat , the crowd erupted almost involuntarily , as if it had been punched liturgy , a young band from new york , opened on friday and sunday nights , playing notional black metal \( saturday s show , also at union pool , was headlined by skeletonwitch , which combines black metal with the punkier thrash \) but in all its rush and speed there s an unlikely serenity hunter hunthendrix , liturgy s guitarist and singer , writes the band s music the quartet grew out of his oneman project but the drummer greg fox one of the most exciting drummers i 've seen recently in any kind of music sets its agenda in another way while playing as hard as his body will allow , he is n't following a strict grid of time he lets his blastbeats accelerate and decelerate , bestowing the gift of breath to a music that s suffocating by definition
there have been encouraging signs of progress recently at the site of the former world trade center but now the developer , larry silverstein , is challenging his agreement with the site s owner , the port authority of new york and new jersey , over who pays going forward , what is built and when it gets completed if this latest dispute is not quickly resolved , the sept 11 memorial is unlikely to be ready for the 10year anniversary of the attack in 2011 continued wrangling and delay could also deplete the port authority s funds so that other projects , like building a new pennsylvania station , are put off not for another day , but for another era none of this would look good for anyone involved the politicians , the port authority and mr silverstein mr silverstein charges that the port authority is taking too long to build the complicated substructure he needs to create skyscrapers at the site \( port authority officials counter that he has denied them access to crucial parts of that very underground area \) the developer says the delays have made it harder for him to get credit from private sources , so he wants the port authority to provide the financing for two more skyscrapers the port authority is promising some additional support , but mr silverstein is asking for too much the authority , which was created to manage transportation and port facilities in the area , has limited resources , and it should not be getting deeper into the real estate business mr silverstein s company , which took over the lease of the twin towers six weeks before they were attacked , has already received billions of dollars in support insurance , government bonds and subsidies , plus a handsome development fee for the port authority s construction of the 1 , 776foot tall tower at the site the outlines of a new agreement are there , especially if mr silverstein will stake a lot more of his own considerable money and risk in these new skyscrapers but time is running out , and political leaders need to get involved especially mayor michael bloomberg of new york city and gov jon corzine of new jersey both are successful businessmen who know the world of financial negotiation those are the very skills needed right now at the site of the former world trade center
players have contracted 33 cases of the virulent skin infection known as over the past three years , a recent survey has found , a decrease of nearly 50 percent compared with a similar study completed in 2005 the results are encouraging , said dr andrew tucker , who conducted the survey and is president of the nfl physicians society tucker said the dip in outbreaks indicated that teams had taken effective steps to prevent the spread of the infection , whose full name is methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus like athletes in other sports , football players are susceptible to skin infections because of their close contact with other players , the frequency of cuts and the conditions in locker rooms , which are havens for bacteria team doctors have paid heightened attention to mrsa , which is resistant to many , since at least 2003 , when eight st louis rams' players contracted the infection the team invited the centers for disease control and prevention to investigate the outbreak , and tucker conducted a leaguewide survey of mrsa in 2005 , which found that 60 players had contracted the infection now , players are counseled at the start of the season on personal hygiene , and tucker said team physicians were on the alert for signs of mrsa outbreaks among their players the league also recently hired an infectious disease consultant to audit teams' efforts to prevent mrsa independently \? the results of that study will be presented at the league s scouting combine later this year , tucker said according to the most recent survey , of 30 teams that responded , 16 teams had either a single mrsa case or none , tucker said eight of the 33 cases arose after surgery , meaning it was likely the infection was contracted in a hospital jeff hageman , an epidemiologist for the cdc , said the decrease in cases among players showed the league s efforts were working i think it s realistic to see that as a true decrease , he said it was recognized quicker , treated quicker and therefore had less chance to spread within teams infections among nfl players made headlines this season , although none of the most highprofile cases including tom brady and peyton manning , who had infected knees were reported to be mrsa the subject had become so sensitive that kellen winslow received a onegame suspension , later rescinded , after accusing the browns of concealing his staph infection , which was his second in three years hageman said that while nfl players made news when they contracted infections , they were no more likely to develop mrsa than other athletes here s the nfl , with many resources available to them , and they get mrsa infections , he said regardless of how many resources you have and the best medical care , mrsa is a very common cause of skin infection
the president hello , everyone all right well , i just concluded a extraordinarily productive meeting with organizations and associations that are going to be essential to the work of health care reform in this country groups that represent everyone from union members to insurance companies , from doctors and hospitals to pharmaceutical companies it was a meeting that focused largely on one of the central challenges that we must confront as we seek to achieve comprehensive reform and lay a new foundation for our economy and that is , the spiraling cost of health care in this country they 're here because they recognize one clear , indisputable fact when it comes to health care spending , we are on an unsustainable course that threatens the financial stability of families , businesses and government itself this is not news to the american people , who , over the last decade , have seen their outofpocket expenses soar , health care costs rise , and premiums double at a rate four times faster than their wages today , half of all personal bankruptcies stem from medical expenses and too many americans are skipping that checkup they know they should get , or going without that prescription that would make them feel better , or finding some other way to scrimp and save on their health care expenses what is a growing crisis for the american people is also becoming an untenable burden for america s businesses rising health care costs are commanding more and more of the money that our companies could be using to innovate and to grow , making it harder for them to compete around the world these costs are leading the small businesses that are responsible for half of all private sector jobs to drop coverage for their workers at an alarming rate and , finally , the explosion in health care costs has put our federal budget on a disastrous path this is largely due to what we 're spending on medicare and medicaid entitlement programs whose costs are expected to continue climbing in the years ahead as baby boomers grow older and come to rely more and more on our health care system that s why i 've said repeatedly that getting health care costs under control is essential to reducing budget deficits , restoring fiscal discipline , and putting our economy on a path towards sustainable growth and shared prosperity we , as a nation , are now spending a far larger share of our national wealth on health care than we were a generation ago at the rate we 're going , we are expected to spend one fifth of our economy on health care within a decade and yet we 're getting less for our money in fact , we 're spending more on health care than any other nation on earth , even though millions of americans do n't have the affordable , quality care they deserve , and nearly 46 million americans do n't have any health insurance at all this problem did n't just appear overnight for decades , washington has debated what to do about this for decades , we 've talked about reducing costs , improving care , and providing coverage to uninsured americans but all too often , efforts at reform have fallen victim to special interest lobbying aimed at keeping things the way they are to political pointscoring that sees health care not as a moral issue or an economic issue , but as a wedge issue and to a failure on all sides to come together on behalf of the american people and that s what makes today s meeting so remarkable because it s a meeting that might not have been held just a few years ago the groups who are here today represent different constituencies with different sets of interests they 've not always seen eye to eye with each other or with our government on what needs to be done to reform health care in this country in fact , some of these groups were among the strongest critics of past plans for comprehensive reform but what s brought us all together today is a recognition that we ca n't continue down the same dangerous road we 've been traveling for so many years that costs are out of control and that reform is not a luxury that can be postponed , but a necessity that cannot wait it s a recognition that the fictional television couple , harry and louise , who became the iconic faces of those who opposed health care reform in the '90s , desperately need health care reform in 2009 and so does america and that s why these groups are voluntarily coming together to make an unprecedented commitment over the next 10 years from 2010 to 2019 they are pledging to cut the rate of growth of national health care spending by 15 percentage points each year an amount that s equal to over 2 trillion two trillion dollars their efforts will help us take the next and most important step comprehensive health care reform so that we can do what i pledged to do as a candidate and save a typical family an average of 2 , 500 on their health care costs in the coming years let me repeat that point what they 're doing is complementary to and is going to be completely compatible with a strong , aggressive effort to move health care reform through here in washington with an ultimate result of saving health care costs for families , businesses and the government that s how we can finally make health care affordable , while putting more money into the pockets of hardworking families each month these savings can be achieved by standardizing quality care , incentivizing efficiency , investing in proven ways not only to treat illness but to prevent them this is a historic day , a watershed event in the long and elusive quest for health care reform and as these groups take the steps they are outlining , and as we work with congress on health care reform legislation , my administration will continue working to reduce health care costs to achieve similar savings by curbing waste , fraud , and abuse and preventing avoidable hospital readmissions and taking a whole host of other costsaving steps , we can save billions of dollars , while delivering better care to the american people now , none of these steps can be taken by our federal government or our health care community acting alone they 'll require all of us coming together , as we are today , around a common purpose workers , executives , hospitals , nurses , doctors , drug companies , insurance companies , members of congress it s the kind of broad coalition , everybody with a seat at the table that i talked about during the campaign , that is required to achieve meaningful health care reform and that is the kind of coalition which to which i am committed so the steps that are being announced today are significant but the only way these steps will have an enduring impact is if they are taken not in isolation , but as part of a broader effort to reform our entire health care system we 've already begun making a down payment on that kind of comprehensive reform we 're extending quality health care to millions of children of working families who lack coverage , which means we 're going to be preventing longterm problems that are even more expensive to treat down the road we 're providing a cobra subsidy to make health care affordable for 7 million americans who lose their jobs and because much of every health care dollar is spent on billing , overhead , and administration , we are computerizing medical records in a way that will protect our privacy , and that s a step that will not only eliminate waste and reduce medical errors that cost lives , but also let doctors spend less time doing administrative work and more time caring for patients but there s so much more to do in the coming weeks and months , congress will be engaged in the difficult issue of how best to reform health care in america i'm committed to building a transparent process where all views are welcome but i'm also committed to ensuring that whatever plan we design upholds three basic principles first , the rising cost of health care must be brought down second , americans must have the freedom to keep whatever doctor and health care plan they have , or to choose a new doctor or health care plan if they want it and third , all americans must have quality , affordable health care these are principles that i expect to see upheld in any comprehensive health care reform bill that s sent to my desk i mentioned it to the groups that were here today it s reform that is an imperative for america s economic future , and reform that is a pillar of the new foundation we seek to build for our economy reform that we can , must , and will achieve by the end of this year ultimately , the debate about reducing costs and the larger debate about health care reform itself is not just about numbers it s not just about forms or systems it s about our own lives and the lives of our loved ones and i understand that as i 've mentioned before during the course of the campaign , my mother passed away from ovarian cancer a little over a decade ago and in the last weeks of her life , when she was coming to grips with her own mortality and showing extraordinary courage just to get through each day , she was spending too much time worrying about whether her health insurance would cover her bills so i know what it s like to see a loved one who is suffering , but also having to deal with a broken health care system i know that pain is shared by millions of americans all across this country and that s why i was committed to health care reform as a presidential candidate that s why health care reform is a key priority to this presidency that s why i will not rest until the dream of health care reform is finally achieved in the united states of america and that s why i'm thrilled to have such a broad , diverse group of individuals from all across the health care spectrum representing every constituency and every political predisposition who feel that same sense of urgency and are committing themselves to work diligently to bring down costs so we can achieve the reforms that we seek so thank you very much to all of you for being here thank you very much everybody
tarpon springs , fla the family clad in pittsburgh steelers jerseys watched nicholas toth walk by in his calloused hands , he held a diving helmet he had made from scratch , a 38pound brass and copper tribute to his grandfather in a place populated by the descendants of greek immigrants , mr toth , 54 , carries on the tradition of a family and a town he is a master maker of diver s helmets and here , he is the only one left i'm probably the last person in the world who makes these helmets , one person , beginning to end , mr toth said i make them the oldfashioned way that has been handed down from generation to generation greek divers arrived here in the 1890s , recruited by an entrepreneur intent on harvesting the sponge beds off the coast anthony lerios arrived in 1913 he found dirt roads and mud streets , pigs and chickens running loose he considered moving back to greece there he had built steam engines , but here he found his calling an older man taught him to make helmets for sponge divers , and when that man died , mr lerios took over the helmets have not changed since the mid1800s they are built with brass , copper , leather and quarterinch plate glass mr lerios s grandson , mr toth , was born in 1955 he often followed his grandfather to the sponge exchange , where boat captains held auctions in the town courtyard after graduating from the university of florida with a degree in political science , mr toth wanted to go to graduate school and then start a career in law or politics instead , he found himself drawn toward home together , mr toth and his grandfather built a booming business , played club soccer in the afternoon and grew as close as two people can ten years passed gone , just like that mr lerios died in 1992 he was almost 101 for five years , mr toth could not look at helmets , much less make one he took on jobs fixing boats or houses eventually , he returned to the shop and sat at the machines as soon as i started doing it again , i felt him there , mr toth said everything was flowing i was an artist again down by the docks , mr toth pointed to restaurants named after greek islands like santorini and mykonos , places that border the old exchange , which was converted into shops nearly 30 years ago some still carry sponge , wool sponge and yellow sponge and grass sponge from the nearby waters divers remain , but in smaller numbers none of them use mr toth s helmets mr toth still sells the occasional helmet , but mostly he makes his living doing odd jobs as the population grew and artificial sponge elbowed its way into the market , the town changed from the spongediving capital of to a tourist destination mr toth s grandfather s shop , which once attracted divers , has been battered by and sits in disrepair the only way to get in is to crawl under a garage door that does not fully open down the street , a once famous tapas restaurant called the riverside cafe sits empty as the town changed , starting in the 1960s , it clung , like mr toth , to its history an old spongediving boat , built in 1935 from cypress and pine , dominates the square mr toth said there are n't too many places like this , in florida or in the country the historical value is tremendous and that s the charm of it mark diclemente paints that history on local buildings residents call him marcus angelo for 14 years , mr diclemente has watched the economy head south murals of sponge divers and sponge boats that he once painted for 20 , 000 now go for 8 , 000 everyone s had to downsize , he said everyone s losing their jobs but in this community , everyone s sticking together , keeping each other alive mr toth believes he can accomplish that by continuing tradition , by building diving helmets the same way his grandfather did building one remains tedious work that requires more than 200 hours spread over two to three months depending on the helmet gods the helmets cost 10 , 000 mr toth once made five in a single year , but as business declined , so has his production he views this work as an art form , albeit a dying one he hopes that it evokes an emotional response he believes that this is what his grandfather would have wanted in 2000 , the library of congress inducted mr toth and his grandfather into the american folk life center in 2003 , he received the national heritage fellowship , the highest honor in the folk and traditional arts field the tradition here acts as the backbone , the spine of this place , mr toth said if you just opened a waterfront with tourist shops , which a lot of places in florida do , there s no soul there the diving tradition , the helmet making , the history that we have , that is the real soul of this city dark , ominous clouds gathered overhead , as tourists scrambled into the greek restaurants and shops mr toth grabbed the helmet from its resting spot on a nearby bench the first he made after his grandfather died , the one he will never sell two tourists stopped and pointed what s that \? one of them asked a spongediving helmet , mr toth said i 've been making these for a long time
islamabad , two missiles fired from american drone aircraft killed more than 30 people , including qaeda and fighters , near the pakistani border with afghanistan on saturday , according to a pakistani intelligence official and residents of the area the missiles struck three compounds , including one where the leader of the pakistani taliban , , and foreign and local fighters loyal to him sometimes gather , the official and residents said mr mehsud , one of the most feared leaders in pakistan s lawless tribal areas , was not among those killed , according to the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press mr mehsud , a pakistani , has fought the government openly in the past , and government and intelligence officials say forces loyal to him continue to attack pakistani troops in the swat valley and the bajaur and mohmand tribal areas the previous government , led by pervez musharraf , accused mr mehsud in the killing of benazir bhutto , a former pakistani prime minister if mr mehsud was the target of the attack in south waziristan , it would be the first time that american missiles were aimed at him , the intelligence official said missile attacks in pakistan by remotely piloted aircraft operated by the central intelligence agency have generally been aimed at foreign qaeda fighters and taliban guerrillas from afghanistan , who take shelter in pakistan between raids into their country to fight american and nato soldiers a cia spokesman , mark mansfield , declined to comment on the reports of missile strikes on saturday , as is the agency s standing policy a spokesman for pakistan s military was unavailable for comment arab and uzbek fighters were among those killed saturday , according to the intelligence official and residents of the area the attack followed a visit to pakistan last week by richard c holbrooke , the special representative to pakistan and afghanistan , that was part of a review of american policy in the region ordered by president obama during his visit , mr holbrooke heard a litany of complaints about drone strikes , some of which have inadvertently killed civilians , making it harder for the country s shaky government to win support for its own military operations against the taliban it was unclear if any civilians where killed in saturday s strikes , which residents say also hit a madrasa the drone attack also comes after a statement on thursday by senator dianne feinstein , democrat of california and the chairwoman of the senate intelligence committee , that the aircraft take off from a base in pakistan as i understand it , these are flown out of a pakistani base , ms feinstein said during a hearing the drone attacks , especially in the last six months , have increased antiamerican sentiment in pakistan to very high levels , and ms feinstein s statement is likely to further inflame the protests over them her statement was prominently covered by the pakistani press on saturday although many pakistanis have accused their government of giving quiet approval for the united states to strike in the tribal areas , they also assumed that the strikes came from afghanistan in 2008 , the american drones carried out more than 30 missile attacks against qaeda and taliban targets in the tribal areas , according to a report by the council of foreign relations in washington two missile attacks just days after mr obama was inaugurated indicated that his administration , at least for now , planned to continue the policy of the bush administration the compounds that were hit saturday were in the village of shwangai , near the town of makeen the village is about 60 miles from the afghan border a resident of the area said that bodies were still being recovered from the debris hours after the attack the attack was the fourth in the area controlled by mr mehsud , but none of the others were believed to have had him as a target most of these attacks have occurred since september , when president asif ali zardari took power

uyuni , in the rush to build the next generation of hybrid or electric cars , a sobering fact confronts both automakers and governments seeking to lower their reliance on foreign oil almost half of the world s lithium , the mineral needed to power the vehicles , is found here in bolivia a country that may not be willing to surrender it so easily japanese and european companies are busily trying to strike deals to tap the resource , but a nationalist sentiment about the lithium is building quickly in the government of president , an ardent critic of the united states who has already nationalized bolivia s oil and natural gas industries for now , the government talks of closely controlling the lithium and keeping foreigners at bay adding to the pressure , indigenous groups here in the remote salt desert where the mineral lies are pushing for a share in the eventual bounty we know that bolivia can become the saudi arabia of lithium , said francisco quisbert , 64 , the leader of frutcas , a group of salt gatherers and quinoa farmers on the edge of salar de uyuni , the world s largest salt flat we are poor , but we are not stupid peasants the lithium may be bolivia s , but it is also our property the new constitution that mr morales managed to get handily passed by voters last month bolstered such claims one provision could give indians control over the natural resources in their territory , strengthening their ability to win concessions from the authorities and private companies , or even block mining projects none of this is dampening efforts by foreigners , including the japanese conglomerates mitsubishi and sumitomo and a group led by a french industrialist , vincent bollor in recent months all three have sent representatives to la paz , the capital , to meet with mr morales s government about gaining access to the lithium , a critical component for the batteries that power cars and other electronics there are salt lakes in chile and argentina , and a promising lithium deposit in tibet , but the prize is clearly in bolivia , oji baba , an executive in mitsubishi s base metals unit , said in la paz if we want to be a force in the next wave of automobiles and the batteries that power them , then we must be here mitsubishi is not alone in planning to produce cars using lithiumion batteries ailing automakers in the united states are pinning their hopes on lithium one of them is general motors , which next year plans to roll out its volt , a car using a lithiumion battery along with a gas engine nissan , ford and bmw , among other carmakers , have similar projects demand for lithium , long used in small amounts in moodstabilizing drugs and thermonuclear weapons , has climbed as makers of batteries for blackberrys and other electronic devices use the mineral but the automotive industry holds the biggest untapped potential for lithium , analysts say since it weighs less than nickel , which is also used in batteries , it would allow electric cars to store more energy and be driven longer distances with governments , including the obama administration , seeking to increase and reduce their dependence on imported oil , private companies are focusing their attention on this desolate corner of the andes , where quechuaspeaking indians subsist on the remains of an ancient inland sea by bartering the salt they carry out on llama caravans the united states geological survey says 54 million tons of lithium could potentially be extracted in bolivia , compared with 3 million in chile , 11 million in china and just 410 , 000 in the united states independent geologists estimate that bolivia might have even more lithium at uyuni and its other salt deserts , though high altitudes and the quality of the reserves could make access to the mineral difficult while estimates vary widely , some geologists say electriccar manufacturers could draw on bolivia s lithium reserves for decades to come but amid such potential , foreigners seeking to tap bolivia s lithium reserves must navigate the policies of mr morales , 49 , who has clashed repeatedly with american , european and even south american investors mr morales shocked neighboring brazil , with whom he is on friendly terms , by nationalizing that country s natural gas projects here in 2006 and seeking a sharp rise in prices he carried out his latest nationalization before the vote on the constitution , sending soldiers to occupy the operations of the british oil giant bp at the la paz headquarters of comibol , the state agency that oversees mining projects , mr morales s vision of combining socialism with advocacy for bolivia s indians is prominently on display copies of cambio , a new statecontrolled daily newspaper , are available in the lobby , while posters of che guevara , the leftist icon killed in bolivia in 1967 , appear at the entrance to comibol s offices the previous imperialist model of exploitation of our natural resources will never be repeated in bolivia , said sa l villegas , head of a division in comibol that oversees lithium extraction maybe there could be the possibility of foreigners accepted as minority partners , or better yet , as our clients to that end , comibol is investing about 6 million in a small plant near the village of r o grande on the edge of salar de uyuni , where it hopes to begin bolivia s first industrialscale effort to mine lithium from the white , moonlike landscape and process it into carbonate for batteries technicians first need to get a brine , or water saturated with salt that is found deep beneath the salt desert , to the surface , where it is evaporated in pools to expose the lithium mr morales wants the plant finished by the end of this year workers here were in a frenzy to meet that goal during late january , laboring under the sun around halffinished walls of brick over a meal of llama stew and a pepsi , marcelo castro , 48 , the manager overseeing the project , explained that along with processing lithium , the plant had another objective of course , lithium is the mineral that will lead us to the postpetroleum era , mr castro said but in order to go down that road , we must raise the revolutionary consciousness of our people , starting on the floor of this very factory beyond the tiny plant , lithium analysts say bolivia , one of latin america s least developed nations , needs to be investing much more to start producing carbonate but with economic growth slowing and a decline in oil prices limiting the reach of its top patron , venezuela , it remains unclear how bolivia can achieve this on its own still , even though mr morales is asserting greater control of the economy and taking over oil and gas projects , optimistic industry analysts point out that he allowed some foreign companies to remain in the country as minority partners mining lithium in bolivia has its own history of fits and starts in the early 1990s , nationalist opposition reportedly led by gonzalo s nchez de lozada , a wealthy holder of mining concessions who later became bolivia s president , thwarted a plan by lithco , an american company , to tap the lithium deposits here that history , coupled with mr morales s current tensions with washington , might help explain why american companies appear to be on the sidelines as others seek lithium deals here mr s nchez de lozada was ultimately forced to resign as president in 2003 after mr morales led protests against his efforts to export natural gas with the help of foreign capital as bolivia ponders how to tap its lithium , nations with smaller reserves are stepping up china has emerged as a top lithium producer , tapping reserves found in a tibetan salt flat but geologists and economists are fiercely debating whether the lithium reserves outside of bolivia are enough to meet the climbing global demand keith evans , a californiabased geologist , argues that accessible lithium resources outside bolivia are significantly larger than estimated by the united states geological survey juan carlos zuleta , an economist in la paz , said we have the most magnificent lithium reserves on the planet , but if we do n't step into the race now , we will lose this chance the market will find other solutions for the world s battery needs on the flat salt desert of uyuni , such debate seems remote to those still laboring as their ancestors did , scraping salt off the ground into the coneshaped piles that line the horizon like some geometric mirage the lithium found under the surface of this desert seems even more remote for these 21stcentury salt gatherers i 've heard of the lithium , but i only hope it creates work for us , said pedro camata , 19 , his face shielded from the unforgiving sun by a ski mask and cheap sunglasses covering his eyes without work out here , one is dead

dresden , germany in early july thousands of mourners took to the streets in egypt , chanting down with germany thousands more arabs and muslims joined them in protests in berlin in iran , president mahmoud ahmadinejad added to the outcry by denouncing german brutality the provocation was the murder on july 1 of marwa alsherbini , a pregnant egyptian pharmacist here she was stabbed 18 times in a dresden courtroom , in front of her 3yearold son , judges and other witnesses , reportedly by the man appealing a fine for having insulted ms sherbini in a park identified by german authorities only as a 28yearold russianborn german named alex w , he had called ms sherbini an islamist , a terrorist and a slut when she asked him to make room for her son on the playground swings ms sherbini wore a head scarf the killer also stabbed elwi okaz , ms sherbini s husband and a genetic research scientist , who was critically wounded as he tried to defend her the police , arriving late on the scene , mistook him for the attacker and shot him in the leg more than a week passed before the german government , responding to rising anger across the arab world , expressed words of sorrow while stressing that the attack did occur during the prosecution of a racist and that the accused man was originally from russia dresden is one of the great cultural capitals of europe it is also the capital of saxony , a former part of east germany that , along with having a reputation as silicon saxony , has made more than a few headlines in recent years for incidents of xenophobia and rightwing extremism one wonders how to reconcile the heights of the city s culture with the gutter of these events this year s annual report of the federal office for the protection of the constitution , germany s domestic intelligence agency , showed that farright crime rose last year by 16 percent across the country most of these offenses were classified as propaganda crimes painting swastikas on jewish headstones or smashing the windows of restaurants run by immigrants but politically motivated violent acts like murder , arson and assault accounted for 1 , 042 of the nearly 20 , 000 crimes recorded , a rise of 63 percent over 2007 and these violent crimes turned out to be far more commonplace in parts of the former east germany saxony , with roughly 5 percent of the country s population , accounted for 12 percent of the violence classified as far right in nature , the report said these days dresden s center , once obliterated by allied bombs , is a marvel of civility , a restored baroque fairyland surrounded by socialistera and postsocialistera sprawl the rebuilt frauenkirche , the great baroque cathedral where bach played , again marks the skyline with its bellshaped dome , as it did for centuries the ruin of the frauenkirche became a gathering spot for protests against the east german regime during communist times in february , as usual on the anniversary of the allied air raids , neonazis marched through the streets some 7 , 500 of them carried banners condemning the bombing holocaust they were outnumbered , spiegel online reported , by antinazi demonstrators , but 7 , 500 was nonetheless twice as many neonazis as showed up last year the other day only the benign clopclop of horsedrawn carriages sounded across the cobblestone square outside the cathedral , the carriages bouncing cameratoting tourists past highend jewelry shops and overpriced cafes nearby , the zwinger palace , perhaps the most beautiful of all baroque complexes , attracted the usual supplicants to raphael s sistine madonna , which was paired in the gem ldegalerie with an african sculpture germany is now a bastion of democracy in the heart of europe but the far right is on the rise across the continent , and xenophobia is gaining in this country , not least among youth and not least singling out muslims a recent twoyear government survey of 20 , 000 german teenagers classified one in seven as highly xenophobic and another 262 percent as fairly xenophobic it was known that the figures were high , interior minister wolfgang sch uble said but i'm appalled that they 're this high the newspaper tagesspiegel reported that alex w asked ms sherbini in the courtroom , do you have a right to be in germany at all \? before warning her that when the npd comes to power , there 'll be an end to that i voted npd , he added no surprise the farright national party , a marginal but noisy troublemaker on the german political scene with a tiny official membership \( some 7 , 000 \) , is as strong in saxony as it is anywhere recent polls have routinely shown its support in the state as nearing 10 percent of the population it claims 8 seats out of the 124 in the state parliament in dresden on tuesday the party issued a statement calling for a black politician , zeca schall , working on regional elections in thuringia for the ruling christian democratic union , to head home to angola thuringia should remain german , the statement said mr schall , angolanborn , has lived in thuringia , another region in the former east , since 1988 hightech industries and research institutes like the one where ms sherbini s husband works , which recruit foreign experts , have lifted dresden economically above much of the rest of the former east , and last year nearly 10 million tourists fattened the city s coffers with half a million residents , some 20 , 000 of them foreigners , the capital looks prosperous and charming , like its old self all of which gets back to the problem of reconciliation what are the humanizing effects of culture \? evidently , there are none to walk through dresden s museums , and past the young buskers fiddling mozart on street corners , is to wonder whether this ageold question may have things backward it presumes that we 're passive receivers acted on by the arts , which vouchsafe our salvation , moral and otherwise , so long as we remain in their presence arts promoters nowadays like to trumpet how culture helps business and tourism how teaching painting and music in schools boosts test scores they try to assign practical ends , dollar values and other hard numbers , never mind how dubious , to quantify what s ultimately unquantifiable the lesson of dresden , which this great city unfortunately seems doomed to repeat , is that culture is , to the contrary , impractical and fragile , helpless even residents of dresden who believed , when the war was all but over , that their home had somehow been spared annihilation by its beauty were all the more traumatized when , in a matter of hours , bombs killed tens of thousands and obliterated centuries of humane and glorious architecture the truth is , we can stare as long as we want at that raphael madonna or at antonello da messina s st sebastian , now beside a congo fetish sculpture in another room in the gem ldegalerie or at the shiny coffee sets , clocks and cups made of coral and motherofpearl and coconuts and diamonds culled from the four corners of the earth in the city s new green vault , which contains the spoils of the most cultivated saxon kings but it wo n't make sense of a senseless murder or help change the mind of a violent bigot what we can also do , though , is accept that while the arts wo n't save us , we should save them anyway because the enemies of civilized society are always just outside the door

i understand aaron ross is new to playing safety , but his biting on a crossing route by celek instead of keeping deep contain on jackson is comical new rule put two men on jackson , and make the rest of the team hurt you just amazing 10 47 pm touchdown , giants hixon takes a short hitch route 61 yards for the score , taking full advantage of simply horrific philadelphia tackling to help the giants take the lead it s now 3130 that missed extra point looms large i m going to side with football outsiders here this has been an awfully played game on both sides simply sloppy we ve had nicks , despite his many drops , score a 60yard touchdown now hixon , who has fumbled on two kickoff returns , take a pass 60 yards for a score a win is a win , but neither team can feel good about its showing on the field 10 40 pm ruling stands as called it would have been tough to overturn , and the official call is that while manning was touched prior to taking his slide , that touch was not what caused him to fall to the turf it is clear , upon further review , that manning did take another two steps after a defender touched his back heel before sliding can we get joe girardi to come in for sliding practice \? \( judy agrees paging joe girardi , eli needs you too ! \) the giants had a great opportunity to take the lead there , though a threeandout for philadelphia will give the giants the ball back with significantly worse field position football outsiders tweets what a poorly played game does anyone want the football \? 10 35 pm the giants defense makes a huge play \( take that , rich \) , as linebacker jonathon goff intercepts mcnabb that s the first turnover of the game for the eagles , and another momentum building play for the giants goff did a nice job reading mcnabb , who was locked in on celek , and made an effective break on the ball the giants take over near the philadelphia 30 as i write this , the giants may have given it right back manning , scrambling to his left and out of the pocket , gains about 15 yards before sliding headfirst to a stop however , manning fumbled the ball as he hit the turf , and since officials ruled he went down untouched , that s a fumble \( if he had been touched as he went down , the ground would have caused the fumble , and the giants would keep possession \) coughlin will challenge , believing he was touched on his back heel as he went down , but there may not be enough to overturn the call if the call is overturned , the giants will have a first down near the eagles 15 if not , first down for the eagles , and a bullet dodged 10 28 pm a gamechanging decision , a gamechanging play \( perhaps \) for the giants for the second time this evening , coughlin dials up a dive to jacobs on fourthandshort the first time , in the first quarter , jacobs converted a fourth down at the eagles 29 this time , it s a touchdown from right on the goal line the giants cut the lead to 3024 , and that missed extra point looms large how often do we see a botched extra point come back to haunt a team \? a very impressive drive here by the giants , one that could serve as a momentum builder in the second half that conversion by jacobs really riled up this crowd , to be sure the times judy battista tweets \( should that be capitalized \? \) remember when they played defense in the nfc east \? what happened to those days \? a comment from rich in new haven echoes that point it is fitting that the giants 2009 defense is a throwback to the mid1970s unit when the meadowlands opened can t tackle , can t cover , can t make a big play 10 21 pm the giants offense continues to roll , opening up the second half with an impressive drive spanning from their own 26 to the philadelphia 14 our man hakeem nicks almost evens his tally to three drops , two receptions with his latest grab , which gave the giants their current field position andy reid and the eagles will challenge the catch , however , arguing that nicks did not have possession of the ball when he went out of bounds the call is confirmed as called first down at the 14 10 02 pm philadelphia calls vick s number from the one , and he takes it in off left end for his second touchdown of the game the giants block the extra point , so the score is 3017 a potentially big play from the special teams , but a devastating touchdown drive allowed by the defense i understand it s very much easier said than done , but i can t understand how you allow jackson to get free in the secondary if anything , bracket jackson and force a reggie brown to make plays another major disaster is averted as the half ends hixon , for the second time , fumbles on the kickoff it s the eagles who recover this time , but not before time runs out on the half on second look , the eagles clearly had possession of the fumble with two seconds remaining , but it can t be reviewed i guess only big 12 officials have the power to overturn an expired clock on the field as we head to the half , the giants need to clean up some sloppy play 9 59 pm another huge play by jackson , who is incredible he is able to find a hole in the secondary behind a cornerback and in front of a safety on a third down pass from mcnabb for a gain of 43 , and the eagles will be in great position to add at least a field goal you d think that the defense would make sure that jackson , of all people , would not get free in the secondary is he just that hard to cover \? the eagles face another third down and long two plays later , but mcnabb finds celek for a 24yard gain down to the one the giants must keep the eagles out of the end zone 9 52 pm touchdown , giants bradshaw bulldozes his way between the tackles for a sixyard score , and the lead is cut to seven it s the eagles 24 , giants 17 the giants have been very , very physical on the ground , a good omen for success as the game wears on two ways to look at this first half of play optimistically , the giants trail by only a touchdown despite allowing a defensive and special teams score on the other hand , the eagles lead by a touchdown despite not doing much \( not being on the field much \) on offense with 90 seconds left , let s see if the eagles can add points before heading to the half 9 45 pm can the giants respond \? so far , the answer is yes the running game is in full effect \( ahmad bradshaw doing most of the work \) , but manning continues to find open receivers in the philadelphia secondary not all his passes are being caught , to be honest , but his latest attempt finds an open steve smith for a new set of downs at the eagles six tough news for an already bangedup giants offensive line , as right tackle kareem mckenzie went down with an apparent lower body injury william beatty , the rookie out of connecticut , will take his place the giants offense is keeping this team in the game 9 38 pm touchdown , eagles desean jackson , who did not play last week due to a concussion , returns a jeff feagles punt 72 yards for six , tiptoeing down the left sideline to avoid a host of potential tacklers as al michaels pointed out , the giants thought the sideline would be their friend not the case he s the most explosive player in the nfl , and a serious weapon the eagles have a pair of nonoffensive touchdowns , and lead 2410 if i had told you that philadelphia would have two nonoffensive scores , would you have thought the giants would have any shot \? a major disaster averted on the ensuing kickoff return , as a domenik hixon fumble is recovered by the giants more twitter action from a friend of the fifth down , as football outsiders asks how does feagles not pin jackson in on the sideline there \? 9 33 pm the fifth down team of researchers will be tracking drops and catches for hakeem nicks throughout the evening his most recent drop gives him three for the game to go with one reception , albeit one that went for a touchdown rod gardner , a redskins receiver in the early 2000s , had the fitting nickname of 50 50 because of his penchant to drop , well , half the passes headed his way and to be sure , gardner did not take either of those catches to the house 9 28 pm you can make the point that the giants have outplayed the eagles through the first 25 minutes , at least statistically the giants have run 23 plays for 178 yards , while philadelphia has run 20 for 138 of course , the giants are aided greatly by the long touchdown catch and run by nicks the biggest statistic so far has been turnovers the giants lone give away \( the eagles have none \) was returned 60 yards for a touchdown by sheldon brown manning is 8 of 13 for 148 yards and a touchdown jacobs has 6 carries for 27 yards and the fumble 9 24 pm though the giants did force philadelphia into a quick punt on the eagles last series , it s pretty clear that the eagles have the personnel to move the ball both through the air and on the ground against this defense they are again inside the giants 10 cris collinsworth echoes a point joe made in his preview michael vick is beginning to resemble the player we all saw in atlanta , mainly because of his conditioning he has run for a first down and nearly thrown for a touchdown on this drive the pass was delivered late his receiver was open and aaron rouse was able to knock it away however , the eagles add a field goal , giving the giants a small win the score is now eagles 17 , giants 10  9 15 pm touchdown , hakeem nicks yes , nicks , who just dropped two successive passes , one of which should have gone for a score this time , instead of allowing the ball to come to him , the rookie went up and snagged this ball out of the air with his hands \( massive , by the way \) he dodged one defensive back before outrunning a pair of defenders into the end zone a 68yard score , and the giants trim the lead to 1410 hey , he s a rookie 9 10 pm and nicks drops a clear touchdown yes , there was illegal contact on the play which allowed the giants to convert a tough thirdand11 but nicks had at least one step on the closest philadelphia defender right off his mitts he could have strolled , a la sheldon brown , into the end zone one play later , he does it again and yes , again , the giants are saved by an illegal contact penalty i guess the giants could progress down field five yards at a time , but you have to catch the ball 9 05 pm nice series here for the giants defense , which forces the eagles into their first threeandout of the evening potentially solid field position off the punt is negated , however , after the giants are flagged for unnecessary roughness on the punt return it turns out that once you force a potential tackler out of bounds \( typically the gunner \) you cannot continue to block him into the first row of seats so the giants will open this series at their own 17 , not the 32 two plays earn little positive yardage , and we ve reached the end of the first quarter 8 57 pm a quick look at what some times reporters and friends of the fifth down are twittering the times judy battista oh boy football outsiders so we ll chart that as manning intercepted by 54jtrotter , laterals to 89kboss right \? more from judy giants settle for fg not good baba o reilly now on pa tho small victories 8 52 pm fourthandone from the eagles 29 , and the giants are going for it the big group comes in jacobs , in particular and it s jacobs getting the call , and he lowers his head and gets two yards to the 27 gutsy call by tom coughlin , and the right one the giants have some momentum and some luck on the following snap , manning s throw to kevin boss along the left sideline could have been \( should have been \) picked by linebacker jeremiah trotter , but the ball went through trotter s arms and to boss , who took it down to the eagles eight before being tackled the drive ends there , but the giants are able to add a field goal it s now eagles 14 , giants 3  8 48 pm i m really starting to like hakeem nicks , who just made a nice catchandrun off a quick slant al michaels raised a nice point , calling nicks the giants anquan boldin \( i would have thrown a poor man s in there \) but he is a nice , bigbodied receiver who is willing and able to go over the middle and used his physicality to make plays in traffic manning has made a pair of completions on this drive , and the giants are inside philadelphia territory 8 41 pm well , brandon jacobs fumbles , and sheldon brown brings it back 60 yards for a touchdown it s eagles 14 , giants 0 a clear fumble by jacobs , who had the ball knocked loose and forward by defensive end trent cole the ball bounced nicely into brown s waiting hands , and the veteran took a leisurely stroll down the sideline for six a disastrous turn the most important thing here \? maintaining the game plan and not allowing defensive touchdowns , i guess 8 38 pm it s not wise to make too much of one series , obviously , but you can t help but start thinking that yes , just maybe , this eagles offense has the giants number if that is the case \( and i m not necessarily saying that s the case \) , the giants will need to get consistent results out of their offense of course , as we all know , that means having a reliable run game to set up the pass the last thing you want to see is a shootout , however that scenario clearly favors the eagles 8 34 pm speaking of jackson , his ability to get behind the defense pays off immediately , as newlyperfect passer michael vick , lined up in the shotgun , finds his receiver for a 32yard gain down inside the giants red zone two plays later , donovan mcnabb hits brent celek on a tight end screen for an eightyard gain and a touchdown it s 70 eagles , and i ve just sat down shades of the 4017 destruction in philadelphia the last time these two teams met 8 25 pm the eagles have won the toss and will elect to receive remember , tonight s game puts first place on the line while the eagles , giants and cowboys will all hold identical records if the giants win , the giants will hold all the tiebreakers now , the eagles will hold a very nice lead in the nfc east with a win \( one game above the now 85 cowboys \) actually , if the eagles win and move to 94 you can pretty much eliminate the giants from anything more than wild card contention quick injury notes giants lineman chris snee and eagles receiver desean jackson are both active 8 10 pm joe provides a preview when the giants inactive list was announced for sunday night s home game against philadelphia , the biggest surprise was rocky bernard , the defensive tackle who has been a disappointment since joining the team as a free agent this season from seattle the biggest eagles name out of uniform was brian westbrook , the running back , who still has concussion symptoms his absence was no surprise it was announced friday in the offensive starting lineup for the giants , hakeem nicks replaced mario manningham at wide receiver on defense , aaron ross replaced cc brown at strong safety ross was a cornerback until he returned at midseason from a hamstring injury and bolstered the safety position that has been wanting since the seasonending knee surgery of kenny phillips other inactives for sunday night for the giants wr ramses barden db dj johnson rb gartrell johnson ot adam koets ot guy whimper wr sinorice moss te bear pascoe for the eagles qb kevin kolb cb geoffrey pope rb pj hill g mike mcglynn wr kevin curtis dt trevor laws the rain fell all day on giants stadium but lessened in its intensity in the hours just before kickoff and looked to be almost stopped an hour before kickoff workers used brooms and other tools to push the water off the artificial turf as fans filed in but the surface would likely be slick sheldon brown , the veteran cornerback of the eagles , was talking after practice last week about efforts to reduce the violence of collisions on the field he is not a big fan of the movement it s crazy , man , brown said twohand touch what is it , the ladies lingerie league \? regarding concussions , brown said i only know one way to play if i come in and close my eyes and my helmet happens to hit your helmet , i m sorry , but i ve got just as much risk of getting concussion as you lesean mccoy , the rookie running back who played last season in college at pittsburgh , compared the long grind of the nfl season with his workload as a panther when he got more carries physically , my body feels good , mccoy said last year at this time , i was hurting it s different now it s more mental just mental every day football , football , football the next week , same thing , for so long , all the way since training camp mccoy said playing the giants for the second time in a season is an adjustment from facing college rivals the weird thing is you ve got to play them again , that s kind of an nfl thing , he said the rivalry becomes a little bit bigger each time you play them michael vick , the backup quarterback of the eagles , said he has lost 15 pounds since the start of the season and now is about 210 i was 224 and i was like `oh , my god , ' vick said it took a while to do it losing weight takes a lot of dedication and commitment it s something i never had to do before eating the right foods you can exercise all you want but it s more about the diet all protein no carbs no cheese steaks i will say i feel a lot better than i did at the beginning of the year
i wrote about this particularly a year ago the american meteorological society is seeking input from its membership on a proposed position statement on geoengineering \( downloadable as a pdf file at the preceding link \) this is the menu of potential but largely untested ways to counteract global warming resulting from the buildup of greenhouse gases , should reality start to reflect worstcase projections the draft statement is below members of the meteorological society have until april 23 to submit comments you can comment anytime here , of course there s also a lively discussion of the meteorological society s draft statement at the geoengineering google group  such statements have raised hackles before , mainly because they can never fully reflect the variegated views of experts when i wrote about the american geophysical union s statement on global warming , i had to close out comments at 1 , 200 \( i really do have to nudge the sociologists who promised to study that comment string \) here goes ams policy statement on geoengineering the climate system , draft , 7 march , 2009 human activities have very likely caused most of the welldocumented change in global climate over the last half century unchecked future greenhouse gas emissions , particularly of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels , will almost certainly lead to additional climate impacts such as further global warming , continued sea level rise , greater rainfall intensity , more serious and pervasive droughts , enhanced heat stress episodes , ocean acidification , and the disruption of many biological systems the resulting inundation of coastal areas , severe weather impacts and loss of ecosystem services will likely cause major negative impacts for most nations three strategies could potentially help reduce the risks of climate change 1 \) reduce emissions \( mitigation \) , 2 \) moderate impacts by increasing our capacity to cope with them \( adaptation \) , and 3 \) deliberately manipulate largescale physical , chemical or biological aspects of the climate system to counteract the climate effects of increasing greenhouse gas emissions \( geoengineering the climate system \) this policy statement addresses geoengineering geoengineering could conceivably offer targeted and fastacting options to reduce acute climate impacts and provide strategies of last resort if abrupt , catastrophic or otherwise unacceptable climate change impacts become unavoidable by other means however , geoengineering must be viewed with great caution because manipulating the earth system is almost certain to trigger some adverse and unpredictable consequences furthermore , these impacts would almost certainly be distributed unevenly among nations and people , raising serious ethical issues research to date has not determined that there are largescale geoengineering approaches for which the benefits would substantially outweigh the detriments geoengineering proposals fall into at least three broad categories 1 \) managing atmospheric greenhouse gases \( eg , ocean fertilization and atmospheric carbon capture and sequestration \) , 2 \) cooling the earth by reflecting sunlight \( eg , putting reflective particles into the atmosphere , putting mirrors in space to reflect the sun s energy , increasing surface reflectivity and altering the amount or characteristics of clouds \) , and 3 \) moderating specific impacts of global warming \( eg , efforts to limit sea level rise by increasing land storage of water , protecting ice sheets or artificially enhancing mountain glaciers \) geoengineering proposals differ widely in their potential to reduce impacts , create new risks and redistribute risk among nations for example , reflecting sunlight would likely reduce the earth s average temperature but could also change global circulation with potentially serious consequences such as changing storm tracks and precipitation patterns throughout the world as with inadvertent humaninduced climate change , the consequences of such actions would almost certainly not be the same for all nations and individuals , thus raising legal , ethical , diplomatic and even national security concerns exploration of geoengineering strategies also creates potential risks developing any new capacity will require resources , possibly drawn from more productive uses the possibility of quick and seemingly inexpensive geoengineering fixes could distract the public and policy makers from critically needed efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build society s capacity to deal with unavoidable climate impacts geoengineering technologies , once developed , may enable shortsighted and unwise deployment , with potentially serious unforeseen consequences even if reasonably effective and beneficial over all , none of the geoengineering approaches proposed to date would alleviate all of the serious impacts from increasing greenhouse gas emissions for example , enhancing solar reflection would not alleviate direct effects of the rise in co2 concentration such as ocean acidification or changes to the structure and function of biological systems still , the threat of climate change is serious mitigation efforts so far have been limited in magnitude , tentative in implementation and insufficient for slowing climate change enough to avoid potentially serious societal impacts not all of the expected climate change impacts can be managed through adaptation thus , it is prudent to consider geoengineering s potential , to understand its limits and to avoid rash deployment therefore , the american meteorological society recommends 1 \) enhanced research on the scientific and technological potential for geoengineering the climate system , including research on the unintended as well as intended environmental responses 2 \) additional study of the historical , ethical , legal , political and societal aspects of the geoengineering issues 3 \) development and analysis of policy options to promote transparency and international cooperation in exploring geoengineering options along with restrictions on reckless efforts to manipulate the climate system geoengineering will not substitute for either aggressive mitigation or proactive adaptation it could contribute to a comprehensive risk management strategy to slow climate change and alleviate its negative impacts , but the potential for adverse and unintended consequences implies a need for adequate research , appropriate regulation and transparent consideration
when the big east expanded to 16 teams in 2005 and decided to continue playing its postseason basketball tournament with only the top 12 , its coaches were relentless in their criticism they maintained that not reaching the big east tournament would turn into a coach killer that failing to earn a trip to new york would cost them their jobs their concerns might not have been fully realized the past few years , but the big east adopted a 16team format for its 2009 tournament with the coachkilling benchmark no longer in place , no big east coaches are expected to be fired this spring that development may have nothing to do with the tournament s expansion the country s economic decline has had an impact on every conference , from the bigbudget big east to the tiny america east with multimilliondollar buyouts tougher to afford , it is a good year to have a bad season the economy is going to heighten the decisionmaking more so than any time in the last 25 years , said dan gavitt , the big east s associate commissioner in charge of basketball the length of contracts and obligations that the institutions have to their coaches is not insignificant to the decisionmaking process when the stock market was soaring , universities had no problem shelling out big buyouts if they were trying to revive their basketball programs from 2006 to 2008 , 124 jobs turned over in college basketball but now , a new reality has settled over the typically volatile college basketball world i think there s a lot of coaches having bad years thankful for the bad economy , nevada coach mark fox said schools just are n't going to be able to afford to make changes from the standpoints of perception and reality , times have changed drastically at private and public colleges a university that is laying off staff and faculty members would take a publicrelations beating if it paid out a substantial amount of money to fire its basketball coach , then had to fork over even more to bring in somebody new many athletic departments are suffering from lagging ticket sales and slumping advertising revenue the crunch is especially acute at universities that lack revenue from a toptier football program st john s , seton hall and depaul have struggled in recent years , and they receive no money from the big east s football coffers norm roberts of st john s , bobby gonzalez of seton hall and jerry wainwright of depaul have yet to lead their team to the tournament but none of them seem to be going anywhere that can be attributed , at least in part , to their employment at private colleges , which tend to rely heavily on fundraising where our schools are really being hit is in fundraising , big east commissioner mike tranghese said i think everyone is feeling it it s not a good time for anyone dave maggard , the university of houston s athletic director , predicted a lot more scrutiny for public universities that make expensive coaching changes he said that the use of state money would come under increasing scrutiny , especially considering that many universities , even the larger and more visible ones , lose money on their athletic programs a lot of places , even the big places , are running deficit budgets today , maggard said i think you 're going to see some real pulling back and i think some real effort to economize in every way possible there have been at least 40 coaching changes a year in college basketball over the last 15 years over the past three years , the turnover has averaged 56 that number is likely to dip steve mcclain , an assistant at colorado , said that he wondered if he might still be the coach at wyoming if the economy were this bad when he was fired in 2007 he posted a record of 157115 in nine seasons at wyoming and won an ncaa tournament game in 2002 the university paid more than a halfmillion dollars to buy him out it s pretty hard to justify a 500 , 000 buyout right now when people are losing their jobs , mcclain said it s definitely affected what s going on in our business still , jobs are open at arizona , georgia and alabama those positions will probably create a ripple effect , opening up jobs at lower levels and inevitably , changes will be made boston university , which plays in the america east , stunned the coaching community last week by firing dennis wolff the university will have to spend more than 1 million to buy out his contract before the firing , america east commissioner patrick nero said i think that people are thinking these decisions a little bit longer and hesitating to pull that trigger quick i think we 've become too quicktrigger after wolff s firing , he declined to comment some people involved in college athletics said that the coaching churn would continue it will be logical to say it might change the situation a little bit , the sports consultant kevin o'malley said but you ca n't tread water in the highest levels of college athletics you 're either moving forward or backwards , and the pressures normally in place are still there one thing virtually everyone agrees on is this if there is a slowdown in firings , it will not last long if the economic downturn slows coaching movement because of the high cost of transition , it will likely only be temporary , missouri valley commissioner doug elgin said coaching talent will always be hotly pursued which means that soon enough , it will once again be a bad year to have a bad season
the roars cascading out of arthur ashe stadium for a women s match on monday might have been as surprising as the fact that they were for a 17yearold upstart , melanie oudin men s tennis has grown to be more dynamic than the women s game , but in this , that trend has turned around with women s seeds dropping as if felled by a plague , the men have stuck somewhat maddeningly to form crowds had hoped that john isner would be the men s equivalent to oudin , but isner stepped aside rather quietly in a of spain , one round after accomplishing the most notable upset on the men s side by knocking off no 5 andy roddick meanwhile , no 1 roger federer rolled through his fourthround match over no 14 tommy robredo while barely disturbing his hair the lone result that could even appear to be an upset was no 12 robin soderling s advancing to the quarterfinals , but that came when no 8 nikolay davydenko retired with a leg injury in the third set when oudin rallied past no 13 nadia petrova to set up a quarterfinal match against no 9 caroline wozniacki , even the men took notice i mean , she s beaten great players on the way now , federer said i think it s nice for a change that somebody s coming up we have n't heard about it much before , because it seems like many women now are kind of known i think this is very exciting and very much needed on the women s side federer has done his best to extinguish any excitement he toiled a bit in the first set of his 75 , 62 , 62 victory , but a few games into the second , robredo was looking skyward for answers to federer s game and unflappable psyche he found none when he saw that he was up a set , he start hitting harder and with confidence , robredo said then it s tough to handle it so then you have to try to hit harder sometimes then the match goes so easy for him isner , the only unseeded men s player in the fourth round and one of only two not seeded 16th or higher , had tried to prevent a shutout of americans in the men s quarterfinals , something that had never happened in the open era until now i wanted to keep it going , isner said i did n't really expect to be if you would have told me i 'd be the last american , only one american make the final 16 , i probably would have thought maybe one or two more would have isner looked strong early , grabbing a late break of verdasco s serve to win the first set but verdasco improved his serve in the second and isner could not even sniff another break point at 24 , isner is still developing weapons other than his serve verdasco , 25 , has made big strides in his game over the past year , reaching the semifinals of the australian open after never getting further than the fourth round in any grand slam tournament he has a much more powerful game than many spanish players , who tend to be claycourt specialists verdasco will meet no 4 novak djokovic , on monday night up next in the quarterfinals for federer is soderling , the player he defeated to win the first title of his career in june , and also the player he defeated in the fourth round on his way to the title at wimbledon soderling , 25 , is trying not only to give a jolt to his own erratic career but also to help boost swedish tennis a country with a proud tradition of champions like bjorn borg , stefan edberg and mats wilander has found itself bereft of talent in the sport soderling is the perhaps that is why magnus norman , once the no 2 player in the world , took him on as a coaching project last year that project has been a smashing success soderling accomplished the unthinkable at the french open , and reaching the final when he lost to federer at wimbledon , it obscured the fact that it was his best showing in that tournament as well before this year , he had never advanced beyond the third round at the open he suddenly finds himself rekindling hope back in sweden i got a lot of attention , especially after paris , in sweden , soderling said for me , it feels really good that the tennis is getting bigger in sweden again i think that s really what we need , and hopefully , i can inspire young kids to start playing tennis again inspiration is something the men s field here could use
chicago as president obama and his national security team confer this week to consider strategies for afghanistan , one point seems clear our current military forces cannot win the war gen stanley mcchrystal , the top american commander there , has asked for 40 , 000 or more additional united states troops , which many are calling an ambitious new course in truth , it is not new and it is not bold enough america will best serve its interests in afghanistan and the region by shifting to a new strategy of offshore balancing , which relies on air and naval power from a distance , while also working with local security forces on the ground the reason for this becomes clear when one examines the rise of terrorist attacks in afghanistan in recent years general mcchrystal s own explains that american and nato military forces themselves are a major cause of the deteriorating situation , for two reasons first , western forces have become increasingly viewed as foreign occupiers as the report puts it , overreliance on firepower and force protection have severely damaged the international security assistance force s legitimacy in the eyes of the afghan people second , the central government led by america s chosen leader , hamid karzai , is thoroughly corrupt and viewed as illegitimate local afghan communities are unable to hold local officials accountable through either direct elections or judicial processes , especially when those individuals are protected by senior government officials unfortunately , these political facts dovetail strongly with developments on the battlefield in the last few years in 2001 , the united states toppled the taliban and kicked al qaeda out of afghanistan with just a few thousand of its own troops , primarily through the combination of american air power and local ground forces from the northern alliance then , for the next several years , the united states and nato modestly increased their footprint to about 20 , 000 troops , mainly limiting the mission to guarding kabul , the capital up until 2004 , there was little terrorism in afghanistan and little sense that things were deteriorating then , in 2005 , the united states and nato began to systematically extend their military presence across afghanistan the goals were to defeat the tiny insurgency that did exist at the time , eradicate poppy crops and encourage local support for the central government western forces were deployed in all major regions , including the pashtun areas in the south and east , and today have ballooned to more than 100 , 000 troops as western occupation grew , the use of the two most worrisome forms of terrorism in afghanistan suicide attacks and homemade bombs escalated in parallel there were no recorded suicide attacks in afghanistan before 2001 according to data i have collected , in the immediate aftermath of america s conquest , the nation experienced only a small number none in 2002 , two in 2003 , five in 2004 and nine in 2005 but in 2006 , suicide attacks began to increase by an order of magnitude with 97 in 2006 , 142 in 2007 , 148 in 2008 and more than 60 in the first half of 2009 moreover , the overwhelming percentage of the suicide attacks \( 80 percent \) has been against united states and allied troops or their bases rather than afghan civilians , and nearly all \( 95 percent \) carried out by afghans the pattern for other terrorist attacks is almost the same the most deadly involve roadside bombs that detonate on contact or are set off by remote control although these weapons were a relatively minor nuisance in the early years of the occupation , with 782 attacks in 2005 , their use has shot up since to 1 , 739 in 2006 , nearly 2 , 000 in 2007 and more than 3 , 200 last year again , these attacks have for the most part been carried out against western combat forces , not afghan targets the picture is clear the more western troops we have sent to afghanistan , the more the local residents have viewed themselves as under foreign occupation , leading to a rise in suicide bombings and other terrorist attacks \( we see this pattern pretty much any time an outside armed force has tried to pacify a region , from the west bank to kashmir to sri lanka \) so as general mcchrystal looks to change course in afghanistan , the priority should be not to send more soldiers but to end the sense of the united states and its allies as foreign occupiers our purpose in afghanistan is to prevent future attacks like 9 11 , which requires stopping the rise of a new generation of antiamerican terrorists , particularly suicide terrorists , who are superpredators able to kill large numbers of innocent people what motivates suicide attackers , however , is not the existence of a terrorist sanctuary , but the presence of foreign forces on territory they prize so it s little surprise that western forces in afghanistan have provided a key rallying point for the insurgency , playing a central role in the taliban s recruitment campaign and propaganda , which threaten not only our troops there but also our homeland the presence of our troops also works against the stability of the central government , as it can rely on western protection rather than work harder for popular support fortunately , the united states does not need to station large ground forces in afghanistan to keep it from being a significant safe haven for al qaeda or any other antiamerican terrorists this can be achieved by a strategy that relies on overthehorizon air , naval and rapidly deployable ground forces , combined with training and equipping local groups to oppose the taliban no matter what happens in afghanistan , the united states is going to maintain a strong air and naval presence in the persian gulf and indian ocean for many years , and these forces are well suited to attacking terrorist leaders and camps in conjunction with local militias just as they did against the taliban and al qaeda in 2001 the united states has a strong history of working with local groups , particularly the tajiks and uzbeks of the old northern alliance , who would ensure that the taliban does not recapture kabul and the northern and western regions of afghanistan and should more substantial threats arise , our offshore forces and allies would buy time and protect space for western ground forces to return further , the united states and its allies have made some efforts to lead pashtun tribal militias in the southern and eastern areas to abandon their support for the taliban and , if not switch to america s side , to at least stay neutral for instance , the largest british gains in the southwest came from winning the support of mullah salam , a former taliban commander who is the district governor of musa qala early this year the united states started what it calls the afghanistan social outreach program , offering monthly stipends to tribal and local leaders in exchange for their cooperation against the taliban insurgency the program is financed at too low a level approximately 20 million a year to compete with alternatives that the taliban can offer like protection for poppy cultivation that is worth some 3 billion a year one reason we can expect a strategy of local empowerment to work is that this is precisely how the taliban is gaining support as general mcchrystal s report explains , there is little ideological loyalty between the local pashtuns and the taliban , so the terrorists gain local support by capitalizing on vast unemployment by empowering the young and disenfranchised through cash payments , weapons , and prestige we 'll have to be more creative and rely on larger economic and political carrots to win over the hearts and minds of the pashtuns changing strategy does not mean that the united states can withdraw all its military power from afghanistan immediately as we are now seeing in iraq , changing to an approach that relies less on ground power and more on working with local actors takes time but it is the best strategy for afghanistan otherwise we will continue to be seen and mistrusted as an occupying power , and the war will be lost
socrates talked the assumption behind his approach to philosophy , and the approaches of millions of people since , is that moral thinking is mostly a matter of reason and deliberation think through moral problems find a just principle apply it one problem with this kind of approach to morality , as michael gazzaniga writes in his 2008 book , human , is that it has been hard to find any correlation between moral reasoning and proactive moral behavior , such as helping other people in fact , in most studies , none has been found today , many psychologists , cognitive scientists and even philosophers embrace a different view of morality in this view , moral thinking is more like aesthetics as we look around the world , we are constantly evaluating what we see seeing and evaluating are not two separate processes they are linked and basically simultaneous as steven quartz of the california institute of technology said during a recent discussion of ethics sponsored by the john templeton foundation , our brain is computing value at every fraction of a second everything that we look at , we form an implicit preference some of those make it into our awareness some of them remain at the level of our unconscious , but what our brain is for , what our brain has evolved for , is to find what is of value in our environment think of what happens when you put a new food into your mouth you do n't have to decide if it s disgusting you just know you do n't have to decide if a landscape is beautiful you just know moral judgments are like that they are rapid intuitive decisions and involve the emotionprocessing parts of the brain most of us make snap moral judgments about what feels fair or not , or what feels good or not we start doing this when we are babies , before we have language and even as adults , we often ca n't explain to ourselves why something feels wrong in other words , reasoning comes later and is often guided by the emotions that preceded it or as jonathan haidt of the university of virginia memorably wrote , the emotions are , in fact , in charge of the temple of morality , and moral reasoning is really just a servant masquerading as a high priest the question then becomes what shapes moral emotions in the first place \? the answer has long been evolution , but in recent years there s an increasing appreciation that evolution is n't just about competition it s also about cooperation within groups like bees , humans have long lived or died based on their ability to divide labor , help each other and stand together in the face of common threats many of our moral emotions and intuitions reflect that history we do n't just care about our individual rights , or even the rights of other individuals we also care about loyalty , respect , traditions , religions we are all the descendents of successful cooperators the first nice thing about this evolutionary approach to morality is that it emphasizes the social nature of moral intuition people are not discrete units coolly formulating moral arguments they link themselves together into communities and networks of mutual influence the second nice thing is that it entails a warmer view of human nature evolution is always about competition , but for humans , as darwin speculated , competition among groups has turned us into pretty cooperative , empathetic and altruistic creatures at least within our families , groups and sometimes nations the third nice thing is that it explains the haphazard way most of us lead our lives without destroying dignity and choice moral intuitions have primacy , haidt argues , but they are not dictators there are times , often the most important moments in our lives , when in fact we do use reason to override moral intuitions , and often those reasons along with new intuitions come from our friends the rise and now dominance of this emotional approach to morality is an epochal change it challenges all sorts of traditions it challenges the bookish way philosophy is conceived by most people it challenges the talmudic tradition , with its hyperrational scrutiny of texts it challenges the new atheists , who see themselves involved in a war of reason against faith and who have an unwarranted faith in the power of pure reason and in the purity of their own reasoning finally , it should also challenge the very scientists who study morality they 're good at explaining how people make judgments about harm and fairness , but they still struggle to explain the feelings of awe , transcendence , patriotism , joy and selfsacrifice , which are not ancillary to most people s moral experiences , but central the evolutionary approach also leads many scientists to neglect the concept of individual responsibility and makes it hard for them to appreciate that most people struggle toward goodness , not as a means , but as an end in itself
chisinau , on wednesday , moldova s parliament building was seared black from fire , and its ceremonial entryway was spraypainted with crossedout hammers and sickles filing cabinets lay where they crashed to the ground the night before , while office papers were tangled in the boughs of pine trees ruslan grosu , 21 , stood outside , trying to make sense of it a little revolution happened here , he said there is this power in our youth , and they should respect our wishes but from inside the building came the bleak sound of workers knocking out broken windows , and mr grosu felt compelled to add this almost all of us think it is bad and evil , what happened here we are not thieves , he said a day after a huge anticommunist rally turned violent in chisinau , moldova s capital , everyone was speculating about who was behind it president vladimir voronin said the event had been planned by romanians , and called for the romanian ambassador to leave within 24 hours youth activists charged that opposition parties had hijacked an otherwise peaceful crowd for their own purposes and the opposition leader vlad filat said authorities had allowed the protests to get out of hand in order to portray the president s challengers as extremists but dumitru minzarari , a political analyst , thought the best answer was the simplest one it was a spontaneous event , said mr minzarari , who works at , a policy research organization here the real reason behind this was that young people just revolted these are not sovieteducated people who are submissive and afraid to get into the streets nobody was killed in tuesday s violence , but 118 police officers needed medical assistance and 43 of them were hospitalized , said alla meleka , a spokeswoman for the moldovan interior ministry the city ambulance service reported that 79 civilians received medical care and that 14 of them were hospitalized crowds gathered again on wednesday in the city s main square , but it was a chastened group of around 1 , 000 , a fraction of the 10 , 000 to 15 , 000 estimated on tuesday during tuesday s protests , 193 people were arrested , ms meleka said moldova s prosecutor general s office announced that it would investigate each case and pursue criminal charges against organizers the half dozen young activists who enlisted twitter , facebook and to organize a flash mob on monday have withdrawn from the protests entirely in an interview , one activist , natalia morar , 25 , said that she expected to face charges , and that she and other organizers had received phone calls that were not so much threats as warnings that we will be in very big danger during the next few days what bothers her the most , she said , is the suggestion that she and her friends somehow contributed to the violence , which she watched on television believe me , there is nothing at all enjoyable about it , she said the protests have exposed a split in moldova , the first postsoviet state to vote communists back into power mr voronin was elected president in 2001 on a wave of deep disappointment that the soviet collapse had brought moldova little but poverty , corruption and civil war mr voronin , who once led the moldovan kgb , won reelection in 2005 pledging to renew relations with europe and strengthen democratic institutions but many of his opponents saw his commitments as hollow many of the young see , a european union member just southwest of moldova , as a symbol of promise there have been shortlived movements to unite the countries , which were one from 1918 to 1940 that played down romanian influence prompted protests in the capital a main complaint among youths in the recent protests was about the government s restrictions on passage into romania as protesters flooded the parliament building on tuesday , one raised a romanian flag on the roof , something that mr voronin pointed out wednesday we know that certain forces from romania masterminded these riots , he said , according to the interfax news agency romanian flags which were planted on state buildings in chisinau prove this the protests were first called on monday , after preliminary parliamentary election results showed that the communist party had won about half the vote , giving its deputies enough leverage to appoint the next president helen pascari , who gathered in the square with friends , said none of her peers had expected communists to hold onto power for another fouryear presidential term we want some changes in our country , she said any kind of changes
centre court at wimbledon , roland garros stadium in paris , the foro italico in rome and arthur ashe stadium in new york now have company in spain it is time to add la caja m gica to the grand tour of tennis showplaces it is the new , avantgarde home of the combined men s and women s event in madrid and an it features three main courts with retractable roofs , all in the same arena , and it is a shapeshifting statement of the spanish capital s ambition to become a nexus for international sport a tennis taj mahal , said ion tiriac , the owner of the  la caja m gica is spanish for the magic box , although the origins of the nickname for the main arena in the manzanares park tennis center are actually french the architect dominique perrault used the term la bo te magique to headline his successful proposal for the tennis complex it s a box that transforms itself constantly closed , open or illuminated , perrault said in a telephone interview last week the box s three adjustable roofs are its signature feature , giving madrid instant bragging rights over any other tennis tournament , home of the australian open , has two stadiums with retractable roofs , no longer seeing anything quaint in rain delays , is about to inaugurate a translucent , retractable roof over its venerable centre court but the roofs at the caja m gica , which can open or close in 20 minutes , are a step beyond , in that they are all independent elements of the same structure and , unlike melbourne s roofs , they do not simply slide they also are configured to be lifted like the lid of a box , which can make the top resemble kinetic sculpture we can be 100 percent outdoors , and in that case , the roof slides , perrault said and then there are these intermediate positions which are very comfortable and which give the feeling of being outdoors but also protect the courts from the wind the box is also not constructed with walls it s constructed with a metal casing that acts like a big curtain that lets the air pass through but stops the sun and the wind and also the rain at night , the box is a magic lantern the light comes from the interior of the building , and then , at that moment , it lights up the entire curtain and the facade disappears , and we see the structures of the stadium inside the stadium court seats approximately 12 , 500 and has been named for the tournament director and former spanish men s champion manuel santana , the second court seats approximately 5 , 000 and has been named for the former spanish women s champion arantxa s nchez vicario the third seats 3 , 000 and might already be named for rafael nadal if he were not still in his prime there are also four other match courts outside as part of the larger complex , with la caja m gica linked to the surrounding neighborhoods by a pedestrian pathway perrault is no stranger to bold and symbolic projects he was a youngster by architecture standards , still in his 30s , when he won the competition to design the new french national library in paris his four highrise towers on the left bank of the seine did not lack for detractors , but perrault has become one of the and has taken on projects as diverse as a theater in japan , a hotel in barcelona and the olympic pool and velodrome in berlin , which , until now , was his most prominent sportsrelated project perrault sounds eager to do more i think an arena or stadium is one of the only places in a city where a crowd can experience an event emotionally and physically in a live context , he said there is no internet , no television , none of these information systems that externalize the event we are physically there , from the moment when the goal is scored or the first ball hit there is a before and after we live it there is suspense , real suspense that is something that is becoming rarer in our society where so much information circulates , and we do n't often experience events in such a personal manner anymore i think stadiums are places where we have this feeling we are in the moment to reach this moment required seven years of planning and about 180 million euros \( about 2544 million \) of public financing , provided with the olympic bids for 2012 and now 2016 in mind in tennis , i like to steal a formula one analogy and say that we 've drafted off the olympic movement to an extent , said larry scott , the chairman of the wta tour , whose circuit now has a new stadium in beijing for another of its toptier events because of last year s olympics perrault contended that spain , with its tennis tradition and present strength , would have gotten its cuttingedge tennis stadium eventually but agreed that the olympic bid was a powerful lever as the confluence of events would have it , the international olympic committee task force that is assessing each of the four candidates for 2016 visited madrid this week the same week la caja m gica opened and the same week perrault acknowledged having le trac jitters as he shared the moment with prime minister jos luis rodr guez zapatero and mayor alberto ruizgallard n of madrid perrault , it turns out , has a personal connection to tennis , although he no longer plays as a youngster living in the paris suburbs , he worked as a ball boy at the french open just once , he said and that was a long time ago
in the political sense , barack obama came out of nowhere and both his democratic primary opponents and john mccain in the general election tried to persuade voters of the risks of electing someone with so sparse a past , telling them that we don t know who he is ! this raises a bigger question how well do we really know any politician , no matter how long he s been in the public eye \? history holds a cautionary lesson january 1969 the month came with gusts of freezing rain and murky ice fog hovering over the potomac yet washington s welcome was warm with hope and the promise of change after a prodigal rise , searing defeats , and a stunning comeback , richard milhous nixon became the 37th president of the united states at 56 , with more than two decades on the national stage , he was a familiar figure elected to congress in 1946 and the senate in 1950 , he had been in politics scarcely six years before he became vice president under dwight eisenhower he lost the presidency to john f kennedy in 1960 in one of the closest , most controversial races in the nation s history when he suffered humiliating defeat in a 1962 bid to be governor of california , his political life seemed over then , gradually , political havoc and his own dogged resolve gave him another chance with gov george wallace of alabama draining democratic votes as a third candidate , nixon s 1968 victory over vice president hubert humphrey was a bare 434 percent to 427 percent he had won the presidency at last the america nixon now led was deeply divided by rising opposition to the vietnam war , along with a seething reaction to cultural and racial upheavals of the 1960s historians would ponder into the 21st century the complex character of that wider turmoil both more and less transformative than clich s had it the impact at the time was epic , cast in fire and blood urban riots , campus revolts , the withdrawal of president lyndon johnson from his reelection bid , the assassinations of the rev dr martin luther king jr and robert kennedy , the violent police suppression of antiwar demonstrators at the democratic national convention , governor wallace s 46 electoral votes marking a historic realignment of party politics in the south all that and more made 1968 the most tumultuous election year in modern american politics that furor was a staple of nixon s triumph but no politician of his rank had been more partisan and divisive he had fueled his early rise with crude chauvinism , impugning the patriotism of opponents if he embodied much of the virtue and striving of the great postwar american middle class , he also played to its fears , resentments and prejudices even in successive efforts at political makeover in the 1950s and 60s , cultivating the imagery of a new nixon , he harbored rancor and blame for a host of perceived enemies as he bitterly told reporters in his supposed last press conference after losing the california gubernatorial race , they would not have nixon to kick around any more yet in 1968 silhouetted against fractured democrats as well as his own campaign themes of restoring law and order and a vague but welcome plan to end the war with honor he came to office as a symbol of longedfor stability and even conciliation for a strifeworn country there was haunting paradox in the anticipation some constituencies , especially in the south , expecting the president to avenge or uphold their interests others believing he was the leader to transcend old antagonisms , including his own a lot of people that year , even his opponents , saw in him what they wanted , his aide john ehrlichman later said , even if what they wanted was very different divider as unifier , attacker as peacemaker , it was a role the new president embraced he would be guided , nixon said after his victory , by a sign he saw in a campaign crowd bring us together a later era , weary of its own redblue divisions , might have called it all postpartisan his inaugural went on in a cold drizzle , with a relatively somber crowd of 250 , 000 compared to johnson s 12 million four years before between podium and audience the bulletproof partition was a grim token , wrote the washington post , of the assassinations which so suddenly had altered the political fortunes of the leaders present but the new president s speech , often forgotten in the tangled history that followed , was arguably the finest of his long career , confirming the disparate hopes riding that january in these difficult years america has suffered from a fever of words from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading we cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices for its part , government will listen we will strive to listen in new ways to the voices of quiet anguish , the voices that speak without words , the voices of the heart to the injured voices , the anxious voices , the voices that have despaired of being heard he went on to speak of rebuilding our cities and improving our rural areas and protecting our environment and enhancing the quality of life , including an eloquent if oblique reference to civil rights what remains is to give life to what is in the law to ensure at last that as all are born equal in dignity before god , all are born equal in dignity before man and , invoking the better angels of our nature , he spoke of own deepseated sense of mission the greatest title history can bestow is the title of peacemaker this honor now beckons america the chance to help lead the world at last out of the valley of turmoil and onto that high ground of peace that man has dreamed of since the dawn of civilization to the crisis of the spirit we need an answer of the spirit we need only look within ourselves we have endured a long night of the american spirit but as our eyes catch the dimness of the first rays of dawn , let us not curse the remaining dark let us gather the light those last words moved some to tears , and would seem all the more impressive for being echoed in private notes nixon jotted before and after the inauguration on his ubiquitous yellow legal pads each day a chance to do something memorable for someone need to be good to do good the nation must be better in spirit at the end of term the nixon transition headquartered at the elegant hotel pierre on fifth avenue across from central park in manhattan and described in the press as brilliantly managed and silken smooth was reported to give every sign of that better prospect , and from news media once thought hostile , praise for the new government was fulsome for a revitalization of the white house staff , it was reported , the president had enlisted not only two gifted aides from the campaign , chief of staff hr bob haldeman and white house counsel john ehrlichman , but also , to head a new urban affairs council in a bipartisan spirit , former kennedyjohnson democratic official daniel patrick moynihan and from the camp of nixon s republican rival nelson rockefeller , a little known harvard professor , henry kissinger , as national security advisor these new men , america was told , were relaxed and almost mellow , with what life magazine called remarkable ease and sense of pleasure and , according to the washington post , none of the moralistic sense of good guys replacing bad guys kissinger especially impressed journalists with his openness and modesty he would be doing quiet thinking about foreign policy , he told them , and no operating or selfaggrandizement in diplomacy the columnist joseph kraft , who would soon be a frequent kissinger contact , thought it all made for an era of better feeling background briefings assured the media that there would be no bureaucratic wars , with the white house overshadowing the cabinet , as in past presidencies introduced by nixon in a specially staged ceremony broadcast live by television networks , each extolled in turn , the new cabinet secretaries would be nothing less than deputy presidents who run their own departments , and the oval office always open to them the same collaboration was pledged to congress , where nixon was the first president in more than a century without his party having a majority in at least one chamber bipartisan cooperation , moynihan told a congressional group as kissinger looked on smiling broadly , will be our watchword he knows he needs us , senate majority leader mike mansfield would say confidently of the president not least , there was a solemn promise to an already admiring media truth will be the hallmark of the nixon administration , announced herb klein , the white house communications director altogether , concludes rick perlstein in nixonland , his colorful and authoritative history of the era published last year , the weeks around the 1969 inauguration saw a remarkably successful public relations campaign selling the new presidency as a magnanimous respite from a cacophonous era of division but as not even some of the sellers understood until later to say nothing of the congress , media , and public who did the buying that image was very different from the inner reality of the nixon presidency as we now know from memoirs , official archives , testimony and various other sources , what white house aides came to call the dark side of the moon was there from the start the supposedly smooth and hardworking transition was a sham we did have a couple of meetings , but basically we were left on our own to compose the government , remembered ehrlichman , who was at the center of the process the personnel process was a shambles not surprisingly , the disarray traced largely to nixon himself by several accounts , a president that the nation now assumed to be so experienced and ready to lead in fact had little purpose beyond his longtime ambition to be a global statesman and scant interest in much of governance domestic policy he thought a bore , or , as he once put it , building outhouses in peoria when dick was finally elected president he attained eighty percent of all goals in his life , bryce harlow , one of his longtime closest friends and advisors , confided to an associate before the inauguration he has no idea of what he will do after he is sworn in harlow was not quite right the new president had definite ideas about keeping power in his own hands the cabinet he publicly announced as deputy presidents with an open door to the oval office he privately derided as clowns , idiots or worse keep them away from me ! he ordered haldeman when kissinger soon after the inaugural told him how much he admired some of the cabinet \( pointedly excluding his rivals , secretary of state william rogers and defense secretary melvin laird \) , but then said he felt obliged to mention the suspect foreign ties of one of the other department heads , nixon brushed it aside oh , henry , nixon shot back , they re all dirty behind the revitalization of the white house staff was a deliberate , almost total and ultimately insidious concentration of power in the presidency that would exclude and demonize most of the rest of government the new president s relaxed and mellow men would be charged , as haldeman put it in an early staff meeting , to move over and through anyone who gets in our way the monopoly was most complete , most venomous , and eventually most famous in kissinger s dominance of foreign relations from his deceptively small office in the white house basement if little else had been accomplished in the suites of the hotel pierre , it at least had been the scene of a transition coup d etat in the making of foreign policy not long after the inaugural , secretary of state rogers was presented with a new presidential directive vesting decisive power in the national security advisor the nixonkissinger duopoly could now begin the ultrasecret diplomacy and covert actions secret from most of the rest of government as well as the public that would make much of the dramatic , and tragic , history of the next fiveandahalf years foreign policy was hardly the only secret as for bipartisanship and collaboration with a democratic congress none of them will help us and none of them are worth a damn , nixon told an early staff meeting just ignore em as for the elegant passage on civil rights in the inaugural address nothing should happen in the south without checking with dent , nixon said , giving veto power to his special counsel harry dent , a prot g of south carolina senator strom thurmond and now the administration s point man in resisting civil rights measures and enforcement that would offend the southern voters nixon planned to win over \( even beyond the six states of dixie he had taken in 1968 \) it was the beginning of the vaunted republican southern strategy , and was accompanied from the start by nixon s casual use of racial epithets as for the media now being told the truth , nixon referred to the press corps as that bunch of crew cut boy scouts in a conversation with writer theodore white soon after the inauguration after a white house press aide reported to him that coverage of the new administration over its first month had been almost uniformly excellent , the president answered impatiently you don t understand , they are waiting to destroy us nixon would hold no televised press conferences in his first eight months , and then only 31 over four years \( by comparison , johnson held four times as many in his five years in office \) and finally , most tragically , there was the war the nixon constituency is behind the war effort , kissinger said that winter , revealing a base motive that belied the new government s promise of an early peace if we were to pull out of vietnam , there would be a disaster , politically , for us , here at home there would be , of course , other calculus , other mania , in the following four more years of war with nixon and kissinger , the historian learns early , motives are rarely simple , or constant at almost the same moment the times was reporting public pressure on the war had disappeared , nixon was ordering the secret bombing of cambodia the new presidency would be less than 100 days old when a leak to the times on the war policy set in motion the malignant process that would bring the wiretapping of officials and journalists , and ultimately onto the sequence that would lead to watergate it was indeed a historic start for the new administration , if not in the sense of the benign , hopeful public image of january 1969 america had elected a familiar , reassuring figure to the presidency , only to find a stranger in the oval office
if congress approves health care reform , virtually all americans will be required to buy health insurance or pay a penalty that raises a fundamental question will the policies be affordable \? people everywhere are complaining that relentlessly rising costs are making health insurance unaffordable the situation is especially dire for millions of americans who are uninsured , selfemployed or whose employers do not offer subsidized group coverage a survey by the commonwealth fund found that 73 percent of the adults who tried to buy insurance on the open market over a threeyear period never bought a plan because they could not afford it , could not find a plan that met their needs , or were turned down pending legislation would help some of them by preventing rejections or high charges based on health status and by setting minimum benefit requirements but many people who might still find the premiums too high will face an agonizing choice buy insurance coverage or pay a penalty of hundreds or even thousands of dollars per family if they still decide to forgo insurance successful reform will provide financial support for those who need it and is the only way to finally guarantee coverage for tens of millions of uninsured americans here is a look at some of the issues behind the affordability debate it is important that everyone be required to buy insurance , either from their employers or on new insurance exchanges reliable studies show that people who lack insurance seldom get regular medical care and therefore suffer more severe illness and death than those who are insured when they do get sick , they often turn to expensive emergency rooms for free care driving up costs for everyone else finally , the health care reforms , which require insurers to accept all applicants , will not work well unless nearly everyone carries health insurance unless the pool includes a large number of healthy people , the costs for everyone on the exchange will be too high those forced to buy their own insurance could choose from an array of private plans and possibly a public plan that will be offered on the exchanges there is sharp debate over whether these plans would be less or more expensive than plans that would be available on the open market insurance industry studies contend that premiums would go up because various fees imposed on health insurers and health care providers to pay for covering the uninsured would inevitably get passed on to consumers we believe premiums would come down for several reasons companies would no longer need to spend as much money on administrative costs , to screen out people with preexisting conditions \( prohibited by all reform bills \) if they wanted to participate on the exchanges \( and have access to millions of new customers \) , the companies would also be forced to compete with other private plans , and possibly a public option , encouraging them to lower premiums and accept lower profits a hint of what might happen can be seen in an analysis by the congressional budget office under a version of the senate finance committee bill , the average single person would pay a 5 , 000 premium for a silver plan sold on the exchanges in 2016 but would pay 6 , 000 for a plan with less generous coverage if the reform failed right now , only the poorest americans get help , through the statefederal medicaid program the bills in both houses would expand eligibility for medicaid to cover millions more people , and lower the contributions of the poorest americans for those buying policies on the exchanges , perhaps 30 million people in all , the bills would provide taxcredit subsidies to help low and middleincome people pay the premiums people would have to pay specified percentages of their income toward the premium , ranging in the house bill from 15 percent for those barely above medicaid level to 12 percent for those earning four times the poverty level , or 88 , 000 for a family of four that sounds like a substantial hit at the upper end 10 , 560 for a family of four before subsidies kick in but it is comparable to what many workers are currently willing to pay for their group policies and just in case the premiums might still look unaffordable to large numbers of people , the senate finance committee s version has proposed an escape hatch no one would be required to spend more than 8 percent of their income on health insurance they would not be insured , but they would not be fined no one has a clear answer , and various experts use different approaches to calculating affordability some estimate what people would have to pay for such other necessities as housing , food , day care , transportation and taxes , and then see how much is left over that could pay for health insurance others look at what people at various income levels are paying for health insurance today , without a requirement by either yardstick , jonathan gruber , a prominent health economist at the massachusetts institute of technology , believes that all of the pending bills in congress would make health insurance affordable to the vast majority of americans and that none of the bills would require anyone to buy insurance they could not afford his only concern is that the senate finance committee s bill might not provide enough protection against high payments required to meet deductibles or copayments and other outofpocket charges the commonwealth fund , a staunch advocate of health care reform , believes that the house bill meets its affordability standards \( 5 to 10 percent of income \) for premiums required of families earning up to about 75 , 000 a year , while the senate finance panel s bill falls short at every step of the way advocacy groups point to cases where , under the less generous senate finance bill , some families would have to strain to pay their premiums and would probably have to cut back on such items as clothing , various household expenses , meals eaten out , and other activities their plight would worsen in coming years because the amount they would have to pay toward premiums would rise faster than their wages we already have some experience in massachusetts , where the state s reforms have achieved nearuniversal coverage and won broad support from doctors , although a surge of newly insured people has increased waiting times to see a doctor like the congressional bills , massachusetts requires all residents to carry health insurance or pay a penalty the state provides somewhat more generous subsidies than the congressional bills , although not as far up the income scale and it has exempted some 76 , 000 people from the mandate because they would have to pay more than specified percentages of their income for premiums the downside is that people forced to buy insurance were often miffed at the mandate in a 2008 poll , most massachusetts residents strongly supported the reforms but many still felt the reforms had harmed them personally or driven up health care costs , presumably by making them pay more for insurance than they wanted to their disenchantment is the price that will likely have to be paid for achieving nearuniversal coverage it has not sparked any widespread revolt in massachusetts , but it could be a harbinger of how some people will feel about similar reforms at the federal level the house bill , unveiled last week , seems a safer bet than the senate finance bill \( which must still be merged with another senate bill \) to make coverage affordable and widespread it has stronger penalty provisions for individuals who decline coverage , thus making it more likely that the pools on the exchanges would be large enough and varied enough to spread the risk it would require employers to offer health coverage and pay a substantial share of the premiums or face a very stiff penalty , thus easing the burden on many workers and it would provide relatively generous subsidies congressional leaders will have to meld the versions in coming weeks we believe that a final bill should include a strong mandate , a public option and generous subsidies that is the best chance of covering the maximum numbers of americans and making insurance affordable we believe that right now the house version does all of that best

philadelphia a blue stocking cap pulled over his ears , al bagnoli , the football coach at penn , stood in the rain wednesday at franklin field as he directed an important practice before the 282nd game of his career , a game that he said would feel different the quakers will play at harvard on saturday , and the winner of the game between these evenly matched teams both 62 over all and 50 in the ivy league will secure at least a share of the league championship penn which will end its season next week against cornell , while harvard is at yale has won six ivy titles in bagnoli s 18 years as coach , but none since 2003 harvard spoiled penn s chances  then came 2005 on oct 10 , two days after scoring two touchdowns in a 537 victory over bucknell , the senior running back kyle ambrogi , a wellliked finance major at the wharton school , committed suicide it devastated us , bagnoli said wednesday here was a kid who was as popular as we 'd ever had a good player , a local kid , an outstanding student with a 35 at wharton he probably would have been the last person we would have selected to be battling depression ambrogi , 21 , was , in fact , battling depression , but he was undergoing counseling and his mood had brightened before the bucknell game in the game , his brother , greg , then a sophomore defensive back for the quakers , recovered a fumble for another touchdown it really , really hit us hard emotionally , bagnoli said of kyle ambrogi s death it took us a couple of years to get over it emotionally we were just on pure adrenaline the first week we were angry and upset at what had happened , and we played that way after the second week , we were so lacking in the emotion that s necessary to play this game penn won the two games after ambrogi s death but lost its final four , finishing 55 for the first time in six years by the middle of the 2006 season , a columnist for the daily pennsylvanian , the student newspaper , wondered if bagnoli was the right person for the job penn finished 55 again then came a 46 record in 2007 , bagnoli s first losing season at penn \( not counting the 1997 season , in which the quakers forfeited five victories for using an ineligible player \) penn was 64 last year , but lost to harvard , missing a chance to tie brown for the ivy league title the cloud that had been over the program seemed to lift late last season , bagnoli said , and the penn roster has turned over since ambrogi s death because of that and other factors , the quakers have been able to gather traction and togetherness now we 're undefeated , the senior wide receiver kyle derham said , referring to penn s 50 record in ivy league play and it s been five or six years since this team has gotten to this point undefeated we 've been struggling to find an identity until this season , or until the offseason this game pretty much means everything harvard coach tim murphy , whose teams have won or shared three of the last five ivy championships , said in a conference call this week you know if you 're going to win an ivy league championship , it s going to come through penn you know that penn s going to be there they 're always there still , the effects of ambrogi s death permeated the program the players , bagnoli said , asked a lot of soulsearching questions why \? why him \? why did n't i see this \? how could i have helped \? ambrogi was a player , bagnoli said , who had 25 best friends on the team he was a good , tough kid , a physical kid , just the kind of kid you want in your program , very popular , said steven downs , who has coached the running backs at penn for 11 years and recruited ambrogi when he played at st joseph s prep in philadelphia you expend so much energy when something like this happens you do n't know how you 're going to bounce back the team has bounced back , but slowly ambrogi s teammates organized a scholarship fund in his name to be awarded to a penn player from the philadelphia area , bagnoli said some of the quakers' coaches wear a patch with his jersey number , 31 , on their jackets but the players on this year s team carry no stickers on their blue helmets honoring his memory there is no memorial for ambrogi at franklin field , either on the stadium or in the team s locker room , but bagnoli said he would like to look into establishing one i think al and his staff allowed the football team to place grieving ahead of football priorities , even if it was to the detriment of wins and losses , and helped educate athletes who are stereotyped as big and strong that reaching out for mental health help is not a sign of weakness , steve bilsky , the athletic director at penn , said in an email message only now , for a number of reasons , has the penn program regained its footing , bagnoli said now , it is one step from where it was in 2003 , when the quakers finished 100 when practice ended wednesday , bagnoli gathered his players in the rain and reminded them of the opportunity this game presented at least a share of the title and the chance to win it outright these are the games that you work yearround to play in , he said of the harvard game you work they work to play in them
the decision to put diane sawyer into charles gibson s old job was not unexpected but the timing may have thrown abc for a loop david westin , the president of abc news , characterized mr gibson s decision to step down as entirely his own , after they held conversations that extended through the summer mr westin added in an interview that if he had had his way , none of this would be happening he said he had tried to talk mr gibson out of the decision and had also given him time to think it over this was not a result i wanted , mr westin said mr westin said he finally assented only last week and asked ms sawyer if she would accept the position last thursday she agreed only tuesday night , he said other senior abc news executives , including jon banner , the executive producer of world news , said that mr gibson , 66 , had indeed initiated the move out of a desire to pull back from daily television work the decision was sudden enough that abc does not have a plan in place to replace ms sawyer , 63 , on good morning america , where she is by far the biggest attraction for viewers and which is by far the most profitable program in the news division one executive estimated that it brings in about 50 million a year for abc
at its nadir last november , goldman sachs s share price closed at 52 , nearly 80 percent below its high of around 250 by then , many of its chief competitors bear stearns , lehman brothers , merrill lynch and ubs were dead or shadows of their former selves even morgan stanley , long considered goldman s archrival , had nearly died but somehow , less than five months later , on the heels of a surprisingly profitable first quarter of fiscal 2009 , goldman sachs is once again riding high , with its stock closing tuesday at 115 a share the question many wall streeters are asking is just how goldman once again snatched victory from the jaws of defeat many point to goldman s expert manipulation of the levers of power in washington since robert rubin , its former chairman , joined the clinton administration in 1993 , first as the director of the national economic council and then as treasury secretary , the firm has come to be known , as a headline in this newspaper last october put it , as government sachs how can one ignore , the conspiracyminded say , the crucial role that henry paulson , who followed mr rubin to the top at both goldman and treasury , played in the decisions to shutter bear stearns , to force lehman brothers to file for bankruptcy and to insist that bank of america buy merrill lynch at an inflated price \? david viniar , goldman s chief financial officer , acknowledged in a conference call yesterday the important role the changed competitive landscape had on goldman s unexpected firstquarter profit of 18 billion many of our traditional competitors have retreated from the marketplace , either due to financial distress , mergers or shift in strategic priorities but he was largely mum on american international group , which , goldman s critics insist , is the canvas upon which the bank and its alumni have painted their great masterpiece of selfinterest a few days after mr paulson refused to save lehman brothers last september at a cost of a mere 45 billion or so he came to aig s rescue , to the tune of 170 billion and rising then he decided to install edward liddy a former goldman sachs board member as aig s chief executive goldman has since received some 13 billion in cash , collateral and other payouts from aig that is , from taxpayers why kill lehman and save aig \? the theory , we now know , was that the government felt it needed to save the firms , including goldman sachs , that had insured many of their risky ventures through the insurer indeed , had mr paulson decided not to save aig , its counterparties would have suffered serious losses lehman s creditors will be lucky to get back pennies on the dollar in a conference call he held last month , mr viniar made the shocking claim that goldman had no material exposure to aig because the firm had collateral and market hedges in order to protect ourselves if so , then why did goldman need the government s help in the first place \? during yesterday s conference call , guy moszkowski , an analyst from merrill lynch , asked mr viniar what role the 13 billion goldman has collected from aig had on its firstquarter showing but mr viniar would have none of it profits related to aig in the first quarter rounded to zero hmm , how then did goldman make so much money if that multibilliondollar gift from you and me had nothing to do with it \? part of the answer lies in a little sleight of hand one consequence of goldman s becoming a bank holding company last year was that it had to switch its fiscal year to the calendar year previously , goldman s fiscal year had ended on nov 30 now it ends dec 31 as a result , december 2008 was not included in goldman s rosy firstquarter 2009 numbers in that month , goldman lost a little more than 1 billion , after a 1 billion writedown related to noninvestmentgrade credit origination activities and a further 625 million related to commercial real estate loans and securities all told , in the last seven months , goldman has lost 15 billion but that number did n't come up on monday how convenient which leaves us with the real reason goldman has cleaned up this year the huge misfortunes of its major competitors those other firms have disappeared or have become severely wounded , and as a result have more or less been sitting on their collective hands since the collapse of lehman last september as part of its busy day on monday , goldman also announced it was raising 5 billion of equity capital and that it intended to pay back the 10 billion from the treasury s troubled asset relief program that mr paulson forced on the bank last october being free of the tarp yoke will give goldman yet another competitive advantage the ability to pay its own top talent and new recruits whatever it wants without government scrutiny this is significant , since it is unlikely any of goldman s remaining competitors will be able to make a similar move anytime soon there is a reason bill gates once said microsoft s biggest competitor was goldman sachs it s all about iq , mr gates said you win with iq our only competition for iq is the top investment banks and then there was one
when the singersongwriter schuyler fisk was 17 , she up and moved from charlottesville , va , to los angeles to pursue a career as an actor her parents could have freaked , but instead they asked a lot of questions and then made sure that she got settled properly that s partly because her parents not only understood the impulse , but had also lived the life in los angeles her father , , is an oscarnominated production designer , and her mother , , is , well , sissy spacek , nominated six times for an oscar and winning in 1981 for coal miner s daughter ms spacek left quitman , tex , when she was a teenager to take a shot at being a folk musician in new york things did n't go exactly as she planned , but they turned out pretty well ms fisk , 26 , who performed with her band at the bell house in gowanus , brooklyn , last week , has had a similar bounty of good fortune , although not exactly on plan , either as a young actress with a frecklefaced openness and an easy smile , ms fisk \( her first name is pronounced skyler \) had significant roles in the films american gun , i'm reed fish and , most notably , orange county she also worked on her music , some of which was folded into films paperweight , a duet with joshua radin , was on the soundtrack of the last kiss in 2006 somewhere along the way , the actress with an interest in music became an actual working musician once signed to universal music , she is back on her own and will selfrelease her debut album , the good stuff , on itunes on feb 17 although she has lots of running buddies in the los angeles folkpop scene , her virginia roots show through in the loping cadence of her clear , remarkable voice and her obvious crush on sheryl crow she has a girltowoman lyrical perspective , a willingness to walk past irony to a selfdefined truth in a way reminiscent of taylor swift ms fisk s songs head directly at the things she holds dear from where i'm standing , you 're the quiet side of the road you 're looking so lonely , and i ca n't stop looking at you she said that she and universal parted ways because although the label had lots of ideas for what direction her music should take , none of them meshed with her idea of just being herself now the public awareness she developed as an actress is helping her build a route to a musical audience even though a long tour in an rv and an opening slot on the club circuit \( for ben taylor , the son of james \) is about as far from the movie lot as you can get , ms fisk plans to stay on the road as long as people will have her i'm not saying i would never do acting again , because i love it , but there really is nothing compared to getting up in front of people and singing your music , she said in an interview on a couch at the bell house i love going into a dive where they have no idea who i am or have n't heard my music and try to win them over dave bassett , a california musician who helped write some of the songs on the good stuff and produced it , said ms fisk was not searching for an identity or for industry approval she has learned a tremendous amount as a musician , but she was very clear on who she was from the very start , he said she can be really stubborn about that , and i think it s the reason that what she does is not going to go out of style this is the kind of record that people will make their friends listen to because she has a kind of conversational writing that pulls people in in conversation and onstage , there is very little reflection of what would seem to be a rarefied childhood she talked with a great deal of enthusiasm about the pulledpork burritos she was going to whip up for the band in the crockpot they are traveling with probably because it was n't all that rarefied we moved from los angeles when i was very little , just a few months old , she said my parents wanted me to grow up around horses and open spaces she appreciated all that fresh air , to a point when she was very young , we went to los angeles and were driving around , mr fisk recalled in a phone interview and she asked me you and mom both work in the movie business here why do n't we live here \? ' and i mentioned the smog and the traffic , and she said , but i like the smog and traffic' when ms fisk was 16 , ms spacek , who performed all the songs in coal miner s daughter , showed her daughter a few guitar chords sissy and i both encouraged her to work with her music , in part because she has an amazing voice , but also because music offers more control of your life , mr fisk said when you are in the movie business , you spend a lot of time waiting around for other people to decide what they want to do with you and that s not really schuyler it is so much easier for someone who is established as a musician to do some acting than the other way around , he added actors who decide to form bands are not generally given a lot of credibility mr fisk and ms spacek will be in chicago this weekend to see their daughter at martyrs' ms spacek , who is shooting a thriller called get low , has been known to grab a microphone behind her daughter she is my best friend and my biggest supporter , ms fisk said she comes to every show that she possibly can ms fisk made orange county with colin hanks , son of tom , and the film was directed by jake kasdan , son of lawrence she is sensitive about being written off as a member of the luckygenes club part of the reason that i moved to los angeles is that even though my mom introduced me to all kinds of music , i really wanted to work on having my own identify , on being who i am and doing what i do , and seeing how people responded , she said the fact that people show up , that they buy the records , just blows my mind after her set at the bell house concluded , ms fisk headed for the merchandise table and was followed by dozens of fans so young that they probably do n't have a clear idea who sissy spacek is , anyway ms fisk s own movies do n't hurt , though brittany travis , who lives in weehawken , nj , stood in line to buy a cd of the good stuff she can sing , she plays a good guitar , and i liked her movies like snow day' and i'm reed fish , ' she said she already has a fan base from that , so it s only natural that people would come out and see what she can do onstage and if you look around , she added , gesturing to the other people waiting in line , they liked what they heard ms fisk s geewhiz sincerity will probably prevent her from becoming any kind of hipster fetish , but at the bell house , it was working pretty well for her hi , i'm schuyler , she said , jumping up from the merch table to greet another fan we got that

in the late 1930s the new york art dealers albert duveen and norman hirschl started turning up some intriguing paintings in upstate new york these works depicted conventional subjects of 19thcentury american painting hudson river landscapes and marine views of ships , harbors and naval battles but in an entrancing , slightly demonic style unlike anything the dealers had seen before neither strictly realist nor na ve , they packed a formal , even decorative punch the works felt ahead of their time , as if the artist had grasped that reality was , in the end , a geometrybased situation , much as early 20thcentury painters would unfortunately none of the canvases were signed then one day the pair came across a large and ambitious painting in this style that had both a title and signature it depicted the american warship constitution defeating the british vessel guerri re in the war of 1812 it was signed t chambers in 1942 hirschl and duveen organized an exhibition of their finds at the macbeth gallery in new york they titled it t chambers , active 18201840 first american modern since then t chambers has acquired the first name of thomas , a slim biography and a working life that dated from 1834 to 1866 his exuberant paintings are admired by scholars and collectors of 19thcentury american painting they can be found in museums along the eastern seaboard , and inland , too almost everywhere i would guess they jump off the walls at you the first chambers i saw , at the brooklyn museum , sure did but have there been any major chambers exhibitions \? not one , at least not until now , with the extraordinary survey of nearly 50 paintings at the american folk art museum organized last year at the philadelphia museum of art by kathleen a foster , its curator of american art , thomas chambers \( 18081869 \) confirms that there is nothing quite like the starchy hybrid that chambers devised he aimed to please his images are like chorus lines singing and dancing their hearts out , ever so slightly offkey and out of step every part contributes vocally and vigorously to the whole the trilling patterns of ocean waves , rounded trees or riverside hedgerows the sharpedged mountains and shorelines , overemphatic clouds , glossy rivers and almost lurid sunsets they all lock arms , and do a little more than their bit the slight awkwardness amplifies you see them perform and you see their performance , gaining a greater understanding of the visual appetite by having it thoroughly satisfied the desire to please is also explicit in the way chambers s compositions sometimes repeat with slight variations views of west point , niagara falls , lake george and mount vesuvius \( which chambers never saw \) it was as if he were reproducing a successful formula because of customer demand , which he was art was chambers s ambition and his means of survival , and he painted as many as 10 copies of a popular scene chambers was born in whitby , england , into a poor seafaring family , where artistic talent literally saved or at least prolonged lives his older brother george , sent to sea at age 10 , revealed such a knack for painting and decorating the ship s gear that , at 18 , he was released from his indentures and sent to art school four years later he was in london , where he became a successful marine painter even william iv , the sailor king , commissioned a work but george died in 1840 his early years at sea had ruined his health thomas followed george to london , picking up artistic skills from him and probably first working , as george had , as a painter of theater scenery and panoramas ms foster surmises that chambers was an impatient , restless sort who decided to try his luck across the atlantic on march 1 , 1832 , he was in new orleans at the courthouse , to be precise filing a declaration of intention to become an american citizen after that , census reports , directories and newspaper advertisements show him moving every few years new york city , baltimore , boston , albany and back to new york city he listed himself variously as a landscape painter , marine painter and occasionally as a fancy painter , which indicated skills at ornamental painting that may have included the decoration of furniture , mirrors and tinware twice he consigned groups of paintings to auction , a common practice by which artists publicized themselves and raised money in a time when galleries and dealers were virtually unheard of but chambers seems mostly to have just scraped by in his lifetime he never gained the acclaim of contemporaries like thomas cole , and suddenly he dropped from sight in new york in 1866 , two years after the death of his wife , harriet he had returned to whitby , where he died in the poorhouse , unknown and alone ms foster finally closed the circle by locating his death certificate , although this is the least bit of the new information that she lays out in her phenomenal catalog chambers the man is as dim as his paintings are vivid they do communicate impatience maybe chambers did n't have time for the delicacies of onepoint perspective and atmospheric it was easier to fit the image together in a series of flattish planes , letting mountains upholstered in trees meet a river s mirrored surface with a nearly straight line and small jolt it also made a stronger impression more quickly chambers knew that his clients members of the nascent middle class , not the elite did n't have much time for artistic diversions or much experience buying paintings his abbreviations also had the boldness of the folk art and painted furniture that was more familiar to them he synthesized and formulized he executed images that would appeal to local pride , like packet ship passing castle williams , new york harbor , in which the waves are indicated by parallel rows of matching whitecaps staten island is seen against a sky streaked with pink and the ship is at nearly full sail , racing toward the picture s right edge like a bustling courtier in a large , fancy wig often he painted from engravings of other artists' work , sometimes depicting places , like vesuvius , he never visited , including waterloo and the rhine , where there s a castle on every carapace his scenes of frigates tossed by immense , scurve waves were based on scenes in popular pirate novels , and he painted contemporary events , like the wreck of the ship bristol , washed up on far rockaway beach the curving bay recurs in the magnificent , incisively pink view of nahant \( sunset \) , where crescents of ruddy beach and sky alternate with the dark foreground , the semicircle of ocean and ships and a flirtatious ring of lavender clouds this exhibition includes landscapes by other artists , including cole , thomas doughty and william matthew prior , but do n't be surprised if you pass them by chambers s work may lack the historic pedigree and national symbolism , say , of cole s paintings , but on the wall , it s no contest there are also a few tables and a chest of drawers patterned in the fancy style of particular interest is a small black box with a scene of a steamship stippled in white on its inside lid and a band of flowers stenciled in gold and silver around its exterior chambers slipped between these two approaches , took what he needed and sped on , toward 20thcentury painting

the creators of s fourmonthold worldfocus see it as a model for lowcost news programming on public television but its firstyear budget of 8 million is causing dissent at the company , the parent of wnet channel 13 and wliw channel 21 in new york , and is being blamed for deep layoffs at the stations the program , which uses inexpensive digital technology and worldwide partnerships , has won praise for its international coverage recent worldfocus broadcasts that included gaza war coverage , with reports from al jazeera english , one of the program s partners , brought an increase in viewers but the nationally distributed program is n't as popular internally two weeks ago the stations laid off 14 percent of their combined staff , or about 80 people , part of an effort to cut wnetorg s 186 million annual budget by 8 percent , about 15 million some employees , none of whom would speak publicly for fear of angering management , blame the spending on worldfocus for the cuts among those laid off were many in wnet s local programming department , including its director , john denatale the unit s halfhour new york voices , which had been seen only intermittently in recent months , was officially canceled worldfocus is a major project for , a former president of nbc news who took over as chief executive of wnetorg \( formerly known as educational broadcasting corporation \) one year ago and has been moving quickly to revamp the channels in an interview mr shapiro said that the layoffs were unrelated to worldfocus nobody wants to be laid off , and everybody looks for reasons why , he said but the fact is , there are huge financial pressures facing this place he cited declining revenue from corporate underwriting , individual pledges , foundation grants and endowment earnings many of the cuts were in backoffice functions , he said , adding that the reorganization would make the stations more efficient local programming is n't going away , he said some employees who worked on local arts coverage have been reassigned to wnet s yearold sundayarts program wnet has also just begun the weekly it s the economy , ny , with andrew ross sorkin of the new york times as host worldfocus has been a point of internal contention since its premiere in october mr shapiro conceived the program after a disagreement with the bbc , the british broadcaster , over its newscast , which wliw had distributed nationally for a decade when the two sides could n't reach a new distribution deal , wnet and wliw decided to produce worldfocus , and the bbc lined up a new distributor many public stations , but not wliw or wnet , now carry both programs the bbc program remains more widely available and has higher ratings nationally , but worldfocus is continuing to add stations , most recently in st louis and houston mr shapiro defended the decision to start a competing program the two have different formats , he said , adding that it s good for public television to have a show that belongs to public television in an unusual departure , the seed money for worldfocus came from wnetorg s operating budget traditionally , public television stations raise part of the necessary money for a program before starting production mr shapiro said he did n't buy that approach public television would not be anywhere if every time we had an idea , we said , gosh it s going to be very hard to raise money , let s not do it , ' he said are we taking a chance \? absolutely that s what innovation is about last week the peter g peterson foundation provided the program s first outside financing , a 1 million oneyear grant that led to a 1 million matching grant from rosalind p walter , a wnet trustee , and two other unnamed people gave a total of 500 , 000 , bringing the program to a selfsustaining 25 million for its first months , mr shapiro said praising worldfocus as a very highquality program , david m walker , the president and chief executive of the peterson foundation , said the organization believed in today s interconnected world that having a greater focus on the world around us and where we stand in the world overall is very important in exchange for the grant , mr walker said , the foundation expected worldfocus to produce reports examining how other countries have dealt with the challenges facing the united states , like health care and reform worldfocus , he said , will have total control over the content even before the grant , worldfocus had reported on those topics a series on universal health care in brazil , singapore and canada was shown last week to report such substantial stories every evening , the program turns to a number of former network correspondents , including lynn sherr , dave marash and mark litke , previously of abc news , and edie magnus , formerly of dateline nbc the show includes interviews by the anchor , martin savidge , formerly of cnn and nbc news , and reports from worldwide news partners , including a24 , from africa , and al jazeera video is sent via internet , not satellite , to save money , and the entire show is assembled in a computer so that studio cost is minimal , producers said one partner for the program is globalpost , a bostonbased web site \( \) also focused on international news its contributors are being given 250 flip camcorders to shoot video to send to worldfocus it s a great , very simple idea , said charles sennott , a founder of globalpost some advocates of increased international news coverage have questioned the program s production values i laud the concept we 've been agitating for more global coverage for 20 years , said rory o'connor , the president of the production company globalvision but i was taken aback at what seemed to be an antiquated look and antiquated production values he said the style was perilously close to radio on television marc rosenwasser , the program s executive producer , said that viewers were more interested in content than in style i'm not dismissing production values , but fundamentally our role is to provide information to people , he said in a youtube age , he added , some viewers even believe that if it s too manicured , it s not real the audience for worldfocus has been growing but remains small in january it had about 252 , 000 nightly viewers on average in the nation s 30 largest markets , according to wnetorg the program can also be seen at  locally worldfocus will get much more visibility in the spring , when its studio moves from west 33rd street to lincoln center , where wnet has signed a 15year lease for a streetside studio at broadway and west 66th street mr savidge will record his interviews there , and the studio will also be home to sundayarts a saturday film program , reel 13 and the stations' onair pledge drives the studio s rent of just under 1 million a year is another cost that mr shapiro s critics have complained about but mr shapiro has the support of wnetorg s board chairman , james s tisch , the chief executive of loews corporation i think that will be a game changer for 13 , mr tisch said of the new site in an interview it will give it presence , it will pair it with lincoln center , and it will free up studio space on 33rd street that can be used for other reasons mr shapiro added , i think we 're going to look back on the new studio and say it s the best investment we ever made we face huge financial pressures , he said but the way to get out of these pressures is through innovation
sultan munadi is dead , and a british paratrooper whose name we may never know there may also have been other afghan casualties , perhaps taliban , perhaps not that we also don t know yet , for sure but from where i am writing this , on a sunny autumn afternoon in rural england , the deaths of sultan and the british commando seem like a grim black cloud darkening the landscape a harbinger , perhaps , for the increasingly grim news that seems to await us all from a war that seems to be worsening by the day , and heading for worse yet unless our political and military leaders can find a way to turn the situation around behind these deaths lie complex and highly emotive issues for those of us who have traveled to war zones for the times and other news organizations , involving our responsibilities for the lives of the locally employed people who make it possible for us to operate in faraway lands interpreters and reporters like sultan , but also drivers , security guards and domestic staff members altogether , in the case of the times , at least 200 people in iraq and afghanistan over the years of those two wars beyond that , and far more difficult to weigh , if not impossible , are our responsibilities to the soldiers , marines and commandos who may be deployed to rescue us , as they were in the case of stephen farrell and sultan in the overnight hours of tuesday to wednesday i know already , from calls and email messages i have fielded in the hours since the raid outside kunduz , that these are issues that attract highly charged opinions that tend to polar opposites there are those who say that reporters are to be admired for their intrepid pursuit of stories like the fueltanker bombing in kunduz , and that local staff members who accompany them are keenly aware of the risks , as we know sultan was , and that military personnel , too , are aware of the risks they take on operations like the one that led to the deaths of sultan and the british commando that was a point made in the statement issued by britain s prime minister , gordon brown , who said of the commandos engaged in the raid which the bbc and the times of london reported as having been approved personally by the prime minister that they knew the high risks they were running but we know , too , that there are people , including many who have written into this blog , who will condemn us , as they see it , for willfully exposing our local staff and our potential rescuers to fatal risk in our pursuit as our harshest detractors see it of frontpage stories , of journalism prizes and of a faux claim to courage for our gungho ways one british woman who called me this morning as soon as she heard the news of the deaths of sultan and the paratrooper was incandescent i think it s absolutely appalling to endanger other people s lives , she said so instead of one man in captivity we have at least two dead , including , needlessly , yet another soldier and an interpreter these are issues that have been intensely debated at the times for years , with resulting protocols , in our war bureaus , about the importance of weighing risk carefully before embarking on dangerous assignments but first , i d like to enter a personal note about sultan , who worked closely with me and my wife , jane scottlong , during the period when we were establishing our kabul bureau in the months after the overthrow of the taliban in november 2001 we stayed in touch over the years , after we both moved to baghdad , and he traveled to germany on a scholarship , got married , and had two children he was a man we , like many at the new york times , came to love he was gentle , honest , loyal , ironic , brave , and , an unusual but wonderful mix of innocence in the sense of having not a single cynical bone in his body and shining intelligence when steve farrell told our editors after his release that sultan did everything he could to keep us both alive , up to the last minute , it is the sultan we knew in short , he was the diametric opposite , in character , of everything there is to loathe in the political manipulators , warlords , profiteers and drug barons who have strode the landscape in afghanistan since the taliban s overthrow god rest his soul of the circumstances that led to his death , and that of the paratrooper , much that will help our understanding remains , at this writing , unclear we will learn more as stephen and others involved , including the raid commanders , if they ever do , give us their accounts of what occurred but this much can be said with certainty the new york times , and other major news organizations , have no choice about covering these wars , and covering them comprehensively , if we are to be true to our tradition with hundreds of thousands of american soldiers committed to battle over the course of the wars , more than 5 , 000 servicemen and women already dead , and closing in on a trillion dollars of american taxpayers money spent , how credible would be our claim to be one of america s leading newspapers if we absented ourselves \? in fact , we have done the opposite , spending large sums of money , at a time of severely straitened finances for all newspapers in america , to cover the wars as fully as any publication and a large part of doing that has been taking every reasonable precaution to protect our correspondents , photographers and local staff until recently , the larger risks were in iraq , where we built what amounted to a fort for ourselves in baghdad , with blast walls and gun towers \( happily never used \) , armored cars , and our own guard force to protect us within the walls and beyond them as the war in afghanistan has worsened , we have turned our attention to improving our security there , too but just as we have to cover these wars , we have to go out of our compounds to experience the conflict at first hand if our reporting is not to quickly descend into hotel journalism some of that , indeed much of it , has been done on embeds , where our protection comes from the military units we cover but an essential part , too , comes from going in search of the war that embeds don t reach the other side of the war , often enough the war as it is experienced by ordinary iraqis and afghans , the civilians who have done most of the dying that was what stephen farrell was doing when he and sultan set out on saturday for the site of the fueltanker bombing south of kunduz claims by local people put the number of civilians killed by an american f15 eagle bombing strike at 80 to 90 , making it , if those figures were true , one of the most tragic incidents of its kind in the war getting to the site to the site of any such incident is all the more important for the fact that rumor and ill will and the general fog of war have played so large a part in obscuring the truth in iraq and afghanistan and then there s the other inevitability , the one that led to the death of sultan the times has some new yorkbased reporters who speak arabic to my knowledge , none who are conversant in dari and pashto , the two principal languages of afghanistan if we are to tell the story of the wars , we have to engage local staff who can accompany us as interpreters and drivers , and who can scope out the landscape , political , geographic and cultural , to help us fix the context of what we see and hear that s not an option , it s a necessity , and one that is common to all major news organizations at war and it means , ipso facto , that our journalism involves venturing into dangerous places with local staffers like sultan it has been our habit , in hiring local people into our bureaus , as it has been with new yorkassigned reporters and photographers , to impress on them the risks that they are taking as the bureau chief in kabul , and later in baghdad , i would remind newcomers of the last entry that the polar explorer captain robert falcon scott made in his diary , on his catastrophic return from the south pole in march 1912 we took risks we knew we took them things have come out against us , and therefore we have no cause for complaint that , of course , is likely to have about as much persuasive power as a cigarettepack warning to individuals who are drawn to working with the times , as sultan was , by the prospect of helping the world to understand the travails of their homelands as well as by the sheer adventure of the job , the decent salaries western employers can pay , and , bottom line , by a good job in an economy where unemployment is rampant so we added to that initial warning , learning as we went , a series of bestpractice measures we thought most likely to minimize the risks , to foreign and local staff alike paramount among these was our willing partners rule , which held that no reporter or photographer should venture out on assignment without the informed consent of the local staff accompanying him or her , and that no local staffer should be subjected , by the expatriate staff , to armtwisting or any other form of duress the local staffers , after all , were our canariesinthemine if they judged an assignment unsafe , it probably was , and attempting to persuade them otherwise was very likely to be unwise in practise , this was a hard rule to enforce , since local staff were sometimes reluctant to speak out , however much we encouraged them , for fear of being judged wimpish by others among the drivers , interpreters and security guards but all in all , the practice worked well in most instances , we found that we could find ways to accomplish an assignment sometimes by changing the route , or the destination , or perhaps by delaying a day or two sometimes , though , we made misjudgments , as i did one day in 2004 by leading a group of eight times people , including six iraqis , on a 100mile journey into the badlands south of baghdad that led us into a kidnap trap outside the holy city of najaf by the grace of god , we were released by our shiite militia captors within 9 or 10 hours , but i had long enough as a hostage in a cinderblock building out in the desert to contemplate my responsibility for exposing the iraqis to mortal danger as for the military units who stand as a lastresort for those who have been kidnapped , that , too , to my mind , is an inevitability , just as much as the risks we take in venturing unembedded into the warzones we cannot rely on embeds alone if we are to tell the story of the wars and we know , when we do , that if things go awry , as they did for stephen and sultan , there is a high possibility of military action to free us to turn this on its head , and imagine a situation in which allied commanders refused to intervene in all circumstances , would be untenable , for the military , and for us just as it would be impractical for us to turn away from any risk that might end up with our relying on a military rescue what we hope , of course , is that the military s decisions will be judicious , and that no raids will be launched as long as there is a reasonable hope of negotiating a hostage release , just as they will hope that we make judicious decisions of our own in heading out into the badlands in both cases , the judgments involved are likely to be made on the margin , based as they are likely to be on fragmentary and often dubious information for us , as reporters , about the degree of risk in this village or that , or at this bombing site or another for the military , about the kidnappers intentions , and how much time there is to act before it is too late to speak of my own experience out there in the desert beyond najaf , i took comfort in knowing that the gps system in our gmc suburban armored vehicle was reporting our position constantly , in ways that would be accessible to us commanders in baghdad and that , in the last resort , we could hope that the cavalry would come over the hill many readers have inquired about making contributions to the family of sultan munadi , the slain afghan journalist that money , along with funds contributed by the

allow me to reprise my role as the man who stares at votes to provide an addendum to my most recent column , the passion of the right , which warned that republicans are likely to make significant gains in the 2010 midterm elections , not because of their anachronous tenets , but because of historical patterns and an electorate exasperated with seeming democratic ineptitude to buttress that theory , i d like to point out more supporting data last wednesday , the pew research center for the people and the press released the report a year out , widespread antiincumbent sentiment , which noted that support for congressional incumbents is particularly low among political independents only 42 of independent voters want to see their own representative reelected and just 25 would like to see most members of congress reelected both measures are near alltime lows in pew research surveys and which party has more incumbents \? yeah , that s right , the democrats on the same day the pew report was released , fivethirtyeightcom published the post house handicapping one year out with it was a table , attributed to david wasserman of the cook political report , which identified 28 democrats who were considered endangered in 2010 and on friday , gallup released a poll which noted that congress job approval rating now precisely matches the 26 recorded in november 2006 , just before control of congress shifted from republicans to democrats , and is not too dissimilar from the 23 recorded in october 1994 , just before control shifted from democrats to republicans now , none of us can see round the bend we don t know for sure what will happen a year from now and , while the democrats have dug themselves into this hole over the last 10 months , they also have 12 months to find a way out of it that said , at this point it doesn t look good what do you think \? i also invite you to join me on , follow me on or email me at chblow nytimescom
anaheim , calif to its credit , baseball tends to overhype its managers far less than football and basketball do their coaches maybe it is because baseball games are generally won by players rather than particularly innovative tactics maybe it is because a baseball manager must calm down more than pump up maybe it is simply the saggypajama uniforms in which the legends of landry and riley would not fit but sometimes matchups between baseball managers can provide some intrigue los angeles spent last week enjoying two at the same time one national league division series , between s and s , was somehow the first time those managing legends had faced each other in the postseason until recently , because they always managed in different leagues , they had almost never sat in opposite dugouts across more than 50 combined seasons meanwhile , down interstate 5 , the ' and boston s began their fourth american league division series against each other in the last six seasons scioscia lost all 3 previous series and 9 of the 10 games over all , making one wonder if it was not arte moreno who owned the angels , but terry francona la russa and torre began managing in the late 1970s , will someday have plaques in the hall of fame and are on baseball s career managing win list \( the top two , the gentlemanly connie mack and the rogue john mcgraw , developed a fierce rivalry early , with world series against each other in 1905 , 1911 and 1913 \) scioscia and francona are more newage managers who were teenagers when la russa and torre filled out their first lineup cards but all four have won world series this decade , francona two of them the wellearned reputations of torre \( easygoing equanimity \) and la russa \( tighter tinkerer \) were not exactly front and center as the dodgers won the first two games of the series torre was decisive in lifting his shaky game 1 starter , randy wolf , in the fourth despite holding a 32 lead it was torre not la russa , who considers relievers to be fleshandblood chess pieces who relied on five relievers to finish a 53 victory la russa loves to change lineups and use pinchhitters he has led the national league in one of those categories each of the last three years , according to baseball info solutions but he did little in either game his starting lineups had just one difference , the leadoff hitter , and when the brilliant starter adam wainwright loaded the bases deep into the eighth inning of game 2 , his 21 lead in serious jeopardy , la russa sat back and let wainwright pitch his patience was rewarded when wainwright got the next out to end the inning some wondered before the series whether torre s cool would rub off more positively on his team than la russa s solemn strategizing would on his the dodgers beat the probable cy young award winner chris carpenter in the first game , then calmly rallied through matt holliday s botched play in the ninth for a shocking 32 victory in game 2 , leaving the cardinals tighter than twine la russa tinkered with his lineup and paraded out relievers saturday in game 3 , but could not stop a dodgers sweep torre and la russa had managed against each other just 19 times , none before 2003 and never in the playoffs meanwhile , scioscia and francona have collided more than mets outfielders in the six years since francona took over the , they have faced off 54 times , 10 of them during three division series that francona s red sox dominated in 2004 , 2007 and 2008 scioscia s teams have always bucked the modern trend by swinging early and running often , but his angels adapted a bit this year with the patient bobby abreu batting second even chone figgins walked 101 times , adding an important dimension to an offense that wound up scoring 883 runs , second in the majors to the yankees the angels won , 50 , on thursday night via walks \( abreu scored on two of his four \) and power \( torii hunter s threerun homer \) things returned to normal in game 2 , when a howie kendrick steal in the seventh inning led to the tiebreaking run in a 41 victory then again , given how that rally started with a walk to vladimir guerrero , you know the angels have changed francona is used to adapting with the red sox , from the lumbering ramirezortizmillar sluggers of several years ago to this year s considerably more wellrounded bunch , led by jacoby ellsbury and his 70 steals up top and several other decent runners behind him whereas the old red sox could go several years between triples , ellsbury s threebase hit on friday night led to boston s only run of the series torre is the raconteur , la russa the tactician , scioscia the catalyst and francona the comedian before game 1 , francona got a nasty case of food poisoning from an unfortunate choice of southern california snack probably del taco , he said they do n't support mlb , do they \? they just support the angels \? yeah , it was del taco when someone asked whether he had a beef with some bad umpiring calls , francona added , do n't bring up the word beef , please in a rare treat , these division series really did put two interesting pairs of managers together no symphonies thundered in the background and gq never stopped by but it was quite the pajama party
tampa , fla with no decision made in the medical matter , the mood around the returned to normal somewhat saturday some of the highlights came from the right arm and right foot of starter  rodriguez , the slugging third baseman , is mulling the possibility of surgery to correct a torn labrum in his right hip , a procedure that could keep him out of action for four months he remained in vail , colo , to consult with a surgeon and to undergo tests wang is coming back from missing the second half of the 2008 season with a severe injury to his right foot his performance saturday was as comforting as the balmy weather as he pitched three sharp innings and fielded his position crisply i feel fine , good , i'm running and i'm not feeling anything , wang said after the beat the yankees , 31 , in an exhibition at steinbrenner field no problem wang was challenged in the first inning when the braves' leadoff hitter , josh anderson , dropped a long bunt to the right side wang scooped up the ball on the run and flipped it quickly with his glove to first baseman mark teixeira to retire anderson by a step in the third inning , casey kotchman of the braves also forced wang to run to his left , ripping a hopper to the right of teixeira as teixeira fielded the ball , wang raced to cover the bag he caught teixeira s throw in stride , retiring kotchman wang said he did not think about the old injury on those plays , but manager did i still worry about it , girardi said when asked if opponents would continue to test wang with bunts , girardi said , he might have to prove himself teixeira , referring to wang s play on the bunt , said there are n't many pitchers who can make that play he did a perfect job among atlanta s three hits , the only one that damaged wang was kotchman s solo home run in the first inning wang said it came on a changeup that , because of poor delivery , stayed up the ball landed over the rightfield fence wang threw 33 pitches , 27 of them strikes , and faced 12 batters , striking out two and walking none despite the strikes , he said he was not happy with his control because everything was down the middle wang struck out anderson swinging in the third inning on a changeup \( his beisu chou \) he has worked on the pitch in camp , along with a slider , to add to his trademark sinker his slider made a lot of progress last year , girardi said , adding that it bit in the opposite direction of his sinker wang sustained the injury to his right foot a sprained ligament and a torn tendon while running the bases at houston on june 15 wang won that game and finished the season at 82 to raise his career record to 5420 if wang had played in the current world baseball classic , he would have represented taiwan rodriguez would have played for the dominican republic the men s personalities are about as different they can be rodriguez tends to generate controversy he recently acknowledged having used performanceenhancing substances he makes himself available to reporters in limited fashion and often refuses to answer specific questions rodriguez s words are often dissected for hints of ulterior meaning some took his praise of the dominican shortstop and leadoff hitter jos reyes of the mets a few days ago as an implied criticism of his yankees teammates derek jeter and johnny damon wang , conversely , makes few waves in the clubhouse , he is almost always approachable he tends to answer in short sentences in a soft voice after long pauses he smiles although wang s english has improved , he has little to say in any language most of his answers saturday were in english , but he used an interpreter when asked about his national team being eliminated from the classic by china i really wanted to play it s really hard for me , wang said i still need to do some work with the yankees chinese taipei needs a lot of baseball knowledge to learn and improve
a ballet dies with the fall of the curtain nobody knows whether the inner life that makes each ballet special will still be there next year , or even tomorrow the text of a ballet s steps may be preserved by film , notation or the often remarkable memories of dancers , but you can use all three and still find that what was a living work of theater has become a mausoleum merce cunningham , who recently announced plans for the preservation of his choreography after his death , probably knows the problems as well as anybody in recent years when two of his 1980s works were revived , fabrications \( 1987 \) looked even fresher than it had in its original production , but pictures \( 1984 \) , which when new seemed like prospero s isle and proved the most popular success his company had ever enjoyed , had inexplicably lost its spell nonetheless many ballets manage to survive their makers george balanchine \( 190483 \) and \( 190488 \) the world s foremost choreographers of classical ballet in the last half of the 20th century \( their equals have not yet emerged \) both often spoke with skepticism about the survival of their ballets but then acknowledged the likelihood of their survival by bequeathing them to specific friends in their wills following balanchine s example in this , ashton singled out six friends in his will , leaving to each a brace of ballets the ballerina margot fonteyn , for example , received daphnis and chloe \( 1951 \) and ondine \( 1958 \) , in each of which she had created the ballerina role the remainder he left to his nephew anthony russellroberts a wide range of ashton choreography has endured on tuesday the royal ballet dances his oneact month in the country \( 1976 \) in washington beginning june 29 american ballet theater , which in 2007 danced his dream \( 1964 \) , dances a week of performances of his threeact sylvia \( 1952 \) neither 2009 nor 2010 brings any special ashton anniversary , and not all companies have yet announced their plans for 200910 , but we already know that the coming season will see stagings of his choreography by both the royal ballet and the royal danish ballet , the joffrey ballet in chicago , the sarasota ballet and ballet west in salt lake city these surviving dances range from 1930 to 1985 , from threeact ballets to gala divertissements and from puredance academic classicism to characterladen narrative comedy but in what shape and in whose hands \? fonteyn died in 1991 she left the bulk of her to her brother , felix , who in turn left it to his daughter , lavinia hookham the two ballets used to be performed exclusively by the royal ballet at covent garden , and there were doubts about whether they could remain serious without fonteyn s own interpretations but not only were both revived in this decade at covent garden , ondine was also staged by the ballet of la scala , milan , and daphnis more recently by the birmingham royal ballet both ballets have brought ms hookham more royalties in this decade than came her aunt s way as it happens , ms hookham s role has been admirably passive she has neither proposed nor made any changes to the ballets she delegates responsibility for their stagings to those deemed by the royal ballet to know best another of ashton s longterm dance friends was alexander grant , who created roles in ashton ballets from 1948 to 1976 and who was staying with ashton when he died to him were left fa ade \( 1931 , recently danced by the sarasota ballet , among others \) and the twoact fille mal gard e \( 1960 \) ashton himself told me in 1984 that fille was the ballet he expected to survive best ashton s will was ambiguous about what ownership of the ballets implied mr grant and michael somes , another legatee , assumed that they could take control of how the ballets were danced and who danced them the dance text of fille , as happens with all ballets , underwent a few reaccentuations and adjustments during ashton s lifetime under mr grant s care , however , many more of these emerged , so that by 1994 i was hearing of how the birmingham royal ballet dancers were referring , affectionately but ruefully , to alexander s fille' it is a later stage of alexander s fille' that was danced by american ballet theater in this decade mr grant is an endearing and beloved figure it is easy to feel that even while he changes the letter of ashton s ballets , he is true to their spirit i did n't see ballet theater s fille , but i'm happy to hear that it was better than the one by the royal ballet at the same time still , i do n't think it is mere pedantry that makes me fret about the letter of the choreography s being lost the royal ballet and mr grant rely on the use of benesh dance notation when staging their ballets in 1997 , at the roehampton conference on revivals and reconstructions of ballet , the notator michele braban recounted how she had had to spend so long analyzing the differences among various filmed versions of fille that she had finally been required , for sake of economy , simply to record the version currently being danced as the new standard text this story became more distressing when it emerged that nobody had even given her a copy of margaret dale s definitive film of the original fille production many steps and gestures have demonstrably been altered since ashton s day in one recent season at covent garden every single fille performance seemed to bring the erosion of some further detail the ballet still pulsates with the tenderness , love and joy that always made it one of the most lifeenhancing ballets ever made , but it s being danced in what shakespeareans might fairly call a third quarto edition , with many details of ashton s finer poetry smudged and who can be sure that when mr grant is no longer with us , its more lovable qualities will survive \? mr somes , the main r gisseur of the ashton repertory during ashton s lifetime and his fiercest loyalist , was left symphonic variations \( 1946 \) and the threeact cinderella \( 1948 \) , in both of which he had created the leading male role mr somes was disgruntled with the royal ballet at the time of ashton s death , so he staged the puredance symphonic variations which had been exclusively royal ballet fare in ashton s lifetime for several other companies , including \( in 1992 \) american ballet theater , which has revived it several times since then this did more good than perhaps even mr somes had anticipated he had tended to infantilize royal ballet dancers in relation to symphonic variations i remember one dancer telling me in 1979 that merely to be admitted to rehearsals for this ballet was like being allowed to see the holy grail but ballet theater s dancers brought no excessive reverence to the ballet and restored to it a spontaneity that had long been missing when mr somes died in 1994 , he left the ballets to his wife , the former dancer wendy ellis , and there is no question that he also gave her his perfectionist zeal still , problems arose in 2003 , when she commissioned new designs for cinderella , with sets by toer van shayk and costumes by christine haworth that were more prettypretty than any of the three versions in ashton s lifetime \( the joffrey ballet , shrewdly , acquired the previous designs , which were by ashton s longtime colleague david walker and were part of a production supervised by ashton only eight months before his death \) ms ellis has a keen eye for dancers she was the first in the 1999 royal ballet revival of symphonic variations to give a major role to alina cojocaru , now a leading exponent of the ashton style at its 2005 covent garden revival , symphonic variations was looking more radiant than it had since 1977 , with audience ovations to match but ms ellis cannot always make the corps de ballet of stars in cinderella dance with the attack and pliancy that ashton demanded , let alone be the best guide to the clowning of the ugly sisters , two potentially hilarious but frequently exaggerated drag roles and what will happen to these ballets when ms ellis can no longer supervise them \? choreography is the most fragile of art forms the balanchine repertory was lucky in that , within a few years of his death the balanchine trust was established to supervise stagings , and every owner of a balanchine ballet placed his or her works into the balanchine trust s domain \( apart from john taras , who owned symphony in c , a work whose text has become controversial \) even in these circumstances there are controversies the marriage between a company acquiring a balanchine ballet and the person authorized to stage it is not always fortunate but the ashton repertory is in more perilous condition in 2004 the centenary of ashton s birth arrived with the longdesired announcement of an ashton trust certainly this now acts for lavinia hookham and the two ballets originally left to fonteyn tony dyson , to whom ashton left monotones and enigma variations , is the trust s chairman just how the ashton trust operates is otherwise vague it seems as yet not to include the ballets now belonging to alexander grant and wendy ellis somes when i have approached a number of international ballet companies about their negotiations to stage or revive an ashton ballet , none of them has mentioned any dealings with any ashton trust la fille mal gard e is not the only ballet whose text has been posthumously revised to whom should i complain about one ruinous change that has been made by the great dramatic ballerina lynn seymour to ashton s five brahms waltzes in the manner of isadora duncan \? \( she stages it next season in copenhagen \) when dancers of ashton s 1952 sylvia say that the 2004 version reconstructed from a film of a 1963 rehearsal and its latest revivals feature steps on the downbeat that should be on the upbeat , who will listen \? must we , only 21 years after ashton s death , settle for third quarto versions of ballets that once made him the toast on both sides of the atlantic \?
phnom penh , at first glance it seems to be simply a numbers game whether to try 5 , 10 or more defendants for the deaths of an estimated 17 million people at the hands of the three decades ago but as a backed tribunal prepares to hold its first trial hearing this month , the wrangle over numbers is reinforcing longstanding concerns about the tribunal s fairness and independence the cambodian government , critics say , is trying to limit the scope of the trials for its own political reasons , a limit that the critics say would compromise justice and could discredit the entire process to me , it s the credibility of the tribunal which is at stake , its integrity and therefore its credibility , said christophe peschoux , who runs the cambodia office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights the first defendant is the man with perhaps the most horrifying past kaing guek eav , known as duch \( pronounced doik \) , the commander of the tuol sleng torture house in phnom penh , where at least 14 , 000 people were sent to their deaths his trial is to open with a procedural hearing , set for feb 17 , during which more substantive sessions , involving witnesses and evidence , are expected to be scheduled four other defendants , all of whom were members of the khmer rouge central committee , are also in custody , waiting their turns to face charges on crimes that occurred while they were at the top of the chain of command from 1975 to 1979 as much as onefourth of the population in cambodia died from disease , hunger or overwork , or were executed under the khmer rouge s brutal communist rule those five defendants are enough , cambodian officials say but foreign legal experts counter that within reasonable limits , the judicial process should not be arbitrarily limited after a decade of difficult and not always friendly negotiations between the united nations and the cambodians , a hybrid tribunal is in place , with cambodian and foreign coprosecutors and cojudges in an awkward political and legal balancing act now , even before duch s trial gets under way , that balance is being tested last month the foreign coprosecutor , a canadian named robert petit , submitted six more names to the court for investigation , saying that he had gathered enough evidence to support possible charges mr petit s cambodian counterpart , chea leang , objected not on legal grounds , but for reasons that appear to reflect the government s position on the trials additional indictments , the cambodian prosecutor said , could be destabilizing she said they would cost too much , take too long and violate the spirit of the tribunal , which she said envisioned only a small number of trials prime minister hun sen , who bargained hard with the united nations over the shape and scope of the tribunal , has said that trying four or five people would be enough , although there is no formal limit on the number indeed , peter maguire , author of facing death in cambodia , suggests that mr hun sen s plan might be to try only duch a gardenvariety war criminal and hope the other defendants die before they can be tried the additional names submitted by mr petit have not been made public but people close to the court say that none of them hold a significant position in cambodia s current government mr hun sen and several senior members of his government were khmer rouge cadres , but experts say they do not fall under the scope of the tribunal and are not at risk of prosecution the mandate of the court is to try the top leadership of the khmer rouge and those most responsible for the crimes that is , people like duch , who is accused of overseeing the torture and killing of thousands in cambodia , though , courts do not head off in their own directions without tight control from mr hun sen or the people around him some advocates of the tribunal , called the extraordinary chambers of the courts of cambodia or eccc , see it as challenging this topdown control by offering cambodia a model for a more independent judiciary some in phnom penh are apparently frightened that the eccc might actually succeed , that it might serve as an example of accountability that could be applied more widely , said james a goldston , executive director of the open society justice initiative , a new yorkbased organization that pursues legal reform with the feb 17 start of the first trial fast approaching , now is the moment to show that the court is not a tool of the cambodian government , he said most cambodians are eager to see khmer rouge leaders on trial , according to a survey published last week by the human rights center at the university of california , berkeley but the poll found that about onethird of people answering the survey had doubts about the tribunal s neutrality and independence , perhaps because of their experience with their own corrupt and coerced judiciary confidence in the tribunal has also been eroded by allegations of kickbacks that are familiar in the cambodian court system the united nations has investigated the allegations but has not released its findings now , with the dispute between the two coprosecutors in the open , the checks and balances of the hybrid court will meet their first major test the dispute must now go to a panel known as the pretrial chamber , whose makeup reflects the supermajority structure of the tribunal three cambodian judges and two foreign judges there is nothing so far to suggest that this process will not work as it should , said david j scheffer , a human rights law professor at northwestern university school of law who took part in talks to create the tribunal the real test , mr scheffer said in a recent article in the phnom penh post , will be whether the judges in the pretrial chamber step up to the plate and do their duty with the highest degree of judicial integrity we can all assess that when their decision is rendered , he said
nothing says you have to be a specialist to perform baroque music but if you 're going so far as to mount a baroque festival , you 'd better have considerable expertise on hand so when the opened its annual baroque festival at alice tully hall on friday evening , it was good to hear the harpsichordist kenneth cooper playing a central role mr cooper , who values expressivity above all , sometimes in the form of crunching tone clusters , was at his feisty best in the opening piece , heinrich von biber s uproarious sonata representativa in a , with the violinist ida kavafian mr cooper stole the show with his bloated and inert depiction of the frog , though ms kavafian all but stole it back with the equally selfsatisfied meowing of the cat with nice symmetry , mr cooper ended the program in partnership with ms kavafian s sister , the violinist ani kavafian , in vivaldi s concerto in f for violin and harpsichord \( rv 542 \) they gave a rustic cast to the finale , adding embellishments that pointed toward a modern hoedown \( we decorated quite a bit , mr cooper allowed in an interview later , calling vivaldi s chords annoyingly simple \) francesco geminiani s concerto grosso in d minor after corelli s follia , one of a venerable line of works on the theme of madness , was appropriately colorful but in corelli s concerto grosso in c minor \( op 6 , no 3 \) , the eight string players might have done well to heed the injunction adorning the lid of the harpsichord mr cooper played a phrase from alexander pope , to wake the soul by tender strains of art instead , they produced an oddly aggressive , modern wall of sound , drenched in vibrato , rendering mr cooper s playing scarcely audible the soprano dominique labelle also brought considerable earlymusic expertise to the program she sang bach s secular cantata non sa che sia dolore \( none can know the sorrow \) \( bwv 209 \) , a little lament on the departure of a friend that leads in the end to rollicking good wishes for favorable winds and waves ms labelle was a little shrill in her high register at the start , perhaps still adjusting to the renovated hall s lively acoustics , but she quickly settled into an attractive sound and was wholly appealing in that billowing finale she was deftly seconded at every turn by the flutist tara helen o'connor ms labelle also performed songs by henry purcell , touching in their simplicity , astonishing in their variety
what constitutes dance \? we 've known for at least a century that dance can happen with the dancer sitting , reclining or kneeling in the first three decades of the 20th century isadora duncan turned such movements into legend in recent decades dance has only become harder to distinguish from other forms of physical activity here , however , i honor the importance of feet and footwork in dancing every part of the body arms , fingers , thighs , eyes , waist , pelvis , neck can make an irresistible contribution to this art but the effect of the foot is disproportionate make a complex rhythm with your hands \( like drumming \) , and in visual terms it s just a local phenomenon make even a simple a rhythm with your feet slow , slow , quick , quick , slow and your whole body is engaged the foot is at the root of poetry lines of verse are divided into feet , and that s because words , music and dance were once intimately connected and in terms of physical complexity , the foot is among the most miraculous mechanisms of the body \( dancers with broken or fractured bones in their feet have given great performances \) the instep , the toes , the heels and the soles can be used together in multiple ways whether in shoes with heels \( as in flamenco , tango or ballroom \) sheathed in ballet slippers and poised on point \( as with women in ballet \) or bare \( as in much modern dance , in most african dance and , often with bells round the ankles , in indian dance \) , the foot is what gives human movement much of its texture and meter two of the most remarkable visiting dancers to new york in 2009 made footwork a matter of sensational importance the russian ballerina natalia osipova \( dancing two roles with american ballet theater at the metropolitan opera house in july \) and the argentine tango dancer gabriel miss \( dancing in september in two milongas and in two fall for dance performances at city center \) both these dancers left an impression of blaze behind them , and , though they 're compelling through to their fingertips , much of that incandescence came , in contrasting ways , from beneath the ankle with ms osipova the exceptional thrill came from the liftoff provided by her feet in more than 30 years of watching ballet i 've never seen that degree of spring many of mr miss s steps came in percussive clusters too dense to decipher , some bombarding a single spot of floor with rapidfire insistence , others suddenly pouncing like a cat i do n't mean to suggest that either of these artists relies on footwork as a stunt ms osipova is remarkable to watch just standing on point she is one of those ballerinas \( the russians seem to have a preponderance of them , but they 're rare anywhere \) whose weight seems to contradict reality and to flow not down to the toe but up through the body and into the air mr miss is a beguiling spectacle simply when gliding cheek to cheek with his partner \( natalia hills \) in a tranquil current his feet are always central to the flow and drama of his dancing no dances make more splendid use of the sole of the foot and its contact with the floor than those of india \( the bestknown genres in new york are odissi , kathak and bharatanatyam i wish we saw more of each \) i especially love the way a dancer will lift a flexed foot , hold it parallel to the floor and then bring it down so that its sole slaps the ground like a cymbal \( whereas most dancers like to perform on sprung floors , indian dancers often prefer the solidity of stone \) this effect is just one among many each indian dance form makes vivid uses of the foot s ball and heel , often deploying the instep with terrific speed and intricacy whatever the dance idiom , good choreography shows how many different moves this relatively small part of the anatomy can make watching george balanchine s nutcracker the other day at new york city ballet , i was struck again by the many ways he deploys the feet the soldier doll in act i does much with his feet flexed and on his heels the coffee dancer keeps crossing one knee in front of another and gliding on her slippered soles the male tea dancer s feet keep exploding sideways like firecrackers the marzipan soloist hops on one point while slowly revolving full circle , then performs jumps in which each foot writes rings in the air \( known as gargouillades \) duncan \( 18771927 \) generally danced barefoot , which , like her abandonment of the corset , struck some as distasteful grandly rapturous in manner , she defended her style by saying , i believe in the religion of the beauty of the human foot this religion s vocabulary began with what used to be called natural footwork walking , running , hopping and skipping and she taught children , in their earliest lessons , to make compound rhythms with their feet inspired by the sculptures of ancient greece , she noted when one foot should stay flat on the floor while the other leg lifts , or when the dancer should rise onto the ball of one foot without duncan s heroism , such a style started to seem quaint yet in 1988 mark morris , without claiming to reproduce duncan s style literally , made a tremendous impression while reviving its essence in his fullevening allegro , il penseroso ed il moderato strongly marked by the rapturously grecian flavor that had been part of duncan s notion of the natural in dance , this work rightly became the most enthusiastically greeted work of mr morris s career to date here again was the beauty that duncan revealed in walking , running , hopping and skipping other great choreographers of american modern dance have rediscovered natural footwork in quite other ways paul taylor s 1975 esplanade a yet more exceptional classic is also made up of walking , running , skidding , sliding , falling its particular secret is the way it makes these movements heartstoppingly spontaneous none of its steps quite looks like a classroom exercise , and yet they are , evidently , steps i have been writing to celebrate feet and footwork , but i also wish to issue an alarm other than mr taylor , mr morris and twyla tharp , how many of today s choreographers in ballet , modern dance or other genres take much interest in how much the foot can do \? in ballet , footwork reached peaks of coloratura accomplishment in the choreography of frederick ashton \( witness his rhapsody , 1980 \) and george balanchine \( see his ballo della regina , 1977 \) that no subsequent dance maker seems interested in rivaling too many moderndance choreographers today like to use the flat foot as an anchor , with the dancing happening from the ankle up they seem reluctant to ask their dancers to use their insteps or even their heels footwork is where ballroom dancing begins , yet few ballroom exponents today seem remotely as interested in steps as they are in high kicks , acrobatics and displays of overwrought sexiness i have sat through an alltango evening in which mr miss and ms hills were the exceptions in making footwork a serious part of the music and the drama so when i get the blues about the future of dance , i foresee a world without footwork but there is reason to hope that such a world may be avoided the feet of david hallberg , mr miss and ms osipova are exceptional by any historical standard , and there are other feet to anticipate soledad barrio appears this christmas in new york with noche flamenca \( lucille lortel theater , dec 24 to jan 16 \) , and rocio molina will dance as part of the city s 2010 flamenco festival \( city center , feb 12 \) i know of no dancers today who better show below the ankle in particular the brilliance and color of flamenco rhythm the choreographer alexei ratmansky keeps growing as a dance poet his poetry is often at its most subtle and various when showing what the foot can do , and several new ratmansky creations are coming in 2010 the british moderndance choreographer richard alston brings his dance company to the joyce theater next month \( jan 12 to 17 \) at his variable best he is the most musically revealing choreographer today and the one who makes the most virtuoso use of footwork \( and shows how the two skills are connected \) daft as this may sound to nondancers , the foot has sometimes been considered the most divine part of the body when the romantic ballerina marie taglioni appeared in russia in the late 1830s , a cartoonist depicted her single point descending from a cloud , as if heaven sent mr alston s first work as a dancer , in the 1960s , was in baroque dance , with the teacherchoreographer belinda quirey as she used to say , the good lord may have had an off day when he made the knee , but he surely was in marvelous form when he made the foot

the recent publication of a jury of her peers , elaine showalter s sprawling history of american women writers , has provoked much discussion about the gender politics of reading and writing you know that continuous , noisy debate about why most prizes \( and reviews \) go to male novelists , when most buyers and readers of fiction are women it s the one where female critics ask why novels about men in boats get more attention and respect than novels about women in houses all very good questions but in the meantime it s useful to ponder the way our ideas of the masculinity or femininity of works of fiction can change over time for example , i was surprised to learn a few weeks ago , while researching a story on jane austen monster mashups , that until fairly recently the bardess of basingstoke was regarded as pretty much for the boys there is a pattern throughout the victorian period and into the modern era that sees the great english statesmen and literati and gentlemen scholars manifesting their devotion to austen by reading her novels over and over , deidre lynch , a professor at the university of toronto who has written extensively on austen devotees , told me in an email message benjamin disraeli read pride and prejudice 17 times , and matthew arnold and john henry newman read mansfield park every year the historian thomas babbington macaulay read austen obsessively and , as a colonial administrator in india , wrote letters home comparing various colleagues to characters in emma and pride and prejudice none of them are known to have covered the books in plain brown paper in fact , lynch points out , the term janeite today used somewhat derisively to refer to austen s besotted female fans came into usage in the 1890s thanks to men who wore it like a badge of honor kipling s 1923 story the janeites was about a platoon of british soldiers who use austen talk to distract themselves from the horror of the trenches and here s e m forster , coming out as a jane austenite in 1924 i am a jane austenite , and therefore slightly imbecile about jane austen my fatuous expression , and airs of personal immunity how ill they sit on the face , say , of a stevensonian ! but jane austen is so different she is my favorite author ! i read and reread , the mouth open and the mind closed shut up in measureless content , i greet her by the name of most kind hostess , while criticism slumbers on the distaff side of the library , women readers were often much less enthusiastic charlotte br nte , lynch says , bridled when george henry lewes \( george eliot s paramour \) kept pushing the novels on her why do you like miss austen so very much \? i am puzzled on this point the heroine of troy chimneys , margaret kennedy s 1953 historical novel set in the regency , offered one possible explanation when the male hero keeps pressing mansfield park and emma on a lady he knows , she pushes back , arguing that the books , however entertaining , ended up keeping her , well , in the house austen s greatest admirers , she says , will always be men , i believe for , when they have had enough of the parlor , they may walk out , you know , and we cannot but by the mid20th century , austen had become identified as a women s author lynch points to a 1947 usage cited in the oed that suggests that the question of the janeite s gender was starting to make people nervous men as masculine as scott and kipling have been janeites and have been enthralled by her sly humor and fidelity to reality as opposed to the awesome clothes and swoony subplots \? next time i go whaling , i m taking jane
you could be tempted to view the s concert at avery fisher hall on thursday night as a case of what might have been , who has led the orchestra with increasing regularity in recent seasons , made his first podium appearance here since accepting the role of music director for the chicago symphony orchestra last may mr muti turned down a similar offer from the new york philharmonic in 2000 , and stated as recently as september 2007 that he was not interested in taking on the demands of a fulltime position but anyone approaching this particular concert mindful of the one that got away must surely have been disappointed or perhaps relieved the performance only rarely delivered on the promise implicit in this potentially potent combination of maestro and ensemble for haydn s symphony no 89 , mr muti deployed an appropriately scaleddown complement of strings , winds and horns following on the heels of the famous paris symphonies and preceded by a genuine masterpiece in no 88 , the work is not among haydn s betterknown creations still , it has vivacity , elegance and wit in abundance or it does on paper , anyway mr muti s tempos were unfailingly well judged , his control of dynamic contrast and textural detail exacting as ever from a technical perspective , the orchestra s execution was beyond reproach even so , the performance was curiously devoid of animation apart from the contributions of robert langevin , principal flutist , and liang wang , principal oboist , it was difficult to detect the vibrancy and spirit that make haydn s music such a joy the orchestra fared better as a backing band for the german bassbaritone thomas quasthoff in a selection of arias from haydn s last two completed operas , armida and l'anima del filosofo ossia orfeo ed euridice given that mr quasthoff s latest cd , a collection of haydn arias , arrives on tuesday , it was hard not to think of this appearance as a timely promotional opportunity opera was hardly haydn s strong suit , and none of these examples made a convincing case to the contrary \( they sound better on mr quasthoff s disc , where a periodinstrument ensemble provides greater color and bite \) still , mr quasthoff made the most of this unusual fare his robust tone and sure dramatic instincts yielded especially fine results in the lovely chi spira e non spera from l'anima the difference between these performances and the account of brahms s serenade no 1 , which followed the intermission , was almost startling crowned by radiant , secure playing from philip myers , the principal french hornist , the orchestra sounded warm and opulent shaped by mr muti s wise , stylish guidance , the result was a rendition of palpable commitment and worldclass finesse
farrah s story was awful it was awful not because it was a harrowing portrait of farrah fawcett s fight with cancer it was awful because it was an exploitative portrait of a celebrity s fight with cancer on friday , nbc took ms fawcett s candid video diary and allowed it to be packaged as a generic vh1 behind the music biography maudlin music , gauzy slowmotion film , and pseudorevealing interviews with friends , coworkers , doctors and hairdressers reminiscing about a former star ryan o neal , ms fawcett s longtime companion , is devotedly at her side for much of the time , but his preening actor s vanity keeps creeping into the frame at one point , after one german doctor gives ms fawcett good news \( shortlived , as it turned out \) , a relieved mr o neal says , i thought i was in another love story movie it was brave of ms fawcett , 62 , to invite cameras into her exam rooms , surgical procedures and her struggles with nausea , pain and hair loss she wears eye makeup even when receiving painful laser treatments for her liver , but doesn t hesitate to take off her wool cap and reveal her shaved head after radiation destroyed her famous blond mane in one of the final scenes , her son redmond , who is in prison on drug charges , shuffles into her bedroom wearing his la county prison shirt and climbs on to her bed beside her to say goodbye it was clear that ms fawcett wanted to take back her story from the paparazzi and the celebrity magazines and have some control over its telling yet sadly , her film stylistically mirrors some of the worst excesses of our tabloid culture and like many cancer patients , she says she wants to find larger purpose to her suffering at the end of the program , the actress says she made the film to alert public attention to an overlooked disease why isn t there more research done on certain types of cancer \? she asks and why doesn t our healthcare system embrace alternative treatments that have proven successful in other countries \? the film isn t as nearly as brave or as seriousminded as its cancerstricken subject alana stewart , ms fawcett s close friend , held the camera at some of the most difficult private moments , and comes off commendably as a valiant , reliable pillar of support to the actress but none of the doctors , advisers or medical experts interviewed throughout the twohour special explains that one of the most common risk factors for anal cancer is human papilloma virus , and that the hpv vaccine can prevent not just cervical cancer but also anal cancer nobody mentions anal pap smears , which researchers increasingly cite as a way to screen for cell changes that lead to anal cancer the film also doesn t make clear that in many cases , anal cancer can be treated and cured \( the american cancer society estimates that there will be 5 , 290 new cases of anal cancer in 2009 and 710 deaths \) and ms fawcett s reliance on european alternative treatments is more poignant than persuasive her exuberant german doctors seem far too giddily invested in their visiting patient s fame to give her realistic prognoses or even dissuade her from flying home to los angeles before she was strong enough to travel during one painful procedure , a german doctor asks ms fawcett to name her best work the actress mentions a few of the films she made that were critically acclaimed , including extremities and the television movie the burning bed the doctor reminds her about her 1970s television show charlie s angels ms fawcett replies weakly , well , i only did that for one year those trips evidently gave ms fawcett hope and lots of encouragement and personal attention , but the film doesn t shed much light on how much or whether the treatments actually helped i m the girl who always believed in change , ms fawcett says , explaining her determination to fight her disease by all and any means necessary she deserves a different , less exploitative television tribute
an 18yearold man shot and wounded three people at a bronx pizza restaurant early sunday before police officers who heard the gunfire shot him , the authorities said the 18yearold , whose name was not released , was in stable condition sunday morning at jacobi medical center in the bronx , the police said the three people shot inside the restaurant a woman and two men were also taken to jacobi their injuries were not lifethreatening , the authorities said no officers were injured the police said officers who were patrolling the neighborhood about 12 15 am heard gunfire and went to the corner of westchester and elder avenues they confronted the 18yearold , who was standing in the street and firing into the restaurant , a papa john s outlet at 1522 westchester avenue , the authorities said inside , officers found three people who had been shot the police said early indications were that only one of them was the gunman s intended victim the restaurant , which is located in a residential neighborhood in the shadow of the tracks of the no 6 line , was open at the time one of the people shot was a 27yearold woman , who was hit in the knee , and another was her companion , 33 , who was shot in the torso , the police said none of the victims' names were released at least four shots were fired into the restaurant , said the manager , halvin arroyo , 23 he said he saw three bullet holes in the employees' entrance , and one in the door customers use it s not a good neighborhood it s a rough neighborhood , mr arroyo said but i did n't think that anything like this would happen in the store mr arroyo , who was not at the restaurant at the time , said an assistant manager was in the back , near the pizza oven , when the shooting occurred mr arroyo , who said he arrived about 15 minutes later , said the police would not allow him inside right away the police cordoned off two blocks of westchester avenue while they investigated
the violinist rachel barton pine has recorded plentifully and has performed in new york several times as a chamber player , most notably at the with trio settecento , her periodinstrument group , in 2006 the program on that occasion was a set of baroque trio sonatas in which the violin held the spotlight most of the time but it turns out that ms pine had never played a traditional recital here , the kind with just piano accompaniment \( or none \) and with a program that ranges across a few centuries and styles she rectified that omission on tuesday evening with a recital at as part of the hall s new york chamber music festival because ms pine is a star in chicago , her hometown , the concert was broadcast live on wfmt , chicago s principal classical music station , with the radio personality william mcglaughlin as the host and , unaccountably , a permanent stage fixture though he did not conduct an interview with ms pine or introduce the works \( ms pine did that herself \) , mr mcglaughlin sat at a table on the stage through both halves of the program , sometimes writing or drinking water was that absolutely necessary \? ms pine began where her frick performance had left off , in the heart of the baroque , with a sonata in a minor for unaccompanied violin \( 1717 \) by johann georg pisendel , a contemporary of bach and a kindred spirit like bach , pisendel provided a single line of music , phrased in ways that invite a player to create the illusion of counterpoint ms pine accomplished that with deftly shifting articulation and color you may have wished , all the same , that she had played bach instead , but ms pine made a valiant case for pisendel as a reasonable alternative she was joined for the rest of the program by matthew hagle , a sensitive pianist who knew when to defer , and when deference would be counterproductive they proved a wellmatched duo in mendelssohn s sonata in f \( 1838 \) , which gives both players singing lines as well as sparkling , brisk figuration but it took them a few moments to find common ground ms pine s phrasing was oddly breathless at first and seemed to push against mr hagle s more settled pace she found her bearings by the end of the first movement in the central adagio she played with a warm tone that stopped just short of lugubriousness , an approach that set up the sizzling finale perfectly ms pine recalibrated only slightly for john corigliano s sonata \( 1963 \) , a neoromantic work that thrives on melody , but uses chromaticism freely to give its tunes both a modern cast and a touch of unpredictability it has stood up remarkably well having weathered a period when consonance was suspect , it seems prescient now that a generation of composers have adopted mr corigliano s eclecticism ms pine and mr hagle closed their recital with fiery accounts of two showpieces rooted in gypsy fiddling liszt s hungarian rhapsody no 2 , and , in an encore , cesar espejo s airs tziganes
washington , the former senior clinton state department official for africa , seemed assured of being confirmed as the next american ambassador to the after her senate hearing on thursday senators subjected her to fairly gentle questions , focused as much on foreign policy issues as on the concern that the united states does not get its money s worth from the organization in her opening statement before the foreign relations committee , ms rice , who was the senior foreign policy advisor to the obama campaign , said she would work on four priority issues with the overall goal of reinvigorating american leadership at the united nations the most frequent terms she used seemed to be renew and robust diplomacy the priorities she identified are improving the capacity of the united nations to undertake peacekeeping operations providing leadership in addressing preventing both the spread and the use of nuclear weapons and focusing on alleviating the suffering of the world s poorest asked repeatedly about what the obama administration would do about the islamic republic of iran acquiring nuclear weapons , she said it would pursue a combination of incentives and pressure to block that , although she declined to be more specific citing presidentelect barack obama , she said the united states had to combine tough , direct , robust diplomacy with increased sanctions and pressure to try to elicit a change of course from the iranian regime ms rice answered a host of questions about the effectiveness of the united nations by pointing out that it was far more economical for the united states to rely on un peacekeeping operations than for washington to go it alone for every dollar that the united states spent on such endeavors when it worked on its own , she said , it usually cost the united nations 12 cents that is a pretty good deal , said ms rice , 44 , whose husband , two young children and parents were seated behind her the united states pays 27 percent of the roughly 7 billion annual budget for peacekeeping , which includes around 90 , 000 soldiers in 16 different missions it also pays 22 percent of the overall budget , the largest single contribution ms rice said the costs of no action or unilateral action in many crises was too high , so the answer was to make peacekeeping more effective the previous administration intervened periodically she said , but had not pursued it in a sustained or collective fashion this is not a challenge for the united states alone , she said ms rice called it patently unacceptable that the united nations peacekeeping force in darfur had only just reached half its strength , more than a year after it was formed , largely by underequipped units from the african union the prospective ambassador has been quoted extensively saying that she would never allow a situation like the in rwanda to occur again , so she was asked several times how she would confront the government in sudan over the killing in darfur as well as other crises in africa ms rice said she thought the united states could muster more support from countries like china and russia on sudan or zimbabwe or other issues by emphasizing through quiet diplomacy where the interests of great powers converge with those of the region it is not uncommon to hear quite moving speeches in the halls of the security council , she said , but that was to often followed by a deficit of determination to hold dictators like robert mugabe in zimbabwe to account for their actions the hearings ranged widely , touching on virtually every trouble spot in the world including the congo , somalia , burma and north korea given the fact that the middle east is again up in flames , it was striking that no senators raised the question of the fighting in gaza until some two hours into the nearly threehour hearing when two finally did , it was in the context of what to do to stop hamas firing rockets into israel none mentioned the heavy civilian toll among the population it was ms rice herself who brought up the humanitarian crisis , noting that the incoming obama administration was greatly concerned about the suffering of innocents and on a broader scale determined to forge ahead with a twostate solution there needs to be a durable ceasefire , but a durable ceasefire has to entail the halt to hamas rockets against israel and the israeli people , she said , adding that including effective measures to control weapons smuggling into gaza and an effective means to control the border once the fighting ended , she said , we need to mount a swift and robust effort to attend to the dire humanitarian needs inside gaza many senators , especially from the republican side , expressed concern that the united nations was shutting down an independent unit that had conducted corruption investigations over the past two years in the wake of the oilforfood scandal ms rice expressed her support for continued efforts to reform the organization and root out corruption , but said the effort should be transferred to an internal auditor

bailout fund , known as the troubled asset relief program , or tarp the wall street journal wrote that democrats are expecting two bills totaling about 170 billion that would address the needs of the

health insurance plan the times s robert pear and david herszenhron wrote that the pending proposal , now headed to the congressional budget office for analysis , would permit people ages 55 to 64 to buy in to medicare and allow the office of personnel management to negotiate with insurance companies to offer national health benefit plans if those insurance plans failed to meet democrats goals ,

afghanistan the special inspector general for afghanistan is under fire from a small bipartisan group of senators who say the office lacks leadership and focus at a time when aggressive , independent oversight of the country s reconstruction is more important than ever , the associated press wrote  the senators wrote a letter to president obama that said the office led by general arnold fields , which is responsible for overseeing how billions of dollars appropriated for afghanistan s rebuilding are used , has failed to hire enough staff , has issued too few audit and investigative reports , and may be losing sight of its mission they stopped short of asking for mr fields resignation , but asked the white house to look for improvements the times s richard oppel and elisabeth bumiller wrote that hamid karzai , the afghan president , said tuesday that his country will rely on the financial support of allied nations until at least 2024 in a press conference alongside robert gates ,

support of mr obama s newly articulated approach to the eightyearold conflict off to oslo the president s trip to pick up the nobel peace prize he was awarded two months ago seems to have reignited the heated debate over whether he deserved the prestigious award the politico s glenn thrush pointed to a quinnipac university poll showing that only 26 percent of americans believe mr obama deserves the same prize as the dalai lama , mother teresa , and martin luther king jr the times s jeff zeleny noted that for mr obama the burden for mr obama to accept an award for peace as a wartime leader seems even greater than it did two months ago when the nobel committee startled the world and mr obama with its decision to honor the president well before a full picture of his achievements is known mr obama has to give an acceptance speech , known as a nobel lecture , and will be in and out of oslo in a day no , then yes after weeks of denying that he would enter the new orleans mayoral race ,

washington the army said wednesday that it had mistakenly sent 7 , 000 letters with the salutation dear john doe to family members of soldiers who have died in the wars in iraq and afghanistan the letters , which were sent to provide information about private groups that offer assistance to families of soldiers killed in the wars , were supposed to have carried personal greetings the army said that the mistake was the fault of a subcontractor that printed the letters , but that the service bore ultimate responsibility because it did not check the letters before they were mailed there are no words to adequately apologize for this mistake or for the hurt it may have caused , brig gen reuben d jones , the army adjutant general , said in a statement the army said that its chief of staff , gen george w casey jr , would be sending 7 , 000 personally addressed letters of apology the john doe letters , dated dec 20 and signed by col carl m johnson , the service s director of casualty and mortuary affairs , were sent from the army human resources command , in alexandria , va an army spokesman said that colonel johnson had signed a master letter but that because of either a computer glitch or human error , individual names and addresses had not been printed on each of the 7 , 000 copies mailed whether it s a computer error or a human error does not matter it is an error we find unacceptable , said the spokesman , paul boyce a family member should receive nothing other than personal , sincere and heartfelt communication mr boyce said the army became aware of the error when some family members called to extend thanks for the information but then , without realizing that all copies of the letter carried the mistaken salutation , added that their particular copies had been improperly addressed mr boyce said that as far as the army knew , none of the recipients had expressed anger over the mistake so far , 3 , 544 army troops have died in the wars in iraq and afghanistan , and 23 , 538 have been wounded in action
the cacophony at town hall meetings on health care has startled too many members of congress into passivity and pandering but not representative barney frank , who did not shrink last week from a woman loudly demanding to know why he supported president obama s nazi policy the massachusetts democrat responded with a question of his own on what planet do you spend most of your time \? none of the irespectyouropinion razzmatazz being mouthed by more timorous politicians mr frank could have been more civil it is time for everyone to remember that town hall sessions were invented for rational discussions of differences , not as an outlet for selftherapy caperings la the gong show but it was certainly refreshing to hear him try to jolly or shame his audience into a serious debate , asking , which one of you wants to yell next \? if only similar backbone were shown by politicians like senator charles grassley , a republican principal in the senate s gang of six health care negotiations instead of helping to educate his constituents or move the debate ahead , he provided more red meat for fulminators , erroneously insisting that the rival house health care bill features a government program that determines if you 're going to pull the plug on grandma mr grassley now insists he never uttered the death panels canard at the heart of sarah palin s health care diatribe but he said what he said he and the rest of us are stuck with the grandma line , even as he supposedly is pursuing reasonable compromise in washington back home , the senator also conveniently overlooks his support for the 2003 medicare drug subsidy that included the sort of counseling for endoflife issues and care found in the current house bill

washington , the first secretary of homeland security , asserts in a new book that he was pressured by top advisers to president to raise the national threat level just before the 2004 election in what he suspected was an effort to influence the vote after osama bin laden released a threatening videotape four days before the election , attorney general john ashcroft and defense secretary donald h rumsfeld pushed mr ridge to elevate the public threat posture but he refused , according to the book mr ridge calls it a dramatic and inconceivable event that proved most troublesome and reinforced his decision to resign the provocative allegation provides fresh ammunition for critics who have accused the bush administration of politicizing national security mr bush and his democratic challenger , senator john kerry of massachusetts , were locked in a tight race heading into that final weekend , and some analysts concluded that even without a higher threat level , the bin laden tape helped the president win reelection by reminding voters of the danger of al qaeda keith m urbahn , a spokesman for mr rumsfeld , said the defense secretary supported letting the public know if intelligence agencies believed there was a greater threat , and pointed to a variety of chilling qaeda warnings in those days , including one tape vowing that the streets of america will run red with blood given those facts , mr urbahn said , it would seem reasonable for senior administration officials to discuss the threat level indeed , it would have been irresponsible had that discussion not taken place mr urbahn said the storyline advanced by his publisher seemingly to sell copies of the book is nonsense mr ashcroft could not be reached for comment but mark corallo , who was his spokesman at the justice department , dismissed mr ridge s account did n't happen , he said now would be a good time for mr ridge to use his emergency duct tape frances fragos townsend , who was mr bush s homeland security adviser , said that there was a fulsome debate about the threat level but that the politics of it were not ever a factor mr ridge s book , called the test of our times and due out sept 1 from thomas dunne books , is the latest by a bush adviser to disclose internal disagreements and establish distance from an unpopular administration mr ridge complains that he was never invited to national security council meetings , that mr rumsfeld would rarely meet with him and that the white house pressured him to include a justification for the iraq war in a speech he also writes that he lobbied unsuccessfully before in 2005 to replace michael d brown as head of the federal emergency management agency and that the white house killed his proposal to open a homeland security regional office in new orleans the most sensational assertion was the preelection debate in 2004 about the threat level , first reported by us news world report mr ridge writes that the bin laden tape alone did not justify a change in the nation s security posture but describes a vigorous , some might say dramatic , discussion on oct 30 to do so there was absolutely no support for that position within our department none , he writes i wondered , is this about security or politics \? ' postelection analysis demonstrated a significant increase in the president s approval rating in the days after the raising of the threat level mr ridge provides no evidence that politics motivated the discussion until now , he has denied politics played a role in threat levels asked by eric lichtblau of the new york times if politics ever influenced decisions on threat warnings , he volunteered to take a liedetector test wire me up , mr ridge said , according to mr lichtblau s book , bush s law not a chance politics played no part
