to the editor  \( news article , feb 18 \) leaves the impression that a medical opinion article published in the new england journal of medicine has called into question data used in my june 1 , 2009 , article in the new yorker , that s not the case none of the data i relied upon were the subject of the opinion dartmouth researchers have maintained a database known as the dartmouth atlas analyzing medicare cost information in multiple ways my article investigated why these data show markedly different health care costs among communities , even ones with similar levels of illness and poverty none of these data have been found erroneous there is vigorous debate about how to rate and improve hospital efficiency , however , and the opinion cited by the times disputes a particular way that the dartmouth atlas proposes to do so these ratings were not the subject of my article the fact remains that substantial variations persist in the cost of care for people of similar health depending on where they live and that clinicians with the best results often have lower , not higher , costs than average atul gawande boston , feb 19 , 2010  to the editor re , by ross douthat \( column , feb 15 \) the growing hostility between democrats and republicans has saved america from an illconceived health care reform proposal that would have further sapped our resources during the current financial crisis just about everybody , regardless of his political affiliation , wants to reform health care and one of the most important aspects of reform would provide insurance for millions of unprotected americans the original plan was supposed to afford health care to an additional 10 to 15 percent of the population and reduce the horrific impact of growing health care costs for all americans the democrats could not deliver on the latter but tried to move ahead with the former providing new services to a relatively small number of citizens for 1 trillion without doing anything for the remaining citizens is a nonstarter i'm surprised that the proposal got as far as it did why would americans want health care reform of any kind without a prospective reduction in health care costs \? rising health care costs are already a serious threat to our economy and could someday affect the nation s ability to finance other entitlement programs i say we start the process over and focus on cost reduction salvatore j bommarito new york , feb 15 , 2010
orlando , fla hal steinbrenner , the ' managing general partner , stood in a warm breeze in the portico outside the waldorf astoria hotel here thursday and did his best to project a calm outlook regarding what still has the potential to be a stormy issue for his team mindful that an escalation of rhetoric surrounding the contract negotiations could create the very messiness that he alluded to earlier in the month , steinbrenner tried to eliminate any hint of friction between the two sides although backpage headlines have put more of an edge on the talks , steinbrenner told reporters he was happy with the overall tenor of the negotiations thus far and said it was very important to him and the yankee organization as a whole that the exchanges with jeter be civil absolutely , he said this is a business negotiation none of us want to make it personal because it s not personal both sides have a lot of respect for each other my family has a lot of respect for derek , and i believe it s a mutual thing it s been a good history we 're going to do our best to keep it that way actually , it was steinbrenner who initially raised the prospect that negotiations could get messy in a radio interview he gave earlier this month that prompted jeter s agent , casey close , to respond that jeter s value to the yankees could not be overstated having concluded a 10year , 189 million contract , jeter is now a free agent for the first time in his career despite some level of uncertainty and awkwardness about the current talks , there is no indication that he will not resign with the yankees jeter is a classic yankee whose value to the team goes beyond his onfield performance but just as the team has benefited from his contributions on and off the field , he , too , has benefited from being a yankee , a point that steinbrenner and randy levine , the yankees' president , have tried to make in recent weeks at age 36 , jeter is coming off a season in which and his range at shortstop was further called into question , although  steinbrenner would not say whether the yankees had made an offer yet , but they should soon , and it is expected they will propose a threeyear deal , giving them room to extend it to four years as talks progress i do n't talk about offers , and i do n't talk about numbers , steinbrenner said it s a negotiation , and we 'll keep it that way look , we 're talking that s the important thing we 're hearing each other out steinbrenner also briefly addressed mariano rivera , whose situation is very similar to jeter s , except that he is the yankees have not yet been told whether rivera wants a one or twoyear deal as for the timing of when he would like to resolve the jeter situation , steinbrenner indicated he would like everything concluded by christmas would i like to be relaxing christmas eve \? he said yes , i 'd like to be relaxing christmas eve but it will take as long as it takes the important thing is that we do n't make it personal , we have a lot of respect for each other , and we keep talking that s the deal we 've got to keep talking and we will steinbrenner spoke just before he left the owners' meeting , and less than an hour later he was followed by nolan ryan , the rangers' president , who is in competition with steinbrenner to sign texas' freeagent pitcher , cliff lee ryan said he hoped that lee s experience in texas this season , combined with its proximity to lee s home in little rock , ark , would be enough to overcome steinbrenner s money because , he said , he knew the rangers could not outbid the yankees no , you 're not going to , he said if you want to talk about who probably would be positioned to bid the most money , you 'd have to go with the yankees it s their history
lenox , mass from the moment it was announced , a performance of mahler s epic third symphony at the festival here on saturday night promised to be a highlight of the season james levine , who has shaped memorable versions of this paean to nature in a variety of settings including at least one outdoors , at the was to conduct talented fellows of the tanglewood music center , mostly young professionals , in the annual leonard bernstein memorial concert in the shed when mr levine had to cancel his appearances here because of back surgery , it was immediately revealed that a prot g of bernstein and former fellow himself would step in for this concert and a couple by the boston symphony orchestra as music director of the san francisco symphony orchestra , mr thomas has led notable performances of mahler symphonies , including a in 2002 , and as artistic director of the new world symphony , a training orchestra in miami , which he founded in 1988 , mr thomas has also shown a particular gift for working with young players so expectations ran high , and the performance mostly met them in brief remarks before an open rehearsal on saturday morning , mr thomas showed himself in a properly bucolic frame of mind , comparing the experience of performers and listeners approaching a big lateromantic score like the mahler third to that of visiting a great national park , with all its wonderful walks and indeed , his approach , in comparison with mr levine s layering of long spans , was more episodic , with colors and contrasts vividly exposed at every turn still , though less inclined than mr levine to dawdle over sights and smells , mr thomas sacrificed nothing in cumulative impact his command of the huge and emotionally demanding outer movements was especially impressive keeping a firm grip on the young band \( anchored by a double bassist and a few horn players now or formerly of the boston symphony \) , he produced superbly balanced sonorities and stunning climaxes almost inevitably , concentration and stamina sagged a bit in the quirkily varied inner movements , especially among the brass players , and mr thomas was reduced at one point to snapping his fingers , evidently in response to a missed entrance in the wind section but none of this detracted significantly from the performance s overall polish and power there were also standout individual efforts , including excellent work throughout by the concertmaster , breana bauman , and fine posthorn solos in the scherzo from david cohen , a scottish mezzosoprano , sang the nietzsche also sprach zarathustra text attractively for the most part but missed its full measure of darkness and mystery to better effect , she parried the angelic cheer of the american boychoir and women of the tanglewood festival chorus in the text from des knaben wunderhorn the , which john oliver has developed into one of the nation s outstanding choirs , and which also performs with the boston symphony at its home in boston , is celebrating its 40th anniversary , and its program here with the orchestra on friday night , stravinsky s symphony of psalms and mozart s requiem , was particularly apt it is said to have been a highlight of the orchestra s regular season in boston first conducted there by mr levine , who again had to give way here to mr thomas though the idea was far from new robert shaw gave the tanglewood premieres of both works on aug 9 , 1947 , adding a bach cantata for good measure it was especially good to hear the 125strong tanglewood choir at full voice in the mozart \( with an orchestra about half that size \) now that decorously small , historically sanctioned choruses have become the norm in mozart , it is good to be reminded of the punch this music can pack in an appropriate setting like the outdoor shed \( shaw used a chorus of 200 \) and the singing was simply terrific , in moments of meditative quiet as well as at full throttle as usual on mr oliver s tight ship , the chorus performed from memory mr levine , in his time as the orchestra s music director , has dispensed with a further trademark mr oliver s favored seating plan , a complex interweaving of high and low , male and female , voice types now it is the standard lefttoright lineup sopranos , altos , tenors and basses the stravinsky performance made a listener usually disinclined to secondguess mr oliver wonder too about the wisdom of pointedly performing from memory in the first two movements , somewhat diffuse in nature , attacks were often tentative , rhythms and pitches imprecise , despite the chorus s recent experience with the work in boston but by the third and final movement , with its repetitive textual and musical phraseology , the chorus was singing with its customary assurance and flair , with splendid results mr thomas s incisive approach ideally suited stravinsky s guarded effusions , and the orchestra improbably carried it through on a soggy evening
kabul , afghanistan the s suicide bombers have been selling their lives cheaply of late from jan 24 to feb 14 , a total of 17 suicide bombers took aim at one coalition member after another but failed to kill any of them , according to a compilation of reports from afghan police and military officials , and from the americanled  the latest failures were three suicide bombers who attacked an afghan headquarters outside marja on sunday local people reported them to the authorities , who shot them before they could set off their explosives , according to a spokesman for the helmand province governor isaf officials credit better training of afghan forces , and disruption of the bombmakers' networks by natoled raids analysts say the taliban no longer have foreign expertise in preparing suicide bombers , and have a hard time finding competent recruits in a society that until recent years had little history of suicide attacks according to a new york times tally , at least 480 people were killed in 129 suicide bombings in in 2007 , not counting the bombers themselves that death toll dropped to 275 in 2009 , even though the number of bombings had increased a spokesman for isaf , maj steve cole , said bombings in recent months have averaged 15 or 16 a month in three episodes during the last three weeks , the bombers killed innocent bystanders instead of their coalition targets six of the last 17 suicide bombers did not wound anyone beyond themselves in all , those 17 bombers wounded 23 members of nato or afghan security forces , while killing 6 civilians and wounding 27 others a series of four episodes last thursday , friday and saturday were illustrative of the recent attacks and near misses on saturday , at a village in kandahar province , a suicide bomber on a motorcycle drove into a joint americanafghan foot patrol and struck , wounding six american soldiers and five civilians , two of them children , but killing no one , according to the provincial governor s spokesman \( an isaf spokesman said earlier reports that three americans were killed were incorrect \) on friday , a suicide car bomber took aim at an american convoy in khost province , detonating as it passed , according to a taliban spokesman , zabihullah mujahid , who claimed that all the soldiers in two trucks were killed a nato spokesman , maj matthew gregory , scoffed at that , saying no coalition personnel were hurt also on friday , a suicide bomber being pursued by isaf forces blew himself up rather than surrender , according to the isaf on thursday , a man reportedly wearing a vest of explosives under an afghan border police uniform penetrated a joint afghan and american military base in paktia province in eastern afghanistan , and exploded close to five american servicemen , wounding all five but again killing none of them , according to the spokesman for the province s governor asked about the attacks , mr mujahid , the taliban spokesman , argued that isaf forces were covering up the damage we fill those cars and vests using good techniques and lots of explosives but the american military will not let journalists go to the site of the incidents and make honest and real reports , he said brig gen eric tremblay , an isaf spokesman , called the recent phenomenon a cumulative effect of many factors the afghan national security forces , in quality and quantity , are getting better and getting more experience , he said we 're also targeting their command and control nodes and degrading their capacity , he added , both for bomb making and supplies in the thursday episode , for example , the suicide bomber got close enough to kill the american soldiers , but his explosives were not powerful enough , general tremblay said if they had the right recipe , then those soldiers could not have survived , he said where suicide bombers have succeeded in afghanistan , they have often been imports , not local people involving at least two suicide bombers and other gunmen paralyzed kabul for a day and killed five people , two of them police officers the bombers , it later developed , had been smuggled into afghanistan from pakistan , according to afghanistan s intelligence service similarly , while the taliban claimed responsibility for the dec 30 attack in which at a cia base , killing seven americans and a jordanian intelligence officer , the bomber s family maintained that he was working for al qaeda in any case , he was not an afghan the taliban cannot reach their strategic goals , so they just go and blow themselves up on the roads , said brig gen nawab khan of the afghan national army in the end , they do n't have any achievements , a researcher at the at pennsylvania state university , says their relative lack of recent success is due to a lower level of education , training and willingness among bombers here many of them are coerced or duped into becoming bombers , and the bombers are generally not very excited about the prospect , she said lessmotivated , lesseducated guys are more likely to make mistakes , she added the taliban s success in their suicide campaign , particularly in 2007 , was largely due to foreign fighters from pakistan and uzbekistan , but that has become much more difficult now because of better border enforcement , she said suicide bombings are an imported tactic that took root slowly here in the first four years of the conflict , there were only five suicide attacks , according to in 2007 the report also noted that 80 percent of the victims were civilians in 2007 , the taliban , put a bomb vest on him and told him to go up to a group of soldiers and push a button they told him flowers would shoot out , but the boy was not na ve enough to fall for it instead he told authorities and they managed to get the vest off safely it just shows you they 're not able to get the kind of volunteers in afghanistan that you get in israel , sri lanka or anywhere else , ms bloom said the taliban s suicide bombers should not be dismissed simply because their body count is so low , general tremblay cautioned they still are projecting terror dr bloom of the terrorism study center said , there s also still a terror factor of course , but if the only person being killed is the bomber himself , it s sort of like darwinian selection the martyrdom testament videos that are so common in other countries are unknown here such individual recognition , said the united nations report , is largely absent in afghanistan instead , these suicide bombers are buried secretly at a potter s field in a wasteland at the foot of a mountain , at kolehashmat khan , a neighborhood of junkyards on the outskirts of kabul a policeman on duty there said no one ever visited many of the unmarked graves have been dug open by starving dogs , which feast on the remains

president obama , still seeking to get congressional republicans to join in a bipartisan commission to reduce the federal debt , suggested he would be willing to break his campaign promise against raising taxes on households with less than 250 , 000 annual income the whole point of it is to make sure that all ideas are on the table , the president said in the interview on tuesday with bloomberg businessweek that the publication released online today that included not only tax increases , he added , but also spending on the popular government health programs , medicare and medicaid , whose fastgrowing costs are driving the projections of unsustainable annual deficits in coming years what i can t do is to set the thing up where a whole bunch of things are off the table , mr obama said some would say we can t look at entitlements there are going to be some that say we can t look at taxes , and pretty soon , you just can t solve the problem budget experts from conservative to liberal have long agreed that future deficits can only be brought under control by a combination of tax increases and spending cuts , especially in the benefit programs many of them criticized mr obama during the campaign for promising in effect to exempt 95 percent of americans from any tax increase the wealthiest 5 percent , the critics said , cannot shoulder the likely load without harming investment and economic growth last summer , with the recession s costs having forced deficits above 1 trillion annually on average , mr obama s spokesman , robert gibbs , said the president stood by his campaign promise after the top economic advisers lawrence h summers and timothy f geithner , the treasury secretary suggested the administration was reconsidering in light of the worsened fiscal forecasts now the president has made clear he is willing to reconsider , if republicans will come to the table to negotiate ways to reduce deficits but the republican party opposes all tax increases , and so the congressional republican leaders , senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky and representative john a boehner of ohio , have resisted committing to a bipartisan commission but neither did they rule it out at a white house meeting on tuesday , participants say at that meeting , mr obama gave the republicans a paper describing the executive order he is planning for creating a commission the group would have 18 members , 10 democrats and eight republicans the president would name two of the republicans along with four democrats none would be administration officials for the remaining 12 members , the leaders of both parties in the house and senate each would choose three lawmakers the commission would be charged with reporting by december after the midterm elections on how to balance the budget by fiscal year 2015 , not counting federal interest payments on the national debt those are projected to be nearly 3 percent of the gross domestic product that year , a level that most economists say is about the maximum desirable deficit for any year also , mr obama wants a commission to also propose longer term changes in revenues and the entitlement programs to rein in a debt projected to be nearly 80 percent of the economy s total output by 2020 while the president cannot force congress to vote on any package the commission comes up with , the democratic leaders , representative nancy pelosi of california and senator harry reid of nevada , have committed in writing to have vote mr obama , in the interview , said our real problem is neither the spike in stimulus spending of the last year as many republicans charge or the sharply lower tax collections from hardhit businesses and individual taxpayers the real problem , he said , has to do with the fact that there is a just a mismatch between the amount of money coming in and the amount of money going out and that is going to require some big , tough choices that , so far , the political system has been unable to deal with the president s tax shift is a gamble not unlike the one the first president bush took in 1990 when he dropped his no new taxes promise to reach a deficitreduction deal with congressional democrats while that deal gets some credit for the prosperity later in the decade , mr bush lost reelection in party due to the broken promise the risks to mr obama were evident in the quick and critical reaction from republicans offices a spokeswoman for the republican national committee , katie wright , circulated to reporters a copy of the bloomberg business week story along with her comment , so much for those campaign promises not to raise taxes and a spokesman for representative eric cantor of virginia , the secondranking house republican , sent an email reprising an obama quote during the 2008 campaign in which the candidate gave his firm pledge against raising any of your taxes for families making less than 250 , 000
the 10 shutout of the by the ' r a dickey was the surprisingly impressive highlight of his surprisingly impressive season so far before saturday night s game at citi field , dickey \( 85 \) reflected on what he called the regret factor in baseball and how he had none after friday night s game not so much about regret but how to handle regret , those are two very different things completely , dickey said i 've always tried to cogitate over what that really means and how to do it better dickey is a 35yearold journeyman who emerged from the minor leagues this season with a dancing knuckleball that has earned him , the lowest in the mets' starting rotation , better even than johan santana s 289 most baseball players do not drop in the word cogitate into their casual conversations , but dickey does such things apparently without selfawareness the shelf at the top of his locker is filled with books , among them a dictionary and a thesaurus i was an english major in college the written word has always appealed to me in just about all its forms , dickey said you run across words that make a lot of sense in everyday language they just do n't get used but they are beautiful words , good words on a table near his locker sat the book the game from where i stand a ballplayer s inside view by doug glanville i played with him , he sent that to me and so i put it on the table for everyone to read over , dickey said at this point in the conversation , it seemed logical to ask dickey whether he was keeping a journal of this season with the intention of writing a book a journal kind of implies a level of consistency that maybe i ca n't commit to , dickey said i have logged quite a number of thoughts on the season , special moments and things like that but as far as like a jim bouton ball four' kind of thing , no but in response to a question about having a book of some sort in him , dickey replied probably i might need someone to ghostwrite it manager jerry manuel had ruben tejada starting at second base on saturday despite his 183 batting average luis castillo , the mets' other second baseman , was on the bench with an average of 241 manuel said it is all right to use a young player like tejada , despite a slump , during a winning streak the mets have won two consecutive games , both by shutouts that tejada is a good fielder helps with the decision for a position player , if you 're being put in there every day , and you 're doing other things to help win , that can be beneficial , manuel said if you 're not winning and you 're not individually having success , that can be a tough time if tejada continues to struggle at the plate , manuel said , he will have to consider pinchhitting for him earlier in a game , and he said castillo should be ready for such things he 'll need a day of here and there , ruben will , if he continues to struggle , manuel said in his previous 19 games before saturday , tejada was hitting 075
to the editor re \( front page , march 10 \) i wonder what the founding fathers would have thought about keep america safe , which released the video criticizing justice department lawyers who in the past defended terrorism suspects the priority of the founding fathers was freedom , not safety they were ready to give up their lives for the sake of freedom i appreciate being safe in general , and safe from terrorists in particular , but i have no interest in compromising our basic freedoms in the name of safety i would rather be in danger many americans throughout history have given their lives to defend our freedom and the principles spelled out in the constitution and the declaration of independence \( for example , all men are created equal and the right to a fair trial by jury \) our men and women in uniform serve also in the name of protecting our safety , but when safety and freedom are at odds , as in the fight against terrorism , we should , like the founding fathers , embrace danger in the short term in the name of freedom for all in the long term the founding fathers would most certainly not have been members of keep america safe aaron schurger palaiseau , france , march 10 , 2010  to the editor the issue is not whether the justice department lawyers who defended terrorism suspects were patriotic , but whether they should represent the department in the same matter in which they represented a private client the answer is no when two or more people act in concert to commit criminal acts of terrorism or to commit acts of war against the united states , a lawyer can do his patriotic and professional duty by defending them against actions of the government to detain , interrogate and try them a lawyer can also do his patriotic and professional duty by representing the united states in its effort to detain , interrogate or try these same people within the bounds of domestic and international law a lawyer cannot , however , do both the government has stated that most of these people are acting in concert , and that information obtained from interrogating one detainee has led to the apprehension of others in these circumstances , recusal from the entire matter is required these lawyers should work for the justice department , but they should work on other matters richard w painter edina , minn , march 10 , 2010  to the editor branding lawyers as the gitmo 9 demonstrates a misunderstanding of our justice system no less a certified patriot than john adams defended the british soldiers involved in the boston massacre , in which five colonists were killed no one else would take the case he knew that defending the soldiers would be unpopular he also knew what he stood for the mob had expressed justifiable rage over the quartering of british troops in boston ostensibly to maintain order \( when in fact they were there to intimidate colonists into accepting arbitrary rule \) but the british troops could not be blamed for defending themselves against attack in time , bostonians saw adams s point and lauded his integrity the leaders of keep america safe have said of the justice department lawyers , whose values do they share \?

since 2006 , the filmmaker peter greenaway has done a series of installations using cuttingedge technology to illuminate and reinterpret famous paintings so far none of these works has been displayed in the united states but from december 2 to january 6 , mr greenaway will bring his exploration of leonardo s last supper to the park avenue armory for one night in 2008 , he turned the real last supper , located in the refectory of santa maria delle grazie in milan , into a soundandlight show , using projectors , computers and speakers light and shadows played over the painting , some parts of it seemed to move and others appeared to be threedimensional mr greenaway will do the same thing at the armory , but with a fullsize clone of the painting , set within a recreation of the refectory the installation at the armory will also feature other projections , including parts of another work by mr greenaway based on veronese s wedding at cana , which was exhibited at the 2009 venice biennale it s the perfect match to the armory , the armory s president , rebecca robertson , said it s contemporary meets historical , a 15thcentury painting with the most advanced stateoftheart technology i think it s just going to be one of the most amazing experiences
it is a longstanding tradition that presidents send letters of condolence to the families of troops killed at war , whether by enemy fire , accident or illness but since the clinton administration at least , one group has not received those handsigned notes families of troops who committed suicide , even those who killed themselves while deployed to a war front it turns out , though , that on at least one occasion a president has made an exception to the noletter protocol in 2005 , 20yearold pfc jason scheuerman killed himself while in iraq with the 3rd infantry division his father , chris scheuerman , a retired army master sergeant , said his son had been struggling with depression and doubts about the war , and had sought counseling in the weeks before he died but an army psychologist who had not yet received his license to practice declared that private scheuerman might be feigning problems his commanding officers decided he was a malingerer , records obtained by mr scheuerman showed , and sent him back to his unit he was given back his weapon , but denied access to the internet and telephone about three weeks later he shot himself after tacking a note to his closet door that read , i know you think i m a coward for this but in the face of existing as i am now , i have no other choice after learning about his son s death , mr scheuerman assumed that he would receive a letter from the president when none arrived , he inquired with the white house and was subsequently told of the noletter policy for suicides that policy , government officials have said , is based on concerns among senior military leaders that presidential letters of condolence might appear to condone or even encourage suicide mr scheuerman wrote back arguing that the protocol was wrongheaded , particularly at a time when the defense department was trying to slow a rising tide of suicides last year , there were more than 300 suicides by activeduty military personnel members , the most since the pentagon started keeping track in 1980 while most suicides occur on military bases in the united states , more than 184 troops have killed themselves while deployed to iraq or afghanistan since 2001 the fact that we continue the policy , we continue to stigmatize soldiers who suffer from mental illness , mr scheuerman said in a recent interview and we continue to punish the families of soldiers who succumb to the trauma of mental illness that nine years of war has cumulatively heaped upon them the white house did not respond to mr scheuerman s second letter but in late 2005 , the son of the indianapolis colts coach tony dungy committed suicide , and president george w bush sent him a letter of condolence i pray for you , the president wrote in a letter that was read at james dungy s funeral may god keep you may his light shine upon you mr scheuerman fired off a handwritten note to the white house asking why the son of a military family should be treated differently from the son of a professional football coach \( in addition to mr scheuerman and his son jason , mr scheuerman s wife , oldest son and other members of his extended family have served in the military \) not taking away from the tragedy the dungy family had experienced , i felt we had given a whole lot more and sacrificed a great much more for our nation s safety than a football coach , mr scheuerman said in an interview a few weeks later , in march 2006 , a letter from the white house arrived at the scheuerman home in sanford , nc , near fort bragg , where mr scheuerman worked at the time laura and i are saddened by the loss of your son , jason , the letter , signed by president bush , said we know this has been a difficult time for you , and we send our heartfelt sympathy mr bush s letter to mr scheuerman surfaced only recently after he shared it with an indianapolis man , gregg keesling , whose son committed suicide in iraq last year in an email message , mr keesling said he hoped that mr bush s letter would show that presidents have the flexibility to send letters based on a service member s record , not on how the service member died my son , and probably the vast majority who die by suicide , had honorable service , he wrote at mr keesling s behest , two congressmen from indiana have urged the obama administration to modify the noletter policy white house aides say it is under review

on a flotilla trying to breach the blockade of gaza on tuesday , egypt reopened its border with gaza to allow aid to flow through , while another ship had reportedly been sent to the region pressure intensified on israel to end the blockade , which it and egypt imposed after the hamas takeover of gaza in 2007 what is a concrete course of action to take now to maintain security for israel while addressing the humanitarian and political crisis in gaza \? is a research fellow at the belfer center at harvard s kennedy school he is the author of the essence of longing general erez gerstein and the war in lebanon and was the assistant to prime minister ehud barak s foreign policy advisor \( 19992000 \) gaza poses four challenges to israeli security the siege serves as a partial response to only one challenge stemming arms flows into gaza it probably exacerbates all other threats beyond the moral difficulties of the siege , israel s interests would be best served if it were lifted , provided that arms imports are prevented only 44 miles south of tel aviv , the residents of gaza s refugee camps are the closest , largest , embodiment of our deepest fears the refugees return prime minister eshkol sought to solve the gaza refugee problem in 1967 but eshkol died in 1969 and with him died the idea that the palestinian refugee problem is our problem keeping the refugees and their descendants under a siege with no hope will only solidify their support for what they consider the single just solution return we are therefore better off relieving the pain , not deepening it second , gaza is controlled by an islamist organization that has vowed to destroy israel however , it cannot simply put we are much stronger if the siege was intended to topple hamas , it has failed and only provides an excuse for its governmental inefficiencies read more as we learned in lebanon in 1982 , the business of regime change is tricky it usually ends with a blowback third , gaza has been used as a base for a 10year shelling operation against southern israel this is our most acute security concern the siege does limit the amount and quality of weapons at hamas s disposal , but following the 20082009 attack on gaza , israel relies primarily on deterrence and the occasional followup military action finally , israel was hoping that the siege would help secure the release of soldier gilad shalit , held by hamas since 2006 shalit is still a prisoner , and the siege may have only made his captors angrier and hungrier , a bad combination israel is a world expert in border control it can ease the suffering in gaza , while deploying effective strategies , technologies and alliances \( most of all , with egypt \) to maintain low levels of arms imports into gaza any other route would not only be morally difficult it would fail to serve israel s strategic goals is a fellow at the shalom hartman center in jerusalem and a contributing editor to the new republic the current policy of israel and the west to isolate and delegitimize hamas rule in gaza , while bolstering living conditions in the west bank needs to be maintained , for the sake of an eventual twostate solution the practical rationale for the siege is to prevent iraniansupplied missiles from reaching hamas and turning gaza into another southern lebanon , where tens of thousands of missiles threaten israel s population centers the political rationale for the siege is that only by eroding hamas s power can the twostate solution remain viable so long as hamas remains in control of gaza , the israeli public , which now overwhelmingly supports the principle of two states , will not agree to withdraw from the west bank read more that s because of fear of a west bank takeover by hamas , similar to its violent coup in gaza israeli fear is especially acute regarding jerusalem israelis will not agree to sharing their capital with a palestinian state so long as a very real possibility exists that hamas may end up in control over east jerusalem a hamas fatah reconciliation will not , as some hope , create the conditions for a final agreement between the palestinians and israel the opposite is almost certainly true fatah will not moderate hamas instead , hamas will further radicalize fatah unlike fatah , hamas is not so much an ideology but a theology , whose central tenet is the destruction of israel by imposing a siege on gaza while encouraging economic growth in the west bank , israel is offering the palestinians a choice , between the consequences of jihadist terror on the one hand and peace talks on the other the policy is working on the west bank , which last year experienced a 7 percent growth rate , along with the removal of hundreds of israeli army roadblocks and according to polls , palestinian support for hamas has substantially weakened \( though the latest events will no doubt temporarily boost support \) in order to maintain the west s consensus on placing hamas beyond the moral and political pale , israel will need to ease some aspects of the siege tragically , though , without a fundamental change in hamas , there is no substantive alternative to the current policy is an egyptian journalist , photographer and labor blogger based in cairo he blogs at  if the deadly attack on the gaza aid convoy has served to highlight once again the plight of the palestinians living under the israeli siege , the ensuing demonstrations in cairo show a different kind of siege tens of thousands of peasant conscripts , dressed in the black uniforms of egypt s notorious central security forces , were mobilized in the main squares , university campuses and central mosques , as demonstrators vented their anger not only on israel s actions but also on the ailing 82yearold hosni mubarak s role in aiding israel in that siege the demonstrators chanted beautifully rhymed , yet angry , slogans against israel and the us , but quickly the chants changed to denouncements of the police presence , torture , electoral voterigging , privatization of stateowned firms and the deterioration in the country s national insurance system in what has become a ritual , young activists broke the security cordon laid around the protest site , drawing parallels between the siege of gaza and the siege the protesters were feeling among the overwhelming police presence read more israel s recent actions in the sea amount to nothing but piracy and statesponsored terrorism if the us has an ounce worth of respect for human rights , it should be the first to call for prosecuting the israeli perpetrators of those killings the international community also has to come to terms with the fact that there is an elected government in gaza , which yes happens to be islamist and involved in resistance attacks against an occupying power military and financial aid to israel , president mubarak and the rest of the arab dictators who are ruling their nations with draconian security services , torture chambers and failed economic policies , must cease immediately the egyptian people , just like the palestinians , feel they are under occupation  , the ziegler distinguished fellow at the washington institute for near east policy and the director of its project on the middle east peace process , is the coauthor with dennis ross of the flotilla tragedy has brought fresh interest about whether the blockade of gaza should be maintained of course , the blockade can be lifted immediately if hamas would say that it accepts what the international community the united states , the european union , russia and the united nations has demanded of it since 2006 israel s existence , a denial of violence and adherence to past agreements these criteria have been reaffirmed repeatedly by president obama over the last year indeed , it would be useful if flotilla activists would use the same energy to press hamas to accede to peace as it has pressed israel it is odd to see selfproclaimed peace activists on the same side as an organization whose signature policy for more than 20 years is exhorting teenagers to engage in homicidal suicide bombing and then adorning the public space with martyr portraits read more the origin of the blockade is not punitive , but defensive it can be found in israel s 2005 withdrawal from gaza and the 3 , 300plus rockets that fell on israel between then and the gaza war in december 2008 and 2009 an unconditional lifting of the blockade now would be a windfall for an unreconstructed hamas , which would turn a trickle of smuggled rockets from iran into a flood the better question is whether it is possible to recalibrate the blockade in a way that would bar the importation of rockets and protect israeli security , while easing conditions on the ground this leads to the issue of dualuse items the past has demonstrated that hamas has no scruples about diverting select construction materials as well as other aid meant for the public good in gaza and utilizing it to build weapons to ease tensions with the international community without sacrificing israeli security , there might be an advantage for israel to agree to a streamlined dualuse list instead of saying all is forbidden unless it is explicitly approved , it might be easier to say all is permitted but that which is prohibited explicitly by the dualuse list as such , there would instantly be a rationale for everything that is disallowed yet , the first approach of hamas agreeing to live peacefully with its israeli neighbor would be preferable and profoundly transformative is a senior associate at the carnegie endowment for international peace and editor of the arab reform bulletin , a monthly online journal the gaza flotilla incident highlights not only the unsustainability of the closure of gaza , but also the unsustainability of the us position discouraging reconciliation between the palestinian factions , fatah and hamas the united states says it favors a twostate solution to the israelipalestinian conflict and institution building for a palestinian state , but those outcomes will require unified palestinian leadership that enjoys adequate support in both the west bank and gaza president mahmoud abbas cannot take risks in negotiations with israel partly because his mandate is so slim he exerts control over only fragments of the west bank and none of gaza and he is also long past the end of his electoral term read more the suspension of the elected palestinian legislative council since the 2007 rift between fatah and hamas also makes institution building difficult how can the palestinian authority undertake sustainable reforms when it cannot legislate \? and meanwhile , gaza has been drifting off in its own dangerously separate direction under hamas leadership for the past 20 years , the united states has sought one shortterm israelipalestinian negotiating breakthrough after another few of which have yielded real or lasting progress while working to postpone , frustrate , or manipulate internal palestinian politics in order to serve the negotiations the united states need not engage hamas directly while the group continues to advocate armed struggle against israel but it is time for the united states to tolerate the internal palestinian political competition and bargaining that will be necessary to reunite the west bank and gaza and to support real institution building for a future state the united states should stop impeding reconciliation efforts such as those recently exerted by egypt , cease providing excuses to the ramallah leadership for avoiding compromise , and signal its willingness to tolerate a modus vivendi between fatah and hamas as well as palestinian elections the obama administration should look for ways to continue cooperation with and assistance to a palestinian authority that includes hamas , as long as that authority is willing to prevent terrorism and allow the plo to negotiate with israel is an americanisraeli lawyer and worked for the united nation s humanitarian coordination office for the last seven years in the occupied palestinian territory the international aid community including united nations agencies must take center stage , live up to its humanitarian principles and begin sending into gaza the amount and type of aid which will finally meet the needs of the gaza people throughout the blockade , the relief agencies , including the most senior un humanitarian officials , knew that the aid was failing to meet the critical needs of the population , especially the reconstruction needs which emerged after the extensive destruction from israel s military invasion indeed , in the last two years of the blockade , the weekly average for supplies going into gaza hardly ever reached more than 20 percent of the total goods israel allowed to be imported the united nations development program has just issued a report stating w hile some recovery is taking place , the realities on the ground show that the international community is , by and large , rendered ineffective in addressing the needs of people in gaza , whether by default or by design in fact , in view of the scale of the needs , international assistance in gaza is tantamount to tinkering at the edges depriving people from their right to pursue a dignified life should raise an issue of conscience read more the international aid community should send in the aid through a nonisraelicontrolled route like the sea or the rafah crossing on the egyptian border , which until now is only open for the passage of humanitarian cases , but not critical supplies it should refuse to comply with the political restraints imposed on delivery of relief by both israel and western donors who insist on a nocontact policy with senior hamas officials , and even prohibit aid agencies from purchasing goods on the gaza market which were smuggled in through the tunnels however , if a new aid delivery route is not agreed to by israel and egypt , or if negotiations drag out too long , then the international community may well need to follow the freedom flotilla model to send the relief in independently by sea an un flag flying on relief ships may avoid a repetition of the tragic raid this week the limited aid that has gone in through israeli crossings until now by preventing starvation and most disease has made the siege tolerable and reduced the moral imperative to end it but the status quo is unbearable for the gazans , and sending aid by sea or through rafah would enable international organizations to conduct their operations consistent with principles of humanitarian relief neutrality , independence and a do no harm approach to the recipients is director of the middle east task force at the new america foundation this weekend s killings of at least nine civilians by the israeli navy in international waters has again focused world attention on the continued israeli and egyptian siege of the gaza strip that began after hamas election victory in 2006 but it also highlights another problem for the obama administration the question of us credibility the bush administration made a great deal of advocating democracy in the arab world , and rightfully so , but then worked to overturn electoral results it didn t like president obama encouraged nonviolent resistance for palestinians in pursuit of equality and freedom in his famous cairo speech one year ago this friday however , with the failure of the administration to defend those engaged in nonviolent resistance , as we alone among western nations failed to do this week , the obama administration risks cementing the bushera hypocrisy label but it is not too late to salvage the promise of the cairo speech read more we can start by endorsing those engaged in nonviolent resistance starting with the 600 civilians taken by israel from the high seas and the israeli and palestinian demonstrators in east jerusalem or elsewhere on palestinian territory we must also immediately work with the international community to lift the siege on gaza hamas leader , khaled meshal , in an interview with charlie rose last friday , said that hamas would allow international agencies to bring in reconstruction aid and to even repair and rebuild destroyed homes without hamas involvement this is an opening the administration must exploit finally , we must fast forward negotiations by conducting our own direct negotiations with each of the parties to narrow gaps as quickly as possible the bravery of nonviolent protesters on the freedom flotilla must be matched by equivalent american political will to defend our interests and the cause of peace in the region , a syrian writer , is an international consultant and an associate fellow at in london she blogs at  it usually takes a high number of palestinian deaths for the news media to deem the tragedy worth reporting unfortunately , regular killings of palestinians by the israeli army or by israeli settlers are unnoticed and unmourned likewise , the fate of 15 million palestinians in gaza \( and 25 million palestinians in the west bank \) has been all but ignored by governments too had it not been for the deadly israeli raid on the freedom flotilla , it too would have been lost in a sea of forgotten humanitarian initiatives whose declared mission is not only to deliver aid to a desperate population besieged for the past three years , but also to break the inhuman israeli \( and egyptianassisted \) blockade that no other government has supported as legal , let alone justified the killing of nonpalestinian civilians is not even close to being the worst atrocity committed by israel the resulting global outrage , however , is the clearest message yet that israel s actions have gone beyond the debatable , the justifiable , or the socalled disproportionate read more we all know that the time has come to hold israel accountable for its deeds , that only the united states can do it and that most nations would cheer the end of israel s growing impunity forcing israel to adhere to international law is not an option but an imperative either israel complies with international conventions and a regional modus vivendi , or it bears the consequences and endures sanctions like any other country the mantra about security and laments that israel has no partners with whom to make peace have lost their punch long before hamas even dreamed of electoral victory , israel had already besieged the first palestinian president yasser arafat , who delivered the oslo accord to israel , was under house arrest for years in humiliating and dangerous conditions , until his death , in a compound ruined by israeli bombings during arafat s tenure , israel destroyed most of the palestinian infrastructure \( including the gaza airport \) financed by the international community and rejected a unanimous peace initiative from 22 arab nations while continuing settlements on occupied land the problem , therefore , is not just gaza , and it s not just hamas nor is it , for all its transgressions , the current likud government , as israel has a history of impunity even with its greatest supporters it has often embarrassed allies when carrying out assassinations around the world \( recently killing hamas official mahmoud mabhouh in dubai by agents holding fake british and other european passports \) moreover , israel attacks its allies directly when it suits its purposes perhaps because congress never even asked for an inquiry , americans seem to have forgotten israel s bombing of the uss liberty in june 1967 , killing 34 and wounding 171 us navy servicemen the point is that there is a pattern to israeli behavior that transcends governmental leanings or ideologies for decades , israel has been allowed to flout un resolutions demanding its withdrawal from arab territories , to violate other nations sovereignty and to commit war crimes without consequences the raid on the ships heading to gaza was just another transgression , but the solution is not in gaza itself removing the gaza blockade from the greater context of the palestinian question is ludicrous and selfdefeating if israel lived by international law , the security for the entire levant would not be an issue anymore , nor would civilized nations be forced to renege on their own laws and principles in permitting the collective suffering of an entire nation to continue the first step , undoubtedly , is to free gaza unconditionally the second , undoubtedly , is to enforce un resolutions , thereby freeing arab lands from occupation and setting the scene for a peaceful settlement for this to happen , the us must rein in israel

detroit as better times return , the united automobile workers is not the union it was before detroit s carmakers hemorrhaged billions of dollars the union is now a part owner of general motors and chrysler through a union trust fund , and its members are barred from striking against the two companies over compensation for the next five years all told , hourly workers gave up pay and benefits worth 7 , 000 to 30 , 000 each a year during the downturn , the union estimates but while those changes might blur the traditional battle lines between management and union , the incoming president of the uaw , bob king , is making it clear some things are not about to change as one automaker , the ford motor company , restores some perks for salaried workers , mr king is putting the companies on notice that he expects hourly workers to be given back some of the benefits they surrendered as the bottom lines of all three car companies improve at least to the extent that management and other stakeholders are rewarded the union is expected to ask that some of its givebacks be reversed during contract talks with the carmakers in 2011 , when the contract signed in 2007 and modified last year with more concessions as general motors and chrysler approached bankruptcy expires when there s equality of sacrifice , there s got to be equality of gain , mr king said during a speech to executives and analysts this week we just want to make sure when things turn around we share in the upside mr king s muscle flexing is bound to be popular with his rank and file , but it comes at a delicate time some of the carmakers are just getting their footing back , and during much of the crisis , critics have portrayed his union as a major hindrance to detroit s ability to compete with foreign rivals there is also the difficult task of navigating volatile public sentiments about the 62 billion in taxpayer money given to gm and chrysler the bankruptcies were structured to protect the union interests at the expense of the creditors and investors , said paul kersey , director of labor policy at the mackinac center for public policy , a conservative research group in midland , mich so i do n't see there being a whole lot of public support for them pursuing a restoration of the concessions that might be one reason that mr king , the nominee to succeed the retiring ron gettelfinger next month , is trying to frame the union s position around the issue of equality he said that while uaw members had agreed to give up pay and benefits in recent years , the quality of the vehicles they built have improved amid many plant closings and uncertainty about their future they 're making it quite clear that they do n't want an upstairsdownstairs kind of industry where champagne is poured in the boardrooms but the uaw members are largely excluded from the festivities , said harley shaiken , a professor at the university of california , berkeley , who specializes in labor relations the uaw already is upset with ford , which was the only one of the three big detroit automakers to avoid bankruptcy ford remains publicly held and took no government loans ford has been profitable for four consecutive quarters , and this year has restored some compensation for salaried workers , including merit pay increases , tuition reimbursement and matching contributions to retirement accounts mr king , currently a uaw vice president in charge of the union s work force at ford , said the union has filed grievances on the matter , accusing ford of violating its uaw contract we had an understanding about equality of sacrifice , mr king told reporters after his speech this week none of that , in my view of what the contract is , should have happened without our membership getting the same thing a ford spokeswoman , marcey evans , said wednesday that the company was honoring its contract and said any increases in pay or benefits for hourly workers would need to be negotiated the cuts that affected salaried workers were made with a commitment that the company would reinstate them as business conditions allowed , she said ford did not issue meritbased raises in 2007 and 2009 tuition reimbursement was suspended in 2008 , and 401 \( k \) matches were halted in 2009 some benefits for salaried workers , including bonuses , have yet to be reinstated ford told workers the merit pay increases this year will average about 3 percent of their pay ms evans said that this year ford gave profitsharing checks averaging 450 to all of its union workers , in accordance with a formula dictated by the contract the checks were based on ford s 2009 earnings of 27 billion workers would get larger checks next year if the company , which earned 209 billion in the first quarter , meets its profit forecast for 2010 mr king said that the two sides are close to resolving one piece of the grievances but that the issue could go to arbitration soon ms evans and mr king each said it was too early to discuss what either party planned to request during next year s negotiations the economic situation at that time will have a huge impact , mr king said another complicating factor is that the uaw will enter the contract talks as part owners of both gm and chrysler through a unioncontrolled trust fund the fund , which took over liability for retiree health care coverage this year , has a 175 percent stake in gm and is the majority owner of chrysler , holding 55 percent the uaw has a powerful incentive to act responsibly , professor shaiken said they want to see competitive companies , but competitive companies that they share in not where the competitiveness comes at their expense photo bob king is the incoming president of the united automobile workers \( photograph by

deborah howell , former ombudsman of the washington post , washington bureau chief of the newhouse newspapers and executive editor of the st paul pioneer press , died in an accident in new zealand on friday the accident , in which she was struck and killed by a car , happened while she was on a longplanned trip with her husband , c peter magrath , the former president of the university of minnesota she was 68 at the time of her death , and while tragic , the fact that she died in the midst of one more adventure on a lifelist full of them surprised no one who knew her any reporter who ever came into contact with ms howell , the ferocious , pioneering editor who left her mark where ever she landed , has a howell story the classics involve profanity she combined a love of the language with a longshoreman s facility for cussing a teachable moment , and an ensuing tutorial on the enduring values of the craft here s mine when i was a young reporter in the 1980s at the twin cities reader , a weekly in minneapolis , i wrote some stories about police violence that were noticed by ms howell , who was then executive editor of the st paul pioneer press she was known for overseeing a talented bunch of misfit toys at the scrappy newspaper , which often scooped its bigger , betterfinanced competition across the river , the minneapolis star tribune \( ms howell had worked at the the minneapolis star , first as a city editor at the age of 34 and then as managing editor she moved to the pioneer press , first as managing editor and then as executive editor in the 80s \) she beckoned me to st paul for an interview and was complimentary about my work , but expressed her doubts , loudly and directly , about what she perceived to be some sloppiness around the edges of my stories we were still discussing a job when it was announced a few weeks later that those stories i had done had won some state press association awards the night of the awards dinner , i saw her coming across the room and assumed she would whisper that the recognition at hand had closed the deal instead , she stepped up to me and said , you \( redacted \) the middle name of the publisher of our newspaper in that \( redacted \) story you wrote the other day i have no idea how you could be so \( redacted \) stupid , but i m putting your application on the spike , she hissed you re a hard worker and a good writer , but none of that is going to make a difference if you can t get the facts straight the daughter of a reporter and a newsman in every corner of her being , she never did hire me , but her willingness to staple me so directly made a lifelong impression i often thought of her when i was doing the mundane but critical work of factchecking a story one thing led to another and we both ended up working in washington some years later we became friends ms howell was lauded as a woman who made her way in man s world , but what always set her apart was her willingness to surpass the conventions of journalism , never mind gender as the editor of the pioneer press in the 80s , a time when aids was seen as some exotic affliction visited on club kids in san francisco and new york , she assigned and edited a series by jacqui banaszynski called aids in the heartland the stories made it clear that the virus was on the march and might well be found in the milk farmer down the road the series won a pulitzer in 1988 , but more importantly , it put her readers on notice that the distance between us and them was a lot shorter than people liked to think among other innovations under her leadership , the newhouse newspaper s washington bureau began treating religion as something other than a curio as is customary in journalism , and her tenure as the ombudsman at the washington post was vintage howell , with her giving as good as she got after she became a pi ata over her defense of a story about the lobbyist jack abramoff , she wrote a column in response , saying , i have a tough hide , and a few curse words \( which i use frequently \) are not going to hurt my feelings and then she added with characteristic toughness to all of those who wanted me fired , i m afraid you re out of luck i have a contract for the next two years , i will continue to speak my mind keep smiling i will we all will , between a few tears part of the reason that ms howell mentored so many great talents john sandford nee john camp won a pulitzer writing a column for her at the pioneer press is that she made them all want to be better , not just to please her , but to reward the readers she represented so directly and forcefully the fact that she was 68 years old doesn t really describe her mien or pursuits she was always a crisscross of capers , business and errands of mercy , exhausting and hilarious to be around , with a facility for gossip that served as a wing man for her smart industrial analytics i learned things , both juicy and important things , every time i talked to her at the beginning of december , ms howell was wheeling through new york on business and fit me in for a cup of coffee even though she had finished her tour as an ombudsman , she had a consulting contract with newhouse newspapers and continued her work with the american society of newspaper editors and other endeavors half fairy godmother , half drill sergeant , she never let how much she already knew get in the way of learning more she was a serious student of digital journalism and its implications , but her curiosity was always bracketed with a conviction that certain values efficacy , fairness , clear and vivid writing still obtained sitting in our cafeteria , ms howell grilled me about the new york times , the broader media industry , and then with a deeper interest , my health , happiness and my family we caught up on people in common and shared history , but never spoke about back in the day when she nailed me for that error , perhaps because we both knew the professional progress i had made since owed much to that necessary moment we left that part unspoken a week later , a holiday card showed up , with a note , as always , that was very much to point i m proud of you deborah
well , now it seems our dear ally across the pond feels that a row has broken out over the intemperance of the american president toward mighty bp anglophobic spite , was the charge leveled atpresident obama by a columnist for the daily mail , implausibly attributing the animus to obama s kenyan father london s mayor , boris johnson , demanded an end to antibritish rhetoric he demanded it ! or else and a leading tory by name of lord tebbit branded obama s conduct despicable all of this came just before the extraordinary events on saturday in south africa , when the american boys none of whom could make the british squad , it is said played her majesty s finest to a draw in the world cup s opening round brit kneels before america ! was the headline on the eversubtle drudge report , with a picture of the poor english goalie on his knees the oil spill may long be forgotten in britain before the english get over that single goal scored by the yanks certainly , it was a gift even in american youth soccer leagues , where everyone gets a trophy , it s hard to imagine that dribbler getting by one of our undersized goalies with oversized selfesteem if the world s most popular sport is war by other means , then let s keep it on the pitch for the other conflict appears to be a monumental misread on the part of the british they should stick to arguing over the meaning of their unwritten constitution american anger has little to do with the island nation and everything to do with a multinational corporation that has appeared tone deaf and negligent obama tried to get that general idea across when he called prime ministerdavid cameron over the weekend the insults across the water can be explained , in part , by that old line about two nations separated by a common language when americans hear the english speaking laudably of bp s scheme for making good , they wince scheme \? ponzi comes to mind over here , and a felony the knights and earls , the barons and viscounts , the dodgy characters and cheeky gibes so much of it is a muddle to the american mind i know what they think of us i was describing a state fair in montana once for a bbc audience when the producer urged me to cut to the chase are n't they all fat \? and heavily armed \? in her book the anglo files a field guide to the british , my colleaguesarah lyall explained the gap this way we look to the future they look to the past we run for election they stand for it we noisily and proudly proclaim our americanness they shuffle their feet and apologize for their britishness we trumpet our success they brag about their failures when they say they are pleased to meet you , they often mean nothing of the kind as to what specifically angers the brits about the american response to the bp spill , they point to obama s answer to a question about whom to hold accountable they ca n't fathom that the pundit class in the united states thinks our leaders have been too timid , too cool , too restrained a sound bite to please the washington magpies is hardly akin to stepping on the union jack after all , the english burned our capital and who can forget that headline in the daily mirror aftergeorge w bush was reelected in 2004 how can 59 , 054 , 087 people be so dumb \? we love dickens and shakespeare , hitchcock and sting , lennon and mccartney speaking of which , john boehner , the house minority leader , has demanded an apology from sir paul for saying it s great to have a president who knows what a library is when he was awarded the gershwin prize by the library of congress boehner knows a breach in decorum when he hears one he s the head of a caucus with a member who shouted you lie ! at the president most of the above is good fun special relationship and all that but the oil spill is death to a way of life for thousands , and a high crime against nature the anger is real it s directed at a company run by a man , tony hayward , who is a gaffeomatic one day he says the oil is but a drop in a big ocean then he says he wants his life back this week , it s only going to get worse , when bp directors consider whether to suspend their dividend , and the company s executives are called to the white house the president plans to ask them to set up an escrow account for those affected by the spill for diversion , there is a month of glorious soccer , often called a gentleman s game played by thugs , which is a good way to describe the politics of two democracies from the same family this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
a day after saying it would consider suspending players for helmettohelmet hits , the decided tuesday to fine three players involved in a string of injurious collisions last sunday the nfl wants to give players and teams fair warning that it plans to ratchet up discipline for violations of players' safety rules , the league spokesman greg aiello said players , coaches and teams will be told wednesday that future disciplinary actions will be harsher , setting the stage for possible suspensions , the pittsburgh steelers linebacker who knocked two cleveland browns out of their game with helmettohelmet hits one was within the rules the other was a penalty the officials missed , the league said was fined the most , 75 , 000 , because of previous trouble earlier this season , he was fined 5 , 000 for slamming tennessee titans quarterback vince young to the ground while sacking him harrison and his coach , mike tomlin , insisted harrison s hits were clean and that he should not be fined before the fines were announced , tomlin stood by his remarks , but said he supported harsher penalties and rules changes to ensure player safety i think it is the proper initiative that the nfl has , tomlin said i think we need to safeguard the men that play this game to the best of our abilities and make it as safe as we can i'm a proponent of player safety and whatever rule or rule adjustments we need to make to make it safer new england patriots safety , who committed the most egregious foul when he launched himself into baltimore ravens tight end todd heap as heap tried to make a catch , was fined 50 , 000 and atlanta falcons cornerback , who hit philadelphia eagles receiver desean jackson so violently that both were concussed , was fined 50 , 000 in a letter to each of the players , ray anderson , the nfl s executive vice president for football operations , warned that future offenses will result in an escalation of fines up to and including suspension the failure to suspend players retroactively after one of the nfl s most troubling days raised the question of whether the league had talked tougher than it was prepared to immediately act on monday , anderson noted that some players considered fines the cost of doing business and that only suspensions even for first offenders were likely to deliver the message that helmettohelmet hits would not be tolerated the nfl has suspended players for hits without warning in 2008 , jets safety eric smith was suspended a game for a helmettohelmet hit on anquan boldin smith was one of two players suspended that year in 2009 , one player , carolina panthers defensive back dante wesley , was suspended none have been suspended this season aiello said the desire to warn players of increased discipline first was because the overall level of discipline for these violations is being increased and suspensions will be more likely if these violations continue the reaction to the fines was swift and offered a look at why the nfl will have to battle some of its players in an effort to crack down on helmettohelmet hits seattle seahawks linebacker aaron curry called the fines absolutely crazy on his twitter feed tuesday , and he took exception to the fine for harrison his hit happen every play ! curry wrote he jus happen to knock somebody out ! earlier tuesday , patriots coach bill belichick raised an issue that also complicates the nfl s crackdown the inconsistency of officiating harrison s hit on browns receiver mohamed massoquoi was a foul , anderson said monday , but it was not flagged you just have to understand how the game is being officiated and what the calls mean what s a block in the back , what is n't a block in the back what s illegal contact , what is n't illegal contact , what s pass interference , what is n't pass interference , what s holding , what is n't holding , belichick said there are a lot of gray areas in all those calls , so we have to learn what those are and hope that the officials call them consistently from week to week , which , that s an issue , too
kabul , afghanistan one of the principal owners of the afghan bank at the center of an accelerating financial crisis here said depositors had withdrawn 180 million in the past two days he predicted a revolution in the country s financial system unless the afghan government and the united states moved quickly to help stabilize the bank khalilullah frozi , one of the two largest shareholders of kabul bank , said reports indicating that the institution had lost as much as 300 million were overstated but he predicted that if afghan depositors continued to withdraw their money at the current rate , kabul bank would almost certainly collapse , undermining confidence in the nascent financial system the afghans have been trying to build with american help if this goes on , we wo n't survive , mr frozi said in an interview if people lose trust in the banks , there will be a revolution in the financial system afghan leaders promised to guarantee deposits in an attempt to arrest the panic , which began earlier this week when the country s top banking officials demanded the resignations of mr frozi , the bank s chief executive , and the bank s chairman , sherkhan farnood afghan and american officials say the two men , doling out millions to allies of president and pouring money into risky investments that crashed the bank s troubles and the corruption associated with them are posing a direct challenge to the country s fledgling financial system , which was built under american guidance after the collapse of the taliban government in 2001 kabul bank , which counts a brother of president karzai among its politically connected shareholders , illustrates the intertwining of political and economic interests in afghan and american regulators said the bank s political connections had shielded it from scrutiny until now if the loss of confidence spreads beyond kabul bank , it seems almost certain to strain the resources of the afghan government and make it more likely that the united states will be forced to intervene there were no indications yet that the panic was spreading , but american and afghan officials said other afghan banks might face similar troubles for now , american officials ruled out any financial assistance they said they were providing technical assistance to the afghan government , but nothing more we are taking no steps to bail out kabul bank , said a white house spokesman , tommy vietor we support the afghan central bank s efforts to uphold international standards on transparency and its decisive action in response to reports of fraud at the kabul bank in a news conference , president karzai promised that the afghan government would guarantee all deposits at the threatened institution the afghan government had already given kabul bank more than 100 million to ensure that it could pay the salaries of about 250 , 000 public employees , other afghan officials said the bank administers the payments for the government people do n't need to be worried , mr karzai said we 've got enough cash to support the bank even if the whole financial system in afghanistan collapses , we have enough money to support it , he said mr karzai , who appeared with secretary of defense robert m gates , said the crisis had been invented by the western press , which he said had raised baseless fears among afghans the western press has been covering it in a negative and provocative way , he said of kabul bank s troubles still , it was not clear that the afghan government had the legal authority to guarantee afghan deposits , or the financial wherewithal to shore up the banking system if confidence were to collapse mr frozi said kabul bank retained about 11 billion in deposits that figure alone would equal about a quarter of afghanistan s foreign currency reserves , which mr karzai said totaled 48 billion afghan officials said the bank had 2 billion in assets , and 120 million in capital most afghans do not keep their money in the banking system , and kabul bank is tiny by international standards but creating a credible and stable banking system is an important goal of the americanled effort in the country , which is seeking to help afghanistan develop a modern economy kabul bank , one of the biggest private financial institutions that sprang up after the fall of the taliban , stands at the very center of afghanistan s political and economic elite one of mr karzai s brothers , mahmoud , is a major shareholder , as is haseen fahim , the brother of the afghan first vice president the bank lent mr fahim , a prominent businessman , as much as 100 million , officials say the bank helped finance president karzai s reelection campaign last year , giving him as much as 14 million , according to a former senior afghan official mr frozi denied that mr karzai chose the bank to administer much of the government s payroll , which mr frozi described as one of the bank s most lucrative fields of business in the interview , mr frozi said he was mystified by the abrupt loss of confidence in his bank he conceded that many of the bank s investments had lost money , but he said that none of them were irrecoverable the biggest mistake , he said , was the decision by his partner , mr farnood , to buy 160 million worth of villas and office buildings in dubai , in the united arab emirates , at the height of the real bubble in 2007 the next year , the market collapsed many of the villas are occupied by prominent afghans , like former vice president ahmed zia massoud and mahmoud karzai nobody could have predicted the crisis , mr frozi said kabul bank also lent 100 million to haseen fahim his brother , muhammad fahim , the afghan first vice president , has been calling bank officials repeatedly this week from germany to try to save whatever he can of his family s money , two afghans close to the bank said the troubles at kabul bank , which tie the fahim and karzai families together , could strain the alliance between president karzai and vice president fahim mr fahim , an ethnic tajik who fought against the taliban , provides crucial political support to mr karzai s government mahmoud karzai said that he thought the bank could weather the crisis , and that the collapse of confidence that unfolded over the past few days was unwarranted this is nothing but a panic , mr karzai said people are under the impression that the bank is failing , and it s not
as i noted in this post , the debtgdp ratio rose much more under hoover than it did under fdr this doesn t show that fdr was more frugal than his predecessor it reflects the fact that gdp crashed under hoover , while rising quite rapidly , from a low base , during the new deal the picture is even more striking if you look at interest payments on federal debt as a percentage of gdp , which were kept down by depressionera low rates by this measure , the debt burden peaked in 1933 , and basically declined until the 1938 recession , which was partly due to fdr s premature embrace of austerity now , none of this is a clean experiment there were monetary policies going on , and the 192933 recession would probably have given way to at least some recovery whoever was in the white house but the experience of the 30s offers no support to those who worry about the debt consequences of deficit spending in a depressed economy fdr didn t do enough stimulus , but the spending he did do was not reflected in a spiraling , or even rising , debt burden and the evidence is consistent with the view that austerity , hooverstyle , may well be selfdefeating even in a narrow fiscal sense by the way , the debt and interest data come from the millennial edition of historical statistics \( subscription required \)

paris a curious match of contrasting styles looked no more than halfway over but as francesca schiavone sat in her chair after winning a firstset tie breaker , approached when i saw her , i thought , do you need something \? schiavone said dementieva shook schiavone s hand and said she was too hurt to go on schiavone , a 29yearold italian who had never been this far in a major tournament , was stunned for 10 seconds , i do n't know how many seconds , i could n't realize , schiavone said but i know when you shake hands , it s finished she watched the fifthseeded dementieva shake the hand of the chair umpire , too she looked toward a group of supporters across court philippe chatrier for confirmation slowly , schiavone understood she was headed to the final after a 76 \( 3 \) firstset victory , the beneficiary of dementieva s sudden decision to retire with what she called a torn calf muscle a confused expression turned to a smile as schiavone , seeded 17th , strolled onto the court and raised her arms the news rippled through the confused crowd i was not ready to finish like this , said schiavone , who had been the first italian woman to reach the semifinals of a grand slam event but i am not upset schiavone knelt and kissed the crushedbrick surface of roland garros s main court dementieva , no stranger to bigmatch disappointment , pulled her visor down to hide her tears i really wanted to play , because it s a very special tournament for me , said dementieva , 27 in grand slam semifinals , who said she first hurt the muscle in the second round so i was pushing very hard myself to go through the pain but , i mean , i cannot do more than that i just try my best i could n't do any better the other semifinal match ended even faster , though it reached its oncourt conclusion no 7 samantha stosur of australia needed only an hour to fully deconstruct fourthseeded jelena jankovic of serbia ,  that leaves a saturday final that no one might have predicted at the outset , but that will find interested audiences from stosur s home on australia s gold coast to the streets of schiavone s home in milan the two at the 2009 but in the first round , when the 30thseeded stosur beat the unseeded schiavone in two easy sets stosur also beat schiavone last fall in the final at osaka , japan , to capture her first career singles title stosur , a 26yearold former french open champion in doubles with a renewed focus on singles , has overpowered her competition at roland garros in succession , she beat three past or present no 1 players the fourtime champion justine henin , the current no 1 , serena williams , and the recently rejuvenated jankovic beating the caliber of players i 've played the last three rounds definitely helps me for saturday s match , stosur said i 've beaten all those , so why ca n't i win one more \? it is a final , so it s different , but it definitely gives me huge confidence going into the next match , and hopefully for the rest of my career the strategy was the same against them all keep them off balance with a highbouncing kick serve , unusual on the women s side hit powerful strokes deep into the corners and keep the opponent moving side to side or backward it has felt as if the court were tipped slightly downhill for stosur , as long volleys slowly shift toward the other end of the court more times than not , stosur has moved toward the net and put away points with authority , using an overwhelming combination of speed and spin stosur has used it to build a 202 record on clay this spring to be honest , she kind of has , like , almost the game of a man , jankovic said that s what it feels like after a first week with few upsets , the women s draw crumbled once it passed the middle weekend no 2 venus williams and henin lost in the fourth round , and no 1 serena williams and no 3 caroline wozniacki lost in the quarterfinals it left four semifinalists from four countries with something in common none had won a grand slam event that had not happened at the french open since 1979 thursday s opening semifinal match was a study in differences on one side was dementieva , the tall , blonde russian with the steady baseline strokes , a top10 talent whose career has been pocked by disappointing losses although she won the 2008 olympic gold medal in beijing , dementieva is better known for missed opportunities the two times she moved past a grand slam semifinal , at the french and united states opens in 2004 , she lost in the final on the other side was the relatively spry italian with sneaky sharp strokes schiavone presented an allaround game more than good enough to hover around no 20 in the rankings for much of a decade , but never good enough to make a big impression at the majors until now she has more history to overcome only once , in 1933 , has someone seeded outside the top 10 won the women s singles title schiavone and dementieva traded breaks at 33 , then held serve to the tie breaker dementieva won the first two points , but schiavone took the next five  dementieva said she hurt her calf in a secondround match against anabel medina garrigues she nearly pulled out in the third round against aleksandra wozniak , but thought the injury had improved she made the decision to retire immediately after the first set thursday dementieva said she would have probably retired even if she had held the lead , and she is unsure whether she will play wimbledon later this month her decision caused some confusion for a few moments , but no one was more surprised than schiavone finally convinced that she had won , she kissed the dirt for the second straight match it was good , she said so good she smiled imagine the expression on schiavone s face if she wins again
all in all , the visit of pope benedict xvi to britain over the weekend must have been a disappointment to his legions of detractors their bold promises notwithstanding , did n't manage to clap the pope in irons and haul him off to jail the protests against benedict s presence proved a sideshow to the visit , rather than the main event and the threat \( happily empty , it turned out \) of an assassination plot provided a reminder of what real religious extremism looks like as opposed to the gentle scholar , swathed in white , urging secular britons to look with fresh eyes at their island s ancient faith and the crowds came out , as they always do for papal visits 85 , 000 for a prayer vigil in london , 125 , 000 lining edinburgh s streets , 50 , 000 in birmingham to see benedict beatify john henry newman , the famous victorian convert from anglicanism even at a time of catholic scandal , even amid a pontificate that s stumbled from one publicrelations debacle to another , benedict still managed to draw a warm and enthusiastic audience no doubt most of britain s five million catholics do not believe exactly what benedict believes and teaches no doubt most of them are appalled at the catholic hierarchy s record on priestly child abuse , and disappointed that many of the scandal s enablers  but in turning out for their beleaguered pope , britain s catholics acknowledged something essential about their faith that many of the vatican s critics , secular and religious alike , persistently fail to understand they were n't there to voice agreement with benedict , necessarily they were there to show their respect for the pontiff , for his office , and for the role it has played in sustaining catholicism for 2 , 000 years conventional wisdom holds that such respect is increasingly misplaced , and that the papacy is increasingly a millstone around roman catholicism s neck if it were n't for the reactionaries in the vatican , the argument runs , priests might have been permitted to marry , forestalling the sex abuse crisis birth control , gay relationships , divorce and remarriage might have been blessed , bringing lapsed catholics back into the fold theological dissent would have been allowed to flourish , creating a more welcoming environment for religious seekers and yet none of these assumptions have any real evidence to back them up yes , sex abuse has been devastating to the church but as earlier this year , there s no data suggesting that celibate priests commit abuse at higher rates than the population as a whole , or that married men are less prone to pedophilia \( the real problem was the hierarchy s fear of scandal , which led to endless coverups and enabled serial predation \) and yes , the church s exclusive theological claims and stringent moral message do n't go over well in a multicultural , sexually liberated society but the example of catholicism s rivals suggests that the church might well be much worse off if it had simply refashioned itself to fit the prevailing values of the age that s what the denominations of mainline protestantism have done , across the last four decades and instead of gaining members , they 've  the vatican of benedict and john paul ii , by contrast , has striven to maintain continuity with christian tradition , even at the risk of seeming reactionary and out of touch this has cost the church its onceprivileged place in the western establishment , and earned it the scorn of fashionable opinion but continuity , not swift and perhaps foolhardy adaptation , has always been the papacy s purpose , and the secret of its lasting strength catholics do not should not , must not look to the vatican to supply the church with all its saints and visionaries and prophets \( indeed , many of catholicism s greatest figures have had fraught relationships with the holy see including john henry newman , the man beatified on sunday \) they look to rome instead to safeguard what those visionaries achieved , to guard catholicism s inheritance , and provide a symbol of unity for a farflung , billionmember church they look to rome for the long view for the wisdom that not all change is for the better , and that some revolutions are better outlasted than accepted on saturday , benedict addressed britain s politicians in the very hall where sir thomas more , the great catholic martyr , was condemned to death for opposing the reformation of henry viii it was an extraordinary moment , and a reminder of the resilience of catholicism , across a gulf of years that s consumed thrones , nations , entire civilizations this , above all , is why the crowds cheered for the pope , in edinburgh and london and birmingham because almost five centuries after the catholic faith was apparently strangled in britain , their church is still alive
segr , france the 19 beauty queens were comely in their evening gowns , blushing in their swimsuits and heels but the hundreds who packed this small town s exposition hall for the selection of miss pays de loire had also come to cheer an old favorite , the embattled doyenne of the french pageant realm , genevi ve de fontenay for half a century , ms de fontenay , 78 , who never appears in public without a layer of startlingly pale face makeup , broad sweeps of opalescent eye shadow and an elegant hat , reigned over the popular miss pageant series she is exalted in small towns across the country as a sort of folk hero , a protector of traditional values her beauty queens were once congratulated by ministers and received by heads of state but ms de fontenay sold in 2002 to a television production company , endemol france , and though she remained the pageant s public face , she grew disenchanted as it was troubled by scandals , most involving contestants photographed in various levels of undress earlier this year , in what was the final straw for ms de fontenay , endemol paid one of the disgraced beauty queens to appear on one of its reality television shows , the celebrity farm in africa saying that miss france had been irreparably tainted , she quit the contest and started a rival , a more dignified alternative , she says france will have two misses , she vowed , over a glass of cider in segr miss endemol and miss genevi ve ! it has been dubbed the war of the misses by the country s tabloids and local newspapers , which cover the pageant world and ms de fontenay with a reverent assiduousness the conflict has been good for business , too both pageants have been attracting record numbers to their regional contests half the country s regional miss committees have rallied to ms de fontenay , and 28 regional miss nationale pageants are under way under her banner a national winner will be crowned in december , one day after endemol s finale \( a plan to broadcast ms de fontenay s pageant on a regional television channel fell through endemol s event is broadcast on , the country s most popular national station \) in some respects , ms de fontenay s crusade is a measure of the changes in french society since her arrival at miss france in the 1950s but , the thousands who have turned out at her pageants this year also reflect a moral conservatism and regional pride that remain stronger in the french provinces a term widely employed here to mean everywhere but paris than is often recognized this is our france , ms de fontenay said of her pageants the france of the terroir , ' of regional customs , of traditions the one that , we say , still has values it s not the glitzy france of sttropez , where there are halfnaked girls being sprayed with champagne at 10 , 000 euros a bottle ! that s not our france in segr , the contestants were soberly attired they wore onepiece swimsuits and spectators uncorked a local bubbly , saumur brut , none of which was sprayed on anyone contestants sashayed onstage to offer their names , ages and interests one young woman seemed to forget her lines the audience filled the pause with cheers of encouragement i always wanted to be a princess , announced st phanie berthelet , an enthusiastic contestant ms berthelet , 20 , is studying business management contestants and spectators said they were particularly thrilled to be in the presence of ms de fontenay for me , miss france means genevi ve de fontenay , said marie ballu , 19 , another contestant we need to hold on to these kinds of things , she said of ms de fontenay s contests they 're part of our heritage , and it would be a shame if they were lost over the years ms ballu , like many others at the pageant , said endemol had disgraced miss france but endemol s events are hardly carnivals of sin they are , in fact , all but indistinguishable from ms de fontenay s \( though bikinis are the swimwear of choice \) the head of the endemol competition , sylvie tellier , miss france 2002 , is herself ms de fontenay s former prot g e and biographer though ms tellier , 32 , described endemol s contest as about not allowing this young generation to forget what france is and the french values to which we 're attached , she said that ms de fontenay had been trying to fight progress i would n't say she s outdated , genevi ve , it s a generational question , ms tellier said she defended endemol s decision to hire miss france contestants for reality shows , saying , if it can let them make a bit of money , fill up their fridges , and have a bit more popularity , i do n't see what s problematic about it the endemol contest remains remarkably successful , organizers say the televised finale , carried on tf1 since 1995 , attracts among the channel s largest audiences each year last year , for example , about 95 million people , or 15 percent of france s population , watched the crowning of miss france , more than twice the number of viewers for the miss america pageant we know what the french like this is easy , ms tellier said they love to eat they love their country they like seeing beautiful girls , well dressed , well madeup , well coiffed ms de fontenay begged to differ one ca n't imagine miss france without genevi ve de fontenay , she said you know , no one asks sylvie tellier for her autograph no one asks her for anything in the street me , i ca n't take one step without people coming to ask to take photos with me , without people telling me keep going ! do n't change anything ! you 're right ! we adore you ! ' georges peltier , 77 , had come to the segr pageant in the company of his wife , josette , 74 we came because genevi ve de fontenay represents decorum , she represents the french society of yesterday , a bit , he said are her pageants perhaps a relic \? things are always outdated for some people for others they are n't , mr peltier said this is france , it s simple things , he mused , but added , the girls are pretty , one must admit we 're also here for that
david brooks gail , i must say this has been a tough week for those of us who personally admire president obama and his advisers gail collins david , i don t want to hear you complain about a tough week you don t spend nearly as much time as i do in auditoriums full of semisuicidal democrats really , i m lucky i haven t had to talk anybody off a roof ledge david brooks as i was saying , my general rule is that if the president and his advisers are going to accuse somebody of committing a crime , they should have some scintilla of evidence behind the charge yet obama seems to have precisely none behind his accusation that the chamber of commerce is using foreign money to influence the elections  gail collins i think the point was that we have no idea who s funneling money into the chamber for the ads small businesses \? large corporations \? large chinese corporations \? martians \? it s insane that there s no disclosure requirement i still haven t gotten over the true republican pac which paid for ads against a candidate for governor in alabama , claiming he supported the teaching of evolution it turned out they were financed by the teachers union , which had no problem with evolution but wanted to hurt him for his policy on labor issues david brooks some people make a distinction between hard money and soft money in politics , i ve come to learn that the only distinction that really matters in practice is democratic money and republican money in 2008 , when democrats had a huge spending advantage , including 400 million in outside expenditures \( much of it from unknown sources \) , there was no great fuss made about the nefarious influence of money in politics but this year the republicans are outraising the democrats \( at least at some levels \) so suddenly there is great hue and cry the koch brothers have been spending millions for decades , and now suddenly they are allegedly responsible for organizing the tea party movement gail collins i don t want to waste any of our conversation arguing about which party is more hypocritical when it comes to campaign finance the moral here is that the very modest gains we made in controlling the influence of big money on elections have been lost , and we re worse off than we were when we started trying to reform the system i ll bet the sane version of john mccain is weeping in whatever limbo he now inhabits david brooks i don t like the influence of money any more than the next person it magnifies transparency and unreason the people who give tend to be tribal in their affiliations and they hate people who compromise and stray from party orthodoxy the way to rise to leadership in congress is through fundraising and so it is generally the most partisan who make it to the top but the leaders of neither party have the moral authority to criticize the other on this score to do so means ignoring the mote in your own eye and it is depressing to see obama and others going off on this jag there must be other ways of firing up the democratic base is there no substantive issue they can talk about \? gail collins you ve got me on that one i think the obama administration and the democrats in congress have done a good job over the last two years , all things considered but they re running away from their best achievements , so they ll have no mandate to do anything if they do happen to maintain control plus , they ll be relying more than ever on guys like their party s senate candidate in west virginia whose ads show him putting a bullet through climate change legislation david brooks the second reason obama s behavior is depressing is that it shows that the administration is getting mentally captured by the lefty blogosphere the real secret of mature leadership is that you can t confuse your party s information food chain with reality the lefty blogosphere , like the righty blogosphere , exaggerates or makes up facts that flatter its world view , ignores the rest and ends up in a comforting fantasy land the obama people used to understand this in this case , they seem to have lost their distance from it gail collins you ve lost me on that one the lefties aren t particularly obsessed about foreign money the special interests they hate most are right here at home david brooks obama s line of attack is also bad for his reelection prospects and the future of the democratic party as a whole the main reason the democrats are in trouble is not the tea party movements it is because independents have abandoned the democrats the polls clearly indicate indies think the party is too liberal and too hostile to business so why does obama take every conceivable opportunity to go to war with business \? gail collins it s not barack obama who runs around the country yelling about the wall street bailout the last time the two parties worked together , and legislators actually attempted to sacrifice a smidgeon of political gain for the common good was when the democrats saved george w bush s rescue plan for the financial system and now republican candidates are making sure they pay for it along , i must admit , with some particularly weenie democrats david brooks declaring war on the chamber of commerce may be a good idea for somebody hosting a show on msnbc , but there are chambers in towns across america gail collins yeah , and i thought they were dedicated to improving the local business climate by supporting road repair and civic improvement when did they get into the business of shoveling hundreds of millions of dollars into election attack ads \? david brooks my point is that there are big and small business in towns across america there are people who work in the private sector everywhere why is there always so much hostility to these people \? all in all , they re making a big mistake here gail collins david , i acknowledge that big business , in the form of what people call wall street has gotten some bashing from the president this year and the folks who work there resent it but you and i have been listening to campaign speeches for the last several months when was the last time you heard anybody say a bad word about small business \? as far as i can tell , small business is now more politically sacrosanct than social security , motherhood and puppies combined show me a candidate who tells his audiences you know , a small business that makes no effort to give its workers health insurance is irresponsible little is not always virtuous i d give him her my heart
it has become fashionable to say that connecticut s is bad for women s basketball , as if greatness can be as choking and stifling as weeds at best , that growing suggestion is ignorant of college basketball history at worst , it is a wearying , sexist attempt to diminish the achievement of women , who were too long excluded from sports and are still too often forced to apologize for sweating all sports need dynasties to cement their popularity baseball needed the yankees , professional football needed the green bay packers , professional basketball needed the boston celtics and the los angeles lakers and the chicago bulls would as many people pay attention to golf if not for tiger woods s professional birdies and personal bogeys \? and just as college basketball needed the men in the 1960s and '70s , it now needs the women s dominance of and tennessee for visibility and viability connecticut s winning streak is one of the greatest things ever to happen to women s basketball , said van chancellor , the women s coach at louisiana state , who won four consecutive championships with the houston comets of the wnba it s all over tv and newspapers everyone is talking about it i think true men s basketball fans are more aware of uconn s winning streak than almost anything else we 've done in the women s game and yet , as frequently happens , women are held to a different standard , derided as somehow lesser or undeserving the ucla men won 10 championships in 12 seasons under john wooden from 1964 to 1975 , and posted from 1971 to 1974 , achievements that were largely celebrated with hardwood hosannas wooden became the wizard of westwood so why , with six national titles and a seventh expected soon , is n't widely considered the sorcerer of storrs \? instead , the uconn women are criticized for winning too often , by too many points i do n't remember anyone saying ucla was bad for basketball , auriemma said is women s college basketball as balanced as men s basketball today \? no , but realtime comparisons are unfair the truly equitable measure is to judge the two sports at similar moments in their development using that more reasonable calculation , it can be argued that women s basketball is more competitive , not less , than men s basketball was at the same stage of its evolution i think people try to use the streak to say women s basketball is not as good as men s basketball , said harry perretta , the women s coach at villanova , which by uconn in 2003 but we 're in the same growing situation as men s basketball was x amount of years ago people do n't see the timeline the men s ncaa basketball tournament began in 1939 the women did not have one until 1982 a decade after the passage of the genderequity legislation known as title ix this year s women s ncaa tournament will be its 29th the 29th men s tournament occurred in 1967 as the ucla dynasty kicked into full swing with lew alcindor , now , consummating a 300 season and winning the first of what would become seven consecutive titles for the bruins essentially , there is zero difference in the trajectory of men s and women s college basketball the women s game is still in its comparative infancy dominant champions are predictable and necessary , just as they were for the men if anything , it is more difficult for the uconn women to win titles now than it was for alcindor and bill walton at ucla decades ago look at us , defending champions knocked out in the first round last year , said pat summitt , who has won eight national titles at tennessee until wooden won his last title in 1975 , his best ucla teams played in ncaa tournaments that were limited to 25 teams and most important one per conference thus , some great teams were not allowed to challenge the bruins' supremacy , like southern california of 197071 , a topfive squad that lost only to ucla in the regular season before 1975 , those ucla teams had to win four tournament games to capture a national title , not the six that uconn must win in a 64team field that includes all of the nation s elite teams moreover , before 1974 , ucla played only tournament opponents from western states until the final four , which limited threats to the bruins and resulted in some of the same lopsided results in the west region for which uconn is now criticized 10076 over brigham young in 1965 , 10960 over wyoming in 1967 , 9052 over santa clara in 1969 , 10179 over utah state in 1970 and 9058 over weber state in 1972 true , ucla did not win every game by double figures in building its 88game winning streak as uconn has in winning 72 straight but it often was just as dominant in its glory days in fact , ucla set a singlegame scoring record at home , since broken , with a 13384 trouncing of none other than pete maravich and lsu on dec 13 , 1969 after that game , maravich said ucla should join the nba they 'd fit right in so , uconn is not a runaway train it is simply following a track parallel to the growth of men s basketball teams that become consistent winners and play at a certain level , fans love that , respect it , auriemma said i do n't care whether it is the yankees , the patriots , us , whoever to dismiss that is demeaning
san francisco some years ago , when i was in my early 20s , i found a photograph of my mother as a bride that the man beside her was not my father , that she 'd kept this marriage a secret from me , that she had been disturbingly young none of this unsettled me as much as her expression eyes downcast and lips pouted , she looked as if the next shot would have shown her crying in that moment i thought that is not my mother my family left iran during the 1979 islamic revolution my parents bought a roadside motel in california and set out to make new lives for us immigration baffled , then broke , my father , and so it was my mother who took charge of the motel , my mother who sat behind the plastic window of the manager s suite answering the phone , my mother who cleaned the rooms on weekends and all the other days when the maid did n't show up at home she was no less commanding here the woman who wrangled with truck drivers over motel bills wore a turquoise bathing cap and bright red lipstick to swim in the backyard pool she reigned over dinner parties of 50 or 100 people she coursed , coiffed and highheeled , through rooms filled with marble coffee tables , giltframed armoires and fields of persian carpets she stuffed plump dates with almonds and passed them on sterling silver platters , smilingly , to her guests proud , exacting , selfassured and unsentimental that was the mother i knew nothing about her resembled the vulnerable girl in the photograph i found , or at least nothing i could yet recognize for god s sake , make something of yourself ! had been her constant injunction throughout my childhood and adolescence make something of yourself or else you are nothing at all ! my mother was as protective as she was ambitious forbidden even the small liberties enjoyed by the other iranian girls of our social circle , i spent almost every day with her at the motel or out on visits to her friends what i wanted to be what i wanted to make myself more desperately all the time was normal by which i meant american i could never understand my mother s anxiety about keeping me close and safe as i got older , i simply dismissed her protectiveness as just one of her many strange , foreign ways i moved to the east coast and spoke to her only infrequently i cast her as odious old world mother to my plucky american heroine and , until i found the photograph , i did n't look back it s difficult to imagine our mothers as women with stories and selves that exist separately from ours so firmly do we hold onto the mothers of our memories that even as adults faced with some irrefutable proof of their lives before and apart from us , we still insist on our own versions of their lives after i confronted my mother about the photograph , the truth of her life came out haltingly and imperfectly even now , a decade later , there are many parts of it that i do n't understand and ca n't square with my memories of her what i do know is that she was married at 13 i also know she had a child by her first husband a daughter and that she 'd been forced to abandon that child as a condition of divorce do n't speak her name , her family had told her , and even after 30 years , even in another country , she feels herself bound by that dictate for me , finding the photograph meant giving up not only the idea of my mother i 'd held onto for so long , but also giving up some version of the daughter i 'd been the revelation of her secret made me feel a strange new tenderness toward her , and it would make me kinder to her , if not always kind enough it also made me remember other things about my mother , memories i 'd just about forgotten i 'd think back , for example , to how she used to sit in the living room by herself late at night , watching television footage of the revolution and , later , of the iraniraq war as the cries of allahu akbar ! rang out across the rooftops of tehran , she 'd rock herself back and forth , eyes fixed on the screen i 'd remember , too , the times when i 'd wake up in the night , fumble downstairs and find the light from her bedroom spilling out onto the hallway carpet behind the door i 'd hear her sobbing , and it scared me so much i 'd climb the stairs and go back to my own bed these two inscrutable histories iran s , hers were wedded to each other , i realized many years later , and i wondered if i 'd ever make sense of either one shortly after i found the photograph , i went to visit her in california my father had died , the motel had been sold off , and she 'd had to give up her house she had less , by far , than what she 'd come to america with and no hope of ever returning to iran as i looked around her tiny studio , i was astonished not so much by what she 'd lost , but by what she 'd managed to hold on to her brass samovar , her marbletopped buffet , her canopied bed surrounded by these and other hardwon tokens of our american lives , i was suddenly and fiercely grateful to have come back home during that visit , my mother showed me another photograph i 'd never seen before in it a young woman , hair bobbed and face in shadows , stood with a toddler i studied the photograph closely , quietly , ready finally to know her , or at least to begin
prepare for a new round of politicized skirmishes in the neverending climate wars , with the battleground shifting once again to capitol hill hearing rooms be sure to read today s post on the new political climate and science , as well many climate scientists , still reeling from a year of largely unsubstantiated accusations and attacks , are already girding for battle , with some publicly decrying the prospect of congressional hearings on climate science under the impending shift to republican control of the house michael mann , the climatologist at pennsylvania state university who has for years been a focal point for assaults on climate science , made the point most directly in a recent oped article in the washington post he listed some of the elected officials who have used , or plan to use , their offices to probe the integrity of climate research and rejected any claim that such efforts are about revealing the truth the truth is that they don t expect to uncover anything , mann wrote instead , they want to continue a 20year assault on climate research , questioning basic science and promoting doubt where there is none \( representative joe l barton , a republican of texas who led an inquiry into mann s research in 2005 , sent a response , and mann then wrote a rebuttal to the letter \) mike roddy , a frequent contributor to dot earth and passionate defender of climate research and proponent of actions to cut greenhouse gas emissions , recently posted a comment urging scientists in mann s position not to resist such hearings , but to dive into the fray  commenters have mentioned that they look forward to republican takeover of the house so that we can have hearings on climate change , sure to expose the lies and deceptions of climate scientists these hearings will likely be chaired by darrell issa , former caralarm magnate , who recently achieved a zero score from the league of conservation voters bring it on , baby i can t wait to see televised hearings , showing people like michael mann and james hansen pitted against issa and inhofe even the average american will be able to figure out who actually knows what he s talking about if this happens to my mind , while there is a huge hassle factor in enduring such hearings , i agree with roddy beyond his points , i see other reasons not to resist such hearings , however distasteful one finds the politics consider this when work is done using taxpayers money , shouldn t there be a right to examine the books of any government contractor whether building missiles or running climate models \? or is science , in some way or other , special \? i sent this and other questions to the american association for the advancement of science this morning , and the answer was , to some extent , that science is , in fact , special here s the reply , from joanne carney , the director of the association s center for science , technology and congress aaas has consistently emphasized that congress certainly has a responsibility as well as the authority to conduct oversight of federal programs and government management the oversight committee and various oversight subcommittees can play an important role whether it is investigating a catastrophe \( eg , shuttle accident \) or program management and cost overruns \( eg , iter \) aaas has raised questions , however , about instances in which inquiries go beyond that appropriate oversight function and have expressed concern when such inquiries may inhibit scientific advances and have a chilling effect on discovery i think our view is articulated best in a letter we sent to rep barton in response to his inquiry in 2005 congress indeed has an important role in oversight of federally funded research , especially that which contributes to public policy that role properly includes attention to both priorities and productivity in such research , but as to quality , the best guide for the congress is the fate of federally funded research in the peerreviewed literature and in the assessments of that literature by scientific bodies there s still no simple bright line determining what kind of hearing is , or isn t justified , which means that if you re undertaking research with government support , it s hard to find a legitimate argument for resisting a call to capitol hill , no matter who s holding the gavel \( the same goes for probes for information using the freedom of information act \) still , there s plenty of room for discussion , and certainly a history of committee chairmen dangerously wielding their powers , as laurie dougherty , another dot earth commenter , pointed out today in a reply to roddy \( and me \)  mike roddy , i understand , although i don t share , your bring it on attitude regarding the republican threat to investigate michael mann and other climate scientists you have the guts to fight back against powerful interests but this is not a tv show , it s a witch hunt it s not about intelligent responses and informed judgments it s about creating an atmosphere of fear and loathing it s a very dangerous prospect as for andy , will you rise up to defend climate scientists if such an investigation happens \? or will you do a play by play as if it s a game of competing points of view \? \( like the post offering dueling cartoonists \? \) do you have a clue about the legacy of mccarthyism , the careers ruined , the long , dark shadow it cast over american political discourse for decades ask your friend pete seeger do you think it will stop with michael mann and james hansen \? what happens when they go after you \? rush already has you in his sights in reply to laurie dougherty , there ll be plenty of defenders of climate science , including me and i have talked to pete seeger \( who s a friend and neighbor \) about the legacy of the mccarthy era my sense is , even at 91 , he d happily bring his banjo to capitol hill these days no matter who was in charge and what questions were asked i ll ask him and report back
as the rangers and rays series gets under way on wednesday , you should not be surprised if a rangers pitcher throws a lowhit gem at some point during the series the rays had five games this season when the opposing pitching staffs allowed one or no hits this includes the may 9 perfect game by the a s dallas braden and the june 25 nohitter by the diamondbacks edwin jackson add in the three onehitters thrown at the rays by cleveland , toronto and boston , and the rays had the most lowhit games in a single season since 1920 with five despite such anemic performances , the rays still managed to finish the season with the third most runs in the american league , despite finishing next to last in the league with a 247 batting average beating out only the deadball eraesque seattle mariners in fact , a 247 \( 2469 to be exact \) batting average is the second lowest for an american league playoff team in the designated hitter era , just edging the 1974 a s and their 2467 team batting average perhaps this shouldn t be that surprising given the rays batting style the rays relied on a leagueleading 672 walks , very good batting with runners in scoring position \( the secondbest ops in the american league \) , and even better base running the rays offensive plan is straightforward work the pitcher for a walk , run the bases aggressively , and drive the runs home with good situational hitting tampa s base running was exceptional all year , with 172 bases stolen at a secondbest 79 percent success rate , just off the a s 80 percent rate the rays didn t just steal a lot of bases , they also took the extra base more than any other team on baseballreferencecom , we track the number of times a team takes the extra base like going from first to third on a single , tagging up on a fly ball , wild pitches , defensive indifference the rays led the majors with 203 such base advances , just ahead of the rangers at 199 by contrast , the pirates , who suffered from a lack of base runners to begin with , took only 93 extra bases if we look at the number of times the rays took the extra base on hits first to third on a single , for instance they did so 45 percent of the available opportunities just behind the cincinnati reds but unlike the reds , who ran into 66 outs , the rays finished in the middle of the pack with only 56 such outs , despite attempting to take the extra base many more times for good measure , the rays also led the majors in catcher interferences drawn with six fourteen major league teams had none the rangers catchers matt treanor and bengie molina will be in charge of shutting down the rays running game with molina most likely getting more starts than treanor molina s throwing , which was among the best in the league during his time with the angels in the early 2000 s , has deteriorated to the point that baseball info solutions lists him as the fifthworst throwing catcher in the majors this year he allowed the fifth most steals and threw out only 23 percent of base stealers treanor was somewhat better , around league average for the season , and both do a reasonable job blocking pitches i would look for the rays to steal early and often on the rangers some rangers pitchers have been good at shutting down the running game the game 1 starter , cliff lee , allowed only four steals all year and closer neftali feliz allowed none in their regularseason matchups , the rays were eight of nine in steal attempts , so they ve had success against the rangers already this year in the outfield , the rangers had mixed results in keeping runners from taking the extra base centerfielder julio borbon was above average at holding runners , but the corner outfielders , josh hamilton and nelson cruz , were both below average , but not awful i very much expect the rays to test hamilton s throwing arm because making him run around the outfield and execute difficult throws could take some of the punch out of his bat with modern baseball s focus on waiting for a fat 31 pitch to hit over the fence , the rays offer something of a throwback to the 1980 s , where teams like the herzog cardinals would work the pitcher for a walk and then test the opponent s defense all the way around the basepaths
to the editor re \( editorial , jan 30 \) , about a dispute between unitedhealthcare and a group of new york hospitals over reimbursement rates your editorial appears to be evenhanded in appealing to both sides to provide better care and to control costs and premiums but the hospitals in question are notforprofit entities whose costs are growing , in part because of expensive but lifesaving medical technology and drugs , while reimbursement by medicare and medicaid lags behind the other side in the dispute is a forprofit company that pays tens of millions of dollars a year to its chief executive a reasonable person may suspect that the motives of the two sides in this dispute are quite different the goal of one is taking good care of patients , while the primary objective of the other is making profits for its shareholders alexander mauskop new york , jan 30 , 2010  to the editor your editorial cites unitedhealthcare s demand that the hospitals notify it within 24 hours when a beneficiary is admitted or suffer a 50 percent cut in reimbursements , and asks , how hard could it be for admissions offices to alert the insurer that a patient has arrived \? unfortunately , the reality is not so simple patients often arrive in a confused or unconscious state , almost always without their insurance cards many people do not know the name of their insurer or whether their coverage is in force others are subject to carveouts , have primary and secondary policies or are unaware that their medicaid or medicare is managed through a distinct company few insurers are available 24 7 to verify coverage and accept information when insurers are open , hospital personnel spend substantial amounts of time on hold without a singlepayer system , dealing with insurers requires the skills of a detective and the patience of job should hospitals really be penalized for opting to care for their patients instead \? laura fochtmann east setauket , ny , jan 30 , 2010  to the editor while the requirement that hospitals notify unitedhealthcare of an admission within 24 hours is stringent , it is not a major point of contention rather , it is unitedhealthcare s plan to cut hospitals' reimbursement by 50 percent for notifications provided later than 24 hours that is so unreasonable by contrast , an insurer in new york that waited an entire year to pay a hospital claim would incur a penalty of 12 percent interest by any measure , a 50 percent penalty is egregiously disproportionate to the supposed infraction and cannot be viewed as anything short of confiscatory especially with unitedhealthcare making billions in profits and most hospitals struggling just to break even kenneth e raske president , greater new york hospital association new york , feb 1 , 2010  to the editor of the dispute between unitedhealthcare and continuum health partners , you write that the insurer appears to be acting responsibly how is it responsible to reimburse hospitals less than health care actually costs \? hard bargaining by insurance companies does n't bring real costs down it just pressures providers to make economic rather than medical decisions and that is unitedhealthcare s specialty forcing providers to spend their time and money justifying care rather than providing it during the one unfortunate year i spent as a client of oxford \( owned by unitedhealthcare \) , it made some attempt to deny payment on almost every claim i made most of those denials were specious and oxford ended up having to pay , but not until it had wasted money challenging the claim and forced my doctors to refile paperwork or further justify their medical decisions , none of which improves health care , and all of which adds to its cost and it goes without saying that oxford never intervened on behalf of medical care , only on behalf of less david berman new york , jan 30 , 2010
although the filmmaker amar kanwar is highly regarded internationally , he s not much seen on the biennial glamour circuit he continues to live in new delhi , where he was born in 1964 and his documentarybased art is unswervingly grounded in what he once called issues of justice , meaning social justice at the same time , however dark the content of his work , he is a vivid shaper of narratives , as two ambitious pieces at marian goodman attest one , the eightchannel video piece called the lightning testimonies , made its debut at documenta 12 in 2007 , and seeing it there was an intense experience the installation wrapped around a dark , smallish room , so you had to keep changing positions to take in the images flashing by on different screens the subject matter the sexual violation of women during and after the 1947 partition of the indian subcontinent into pakistan and india was harrowing , and the accumulation of firstperson accounts of rapes , abductions and murders felt relentless even when relieved with images from nature being shown for the first time in new york , the piece has lost none of its force , even in a somewhat lightenedup viewing environment but the real news is the new york premiere of an even more elaborately scaled piece , the torn first pages , a 19channel film installation , which mr kanwar worked on from 2004 to 2008 and that comes in three sections , each divided into several short segments the subject is the struggle for democracy in myanmar , formerly known as burma , under a brutal military dictatorship the show is dedicated to a burmese bookstore owner named ko than htay , who was imprisoned in 1994 for tearing out the first pages on which were printed slogans from the military dictatorship of all the books and magazines he sold mr kanwar s focus is on other single and collective examples of resistance inside and outside the country the first and most complex section has six short films playing more or less simultaneously two are tributes to political martyrs a high school student killed by burmese soldiers in 1988 , and a student leader who died in mandalay prison in 2006 a pair of segments was filmed in new delhi in one , the leader of the burmese military scatters flowers at mohandas gandhi s cremation site in the other , a dissident burmese artist carries a painting of gandhi in an indian political march finally , there are segments set in oslo , where democracy advocates in exile have formed a small radio station called the democratic voice of burma the installation s second part is devoted to interviews with members of a burmese community in fort wayne , ind , one of whom tracks down the migr poet tin moe \( 19332007 \) , a prison survivor the third part is archival , with films secretly made in myanmar of prodemocracy demonstrations in one astonishing sequence , thousands of redrobed buddhist monks fill city streets in silent protest the entire piece requires about an hour of viewing with its three sections physically separated in a large gallery , it requires even more movement than the lightning testimonies and because several segments are always playing at once , details are easy to miss perhaps in anticipation of this , mr kanwar has produced a little book with the basic material in condensed form we are not a patient culture we want our art fast , tasty and complete mr kanwar s art , like much of the best video art today , just does n't work that way you have to slow down , adjust to his time frame , and trust that he has memorable experiences to deliver he does
when patrick kane executed his little juke and jive , as craig simpson called it over hockey night in canada , enabling him to freeze kimmo timonen just long enough to build a little outside speed , it looked like a move that could lead to a scoring chance but timonen stayed with him and kept his path closed so from near the goal line , kane just whipped the puck toward michael leighton s skates eight stories above , in the press box , someone said where s the puck \? all eyes were trained on the goal no red light came on , no referee pointed to the net the huge overstuffed arena went silent then , away from the net , a pair of black objects went sailing in the air kane s gloves and a few more pair followed it s in , boys ! it s in ! it s in ! kane yelled at his bench as he wildly skated toward the other end , his bare hands waving victoriously in the air his blackhawks teammates , slowly realizing kane was right , began pouring over the boards in pursuit of him kane couldn t be heard along press row still , someone figured out , it s in the net it s over , although besides the blackhawks spasmodic celebration , no one had officially indicated the overtime had ended and the stanley cup had been won the puck was missing the house announcer lou nolan announced over the pa system the play is under review , as the referees and linesmen searched the net , lifting it to reveal the puck almost 40 seconds after kane s shot it took nearly another minute for nolan to announce , chicago goal scored by no 88 , patrick kane , and the philadelphia fans , quietly fearful until this moment , let out their first postgame boo it was a surreal conclusion to an altogether unusual series four hours earlier , a dozen laughing flyers , most of them bearded and wearing warmup clothers , had gathered under the wachovia center stands on the pattison avenue side of the arena floor level for their pregame soccer ball kickaround forming a circle about 30 feet across , they limbered up by trying to prevent it from hitting the concrete under their feet they used their toes , knees , thighs , heads and shoulders and , for hockey players , acquitted themselves quite well the barbs flew quickly whenever the ball touched down and at one juncture that somehow led linemates scott hartnell and ville leino into a spontaneous game of rock , paper , scissors , before they laughed through their impressive playoff beards , hartnell displaying the lumberjack look while lieno sported a more refined abraham lincoln model it was obvious this group truly liked each other playoff success does that to a hockey team , especially one that does the nearimpossible nothing in their demeanor suggested the flyers thought this would be their last game of the season around the bend , about 125 blackhawks family members paraded into the building , flown in for game 6 by the team the chicago adviser scotty bowman , whose son stan is the team s first year general manager , stood nearby and greeted some of his clan as they entered before indulging a few writers with tales of stanley cups past how about the 1973 finals \? he offered with a mischievous smile when asked about other cup finals which featured subpar goaltending that year , the canadiens ken dryden and blackhawks tony esposito combined to allow 56 goals in six weird games it s still the record of course , dryden and esposito are the hall of famers leighton , brian boucher and antti niemi who got their teams to the finals but conspired to surrender 47 this round aren t quite in that class bowman s canadiens won the cup in 1973 , the first of his 12 championships as coach and in management you d think he d be accustomed to the pressure , but as the game approached and talk turned chicago s plan to distribute their top forwards on three different lines \( pronger can t cover all three , he said \) , his face betrayed some nervousness , the playful smile was gone , his eyes lost a touch of sparkle i hope they take it to philly early , he said they did on their second shift of the game , jonathan toews line with marian hossa and tomas kopecky cycled the puck deep in the flyers zone the puck came to kopecky in the right wing corner with flyers defenseman chris pronger two feet away this was a moment for pronger to deliver a statement bodycheck , plaster kopecky into the boards and disrupt chicago s attack but if the orange army in the seats expected this , they were let down pronger kept his distance as kopecky moved the puck to toews , who kept the cycle going the flyers chased the puck for nearly a minute and leighton had to be quick to stop three shots that set the first period tone pronger was far less a factor than he had been earlier in the series those who wondered at the outset if philadelphia s reliance on four defensemen would wear them and especially pronger down seemed to have their answer and after pronger took his second penalty of the period , the reunited line of towes , kane and dustin byfuglien went to work and the blackhawks led , 10 chicago dominated the period , but couldn t hold the lead brent sopel s second interference penalty of the period with under a minute to go put the flyers on the power play and hartnell camped out in front of the net , absorbed a whack from duncan keith and slammed home a rebound to even the score with under 30 seconds left , juicing the orange army with the late goal twentynine other teams would want hartnell in their lineup the flyers surged into the second period , a simon gagne breakaway in the first minute forcing niemi to make a big save in a series that had a dearth of them \( video \) but he could do nothing eight minutes in when the flyers took the lead , 21 hartnell helping create that one , too , when he clipped keith s skate with his own \( accidentally or in retaliation for the earlier chop \? \) and opened up the ice for danny briere to finish off leino s pass but as the flyers had done in earlier games , chicago answered quickly , less than two minutes later with flyers defenseman braydon coburn off for a cross check , followed shortly by questionable goalie interference call against hossa , the teams skated four a side with the extra room , keith rushed into the flyers zone down the right side and drew the attention of gagne and lukas krajicek he dished off to dave bolland driving down the center , who then relayed a perfect backhanded pass on the stick of patrick sharp on the left sharp s eminently stoppable low shot , the type that leighton had problems stopping all series tied the score at 22 \( video \) leighton would have needed a terrific stop to prevent andrew ladd s deflected goal that restored chicago s lead as the second period wound down but it was kane s dancing with the puck along the right wing boards that made it happen , an example of the type of offense pronger prevented kane from showing in the first four games freed from pronger , kane started creating chances , which is why breaking up the toews line at even strength was the key coaching move of the series pronger wouldn t be against kane in overtime either chicago tried to hold that 32 edge for the entire third period the flyers strained to create chances against the blackhawks defense , which managed to cut down one attack after another the orange army , subdued as the third started , sensed regulation time melting away and didn t need artificial scorboard prompting to encourage their heroes but a clip from one of the rocky films underscored the situation , as apollo creed exhorting philadelphia s favorite fictional fighter , favorite hockey team and their fans with the words , there is no tomorrow employing one arena trick after another at each stoppage of play \( cue the obligatory dancing fan in the nosebleed seats blast the cliched welcome to the jungle and c mon feel the noise at earsplitting decibel levels \) , the crowd grew louder as the flyers scrambled to throw the puck at the net in every way possible , trying to make chicago s defense buckle desperation , scotty bowman called it after the game and that s how they tied it up when hartnell got the tip of his stick blade on the pinballing puck that leino had centered with four minutes to play in regulation the orange army now erupted , and the flyers rode their sonic wave to their best hockey since the second period of game 4 , forcing chicago to ice the puck three times , a game 7 in chicago their aim but niemi had big saves in him , none bigger than the one on jeff carter with less than two minutes left in regulation at the end of 60 minutes , up in the press box , one one outoftown newspaperman turned to another and said in mockexasperation , this team just won t die and in the opening few shifts of overtime , philadelphia pressed the issue , knowing they had no choice but to go for the win when the end came it , wasn t quite the sudden death that stanley cup overtime promises , but more of a reluctant expiration perhaps those extra moments after kane s shot was a little tribute , some recognition by the hockey gods of how well the flyers repeatedly stared down their demise perhaps that uncertain finish was not so strange after all for the blackhawks , the party was on as expected by anyone knowing the pedigree , many in the orange army booed their way through the postgame ceremonies booing commissioner gary bettman is pro forma , but it s quite unusual for fans to boo the conn smythe trophy presentation \( devils fans did boo anaheim s js giguere s selection in 2003 they favored marty brodeur \) but toews s selection was booed , as was the appearance of the stanley cup and bettman s handing it to toews some flyers fans stuck around to watch the victors parade the cup alongside the hundreds in the stands wearing chicago garments they chanted hossa , hossa , hossa after toews handed his new linemate the cup they chanted rocky , rocky rocky not for sylvester stallone s character , but for rocky wirtz , the team owner who reversed his father s antediluvian policies , quickly built a champion and won back a city the families followed the media on the ice as the cup was passed from player to player , and byfuglien skated a large blackhawks flag around the perimeter of the gathering throng tv cameras , audio recorders and notebooks all captured quotes about dreams realized amidst laughter , hugs and tears two little girls in matching pink dresses danced near the penalty boxes each holding one end of a blackhawks banner in one hand and small

a few saturdays ago , a teenage visitor to the , a girl in a black beret , slid open the door to the aye simon reading room and peered in at a group of people in animated conversation is there something going on in here \? she said a woman wearing red lipstick and converse sneakers glared at her for a moment and turned away it s a staff room , a tall man in a plaid shirt said brusquely the girl in the beret backed up and slid the door closed if she had been looking for art there was none to be seen on the walls of the rotunda at the time she had found it but it was rather emphatically taking a break the men and women in the room were part of this progress , a work by the britishgerman artist tino sehgal that took over the rotunda for the last six weeks in the piece , which closed wednesday , visitors were ushered up the spiral ramp by a series of guides first a child , then a teenager , then an adult and finally an older person who asked them questions related to the idea of progress over the course of several hourslong shifts a week for the sixweek run of the show , each of these guides , or interpreters as mr sehgal calls them , spent a few minutes walking and talking with one or more visitors at a time , then moved on to the next the show was extremely popular , with final ticket sales of more than 100 , 000 , and on busy weekends a guide might interact with as many as 70 people in a day by the time the guides retired to one of the break rooms the reading room had been set aside for the teenagers and adults they were taking refuge from encounters with the public still , they were clearly invested in the spirit of the project mr sehgal , 34 , is known for keeping a tight rein on every aspect of his work he refused to divulge information about this progress in advance , for example , and prohibited the taking of pictures and his interpreters , although willing to allow a reporter into their midst while the show was on , were likewise reluctant to say much about it until it was over it s an elaborate social contract , explained ashton applewhite , 57 , a writer from brooklyn who was one of the guides it would ruin something of the piece for visitors to be exposed to its inner workings before they had experienced it themselves as one of the teenagers put it , what happened on the ramps stayed on the ramps speaking on thursday , several of the more than 300 people who had been recruited for the show through email messages and later in interviews \( and in the case of the children , an elaborate series of auditions \) confirmed that their starring roles in the season s most talkedabout artwork had been challenging , even trying at times but most also seemed to have found the job and the wideranging and often philosophical dialogues it involved inspiring this kind of conversation usually only happens when two people are drunk or something , or on the subway , said rafay rashid , 20 , a freshman at the state university of new york , purchase there are great things in this world and one of them is talking to people , especially strangers rarely do you make eye contact with someone and try to figure out where they 're coming from george blecher , a 69yearold writer and sometime actor , said he had not become one of those who are ready to follow tino around the earth as a result of the experience , but he seemed to have gotten what he wanted from it as you get older , your social life diminishes , he said to a great extent older people really suffer from loneliness at the same time , he added i ran out of steam after six weeks you have to be alert and you 're giving so much he was not alone after it was all over i had this image of all of us with these big metal windup keys in our backs , ms applewhite said how long would it take for us to all wind down \? the schedule could be grueling even for much younger interpreters , who , unlike their elders , were unpaid \( they did receive a hat , bag and a museum membership adults were paid 1875 an hour , teenagers 725 an hour \) solomon dworkin , an 11yearold sixth grader at the school at columbia university who was one of the oldest children in the piece , said many of the younger ones had trouble with the pace of 40 to 50 interactions a day , 60 to 70 on weekends they had a workload breakdown , he said they would have liked more snacks some of the problem may have had to do with the intellectual rigors of the job the younger children were all pretty smart for their age , he said , but i 've never met a 7yearold who can match an 11yearold in a conversation about philosophy but even older interpreters found the pressure of nonstop thoughtful conversation draining bram wasti , 16 and a junior at hunter college high school , recalled that on his first day as a guide , one of the visitors had defined progress as deprivatizing the federal reserve i had absolutely no idea how to talk about it , he said \( i looked it up later , and it s absolutely not true \) and vinnie wilhelm , a 31yearold writer from philadelphia , initially felt he needed to summon the intellectual dexterity of kant or diogenes to do the job , as if you had to have these nuggets of intellectual insight so you could awe them with your oracular intelligence asad raza , the producer of the exhibition and the recruiter of most of the guides , said he had seen the work improve over time , as the guides became more relaxed and more willing to be themselves there was a kind of anxiety about being chosen for their intelligence , he said it could lead to grandstanding by the end , he said , the piece had become more personal museum visitors , meanwhile , some of whom had no idea what to expect of the show , were not always relaxed about being approached by chatty strangers i felt bad about it , mr rashid said you 'd get rejected halfway up the ramp they say something like i think we 're here for the art' the trick was not to take it personally if you get rejected it s because they were n't interested , not because you were n't interesting , he said , as if repeating a mantra and as in any service job , the customers could be difficult at one point betsy carroll , 20 , a junior at columbia university , found herself refereeing a lovers' quarrel she had asked a couple do you learn from your mistakes \? the man said yes his companion , a woman , rather vehemently disagreed she had a lot of anger about that , ms carroll recalled she chose this moment to bring it up daniel kaiser , 73 , a literature professor at sarah lawrence , noted that european and asiatic couples are very polite they listen to what you say american college students , on the other hand , are the worst they have bad manners in the reading room where the adults gathered , a joke circulated in which a guide pushes a particularly annoying visitor over the edge of the ramp rail gesturing toward the body below , the guide would announce the title of the new work tino sehgal , this pancake , ' 2010 but even those who found the gig trying seemed generally happy with their experience , and hopeful about sustaining some of the connections they had made one of the things i'm anticipating is that someone will come up to me in a coffee shop and say hey , i talked to you at the guggenheim , ' mr blecher said in the final days of the show , feeling ill , he took a taxi home after his last shift he began talking to the cab driver , a new yorker of 31 years i love to have these interesting conversations , ' said the driver i 've been practicing a lot , mr blecher replied
ashikaga , japan on a december morning in 1991 , toshikazu sugaya s quiet , anonymous existence in this sleepy city north of tokyo ended abruptly with a knock on his door it was the police they wanted to question mr sugaya , then a 45yearold divorced school bus driver with no friends , in connection with the grisly murder in 1990 of a 4yearold girl after 13 hours of interrogation , during which mr sugaya says the police kicked his shins and shouted at him , he tearfully admitted to that murder and to killing two other girls he was convicted of one murder and sentenced to life in prison but last year , after prosecutors admitted that his confession was a fabrication made under duress and that a dna test used as evidence had been wrong , mr sugaya was released a court later  the disclosure that mr sugaya had been for more than 17 years shocked even more than his conviction as a serial killer had his release drew a barrage of news media coverage , shaking the public s faith in the police and the courts at a time when japan s prolonged economic decline has created growing doubts about japan s national institutions in general mr sugaya , now 63 , has become a national figure , and perhaps the country s most vocal critic of forced confessions a recurring problem here he has written or cowritten three books , including one titled falsely convicted , and tours the country giving talks about his experience i tell people not to believe the police , said mr sugaya , a small , slightly built man whose face seems almost hidden behind a large pair of wirerim glasses look what they did to me indeed , with slumped shoulders and an almost cowering demeanor that brings to mind a frightened animal caught in car headlights , mr sugaya seems as unlikely a crusader against the abuse of power as he did a serial killer but he can be disarmingly open , and his voice exudes a quiet confidence that he says he acquired in prison , where he learned to fend for himself during those years , he said , he met other convicts who told him they had been convicted because of false confessions he said a desire to help them and others is one reason he has embraced his newfound celebrity , though he remains visibly uncomfortable with all the attention i want to go back to my quiet life of before , mr sugaya said but when i think that others have suffered the same treatment as me , i want to work to help them before his ordeal , mr sugaya described himself as a shy man who avoided conversations and rarely said more than a few words after a marriage that lasted just three months , he divided his time between living with his parents and spending weekends alone at a small house he rented unbeknown to him , the police had been following mr sugaya for a year before his arrest a witness had told them that mr sugaya had been at a pachinko game parlor about the same time that the 4yearold victim , mami matsuda , was last seen there in 1991 , after his initial confession and subsequent arrest , mr sugaya said he spent weeks concocting increasingly complex stories about how he murdered mami and two other girls who had been killed in the 1980s mr sugaya , who said he had never really met any of the girls , said that at the time he was actually afraid that the police would discover he was lying and would start shouting at him again , a prospect he said paralyzed him with fear the police now admit that they missed glaring discrepancies between mr sugaya s fabricated accounts of the killings and actual evidence mr sugaya said he took the girl away on his bicycle a witness reported seeing a man lead her away on foot mr sugaya also failed to identify the sites where the bodies had been buried still , even when mr sugaya started to proclaim his innocence midway through his trial , judges , prosecutors and mr sugaya s own defense attorney ignored him , apparently in the belief that his initial confession was correct legal experts say this reflects the extreme importance that japanese prosecutors and courts still place on confessions mr sugaya said the question he is now asked the most is why he confessed so quickly to crimes he did not commit describing himself as insecure and excessively spineless , he said his willpower just seemed to collapse after what he said were hours of police officers screaming at him so loudly that his ears still ring 19 years later he said he finally confessed to all three killings just so the ordeal would end hiroshi sato , a defense lawyer who later took up mr sugaya s case , said another problem was misplaced faith in a rudimentary dna test that matched mr sugaya with sperm found on one of the murdered girls after years of fruitlessly petitioning courts for a retrial , mr sato finally won mr sugaya s freedom after a more advanced genetic test disproved the earlier result we 've had cases of false confessions before , but never one where the evidence was this clearcut , said akira kitani , a former judge who now teaches law at hosei university in tokyo the police said mistakes were made because they were under pressure to solve the murders of the three girls , which shook this quiet community the actual killer has never been found and could not be prosecuted now because japan has a statute of limitations in murder cases mr kitani said mr sugaya s release has prompted broader moves to hold retrials in several similar cases , including one involving a 1967 robberymurder in which two men were imprisoned based solely on confessions that they later recanted as part of his efforts to draw attention to false confessions , mr sugaya said he had visited that trial , which is now under way he said his presence in the courtroom was intended to spur the news media to report that the two men might be innocent still , he says , he finds his new prominence oppressively hard to escape on a recent afternoon , just walking across a parking lot , mr sugaya was stopped by uniformed attendants you 're sugayasan , are n't you \? asked one of the men before , i was famous for being a criminal , mr sugaya said a few moments later now i'm famous for being innocent he said the toughest part of his experience has been coming to terms with what he lost while in prison in particular , he said , he was never able to meet his parents again his father , a medicine salesman , died two weeks after the arrest , apparently of shock , mr sugaya said his mother refused to visit him in prison , and once told the police that she wished they would execute him so he could be sent home in a box she died three years ago , before her son was exonerated i wish i could explain to her what really happened , mr sugaya said , his voice breaking the only time during a twohour interview that touched on many painful topics mr sugaya said that he felt a growing anger , and that he had started having trouble sleeping because of flashbacks to his interrogation he also said that he had wanted to find some sort of closure by filing a lawsuit against the two detectives who forced him to confess , but that his lawyers and supporters advised against that because it could prove too emotionally traumatic in the end , i still end up blaming myself , mr sugaya said if i just had been a bit stronger in front of the police , none of this would have happened
ravens at patriots sunday , 1 pm \( cbs \) line patriots by 3 1 2 in 2000 , when tom brady was drew bledsoe s scrawny backup and patriots dynasty sounded ironic , ray lewis led the ravens to a super bowl victory brady and the patriots rose to prominence in the decade since , while the ravens became the afc s perennial agitators , always dangerous enough on defense and pesky enough on offense to act as playoff spoilers this year the ravens are stronger than their record , the patriots weaker than their reputation the patriots may have been better than the ravens in the regular season , but wes welker s injury leaves a once unstoppable offense without its most reliable weapon  patriots on offense wes welker made getting open over the middle look so easy that anyone could do it the rookie backup julian edelman is a welkclone , but edelman is a former college quarterback who is still learning the subtleties of route running he lacks the rhythm welker shared with brady the ravens will use welker s absence to take away the middle of the field , forcing the patriots to beat them with their running game and deep passes to randy moss safety ed reed is back in the ravens lineup , and while he acknowledges that he is only 80 to 85 percent healthy , he adds an intimidating presence over the deep middle if brady and moss cannot connect , a flag will be the next best thing for the patriots the ravens have committed 16 defensive passinterference penalties , most in the nfl ravens on offense the coordinator cam cameron opened up his offense this season , adding more diversity to a scheme that was all inside runs and long passes last year ray rice is one of the most dangerous screen pass receivers in the league , and joe flacco will look to rice to pick up first downs , even on thirdandlong the ravens still strive for a near 5050 runpass balance , and rice , willis mcgahee and le ron mcclain combined for 2 , 200 rushing yards this season , fifth in the nfl flacco has the league s strongest arm , and once the ravens establish the run , they will attack with deep passes along the sidelines the return of defensive linemen ty warren and vince wilfork will stabilize the patriots front seven , but the patriots secondary is vulnerable in oneonone coverage special teams notes ravens long snapper matt katula has been battling tendinitis , and some of his recent snaps have been off the mark billy cundiff has been more reliable than the kicker he replaced \( steve hauschka \) , but cundiff is 02 from beyond 50 yards julian edelman will replace wes welker as the

cardinals by 1 the cardinals don t step forward to win the nfc west they just wait for the competition to step back the cardinals once again rode one of the league s easiest schedules into the postseason , their flaws buried under a pile of 3110 and 273 wins over the rams and the seahawks the team s fishnorfowl approach to resting its starters in the season finale \( kurt warner rested , most others played \) left them with the worst of both worlds an ugly 337 loss , and injuries to key starters like anquan boldin  the packers overcame their earlyseason pass protection issues to become the hottest team in the nfc , winning seven of eight games they can beat any team in the nfl if they don t beat themselves with penalties and special teams mistakes packers on offense the packers like to spread the field , making it easy for aaron rodgers to read blitzes and find oneonone mismatches with cardinals cornerback dominique rodgerscromartie \( knee \) out or limited , the packers will try to isolate donald driver or greg jennings against the weak link in the defense tight end jermichael finley is a 6foot5 matchup nightmare who will can outrun linebackers and outmuscle most defensive backs without rodgerscromartie , the cardinals defense will be spread too thin to stop him if the cardinals cannot stop them , the packers can stop themselves they committed 18 offensive holding penalties this season cardinals on offense with boldin doubtful , the cardinals will count on their running game to take pressure off the top receiver larry fitzgerald the rookie chris wells excels at finding running room where none exists his fellow committee back tim hightower is more effective as a receiver fitzgerald can beat any defender in the league on shorttointermediate routes , so the packers will attack with cornerback blitzes from the side of the field opposite fitzgerald the cardinals lost a leaguehigh 18 fumbles this season , and the packers will look to strip the fumbleprone warner \( six fumbles \) , hightower \( four \) and the inexperienced wells \( two \) special teams notes the packers have the weakest special teams in the league

heaven knows the tired old new york art world could use a fresh story or two this summer it gets one , secondhand , in lush life , a big and unusually ingenious group show spread over nine galleries , all but one on the lower east side assembled by two independent curators , omar lopezchahoud and franklin evans , the show was inspired by the novel lush life , that doubled as a raymond chandleresque police drama and a picaresque homage to the lower east side , a neighborhood that was long an immigrant enclave and is now , increasingly , a yuppie playground mr price s story takes place almost entirely , which extend from , roughly , houston street south to canal , and from the bowery to the east river the at sue scott gallery , y gallery , collette blanchard gallery , lehmann maupin , salon 94 freemans , invisibleexports , scaramouche , eleven rivington and on stellar rays correspond to the nine chapters of the novel , and work in each refers , sometimes specifically , to the book s plot on an early fall night in 2002 , with the emergency mood induced by 9 11 still in the air , a young white man , a waiter in a local upscale barrestaurant , is shot and killed on eldridge street in a mugging attempted by an even younger black man from nearby public housing the killer runs off , and the rest of the book is basically about the hunt for him by a hardboiled but ruminative police detective from the neighborhood precinct needless to say , other streetsoiled characters enter the picture , as do images of bars , drugs , bereaved families and interrogation rooms along with repeated displays of racial conflict and police politics , there s a quasimystical apparition , a soup on of sex and the constant presence as an active personality more than as a passive backdrop of the neighborhood itself and its stratified histories the show at sue scott , chapter 1 whistle , serves , superbly , as a scene setter it opens with a short film by the danish artist nanna debois buhl about the lower east side , with jacob riis s centuryold photographs of subhuman poverty accompanied by the bland words of a contemporary tour guide and seen in the context of the novel , other works take on specific narrative dimensions a 2005 abstract painting by joanne greenbaum , with its linear webs , can be imagined as a bird seye map of the area , with alice o'malley s blurry , beautiful shots of bars and shops bringing us down to ground level david kramer has equipped the gallery with a functioning bar , and a piece by derrick adams stacked photographs of a black male head ornamented with silver brickwork patterning can be taken as a reference to the lowincome housing that surrounds relentlessly gentrifying terrain a rumored appearance of the virgin mary in a rivington street deli in reality nothing more than an accident of condensation on a freezer door makes for one of the novel s more sardonic early episodes and it is neatly suggested here by judi werthein s video of her own projected live figure of the virgin created in spain in 2006 the show wraps up with an installation by david shapiro of drawings , small sculptures and found objects spread out on a tarp like a sidewalk display , and with a wall sculpture by justen ladda a narrow lozenge of polished cedar called bluered night mirror , which can , with a little imagining , be taken as a bloodtinged reflection of the noirish lush life world if none of the other shows now open the one at eleven rivington makes its debut on thursday offer as many pointforpoint correspondences with the novel as this one does , there are still plenty of direct allusions to it for example , the dialogueintensive book s long second chapter is taken up primarily by the marathon police grilling of a coworker of the victim who is initially suspected of the shooting the chapter s real subject , though , is a broader one the slipperiness of truth although it is pretty clear that the man is innocent , the intersection of his own selfcentered fears and the need of the police to nail a perpetrator keeps the illusion of his guilt in play the corresponding exhibition , chapter 2 liar , at on stellar rays , alludes to the mistaken interrogation in an amusing video of polygraph performance by carol irving and in a bulky ezra johnson painting that consists of the words large doubt but the pieces by other artists tim davis , scott hug , elisabeth subrin touch on more generic truthsuspending elements , like addiction , money and celebrity , that not only swim through the book but are shaping the new lower east side at barely five pages , the novel s third chapter , first bird \( a few butterflies \) , is one of the shortest in it the young killer , tristan , sneaks back to his family s apartment after the murder and lies in bed listening to the cries of birds at dawn , a sound at once comforting and disturbing and the show at invisibleexports expands rather than merely illustrates the novel by pushing the bird imagery hard in nicholas di genova s ballpointpen drawing of freakish winged creatures in karen heagle s fantastic painting of vultures picking over fruit and in dana levy s ghostly video of live doves flocking and fluttering in a museum gallery filled with stuffed bird specimens it s easy to read in ms levy s video a visual metaphor of physical death and the migration of souls , which together form a theme of the book s fourth chapter and of the exhibition let it die at lehmann maupin robert beck has assembled the equivalent of a memorial street shrine outside the door ink drawings of skeletal figures by nina lola bachhuber and a tiny painting of a bedroom immolation by amy longeneckerbrown command the space inside the single most interesting work here , though , is tommy hartung s brilliantly edited video the story of edward holmes , which starts out as an adventure story of a white man exploring exotic lands and goes on to flaunt and scramble racial stereotypes and make valuefreighted categories like savagery and civilization seem indistinguishable race and racism loom large in mr price s book , and his handling of them is problematic , not as purposefully incendiary as tom wolfe s take in bonfire of the vanities but still cartoonishly reductive and here again , the show complicates and improves on the book in chapter 5 want cards , at y gallery \( a minute basement space on a 1980s east village model \) rudy shepherd s bustlength paintings of black men refer to mug shots of a kind found on socalled want cards but are still personable portraits in a crazyquilt installation at collette blanchard of photographs by robin graubard , almost all taken on the lower east side , drugs and alcohol are social levelers everyone , black and white , looks equally wasted in chapter 7 of the novel tristan is finally identified and arrested , and his gun , the murder weapon , feverishly sought throughout the book , is recovered it is also there in the matching show at salon 94 freemans in the form of a stretchedout sculpture by robert lazzarini but the saga is n't over the killer is a juvenile , a status that precludes a life sentence and reduces his potential prison time to a term calculated in the title of the book s penultimate chapter 17 plus 25 is 32 this is also the title of the chapter 8 show at scaramouche , where art imaginatively speculates on the past and future of this character , as the book does not with its spectacularly savory new york dialogue , the novel is stylistically addictive but purely as a narrative it has distinct limitations page by page it has the buzz of a readytogo film script but it also has a pat hollywood ending , with anodyne doses of redemption spread all around , shortcircuiting whatever moral complexity the story might have had art is , or can be , expert at creating complex stories , particularly moral dramas , of a kind that push beyond being mere eye candy for the investing classes this is not to say that lush life , the exhibition , ca n't be enjoyed or understood without a knowledge of lush life , the book the show may lose a level of impact if certain narrative cues are missed , but it will still get you walking the streets of a neighborhood that is , with continuing transformation , both a threat and a promise , a morality tale in itself
president obama hosted a luncheon on thursday for newly elected governors across the street from the white house at blair house , where he promised to work closely with them to fix the economy and improve education over the next two years but while ohio s incoming republican governor , john kasich , was among the nearly two dozen state chief executives at the lunch , the democrat he beat in november , gov ted strickland , was not left out in the cold in fact , he got a personal visit with the president hours earlier in the oval office , the only governor singled out for such special attention mr strickland has been an energetic ally for mr obama in an important battleground state and the president campaigned for him repeatedly this fall , albeit in vain an oval office visit may not be much of a consolation prize , but it was a public way for the president to show his appreciation and respect for a political friend who helped him out so much at the blair house lunch , mr obama and vice president joseph r biden jr vowed to put aside partisanship and work with the governors through the many issues now confronting them many in the audience were , like mr kasich , republicans who unseated democrats by running against mr obama and his initiatives , and some have vowed to resist his expansion of federal programs like the new health care law we have just had a very vigorously contested election , but the election is over , mr obama told them and now i think it s time for all of us to make sure that we 're working together i am a very proud democrat , as some of you in the room are although not as many as i had expected some of you are very proud republicans but we 're all prouder to be americans mr obama encouraged them to make their states laboratories for democracy but said there still must be basic national standards that everyone will have to meet he encouraged them to tell him what works and what does not contrary to the mythology , believe it or not , it turns out that i would love to eliminate programs that do n't work , he said and you guys are the ones oftentimes who are implementing them four new governors later told white house reporters that they welcomed his promises of cooperation and acknowledged that they do not expect much financial help from washington in meeting their own budget problems none of the 50 governors are living under the illusion that there s going to be hundreds of millions more dollars coming our way , said governorelect peter shumlin , democrat of vermont but despite the heated rhetoric during the campaign , the governors said none of them challenged mr obama directly during the closeddoor portion of the meeting governorelect dan malloy , democrat of connecticut , who criticized the white house after his election last month for doing a particularly weak job telling its side of the story , told reporters thursday that the blair house session was cordial i do n't think anyone engaged the president , he said none of us are members of the press this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo
the national rifle association has managed to carve itself a nice loophole in a bill that seeks to counter the supreme court s disastrous decision to give corporations free rein to dominate american politics we wish lawmakers had more spine , but the house still should approve the measure , which would impose disclosure mandates on the shadowy propaganda drives that will likely flood the hustings from deeppocketed corporate , labor and specialinterest groups we keep hoping the democratic majority in congress will muster the courage to rise above callow survival politics and stand up to the gun lobby in the cause of public safety it ought to happen in the final house deliberations on this new bill but even if it does not , the overall legislation offers a greater good the nation dearly needs the pending disclose reform requires transparency from the powers financing the expected wave of heightened attack and support ads even mandating fat cats to identify themselves in commercials indulging their new freedom to spend without limit spending would be restricted for corporations that have major government contracts or foreign controls and disclosure would be mandated for political front groups and money megamachines already being set up by such operatives as karl rove , the bush campaign guru none of these protections will be enacted if opponents succeed in using the nra exemption as an excuse to not act at all the exemption defines a handful of nonprofits , including the aarp retirement group , that are at least 10 years old with more than one million active members , no more than 15 percent corporate support and no corporate or union money behind campaign spending at that , the nra would still have to identify authorship of its ads , if not donors fearful lawmakers , including progun democrats , insist that denying the nra this exemption would prompt the gun lobby to fiercely oppose the bill and their reelections it s pitiful that republicans are nearly unanimous in fighting any manner of real reform and hypocritically denouncing backroom dealing for the nra lacking the courage to dismiss the nra gamesmanship , congress must still protect voters by mandating transparency in time for the next election

one of the biggest areas of contention in the online privacy debate is whether online advertisers have the ability to regulate themselves sufficiently privacy advocates claim that privacy policies are not enough to inform consumers about an advertiser s data collection practices because they are complex documents that users don t read the advertising industry recently announced the details of a selfregulatory program that includes the use of an icon that would give users information about an ad and the option to optout of having their data collected for targeted advertising and now , just ahead of two reports that are expected to be issued by the commerce department and the federal trade commission on online privacy , two recent studies are trying to prove that icons are effective the first was a joint study between truste , a company that produces privacy policies and seals , and publishers clearing house over the course of six months , truste placed an icon near the ads that were featured on the publishers clearing house web site , pchlottocom  when a user clicked on an icon , they were taken to a popup window explaining interestbased ads , which are ads that a user sees based on their web history , and advertising networks , which connect advertisers with web sites it also offered a threestep process the learn more about the ads , set preferences to optout of interestbased ads and give feedback to truste about the process during the sixmonth period , the widget was displayed to approximately 20 million consumers and had seven million unique visitors it was accessed 56 , 000 times with 44 , 000 unique views according to the results , more than half of the people who saw the icon and clicked through to the control panel and said they found the notice helpful but the real news for truste and for advertisers was that very few visitors , 11 percent , chose to optout of all advertising networks the clickthrough rate on the icon was 25 percent higher than the clickthrough rate on privacy policies , said fran maier , the president of truste this is to tell industry , do a good job on this , because its really not going to hurt your business , ms maier said publishers clearing house plans to expand the test to it s main web site , pchcom , and to it s gaming web site , pchgamescom according to sal tripi , the senior director of operations and compliance at publishers clearing house , none of the advertisers that advertise on the site raised objections to having the icon placed near their ads if you re doing business with publishers clearing house this is the way we do business , and we prefer to be on the fully transparent side of it , mr tripi said another study conducted by better advertising , who provides the privacy icon technology for the digital advertising alliance , and the research firm dynamic logic analyzed a panel of 1 , 600 people and how they reacted to the icon the results showed that half of the respondents like having ads tailored to them but have a strong need to know they are targets the level of transparency and control accrues really positive benefits to the brands that take this extra step , said scott meyer , the president and chief executive at better advertising according to the results , 67 percent of respondents felt better about brands when they were given more control by those brands , including the ability to optout the time to get on board with the self regulation program is now , mr meyer said the company is the first approved provider of the of the digital advertising alliance the alliance is also in the process of approving truste as an official provider and is considering extending a partnership to the privacy companies preference central and double verify the digital advertising alliance is comprised of trade organizations including the american association of advertising agencies , the american advertising federation , the association of national advertisers , the direct marketing association and the interactive advertising bureau , with additional support from the council of better business bureaus
washington as incomes fell across america over the past decade , new census data show that one place registered a remarkable rise the nation s capital washington , long a symbol of the country s urban ills , is now among the national leaders in income growth it ranks first among states with gains in median household income and third among the country s 100 biggest cities , surpassed only by atlanta , and arlington , va , an affluent enclave there are more people in the city with graduate degrees than with just a high school diploma , and its share of graduate degree holders increased faster than in any other major city the number of households earning more than 100 , 000 grew four times faster than overall population in the same period though the federal government has always been a stable source of jobs here , the data show that the private sector including consultancies , contractors and lobbying and legal firms created most of the new jobs workers who identified themselves as managers and professionals jumped by nearly a third over the decade the economic boom did not lift everybody about a third of the census tracts , areas of between 3 , 000 and 5 , 000 residents , registered income declines during the decade , including many that were already poor to begin with unemployment for residents with only a high school diploma more than doubled over the decade to 19 percent in 2009 , the highest in 30 years , according to the dc fiscal policy institute , an economic research group the decade also brought black employment to a grim low by 2009 , only 49 percent of black adults in the city were employed , down from 56 percent in 2000 , according to the institute that was down from 62 percent in 1988 the figure includes the elderly , so full employment would be around 80 percent it s the classic story of a rising tide that is not lifting all boats , said ed lazere , policy director at the institute there are a lot of residents not able to connect with the city s economic engine and the city s becoming more expensive around them the changes have aggravated the widespread disparities in a city that is both the american seat of power and home to some of its poorest neighborhoods among the nation s 100 most populous cities , washington ranked seventh in in 2009 , according to the  the influx of affluent new residents has resulted in a sweeping pattern of gentrification of poor neighborhoods by a welleducated , mostly white class that fled cities en masse decades ago over all , the city s white population is up by a quarter , while its black population declined by 7 percent it was second only to atlanta in terms of increase in the share of its white population over the last decade similar transformations are happening in other major cities , but few with the pace of the capital s one area in the city with a sharp influx of whites was around u and 14th streets , a stretch of blocks that are important for africanamerican heritage duke ellington s childhood home was nearby , as was the first luxury hotel for africanamericans in one tract in the area , the white population jumped by 1 , 500 , while the black population stayed the same , according to census estimates the bureau also estimated the tract s median household income rose nearly 80 percent , with the number of households earning at least 100 , 000 jumping from 250 to more than 900 another tract a few blocks south and east had the city s largest gain of whites 794 it lost 350 blacks in the same period the decade brought change first a whole foods moved in on p and 14th streets then starbucks today wine bars and fancy restaurants pulse with people , and glittering home furnishings stores replaced scruffy secondhand stores on 14th street whole foods now looks out onto a runningclothes shop , a designer eyeglasses store called blink , and a gelateria this used to be all black here , said tom fouche , 47 , who lives at the central union mission , a wellknown homeless shelter on 14th street now i call it upper georgetown , he said , referring to an affluent , largely white neighborhood to the west it s more preppy with more stuff to do u street s urban feel is its principal draw for many young people who have moved to washington john grainger , a scientist from britain , chose to live in the u street neighborhood , instead of near his work at the national institute for health in bethesda , md , because , at 29 , he wanted to experience the city it s great , said mr grainger , holding a container with his dinner at the whole foods salad bar it s easier to socialize , and there s lots to do but the development has come at a cost prices around the city are rising , making life for mr fouche , who used to work finishing floors , more complicated i'm broke , he said prices are so high i have to eat mr fouche applied for many jobs recently , at target , safeway , giant and home depot , but none of them called back a cleaning company told him he was hired , but the contract was canceled a few days later his frustrations point to another effect of gentrification with highly educated people flooding into the city the rise in the number of graduate degree holders outstripped the rate for new high school graduates by a factor of 10 in the decade less educated people are being displaced even from unskilled jobs , in a phenomenon mr lazere calls the gentrification of the labor market michael beirne , 23 , who graduated from the university of california , santa cruz with a music and math major , now works scooping gelato in the shop across from whole foods a job in music , he said , would require practicing 10 hours a day , and a job in math would require a doctorate i was lucky to find this , he said , standing in the shop on a frigid thursday but the city is still a draw dukes wooters , 28 , moved to washington from new york after losing his job at an insurance company that was associated with lehman brothers he worked for a while as an intern for a congressman , but pays the bills with a job at a sportswear store his dream , he said , is politics and he is not leaving anytime soon i do n't want to move , he said i 've lived in a lot of cities in the northeast but this is the first city where i could see myself staying
washington nearly a dozen current or former lawmakers have been honored by university endowments financed in part by corporations with business before congress , posing some potential conflicts like that attributed to representative charles b rangel in an house ethics complaint the donations from businesses to the endowments ranged from modest amounts to millions of dollars , federal records show and the lawmakers , who include powerful committee chairmen or party leaders , often pushed legislation or special appropriations sought by the corporations an endowed chair at the university of hawaii honoring senator daniel k inouye , the hawaii democrat and chairman of the senate appropriations committee , was financed in part by 100 , 000 from a cruise ship line that the senator helped with legislation allowing it to expand its american ports of call a program at south carolina state university named for representative james e clyburn , the thirdranking house democrat and a key backer of legislation to promote new nuclear power plants , stands to benefit from donations by fluor and duke energy , which want to build plants and an endowment at the university of louisville intended as a tribute to senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky , the republican minority leader , has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from a military contractor that later got a 12 million earmark sponsored by the senator companies and lawmakers defend the donations as simply contributions to a good cause , but critics charge that they are a way for businesses to influence lawmakers in addition to campaign contributions , and without the limits or required disclosures it is another way to curry favor and a less visible one , said melanie sloan , executive director of citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington but it can perhaps be even more effective , because the sums can be much vaster , and it really feeds the members' vanity as these centers are something that will last in perpetuity mr mcconnell and other lawmakers reject any similarity to mr rangel s activities , and say the donations have no bearing on their conduct any efforts to draw comparisons with mr rangel are absurd , said don stewart , a mcconnell spokesman , who added that the senator s support for any earmarks was unrelated to donations it is without similarity whatsoever none of the dozen lawmakers appear to have linked their office to the endowments as closely as mr rangel , the new york democrat , is accused of doing by a house ethics panel mr rangel , who has been forced to step down as chairman of the ways and means committee , used congressional letterhead to send out solicitation letters urging companies with business before his panel to donate to a program honoring him at the city university of new york he even discussed the legislative matters at meetings where he was soliciting donations , according to the house ethics complaint in at least one case , he helped a donor get a requested tax break mr mcconnell , though , like mr rangel , met with business leaders to solicit contributions to his center , an aide said , adding that the fundraising effort ended before he became senate minority leader in 2007 senator edward m kennedy of massachusetts , while in office , also personally hosted a fundraising dinner , soliciting contributions for an oralhistory program that will be part of his institute several of the university programs including those honoring mr clyburn and former speaker j dennis hastert , republican of illinois are intended to include the lawmakers' archives , which the house ethics committee in the rangel case has called a personal benefit to the congressman there is no comprehensive list of these programs , since members of congress are not required to disclose them several lawmakers and universitiesdeclined requests by the new york times and other newspapers to reveal a full list of donors or fundraising events that the members of congress participated in the times survey focused on endowments or educational programs established while the lawmakers were still in office there are no limits on such memorials being created after a member of congress retires or dies education officials involved in creating these centers said they had been amazed at how quickly they had been able to raise money for programs named for a sitting member of congress at the university of hawaii , 16 million was donated in the first month of fundraising for the endowed chair honoring mr inouye and his wife , a record for the university more than 25 of the donors government contractors , banks , insurance and telecommunications companies gave at least 25 , 000 , far more than would be permitted in a single year of campaign contributions an aide to mr inouye said the donations had no influence on his legislative positions some gifts have come in extremely large chunks like the 1 million donated in 2005 by northrop grumman , the miltary contractor , to help establish the trent lott national center at the university of southern mississippi mr lott , a republican from mississippi , served in the senate until 2007
bangkok is a country of 145 , 000 mercedes benz sedans and about 75 , 000 villages , many of them hamlets afflicted by poverty during nearly three weeks of mass antigovernment demonstrations here , luxury cars have had to share the streets of bangkok with the blaring megaphones of rural discontent standing in the back of a pickup truck and shaded by a widebrimmed hat was thanida paveen , a 43yearold mother of two who explained the epiphany that brought her to the demonstration i used to think we were born poor and that was that , said ms thanida , who grew up in the provinces but now lives in bangkok and rents out rooms to factory workers in the city s industrial outskirts i have opened my mind to a new way of thinking we need to change from the rule of the aristocracy to a real democracy the thailand of today is not quite the france of 1789 there is no history of major tensions between rich and poor here , and most of the country is peaceful despite the noisy protests but more than ever thailand s underprivileged are less inclined to quietly accept their station in life as past generations did and are voicing anger about wide disparities in wealth , about shakedowns by the police and what they see as the longstanding condescension in bangkok toward people who speak provincial dialects , especially from the northeast the deference , gentility and graciousness that have helped anchor the social hierarchy in thailand for centuries are fraying , analysts say , as poorer thais become more assertive , discarding longheld taboos that discouraged confrontation the haves in thailand have a lot the country has one of the most inequitable income distributions in asia , a wider gap between rich and poor than in china , malaysia , the philippines or vietnam , according to a world bank report four years of political turmoil have brought clearer divisions between wealthy families and their domestic staff , between the patrons of expensive restaurants and the waiters who serve them , between golfing businessmen and the legions of caddies who carry their bags this is a newfound consciousness of a previously neglected part of thai society , said thitinan pongsudhirak , one of the country s leading political scientists and a visiting scholar at stanford university s fsihumanities center in the past they were upset , but they were n't cohesive as a force and coherent in their agenda new technologies have enabled them to unify their disparate voices of dissatisfaction the role of technology in bringing together the protesters has been crucial the leaders of the protest movement have used community radio stations , mobilephone messaging and the internet to forge an identity for lowerincome thais and connect a vast constellation of people in villages and towns at times the protests in bangkok could be described as flash mobs of the disaffected protesters , who wear trademark red shirts , have converged on government buildings , banks and military bases across the city guided by text messages this would not have been possible 10 years ago , said ms thanida , who was returning from military barracks in bangkok where protesters had demanded that soldiers leave the area the military acquiesced like many protesters , she subscribes to d station , a red shirt news service that gives updates and instructions to protesters the leaders of the redshirted protesters have advertised the current round of protests as class warfare and describe themselves as defenders of the prai , a feudal word meaning commoner or lowerclass citizen the blood of the prai is worth nothing is a phrase now affixed on bumper stickers and tshirts that may be overblown rhetoric there are many stories of upward mobility in thailand and , despite the presence of tens of thousands of protesters , the anger has not translated into personal attacks on the wealthy the main target of the protesters' ire seems to be the system the perception that bureaucrats and the military serve the elite at the expense of the poor the protesters bewail the 2006 military coup that removed thaksin shinawatra , the tycoon turned prime minister who focused his policies on rural areas and they question the fairness of a judicial system that removed two subsequent prime ministers who were allied with mr thaksin to many outsiders , mr thaksin s role is puzzling the notion that a billionaire is leading thailand s disaffected to rebellion verges on the absurd it also infuriates the bangkok elite , who see mr thaksin s role as largely selfserving mr thaksin , most analysts agree , was hardly a paragon of democratic values during his five years in power he intimidated the media , stripped institutions like the anticorruption commission of their independence and mixed his business interests with those of the government many protesters , as well as associates of mr thaksin , say the protest movement has taken on much larger dimensions than just a battle between mr thaksin and his political rivals this goes well beyond thaksin , said pansak vinyaratn , one of the main architects of policies during the thaksin administration the question is , will the thai state be able to harness this negative energy to something positive it is significant that mr thaksin made his fortunes in the telecommunications business even his critics concede that he was able to communicate with the rural poor and deliver results in ways that none of his predecessors had achieved as prime minister , he gave lowerincome thais a taste of a better life , including cheap loans that allowed people to buy pickups and mobile phones , which inadvertently or not laid the groundwork for the current political movement in 2005 , after four years of mr thaksin as prime minister , the number of people using mobile phones in the vast , ricegrowing northeast had more than doubled to 53 million incomes in the northeast rose nearly 50 percent during the thaksin government and even more in the provinces east and south of bangkok the protesters today are not the country s desperately poor , says ammar siamwalla , a prominent economist in thailand who specializes in development issues they are more likely to be people whose expectations were raised and then dashed they started small businesses like hair salons in the thaksin years when more money started circulating in rural areas , mr ammar said it jumpstarted a lot of things after the coup in 2006 , these smalltime entrepreneurs were stuck they were suddenly caught short by the lack of access to credit , said mr ammar , who is otherwise critical of mr thaksin s rule debt levels in the northeast doubled to an average of about 100 , 000 baht , or just over 3 , 000 , per family today rural families still carry this debt , but their incomes are relatively stagnant , in part because crop prices were deflated by last year s economic crisis beyond the economics , there is an intangible side to thailand s political crisis that may be even more significant for the country in the long run the once deeply ingrained cultural mores that discouraged displays of anger , that prized politeness and justified the entitlements of the royalty and the elite have been eroded by technology and mobility the prime minister , abhisit vejjajiva , rarely visits the northeastern part of the country because his aides fear a hostile reception \( mr abhisit has been ensconced in a military barracks in bangkok for much of the past two weeks \) another group of protesters , the yellow shirts , who helped precipitate mr thaksin s ouster with their own demonstrations , held the country hostage by shutting down the airport for a week in late 2008 , a protest that stranded hundreds of thousands of travelers the traditional restraints on aggressive and argumentative behavior the buddhist clergy and a once deeply held fear of bad karma , among other factors have been weakened , says william j klausner , an expert on thai culture and buddhism who has studied village life since he moved to thailand in the 1950s villagers today feel far less inclined to accord deference and respect to those in authority simply because of their privileged position and perceived sense of entitlement , mr klausner wrote in an essay many thais say they are shocked by the coarse language used by political activists of all stripes today insults that were once rarely heard in public have become common thailand appears to be losing a small part of what has long attracted millions of tourists to its shores a culture of unflappable , bendoverbackwards politeness pakawan malayavech , a 55yearold native of a northeastern province , reflected on these changes as she walked through a crowd of tens of thousands of redshirted protesters recently she left thailand as a young woman for the united states , where she drove a good humor ice cream truck in fairfax , virginia , and did other odd jobs then , in 1999 , she returned to retire , and now she sees the country like frames in timelapse photography people used to forgive and forget easily , she said now the new generation are more like americans they talk back
washington in the late 1950s , after poverty near the capitol became a national embarrassment , blocks of old row houses in the southwest waterfront district here were bulldozed in a radical slumclearing effort built in their place were several crisp apartment blocks by i m pei and a pair of angular brick theaters by the chicago architect harry weese , who later designed washington s metro stations the theaters , home to the arena stage company , were soon beloved by architecture buffs for their taut geometry , and by theater buffs for layouts encouraging artistic experimentation but the neighborhood continued to languish as recently as 2001 , the architect bing thom recalls , cabdrivers did n't want to take me there arena , meanwhile , had grown into one of the country s most prominent regional theaters , and its trustees wanted to move it to a larger space in a better neighborhood in 1999 they even chose a location , in the growing entertainment district of northwest washington but several board members protested the plan to abandon the southwest after they prevailed , the theater was left with the problems of the original weese complex , including a shortage of public spaces and little room for backofthehouse operations enter mr thom , a hong kongborn architect who has worked in vancouver , british columbia , for 40 years mr thom , 69 , was one of 50 architects the board considered , but he made a strong impression on the theater s artistic director , molly smith \( for one thing , he asked for a copy of its mission statement , something none of the architects thought to do , she said \) mr thom proposed maintaining the two original buildings and adding a smaller third theater , beneath a massive cantilevered roof that meant they would become objects in a larger composition a kind of threering circus under a big top the arrangement recalls the kennedy center , two miles away , which also joins performance spaces under one huge roof but it is covered in inchthick marble mr thom s 100 million complex , which officially opens oct 23 , has clear glass walls , giant timbers and exposed concrete floors , which make it seem almost informal i came here thinking 'washington takes itself too seriously it has to loosen up a bit , ' mr thom said in an interview and open up a bit mr thom conceived of the new arena stage building , he said , as a shortcut for the community on one side of the building is a connection to the waterfront , he said the other side is a connection to the subway when the doors are open , people can treat the theater as part of the public circulation of the city it s not balkanized private space zelda fichandler , a founder of arena stage in 1950 who was its artistic director for 40 years , said the two small theaters have never looked better than they do from the elevated circulation spaces mr thom created they 're gorgeous forms that harry weese designed before , they were so close that you could n't take them in now i love looking down on them and seeing them as sculptures but mr thom s biggest achievement may be the third structure , the kogod cradle , a blackbox theater that is anything but a box an elliptical space paneled in darkstained wood , it feels almost spiritual it can be a forest , it can be a ship , it can be a church , ms smith said of the interior just getting into it is a theatrical experience mr thom created an entrance that is probably like no other a passageway that curves along the outside of the performance space , following nearly three quarters of the ellipse , its torqued walls recalling the work of richard serra i wanted to have people go from the big spaces into this space and lose their memory in the journey , mr thom said he first came to southwest washington in the mid 1960s as a student at the university of british columbia he was touring with other canadian architecture students , seeing united states landmarks , but what made a real impression was seeing block after block of cruel urban renewal it was more than 30 years later that he received the arena commission and began thinking about how the theater could help heal the neighborhood when he was presenting his plans to anthony williams , then the city s mayor , he said , he was asked to help with a plan for sections of the city near the anacostia river these days mr thom remains involved in that effort , unofficially , partly to ensure that planned apartment buildings do n't block arena s views \( he had to leave an interview recently to press his point with the city government \) this year he picked up another large commission in the area , after donald and mera rubell , the miami hoteliers and art collectors , saw arena stage they paid 65 million for a historic school building a few blocks away and hired mr thom to turn it into a contemporaryart museum and hotel and condominium complex ms rubell , who is used to promoting the work of unknown artists , asked him later why are n't you famous \? i ca n't afford to have you not be famous \( reached by phone in aspen , colo , she added it s a joy to discover a young talent it s a triple , a quadruple , joy to discover a talent who is n't necessarily young \) in canada , mr thom is known mostly for public buildings like the vancouver aquarium and the chan center for the performing arts at the university of british columbia his projects in the united states have included a campus for tarrant county college , in fort worth , completed last year , and a master plan for reusing a former industrial section of that city he said that working on american projects like these is a dream , a step toward fulfilling another dream , to design cities in china at meetings potential clients in china have asked , why should we be your guinea pigs \? mr thom said if i can do a major building in the capital of the us , maybe when i go back to china , they will listen to me for all his concern about the urbanistic qualities of his work , mr thom is focused on the details during a preopening tour of the building he indicated the giant carpet in the lobby , designed by his wife , bonnie thom , in a range of colors if someone spills red wine , it does n't matter , he noted cheerfully in the ladies' room he pointed to a ledge behind the sinks , where members of the theater company will place framed pictures , helping to bridge the gap between the audience and performers he also tries to bridge that gap in his new theater , where he insisted that the seats be on concrete platforms , rather than movable risers when the actors come out , they need to feel , instantly , like the audience is n't falling away , he said , but that it s right there with them and the neighborhood , he said , should feel the same way about arena stage , which is n't going anywhere in the foreseeable future i sometimes analogize a city to a string of pearls , he said as an architect i'm as interested in the string as in the pearls photos above , the spiraling hallway entering the kogod cradle , the new , intimate theater added to the arena stage building left , an early model by mr thom of the former elizabeth g randall junior high school in southwestwashington , soon to be a combined contemporary art museum and hotel and condominium complex \( photograph by colin goldie productions nic lehoux bing thom architects \) above , the architect bing thom , and , top , a view of his renovation of the arena stage theater complex in southwestwashington the structure now houses three performance spaces and connects with a metro station and the potomac waterfront near right , a detail revealing its wood and glass components \( photographs by drew angerer the new york times nic lehoux bing thom architects \) maps
cortland , ny all sunday afternoon , carried pillows , monogrammed luggage and flatscreen televisions into their dormitory , stocking this temporary training camp abode with every last item except the belongings of their best player , cornerback darrelle revis he skipped the camp arrival and team conditioning test , and still dominated all discussions with confirmation of his holdout in fact , both sides dug in deeper sunday the jets held their first team meeting without revis and said his camp rejected three offers in the past three days teammates said they could win without him revis s representatives , who believe the opposite , indicated he would not report to camp until he reached a new deal one agent , jonathan feinsod , said we waited until the last possible minute with hope of getting something done darrelle will not be there general manager mike tannenbaum said , it s hard to say what s going to happen next so the jets find themselves saddled with the greatest of expectations , brimming with optimism , so confident in their aspirations that they teammates echoed the sentiment of receiver braylon edwards all afternoon when he said , anything short of the obvious is failure amid the peddled positives , revis s absence stood out sunday the jets ended weeks of silence between the camps late thursday night , with a phone call to gauge whether revis planned on holding out between then and sunday , tannenbaum said , the jets made three offers a longterm deal , a shortterm solution and a facetoface meeting to talk further all three , tannenbaum said , were rebuffed the jets and revis agree that he outplayed his current contract they also agree that the contract has three years remaining the disagreement centers on total compensation revis wants to be paid more than nnamdi asomugha , the oakland cornerback who signed a threeyear , 453 million deal before last season revis , a player whom coach rex ryan routinely calls the best defensive player in the , wants to be compensated , not just complimented those close to revis described his holdout as a deliberate , thorough , thoughtout decision , one he did not reach overnight revis did hold out before his rookie year , but he has not been a lockerroom headache he is not , as defensive tackle kris jenkins said , the kind of guy who brings negative attention on himself but with three years remaining on revis s contract , his leverage consists almost entirely of his absence he is scheduled to make 1 million this season , or less than seven defensive backs on the jets \( he did receive some 15 million in the first three years of his deal , though \) teammates said that revis also paid close attention to what happened to running back leon washington last season revis remains friends with washington , and last august , after his camp holdout lasted only a few hours , washington reported to camp without a new deal in place washington and was traded in the offseason every jets player took note of that situation , linebacker david harris said cornerback dwight lowery added every player thinks about how that went down it showed that you can never predict the future you have to get what you can , when you can just hearing that they 'll take care of you is n't enough by holding out , revis effectively turned his salary for 2011 and 2012 , a total of 20 million , from guaranteed to nonguaranteed he is also subject to a daily 16 , 000 fine , and if he does not show up by aug 10 , he will lose an accrued season given all of that , revis still thought that playing this season for 1 million presented the biggest risk of all he has scoffed at the amount of guaranteed money \( very little \) the jets have offered he knows that this is an uncapped season , that next season is not guaranteed that only adds to the uncertainty we do n't know if there s going to be a season next year , fullback tony richardson said , alluding to a work stoppage i'm sure that plays into it that s on the horizon we ca n't act like it s not there all signs are pointing toward a lockout that said , richardson is entering his 16th season , and in none of his previous stops can he recall a holdout that actually affected his team in a given season he understands the hype , understands why revis s absence is a story , but richardson added , it always gets worked out most other players arrived sunday edwards wore an impressive beard running back ladainian tomlinson had a jets tattoo inked on his calf mark sanchez pronounced his surgically repaired knee recovered a circus act , jenkins called the scene ryan and tannenbaum received their own extensions in recent months , as did left tackle d'brickashaw ferguson revis , harris and center nick mangold , among others , want new deals asked about offfield extensions , mangold joked , i hope they 're working down the totem pole
washington the federal gave permission to and dozens of other companies to drill in the gulf of mexico without first getting required permits from another agency that assesses threats to endangered species and despite strong warnings from that agency about the impact the drilling was likely to have on the gulf those approvals , federal records show , include one for the well drilled by the deepwater horizon rig , which exploded on april 20 , killing 11 workers and resulting in thousands of barrels of oil spilling into the gulf each day the , or mms , also routinely overruled its staff biologists and engineers who raised concerns about the safety and the environmental impact of certain drilling proposals in the gulf and in alaska , according to a halfdozen current and former agency scientists those scientists said they were also regularly pressured by agency officials to change the findings of their internal studies if they predicted that an accident was likely to occur or if wildlife might be harmed under the and the , the minerals management service is required to get permits to allow drilling where it might harm endangered species or marine mammals the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , or noaa , is partly responsible for protecting endangered species and marine mammals it has said on that drilling in the gulf affects these animals , but the minerals agency since january 2009 has approved at least three huge lease sales , 103 seismic blasting projects and 346 drilling plans agency records also show that permission for those projects and plans was granted without getting the permits required under federal law mms has given up any pretense of regulating the offshore oil industry , said kier n suckling , director of the , an environmental advocacy group in tucson , which filed notice of intent to sue the agency over its noncompliance with federal law concerning endangered species the agency seems to think its mission is to help the oil industry evade environmental laws kendra barkoff , a spokeswoman for the interior department , said her agency had full consultations with noaa about endangered species in the gulf but she declined to respond to additional questions about whether her agency had obtained the relevant permits federal records indicate that these consultations ended with noaa instructing the minerals agency that continued drilling in the gulf was harming endangered marine mammals and that the agency needed to get permits to be in compliance with federal law responding to the accusations that agency scientists were being silenced , ms barkoff added , under the previous administration , there was a pattern of suppressing science in decisions , and we are working very hard to change the culture and empower scientists in the department of the interior on tuesday , interior secretary ken salazar announced plans to reorganize the minerals agency to improve its regulatory role by separating safety oversight from the division that collects royalties from oil and gas companies but that reorganization is not likely to have any bearing on how and whether the agency seeks required permits from other agencies like noaa criticism of the minerals agency has grown in recent days as more information has emerged about how it handled drilling in the gulf , obtained by the new york times , noaa accused the minerals agency of a pattern of understating the likelihood and potential consequences of a major spill in the gulf and understating the frequency of spills that have already occurred there the letter accuses the agency of highlighting the safety of offshore oil drilling operations while overlooking more recent evidence to the contrary the data used by the agency to justify its approval of drilling operations in the gulf play down the fact that spills have been increasing and understate the risks and impacts of accidental spills , the letter states noaa declined several requests for comment the accusation that the minerals agency has ignored risks is also being levied by scientists working for the agency managers at the agency have routinely overruled staff scientists whose findings highlight the environmental risks of drilling , according to a halfdozen current or former agency scientists the scientists , none of whom wanted to be quoted by name for fear of reprisals by the agency or by those in the industry , said they had repeatedly had their scientific findings changed to indicate no environmental impact or had their calculations of spill risks downgraded you simply are not allowed to conclude that the drilling will have an impact , said one scientist who has worked for the minerals agency for more than a decade if you find the risks of a spill are high or you conclude that a certain species will be affected , your report gets disappeared in a desk drawer and they find another scientist to redo it or they rewrite it for you another biologist who left the agency in 2005 after more than five years said that agency officials went out of their way to accommodate the oil and gas industry he said , for example , that seismic activity from drilling can have a devastating effect on mammals and fish , but that agency officials rarely enforced the regulations meant to limit those effects he also said the agency routinely ceded to the drilling companies the responsibility for monitoring species that live or spawn near the drilling projects what i observed was mms was trying to undermine the monitoring and mitigation requirements that would be imposed on the industry , he said aside from allowing bp and other companies to drill in the gulf without getting the required permits from noaa , the minerals agency has also given bp and other drilling companies in the gulf blanket exemptions from having to provide environmental impact statements much as bp s drilling plan asserted that there was no chance of an , the company also claimed in federal documents that its drilling would not have any adverse effect on endangered species the gulf is known for its biodiversity various endangered species are found in the area where the deepwater horizon was drilling , including sperm whales , blue whales and fin whales in some instances , the minerals agency has indeed sought and received permits in the gulf to harm certain endangered species like green and loggerhead sea turtles but the agency has not received these permits for endangered species like the sperm and humpback whales , which are more common in the areas where drilling occurs and thus are more likely to be affected tensions between scientists and managers at the agency erupted in one case last year involving a rig in the gulf called the bp atlantis an agency scientist complained to his bosses of catastrophic safety and environmental violations the scientist said these complaints were ignored , so he took his concerns to higher officials at the interior department the purpose of this letter is to restate in writing our concern that the bp atlantis project presently poses a threat of serious , immediate , potentially irreparable and catastrophic harm to the waters of the gulf of mexico and its marine environment , and to summarize how bp s conduct has violated federal law and regulations , david l perry , a lawyer acting on behalf of kenneth abbott , a bp contractor , to officials at the interior department that was dated may 27 the letter added from our conversation on the phone , we understand that mms is already aware that undersea manifolds have been leaking and that major flow lines must already be replaced failure of this critical undersea equipment has potentially catastrophic environmental consequences almost two months before the deepwater horizon exploded , representative ra l m grijalva , democrat of arizona , sent a letter to the agency raising concerns about the bp atlantis and questioning its oversight of the rig after the disaster , mr salazar said he would delay granting any new oil drilling permits but the minerals agency has issued at least to new drilling projects in the gulf since last week , records show despite being shown records indicating otherwise , ms barkoff said her agency had granted no new permits since mr salazar made his announcement other agencies besides noaa have begun criticizing the minerals agency at a public hearing in louisiana this week , a joint panel of coast guard and minerals management service officials investigating the explosion grilled minerals agency officials for allowing the industry to be essentially selfcertified , as capt hung nguyen of the coast guard , a cochairman of the investigation , put it in addition to the minerals agency and the coast guard , the deepwater horizon was overseen by the marshall islands , the flag of convenience under which it was registered no one from the marshall islands ever inspected the rig the nongovernmental organizations that did were paid by the rig s operator , in this case

london a demonstration against government proposals to cut education spending and steeply increase tuition for university students turned violent on wednesday as protesters attempted to storm the building that houses the conservative party the protesters scuffled with police officers , set off flares , burned placards , threw eggs , bottles and other projectiles and shattered windows at the building , 30 millbank , in westminster a small group of demonstrators , some of whose faces were obscured by ski masks , climbed to the roof of a nearby building , waving anarchist flags and chanting tory scum the protest was dispersed about 10 pm fourteen people , including seven police officers , were injured , none of them seriously , the authorities said thirtyfive people were arrested an estimated 52 , 000 people from across the country also massed near parliament on wednesday to condemn the government s education proposals , which would allow universities to charge 6 , 000 , or 9 , 600 , to 9 , 000 , or 14 , 400 , in tuition a year , up from a cap of 3 , 290 , or 5 , 264 the protest was the largest street demonstration against the government s plans , which were , to cut public spending by 130 billion by 2015 unions and public employees have promised more demonstrations and strikes , particularly as details of the cuts become clear tuition is a politically sensitive subject in , where universities are heavily subsidized by the government until the late 1990s , when the labour government introduced tuition , students paid nothing to attend college the current government , a coalition of conservatives and liberal democrats that has ushered in an age of budget austerity , has announced plans to cut teaching grants to universities and said it had no choice but to raise tuition that has presented a dilemma for liberal democrats the more vulnerable members of the coalition who made abolishing university tuition a core element of their platform in the general election last spring joining the conservatives in proposing tuition increases has been hard for many liberal democrats their leader , deputy prime minister nick clegg , was taunted wednesday in the house of commons by members of the opposition labour party in april he said that increasing tuition fees to 7 , 000 a year would be a disaster , harriet harman , the deputy leader of the opposition , said of mr clegg what word would he use to describe fees of 9 , 000 \? accusing him of going along with tory plans to shove the cost of higher education onto students and their families , ms harman told mr clegg that he was like a college freshman who meets a dodgy bloke during the first week of classes and you do things that you regret is n't it true he has been led astray by the tories \? she asked mr clegg responded that he had to make compromises as part of a coalition , and because the country s finances had been left in such poor shape by the previous government but , he said , he had prevailed on the conservatives to make the proposals fairer and more progressive under the plan , students would borrow money from the government to pay tuition , as they do now they would not start repaying the debt until they earned at least 21 , 000 a year \( about 38 , 000 at current exchange rates \) , an increase from the current level of 15 , 000 \( 24 , 100 \) they would then pay 9 percent of their income above that level to settle the debt the debt would be wiped out after 30 years student leaders have made it a priority to denounce liberal democrats who support the higher tuition , and they said on wednesday that they would try to recall any legislators who had broken their election promises on the issue some liberal democrats have said they would abstain from the vote to increase tuition when it comes up in parliament aaron porter , president of the national union of students , said the proposed increases were doubly unfair , since they were paired with cuts of about 40 percent in the money the government pays to subsidize teaching at universities we should be clear that the government has asked students to pay three times as much for a quality that is likely to be no better than what they are receiving now , and perhaps worse , he said

many homes on the cheyenne river reservation in south dakota have been without power for more than a week because of an ice storm that knocked down utility lines and damaged the water system crews have restored electricity to most communities on the sprawling reservation , but about 1 , 500 homes in outlying areas are without power and could be for weeks , tribal officials said as they worked to distribute blankets and food to those in need , tribal officials said they were grateful that the outcome of the storm , which struck on jan 21 , was not worse i'm just so thankful that none of the people living on this reservation died , said joseph brings plenty , the chairman of the  tribal officials estimate that the storm brought down about 3 , 000 utility poles , causing extensive failures many residents stayed in their homes as they lost water and power and as temperatures plummeted , with wind chills reaching 20 degrees below zero nobody had electricity , mr brings plenty said we used the stove to try to keep the house warm you could still see your breath , though we were dressed up like we were outside just to stay warm at least 39 elderly residents who receive dialysis treatment were evacuated to nearby towns the day after the storm , tribal officials said power and water began to be restored a few days ago to homes in the city of eagle butte , the tribal headquarters about 10 , 000 people live on the 14millionacre reservation , which is about 50 miles northwest of the state capital , pierre the reservation , which takes up most of two counties , is very poor , with 50 percent of the population living below the poverty level in ziebach county and 34 percent under the poverty level in dewey county , according to the 2000 census the tribe s emergency fund was depleted by another major storm in december , tribal leaders said , and they are struggling to pay for the response to the latest one the tribe has received donations and supplies from across the country , mr brings plenty said , but needs more help tribal leaders have used the internet to spread awareness of the damage from the storm , sending out email messages and posting updates to their web site a facebook group dedicated to disaster relief for the tribe had 125 members on sunday tribal leaders are asking for federal aid and said they hoped for a federal disaster declaration officials from the are planning to visit the reservation on monday to assess the damage , mr brings plenty said life is slowly getting back to what we knew before this , but our members on the east side , they 're still dealing with it , he said they 're still trying to stay warm and to find clean water to drink
st petersburg , fla s strides were long and purposeful as he approached the mound in the sixth inning friday night , as if he were late for an appointment placed the ball in girardi s hand and walked toward the dugout , his pace slow and deliberate , as if he had bad news to deliver it came in the form of the to the that , six years later , seemed like a continuation of vazquez s last time in pinstripes his second tour with the began like his first one ended , with a dreadful outing that generated flashbacks to that forgettable 2004 conclusion the carnage friday included eight hits a pair of tworun homers three walks and one very frustrated starting pitcher the first three innings , i was making good pitches and being aggressive , vazquez said and then , i did n't make good pitches after that and so for a night , vazquez , acquired from atlanta in december , looked miscast in the yankees' projected role for him a no 4 starter disguised as someone better that description belonged to david price , the rays' electrifying 24yearold lefthander , who overpowered the yankees through seven and twothirds innings his fastball reached the upper 90s , his changeup was sharp and his curveball was better in ascending to the ranks of the american league elite , the rays have collected a stable of outstanding young pitching james shields , at 28 , is their oldest starter with price , the no 1 overall pick in 2007 , leading the way his first three strikeouts came on 97mileperhour fastballs to nick johnson , alex rodriguez and robinson cano , the second and third looking i mean , i was hoping he would make a mistake , and he never really made any mistakes today , said mark teixeira , who went 0 for 4 and is now hitless in his first 16 atbats , tying his seasonopening stretch from 2003 , when he was a rookie with texas we hit a couple of balls hard off him , but he pitched pretty darn well the same cannot be said for vazquez , who struggled whenever he pitched from the stretch he said he concentrated on the rays' base runners , intent on not letting them steal , but he instead started to rush and was unable to regain his rhythm you know you 're doing it , but you still ca n't correct it , catcher jorge posada said vazquez joined the yankees before the 2004 season and was labeled an ace in waiting he left a year later viewed as a disappointment , remembered more for the grand slam he allowed to johnny damon in game 7 of the american league championship series than for making the allstar team as the yankees plotted how to improve their rotation this past offseason , they kept coming back to vazquez , who by following c c sabathia , a j burnett and andy pettitte in the rotation would be under less pressure to star the yankees' use of a threeman rotation during the postseason only highlighted a need for a reliable starter , and vazquez s durability only once since 2000 has he thrown fewer than signified to them much more than just good health you look at his numbers over just the last 10 years , girardi said before the game he s averaged 216 innings a year , and when you do that , you do n't last long in games if you do n't learn how to pitch and how to be economical with your pitches and use all your pitches and be able to use them at any time vazquez has evolved , throwing a curveball more often and a slider he did not have six years ago undermining him friday was a lack of control of his fastball after the yankees went ahead , 20 , in the fourth when rodriguez tripled and scored on a throwing error the rays evened the score on a tworun homer by carlos pena after b j upton singled , vazquez got willy aybar to fly out and was one strike away from preventing further damage but vazquez misfired badly on a fastball to dioner navarro , who singled home upton two more twoout hits stung , none more so than the double down the leftfield line by jason bartlett a play seemed out of his reach , but marcus thames dived anyway , and the ball bounced beyond his outstretched glove and rolled to the fence , scoring two more runs when vazquez gave up his second homer , to aybar in the sixth , his head dropped as he watched the ball plop into the rightfield stands you worry about a guy that s younger more than you do a guy who s experienced , girardi said javy s been through this where he s had a tough start and he s had to bounce back it s no fun , though , when it s your first start of the year inside pitch in his own measured way , derek jeter said he did not understand why the veteran crew chief joe west criticized the pacing of the yankees' recent series in boston west , who worked that series , told the record of hackensack , nj , that the pace was pathetic and embarrassing the games averaged 3 hours 38 minutes i do n't see what s pathetic or embarrassing about it , jeter said as opposed to what \? going 20 minutes shorter , it s not pathetic or embarrassing \? at what point is it not embarrassing \? if you go over , what , 3 12 , it s embarrassing , you know what i mean \? i do n't know joe girardi said francisco cervelli would catch c c sabathia on saturday
chicago johan santana threw a bullpen session for about 10 minutes sunday , and afterward the mets spokesman jay horwitz said santana felt fine but after the mets 185 win over the cubs , the mets said that they would skip santana s next start , and use the rookie dillon gee in his place on tuesday at washington santana left his previous start , thursday at atlanta , with a strained left chest muscle after santana threw sunday , he consulted with the trainer ray ramirez , the pitching coach dan warthen and manager jerry manuel , who later conferred with general manager omar minaya none of them were smiling very much with the mets a dozen games back in the wildcard race and any chance for a playoff spot all but eliminated , there is certainly no urgency for santana to pitch
as sales to developing nations become ever more important to giant tobacco companies , they are stepping up efforts around the world to fight tough restrictions on the marketing of cigarettes companies like philip morris international and british american tobacco are contesting limits on ads in britain , bigger health warnings in south america and higher cigarette taxes in the philippines and mexico they are also spending billions on lobbying and marketing campaigns in africa and asia , and in one case provided undisclosed financing for tv commercials in australia the industry has ramped up its efforts in advance of a gathering in uruguay this week of public health officials from 171 nations , who plan to shape guidelines to enforce a global antismoking treaty this year , philip morris international sued the government of uruguay , saying its tobacco regulations were excessive world health organization officials say the suit represents an effort by the industry to intimidate the country , as well as other nations attending the conference , that are considering strict marketing requirements for tobacco uruguay s groundbreaking law mandates that health warnings cover 80 percent of cigarette packages it also limits each brand , like marlboro , to one package design , so that alternate designs do n't mislead smokers into believing the products inside are less harmful the lawsuit against uruguay , filed at a world bank affiliate in washington , seeks unspecified damages for lost profits they 're using litigation to threaten low and middleincome countries , says dr douglas bettcher , head of the who s tobacco free initiative uruguay s gross domestic product is half the size of the company s 66 billion in annual sales peter nixon , a vice president and spokesman for philip morris international , said the company was complying with every nation s marketing laws while selling a lawful product for adult consumers he said the company s lawsuits were intended to combat what it felt were excessive regulations , and to protect its trademark and commercial property rights cigarette companies are aggressively recruiting new customers in developing nations , dr bettcher said , to replace those who are quitting or dying in the united states and europe , where smoking rates have fallen precipitously worldwide cigarette sales are rising 2 percent a year but the number of countries adopting tougher rules , as well as the global treaty , underscore the breadth of the battleground between tobacco and public health interests in legal and political arenas from latin america to africa to asia the cigarette companies work together to fight some strict policies and go their separate ways on others for instance , philip morris usa , a division of altria group , helped negotiate and supported the antismoking legislation passed by congress last year and did not join a lawsuit filed by r j reynolds , lorillard and other tobacco companies against the food and drug administration so far , it is not protesting the agency s new rules , proposed last week , requiring graphic images with health warnings on cigarette packs but philip morris international , the separate company spun out of altria in 2008 to expand the company s presence in foreign markets , has been especially aggressive in fighting new restrictions overseas it has not only sued uruguay , but also brazil , arguing that images the government wants to put on cigarette packages do not accurately depict the health effects of smoking and vilify tobacco companies the pictures depict more grotesque health effects than the smaller labels recommended in the united states , including one showing a fetus with the warning that smoking can cause spontaneous abortion in ireland and norway , philip morris subsidiaries are suing over prohibitions on store displays in australia , where the government announced a plan that would require cigarettes to be in plain brown or white packaging to make them less attractive to buyers , a philip morris official directed an opposition media campaign during the federal elections last summer , according to documents obtained by an australian television program , and later obtained by the new york times the 5 million campaign , purporting to come from small store owners , was also partly financed by british american and imperial tobacco the philip morris official approved strategies , budgets , ad buys and media interviews , according to the documents mr nixon , the spokesman , said philip morris made no secret of its financing of that effort we have helped them , not controlled them , he said mr nixon said philip morris agreed that smoking was harmful and supported reasonable regulations where none exist the packages definitely need health warnings , but they 've got to be a reasonable size , he said we thought 50 percent was reasonable once you take it up to 80 percent , there s no space for trademarks to be shown we thought that was going too far these days in courts around the world , the tobacco giants find themselves on the defensive far more than playing offense the who and its treaty encourage governments and individuals to take legal action against cigarette corporations , which have encountered growing numbers of lawsuits from smokers and health care systems in brazil , canada , israel , italy , nigeria , poland and turkey
on april 26 , 1975 , a 26yearold rookie goaltender named glenn resch , better known as chico , leaned down to kiss the goal posts several times during a stanley cup playoff game at pittsburgh civic arena , better known as the igloo trying in vain to win game 7 of a quarterfinal series and avoid a dubious place in history , the had come hard at resch early in the game , ringing two or three shots off the posts but the islanders went on to win , 10 i did n't do it to be a hot dog , resch , now a popular commentator on ' telecasts , said thursday in a telephone interview when you were on the roll like we were on , you 're almost giggling you ca n't believe this is happening that night , the islanders joined the 1942 as the only teams in nhl history to win a bestofseven playoff series after losing the first three games much to resch s delight , no team has matched the islanders' comeback since it was , he said , quite an accomplishment the have a chance to join the exclusive club friday in boston , when they play the in a series the flyers trailed three games to none the flyers are on the kind of roll the islanders were on in 1975 the adversity we 've faced i feel like we 're conditioned to it now , philadelphia coach said wednesday after game 6 , which , to tie the series , 33 although the flyers said after the game that there was still work to be done and that they were far from satisfied with just tying the series , they were ebullient the 1979 michael jackson song , do n't stop 'til you get enough , bounced off the walls in their dressing room when you 're in a doordie situation , you 've got to find something else to give , the veteran philadelphia defenseman said despite a staggering series of injuries the most recent to their goaltender , brian boucher the flyers are getting the kind of breaks that resch , among others , said they needed to overcome what once looked like an insurmountable deficit the bruins seem to be shaken as you rack up the wins , you feel better and better about your game , philadelphia forward danny briere said the flyers last won the stanley cup in 1975 after recovering from a 30 deficit to beat pittsburgh in seven games , the islanders lost the first three games of a semifinal series against the flyers but then the islanders won three straight games again to force a seventh game the deciding game was at the spectrum on may 13 , 1975 resch remembers it was loud the flyers were the defending stanley cup champions , and they did not want to be ousted by the upstart islanders , especially at home that is not always a good thing the adrenaline you get from the fans can sometimes push you over the top , resch said boston is going to have a much tougher time putting their emotions in balance that day in 1975 , the flyers recaptured the magic resch gave up a goal on a shot that he was sure he had stopped with his stick but the crowd was cheering resch looked at his stick , and the puck had torn out a chunk of his stick blade then rick macleish scored on a wrist shot over his shoulder the flyers won , 41 , then beat the , four games to two , for their second straight cup resch would win 231 regularseason games and 17 playoff games in his career , but he always has looked at those two game 7s in 1975 as the high and low of his career his broadcast partner , mike emrick , likes to refer to the breaks as the unseen hand the flyers have been benefactors in last friday , with the flyers facing elimination , a rebound popped onto simon gagne s stick , and he scored the winning goal when you do n't have lady luck , that unseen hand , working in your favor , you get very nervous and very discouraged , resch said the bruins practiced for an hour thursday , an unusually long offday workout at this point of the playoffs coach claude julien said he felt his team was ready for the challenge of playing game 7 but resch , for one , likes the flyers he has been there the unseen hand has helped him

there s been some excitement this week about pennsylvania , where two internal polls commissioned by democrats show a tight senate race one of the polls actually puts their candidate , joe sestak , ahead by 3 points the other has him 1 point behind pat toomey further contributing to the buzz is the disclosure that republicans are upping their ad buys in the state on the other hand , rasmussen reports provides for a buzzkill of sorts , having released a poll this morning showing mr toomey 10 points ahead the largest advantage that rasmussen has given him all year our forecast yesterday evening , which did not yet include the rasmussen poll \( nor the internal polls we do not use them in our senate predictions \) , showed a projected 7point victory for mr toomey and gave him a 92 percent chance of emerging as the victor none of the new information would lead me to deviate greatly from that forecast the internal polls i m not sure why people take polls released by campaigns at face value this does not mean that campaigns don t have very good pollsters working for them but the subset of polls which they release to the general public is another matter , and are almost always designed to drive media narrative for an instructive example , google the term internal polls the first result is a blog post , circa late october 2008 , entitled mccain s internal polls looking very good what we ve found is that is that polls commissioned by campaigns and released to the public show , on average , a result that is about 6 points points more favorable to their candidate s standing than nonpartisan polls released at the same time \( other analysts have found similar results \) so , just as a first cut , you might take a democratic internal poll that shows a tied race and translate it into nonpartisan terms by adding 6 points to the republican s margin that would mean toomey 6 , a figure that is well within the range of the nonpartisan surveys of the race the 6point rule of thumb is problematic , however , because internal polls tend to exaggerate relatively more or less under different circumstances from not at all \( once in a great while , there may even be an incentive for a candidate to lowball his own numbers \) , to a doubledigit fib under other conditions one circumstance where i tend to be particularly suspicious of internal polls is when a candidate is on what i d call the threshold of viability that is , a poll could conceivably change the perception of whether he has a realistic chance to win his race or not and therefore , could impact the allocation of scarce resources like activist energy and national party funds mr sestak is arguably near to such a threshold if the polls which had shown about a 7point lead for mr toomey , although there have been few public polls released in the past two weeks were to show a somewhat tighter race instead \( say , 3 or 4 points \) , the race would clearly be winnable for him and would be among the more important battlegrounds in the country but a 3point swing in the other direction putting mr toomey about 10 points ahead would mean that mr sestak was a longshot this is the threshold of viability the nrsc ad buy arguably this is the more compelling indicator perhaps it suggests that republican internal polls show the race tightening too but a couple of things to keep in mind first , while candidate and campaign committees have access to some information that the public lacks , they also suffer from a disadvantage , which is that it is hard for them to detach themselves from the race campaigns can and do behave emotionally , and depending on their mood , can either read their data through rosecolored glasses , or with their tinfoil hats on even the smartest campaigns can have trouble viewing the evidence objectively so attempting to discern their motives can be a dangerous game particularly when campaigns will occasionally engage in feints of various kinds to deceive gullible reporters a few people , like david wasserman of the cook political report , know how to separate out the signal from the noise but most gossip and speculation is simply gossip and speculation the second reason is a little throughthelookingglass suppose you accept our model s estimate that , with his roughly 7 point lead , mr toomey has a 92 percent chance of winning that estimate is formed from an evaluation of polling averages in past races it is likely , however , that the candidates who held those 7point leads in the past were continuing to put money into their races \( in part , because people tend to perceive races as being closer than they really are , and most people think of a 7point race as being quite close \) in other words , that 92 percent win percentage is conditional upon mr toomey continuing to run an aggressive campaign were he to take the next three weeks off and vacation in bermuda , his position would be considerably less secure than that the nrsc s ad buy might therefore be a reasonable precaution , even if mr toomey s polls show no tightening in the race the rasmussen poll perhaps , as rasmussen suggests , mr toomey s lead is expanding instead \? that could easily be the case rasmussen reports polls have a modest republican lean , however , which seems to be larger in some circumstances than others for instance , there was a period of about 15 days when no one but rasmussen was polling the senate race in washington , and a series of rasmussen showed the republican , dino rossi , gaining ground three other polls of the state have finally come out in the last 24 hours , however , and they all showed democrat patty murray either holding steady or improving her position likewise , a rasmussen poll commissioned by fox news earlier this week suggested tightening in the connecticut senate race , which hadn t been surveyed in a week or so but then a quinnipiac poll out this morning had the race moving in the other direction our statistical model continues to take rasmussen polls at face value , which is as it should be but in general , their polls can march somewhat to their own drummer , and i have grown somewhat skeptical of buying into trends implied by rasmussen polls until they are confirmed by other pollsters but didn t mr sestak make a big , late comeback in the primary \? yes , he did overcoming what had been a 30point polling deficit to win his race against arlen specter by 8 points and he ran a smart campaign , conserving his resources until late in the race when voters were just tuning in primaries , however , are much different beasts than general elections and many of the principles which are critical to understanding the former will mislead you in the latter the polling in general elections is much more accurate there are fewer swing voters turnout is much higher , which reduces volatility voters formulate their preferences earlier , and hold onto them more stubbornly all of these things mean that lastminute comebacks are rare , and a campaign strategy contingent upon one is probably dubious one of mr sestak s problems , instead , is that mr toomey who had an extremely conservative voting record when he represented pennsylvania in the us house quickly worked to establish himself as the moderate in the race \( for instance , by endorsing sonia sotomayor \) while mr sestak and mr specter were fighting for the democratic nomination it is probably too late for mr sestak to alter the fundamental dynamics of the contest still , he has a fighting chance the percentage of undecided voters in the race remains at about 15 percent across an average of polls , which is higher than all but a couple of other competitive senate races and polling suggests that there is an especially large enthusiasm gap in pennsylvania , which mr sestak could potentially close but these things can be discerned from the public polling , rather than trying to read tea leaves from internal polling and advertising spending
charleston harbor , nov 21 , 1860 as he stepped gingerly from a launch onto the wharf , few of those watching could have imagined that this man would , within a matter of weeks , become the most famous military officer in america none , surely , could have guessed that women would soon beg for locks of that meticulously combed gray hair , or that woodcuts of that bland , impassive face would appear on the front pages of magazines around the nation and across the atlantic everything about him seemed middling he was in his fifties , of intermediate rank , medium height and moderate demeanor circumspect in his political opinions pleasantmannered but lacking in charm handsome without the slightest degree of magnetism he was known in the service mainly to the extent that he was known at all for having translated certain french artillery textbooks into english even his name was nondescript , easily forgettable maj robert anderson and yet here was the person to whom the united states government had just entrusted one of the most delicate military and political assignments in american history command of the federal garrison in charleston harbor , the very epicenter of the exploding secession crisis perhaps more than any man except abraham lincoln himself , anderson would set the course of events in the months ahead , and would make decisions that fixed the country on a path toward war or peace within a fortnight after lincoln s election , everyone in america was aware that south carolina would soon attempt to leave the union its legislature had already set a date for a secession convention in less than a month s time as soon as the formalities were complete , all federal property within the state s borders would be , at least to the seceders eyes , subject to immediate confiscation in particular , the three forts guarding charleston harbor of which anderson was about to take command on behalf of the united states would immediately become foreign military bases within the sovereign republic of south carolina would they surrender peacefully or , by resisting , bring war \? luckily for the founding fathers of the nascent republic , those three citadels fort moultrie , castle pinckney and fort sumter guarded charleston in only the most figurative sense waiting on moultrie s parade ground to welcome anderson was a tiny detachment of soldiers that could scarcely even be termed a garrison just two companies of barely 30 men each , not counting a small brass band and these were anything spitandpolish troops their outgoing commander , lt col john gardner , 67 years old , had been shunted off to fort moultrie as a nonetoodemanding spot where he could wind down an army career that had begun in the hazy days before the war of 1812 not surprisingly , gardner was far from a martinet , and his men spent more time attending local cotillions and barbecues than they did taking artillery practice drifts of sand halfcovered fort moultrie s outer walls grazing cows sometimes wandered blithely across the battlements the two other two forts posed even less of a threat to the forces of secession fort sumter , built on an artificial island in the harbor s mouth , sat unfinished after decades of startandstop construction , and it housed just a few military engineers supervising some civilian workmen castle pinckney , though its guns overlooked the town itself , was under the protection of but a single ordnance sergeant the cautious , temporizing administration of james buchanan , the lameduck president , may have appointed anderson because he seemed as unthreatening as the forts themselves born in the border state of kentucky , he detested secessionists and abolitionists in equal measure the major personally owned no slaves , but his georgiaborn wife had inherited quite a number , whom she later sold off anderson once quipped dryly that the increase of her darkies had made him rich he knew both sides of the masondixon line well his long career had seen him posted to maine and florida , new jersey and virginia when the war department plucked him out of the middle ranks of the officer corps for the charleston appointment , he was serving on a commission to revise the curriculum at west point , where he had once been an instructor anderson had fought the seminoles , led troops in the war with mexico , and been brevetted for gallantry at molino del rey but , as a devout christian , he loved peace indeed , he loathed violence with the certitude of a man who had seen far too much of it already the buchanan administration believed it had found a soldier incapable of any rash act , one who would put no american lives at risk either to disrupt the union or to defend it but the officers and men who welcomed major anderson to charleston inspected their quiet new commander with searching eyes they knew that in a certain sense , he and they would hold more power in the months ahead than president buchanan himself the truth is we are the government at present , one of them would soon write it rests upon the points of our swords shall we use our position to deluge the country in blood \?

london has a penny pinching approach to defense spending by prime minister gordon brown kept british troops in afghanistan disastrously short of the helicopters and other equipment their commanders have long demanded , causing unnecessarily heavy combat losses to the taliban s most devastating weapon , roadside bombs \? as the election campaign unfolds , the weightiest issue seems sure to be the economy but with opinion polls pointing to the closest race in decades , other issues could tip the balance , with none more emotive than the losses in afghanistan , and the suggestion that some soldiers have been the victims of government penury the accusation has beset mr brown from tony blair nearly three years ago that was just as s commitment in afghanistan , now at 10 , 000 troops , second largest among allied contingents to an american commitment now building toward 100 , 000 , began to increase and to lead to mounting casualties that have become a political liability for the governing labour party more deaths last week brought the number of british troops who have died in afghanistan to 281 , compared with the who have died as part of the afghan war and related operations proportional to the numbers of troops deployed , that makes britain s casualty rate higher than the united states' , though lower than the losses suffered by canada , which has lost 142 troops , according to calculations by defense experts nearly threequarters of all british combat deaths have been caused by roadside bombs , a figure similar to that for american troops but what has propelled the issue is the british critics' insistence that american troops are far better equipped , with hundreds of troopcarrying helicopters , compared with a british fleet that some former field commanders say has sunk at times to fewer than 20 serviceable aircraft mr brown , citing security considerations , has refused to divulge the precise figure he has rejected accusations that british commanders have been forced to turn regularly to american commanders for helicopter transport by saying that the sharing of airlift capacity is a normal part of any allied military operation gen charles guthrie , britain s top military officer until 2001 , has spoken bitterly of mr brown s paring of budgets for helicopters and other defense priorities gordon never cared about defense , he said in an interview last summer with the times of london it s no good the prime minister one moment saying success is all important , and then for the sake of a few extra helicopters and 2 , 000 men allowing the mission in afghanistan to fail you ca n't go to war in a pennypinching way , he said similar charges have been made by top british commanders in recent years , by highranking former ministers in the brown and blair governments , and by a succession of coroners who have conducted inquests in britain , as required by law , into each of the combat deaths their findings have frequently pointed to a lack of proper equipment , including body armor , armored vehicles and explosivesdetecting devices , in addition to helicopters one recent inquest , into the 2008 deaths from a taliban bomb of four special forces soldiers , made a finding of unlawful killing , directed not at the taliban but at the defense ministry with every death a leading item in britain s newscasts and newspapers , accusations that the troops have been poorly equipped have become a vulnerability for labour and a personal one for mr brown as they mount an uphill campaign in the against the pollleading conservatives so it was no surprise when the conservative leader , david cameron , seized the issue in his final preelection clash with mr brown in the house of commons last week in the harshest exchange in a fiery session of prime minister s questions , mr cameron quoted a former british paratroop commander in afghanistan as saying that repeated demands for more helicopters fell on deaf ears with the brown government , and that troops ended up driving into combat when they should have been flying when a visibly flustered mr brown rose to give his familiar defense that senior british officers in afghanistan had told the government they had what they needed conservative backbenchers set up a chorus traditionally used by opposition parties to mock the government at the moment of the commons breakup for an election byebye , they cried the bitterness that has enveloped the issue of equipment deficiencies for combat troops is part of an unhealed rift in britain , and in the labour party that goes back to mr blair s role in leading britain into the iraq war in 2003 , as chancellor of the exchequer , mr brown fought bitter battles with mr blair over financing for the war , and at one point , in 2004 , ordered more than 2 billion cut from the forces' budget for new helicopters the afghan war has not generated any similar controversy , at least as far as britain s need to fight there both labour and conservative have justified the war on the basis of denying islamist terrorists a base for attacks on britain mr brown , eager to rebut critics who have suggested that he has the hostility to the military of an old leftwing stalwart , has embraced the afghan commitment as his own , making frequent visits to troops there and promising them whatever equipment they need that has left the conservatives to concentrate their attacks on the charge that mr brown is fighting the afghan war on the cheap his response has been to say that the defense budget has doubled over labour s 13 years in power , to about 60 billion , not including billions spent from a special fund for war operations the conservatives and retired military commanders say that claim disguises mr brown s habit of misstating budget details and of distorting or denying the warnings defense chiefs repeatedly gave him on the consequences of cutting the war budgets but defense critics say these clashes mask a reality that either party , forming the next government , will have to confront that britain , in taking on major combat commitments in iraq and afghanistan , was punching above its weight and its financial resources and that the next few years of budget austerity forced by the trilliondollar debt taken on by labour to fight the recession will require a major retrenchment of the armed forces , including sharp reductions in manpower , whoever wins
dave weigel has a piece up in which he talks to yours truly , reihan salam , and david frum all charter members of the republican party needs a new policy agenda chorus about why the gop seems to be making a big comeback despite adopting just about none of our policy suggestions i m quoted in the piece , but i think it s worth making two quick points to clarify my views on the subject first , the argument in grand new party , which i cowrote with salam , was not necessarily that if republicans don t do what we say , they ll never win another election again it was closer to the following if republicans don t address working and middleclass anxieties over health care , wage stagnation , the cost of childrearing , etc , they ll give the democrats an opportunity to entrench an even larger welfare state , and foreclose future opportunities for conservative reform we first advanced this argument , at essaylength form , in 2005 , when the gop controlled the house , senate and the white house , and other pundits were still talking about a permanent republican majority over the next three years well , you know what happened it s nice for the institutional gop that now , after the most significant series of liberal legislative victories since the great society , and with federal spending up over 25 percent of gdp , a strict less government ! message is suddenly resonating again \( well , to a point \) but from a policy perspective , i think the future that we were trying to warn republicans against has already partially come to pass and winning back the working class in a backlash election , after you ve suffered a series of major policy defeats , seems like a poor substitute for keeping them in your corner in the first place , and forestalling obamacare rather than finding yourself stuck trying to repeal it so that would be my combative response to the rightwing critics of grand new party , who see the 2010 polls as proof that the republican party just needed to return to the oldtime antitax , antigovernment religion , and never mind all that nonsense about having a renovated policy agenda my olivebranch response , though , would emphasize the extent to which the landscape of 2010 is very different than the landscape of 20056 , when salam and i were writing the essay and then the book the deficit is much larger , the entitlement crunch is much closer , government and business are more intertwined than ever before , etc and in this landscape posthousing bubble , postfinancial crisis , postbailouts and postobamacare i think that it s entirely appropriate for the gop to chart a more small government libertarian course than it did in the bush era , and than we urged on the party several years ago \( though i d suggest , and i know my coauthor would as well , than our proposed agenda was somewhat more libertarianfriendly than its rightwing critics gave it credit for \) hence my recent arguments for a kind of libertarian populism , and hence my preference for tea partier extremism over the budgetbusting businessasusual of the party s washington establishment the tea party obviously isn t the fulfillment of the grand new party vision , but then again the grand new party vision didn t quite anticipate the depth of the fiscal ditch we ve driven ourselves into and i can imagine the tea party s smallgovernment purism playing an important role in pulling us out of that ditch well , maybe a smallgovernment agenda fits the times we re living in , but it has to be a real smallgovernment agenda , not just a lot of rhetoric about constitutionalism with no policy behind it and as i said to weigel , my biggest worry is that the gop is basically taking one of the insights from grand new party that even the republican base has grown to love big government and running with it in a cynical , rather than a constructive direction , by offering rhetorical promises to cut government joined to specific pledges to protect the most expensive sections of the welfare state if the tea party s fervor succeeds in electing a group of politicians who are serious about entitlement reform , then it will have done both the country and conservatism a service but if it just produces a lot of posturing about small government joined to yet more fiscal irresponsibility well , then i hope the same people who regarded grand new party as a fatal compromise with statism will hold the tea party to the same high standard
amar'e stoudemire looked for answers where there were none he attempted to rationalize the ' struggles this season he called the situation not something that i'm used to and foreign land in actuality , stoudemire is new the situation is not the knicks are losing again i'm not sure if it s the fact maybe a winning mentality has never been here , stoudemire said after the shorthanded handed the knicks a sunday at madison square garden i'm just not used to it i'm used to winning i'm used to talking about winning and having that confidence toward winning you just ca n't have guys complacent and comfortable with losing the knicks' last winning season was a decade ago new faces cycled in and out then at his signing this summer , stoudemire proclaimed , the knicks are back they are back , but to the familiar state of losing houston , without two of its primary scorers , and aaron brooks , handed the knicks their fifth straight loss it is their longest stretch of losses since an eightgame streak last february , long before the roster makeover the knicks are 14 at home this season and 37 over all they depart this week on a trip that will further test them , against denver , sacramento , golden state and the los angeles clippers i do n't understand why we 're not playing with the urgency , said stoudemire , who scored a teamhigh 25 points i'm not used to that we 're not playing like we 're on a fourgame losing streak , now five we do n't have that sense of urgency it s almost as if it does n't matter after reporters had moved on , stoudemire remained at his locker , gazing down both knees were wrapped in ice , and stoudemire said he had been hit on his thigh twice the knicks did not give up a 21point lead as they did against minnesota on friday no one grabbed 31 rebounds , kevin love s haul in that game but there were plenty of rebounds to be had by houston , compliments of the knicks the knicks missed their first eight shots to start the fourth quarter , continuing a drought that originated in the third quarter the rockets used a 14point run to transform a 1point deficit into a 13point lead , and they led by as many as 19 points in the fourth quarter the knicks lacked consistency on offense and defense the only constants came in the misses , and the series of boos from a disgruntled crowd we have a lot of lapses where our offense is n't as fluid as it should be , point guard raymond felton said we make a lot of mental mistakes on defense that hurt us we have to figure this thing out we have to stay strong this is really testing us kevin martin scored 28 points for the rockets , and luis scola had 24 points and 8 rebounds they compensated for the absences of yao and brooks , who have sprained left ankles the game had seesawed before houston s run and featured 13 lead changes and 10 ties in the first three quarters stoudemire placed the minnesota fiasco on his shoulders after he found himself in foul trouble and watched while love gained the bulk of his rebounds on sunday , the knicks began the game with clearouts to stoudemire , and he started well , scoring 12 points in the first quarter i was able to score the ball at will , but again , from a team standpoint , we were n't able to collectively score the ball , stoudemire said danilo gallinari scored 14 points but attempted only seven shots the reserve guard toney douglas struggled he was 1 for 11 and contributed five misses to the knicks' 3for16 shooting behind the 3point arc d'antoni shuffled his lineup and reverted to the one he used the first seven games of the season in starting timofey mozgov at center in the second half , d'antoni opened with wilson chandler d'antoni also loosened his rotation and summoned shooting guard roger mason jr for only the second time in seven games d'antoni , like his team , is searching for answers that are not there yet the season is young but there are distressing signs before the game , a reporter referred to fans being devastated by the loss to minnesota nobody jumped off a bridge or anything , right \? d'antoni said ok , good we want to get better , he added we need to get better rebounds said he expected ronny turiaf \( sprained left knee \) to return tuesday against the denver nuggets
detroit the last train pulled away more than 20 years ago from michigan central station , one of thousands of seethrough buildings here , empty shells from more auspicious times many of the blighted buildings stay up simply because they are too expensive to tear down yet michigan central is in a class of its own some city officials consider it among the ugliest behemoths to pockmark detroit and have ordered its demolition , but others see it as the industrial age s most gracious relic , a beaux arts gem turned gothic from neglect but steeped in haunting beauty now detroit has become embroiled in an urgent debate over how to save what is perhaps its most iconic ruin and in the process , some insist , give the demoralized city a much needed boost people compare it to roman ruins , said karen nagher , the executive director of , an organization that seeks to protect architecture and neighborhoods around detroit some people just want it left alone but i 'd love to see that building with windows in and lights on again since the voted last year to demolish the depot , the building has been granted a reprieve of sorts thanks to more urgent issues confronting the city , including a 400 million budget deficit and a lawsuit to halt the tear down \( citing the station s historic landmark status \) further , several council members , elected since the vote , do not share the previous council s enthusiasm for land clearing i do n't want to bulldoze it , then find out later there could have been a viable use for it , said charles pugh , a newly elected member who took over as council president in january now preservationists , business owners , state leaders and community activists are taking what feels like a last stab at saving the 97yearold building before it goes the way of new york s pennsylvania station or , more locally , tiger stadium and countless other pieces of old detroit that have fallen to the wrecking ball in recent years among the recent proposals have been to turn the cavernous brick , steel and stone facade into an extreme sports castle a casino a hotel and office park a fish hatchery and aquarium an amphitheater or a railway station again , with highspeed trains or just clean and secure it , and leave it the way it is as an attraction for tourists it s the quintessential example of urban decay in detroit , said john mohyi , a wayne state university student and founder of the , a nonprofit group formed to save the building to see redevelopment of that station would have a major impact on morale having lost nearly a million people in the last 60 years , detroit has a backlog of thousands of empty office buildings , theaters , houses and hotels downtown alone , more than 200 abandoned buildings are on the national register of historic places most are examples of the art deco and neoclassical styles that were popular before world war ii , when detroit was booming but with 500 , 000 square feet of space on 14 acres of land , michigan central station is different from your standard vacant building , said mickey blashfield , a government relations official with the station s owner , centra inc , a trucking and transportation company that acquired it by default through a property transfer in 1995 and has struggled to find a use for it since architecturally and historically , mr blashfield said , it has more of an emotional connection with people than virtually any building in the city as it is , michigan central station , with its 18story office tower , has been picked to the bare bones by scavengers , who over the years have made off with a treasuretrove of chandeliers and mahogany and marble ornaments but it is still a magnet for urban explorers and photographers from around the world on various pages , it has more than 15 , 000 fans and friends phillip cooley , a restaurant owner who lives across a park from the station , estimates that about 30 sightseers a day show up at its locked gate , cameras raised he calls the building an education a building like that would not be allowed to deteriorate that way and remain standing in any other city , said mr cooley , who spends some of his free time around the station with neighbors cleaning up and planting grass it shows our postindustrial landscape how nature takes over , what abandonment looks like there s a lot to be learned from its current state it needs to be a public space again jack teatsorth , the station s director of security , said his parents met at the depot during its bustling world war ii years inside is a solid steel skeleton , he said there s not enough dynamite in four states to bring this building down mr blashfield said his company was not interested in demolition , but needed an anchor tenant or at least a critical mass of businesses or government agencies before it could pay for any renovation and that is the hard part grand and varied plans have been proposed over the years , with none coming to fruition but there is new hope that momentum is building for michigan central to become a hub for some government security functions , like the detroit headquarters of the michigan state police , some state and federal homeland security offices and , given detroit s location close to the canadian border , a center for trade inspections , mr blashfield said plans are preliminary , but they offer the most promise of anything proposed lately , especially if federal stimulus money can be used i think this window of opportunity is very narrow , and if we do n't seize the moment , we may lose it , said cameron s brown , a republican state senator who supports having security agencies use the building the clock is ticking
as the ninth commissioner of the tour , michael whan , 44 , has taken the reins of an organization in flux its last commissioner , carolyn bivens , left after a player revolt at last year s united states women s open over sponsor defections , some of them caused as much by bivens s autocratic management style as by the slumping economy the 2010 outlook is uncertain for the tour , which gets under way thursday with the honda ptt lpga in thailand there are 25 tournaments on the schedule this season , down from 34 in 2008 and from 27 last year , and there are nine open dates between now and june although whan will admit to facing a learning curve and acknowledge some challenges , he seems confident of where the tour is going a graduate of miami university in ohio with a procter gamble background , whan was a marketing and sales executive at taylormade adidas golf and then turned around a struggling hockey gear company in orange county , calif sleeping is not high on his priority list , nor is thinking about things outside his control traits associated with chief executives and successful sports commissioners he has been the former and is learning to become the latter people who know him say he is a quick study , and he is determined to show just how quick i think the lpga and we should take pride in this is showcasing its brand worldwide we 're doing that with fans , players and sponsors , and the developmental programs around the world prove it we put the show on the road , and we do it often enough that you can wake up one day and 7 of your top 10 players in the world can come from different countries , from outside the us that s a testament to what the lpga has become fifteen years ago , people wondered if the lpga could be any bigger or better because it was really limited to the us and europe nobody asks that question today all you have to do is go to qschool and see how many different flags are flying above the practice range to realize we 're really worldwide to us it s a duty to showcase the best all around the world we 'll always be a usbased business we 'll always have our home in the us like any other business that has gone global in the last 20 years , going global is n't easy and a lot of people will tell you it s tough to do the process but when you wake up on the other side , it s such a better business model we 're not going to turn back , because the players and the fan base would n't let us and not only is the fan base growing , but our sponsor base is growing because of the global nature of our tour in business i have found there are two kinds of overwhelming there s the oh my gosh do i have a lot to do and where am i going to find the time and the ability to do all of this \? ' and there is the i 've got so many interested , passionate , exciting people to help , how do i make sure i utilize all of them and do n't use that as a distraction but as a positive \? ' the good news for me is that it s the latter the key for me is how do i make sure i get them all on the same train going on the same track i 'd much rather have that problem i think the biggest challenge to the job , not necessarily the company but the job and i do n't know if i 'd have said this 60 days ago has been focus the core responsibility of getting the best women players in the world out on the course playing for money and on tv is a fairly simple business challenge i think , on the commissioner front , so many of the requirements and needs i do n't want to use the word distractions , which i would have as a ceo the different requirements and requests and constituents come through me every day none are unimportant or irrelevant but if you 're not careful , you can actually finish a 10 , 12hour day and realize you spent zero amount of time focusing on the most important thing that is our business partners , who get our players on the golf course my wife and kids are not going to move until the summer i have three teenage boys , so moving them in the middle of school and teams and seasons was unexciting to everyone including me my wife said , you know , you 're not going to be much of a father the first six or seven months anyway , so go do what you got to do when you 're somewhere else from your wife and kids , there s no guilt in coming home at 11 o'clock at night i'm excited about it i love the topic , i love the challenge i 've really enjoyed the people i 've always been an earlymorning person , so starting my day at 6 30 in the office is normal for me it s not normal to come home at 11 o'clock at night but i 've got a few months of that just because there s so much to learn i do n't have to be there i'm just enjoying the orientation process i 've been working a couple of weeks or three weeks and then go home for a three or fourday weekend , that kind of span , and think i might do that for this six months and then when the school season ends in june , we 'll move in june or july it is the no 1 priority i would n't even call it one of , it is there certainly are other things to do , but no 1 is about getting us playing a lot more often , a lot more places and on tv nobody got to avoid what happened to the business community in 2008 and 2009 , and certainly businesses that were downsizing and challenging the sports marketing plan , nobody was immune to that certainly not the lpga , either at the same time it s kind of helped us all realize that none of this is a given and you 've got to work for it we 've got to make sure that when these title partners sign up with us that we 're working hard for their business , not just working hard for the purse i 've said many times i do n't even like the term sponsor a sponsor , you sell something to a partner , you go into business with we 've just got to get into the mindset that we partner up with these title holders and we have to understand what they need and want to get out it from a business perspective the real work begins after you 've signed the contract and not before the best business to be in is contract renewal , when people love what you 're doing working for them and want you to keep doing it i do n't think i'm letting the cat out of the bag to say that one of the terms i 've got us talking about is what i call roo , which is return on objective if you have five title partners sitting in front of you , they probably have four different reasons why they do the event all of them are important , they 're just different reasons for different folks some are all about a charity opportunity some are about moving cases of product some are all about community outreach in one of the key areas where they have employment some are all about getting close to the top 50 or 100 customers and it s all about customer interaction and securing better business with the customers they all have sort of a primary objective i 've said to some of the players you 've got a warning coming soon ' i would like by 2011 , when the players and my staff and i roll into a tournament , we all know very well what the objectives are of this tournament sponsor is and we 're all about it , not only the week we 're there , but in the weeks before it and the weeks after if we all know what we 're trying to achieve for cvs , or honda , or kia , then we 're all working for them and we realize it s more than a golf tournament it s an important corporate effort , and making it succeed is key to what we do i 've got some ideas that are from the first 30 days , you get a lot of ideas and you just do n't know which are the good ones for another 60 days we 're going to try things our pricing is a little complex right now to sit across from a ceo and explain how the whole thing works i 've looked at it as a ceo and said this does n't have to be this hard it could be real simple to explain so everybody gets it and we do n't spend a lot of time with all the different price points so i think we 'll have to change how we price , which does n't mean our price will be different , just a lot easier to understand right now it s a little cryptic i do have people doing that who i feel are pretty talented i also would tell you that given that that s the no 1 objective finding new partners , bringing new tournaments to the table that s also where you 're going to see an increased devotion of resources and people on my side first , john has 15 years of selling golf title sponsorships in his background , which gets right to using resources to support your no 1 objective i knew john at procter gamble we came out of school at the same time we 've been friends for a long time , and he brings some significant horsepower to the table he s just a perfect fit his wife is a super athlete and he has three girls who are all worldclass athletes , so the idea for him enhancing and growing women s opportunities in sport and getting exposure for some of the best women athletes in the world is a little personal for him so that s great for me and for the organization first and foremost , it gives our tour a home , a consistent location for our fans to find us one of the criticisms we heard was that we were just kind of all over the place and it was difficult to find us the second thing it gives us is a significant media partner with a skin in the game to want to see us grow and get better i mean , their 10year deal looks great if we really grow this thing over the next five years , and it does n't look so great if we do n't i talk to the golf channel once a day , and it s always on the same topics how can we do more better to help the fans get to meet these personalities on the tour \? anybody who follows the lpga , and even those who do n't regularly , the one thing they all agree on is that the personalities on the lpga are second to none exciting young women who are having fun on the golf course they 're fun to look at , fun to watch and they perform at a freakishly high level our job is to make sure that more people not only get to see them , but also get to know them i tell people all the time that the solheim cup was the no 1 reason why i became the commissioner , at least on my side i mean , i 've never had so much fun viewing golf that i can remember in a long time i had my 12yearold son next to me , and we were visiting my parents and we had three generations of whans sitting together on the couch highfiving and laughing i remember turning off the tv and telling my dad i was going to call back the recruitment firm and tell them this is a fantastic product i 'd feel blessed to feel part of it was a spectacular viewing event it was hard not to root for both sides , not to love the personalities these were women who were having a lot of fun , nervous , competing , hitting the shots of their lives , and as a golf fan it was hard to turn away i drove up to ponte vedra , might have been day 5 of my tenure he was one of the first people who emailed me after my announcement , which i was very impressed with he said any time , anyplace , so i just decided to take him up on it spent about two and a half hours , just he and i in his office , and then he set up the rest of the day where i could meet with different executives in different departments if there would have been a way for him to be more welcoming to me , i do n't know what it would have been since then , we 've exchanged emails and text messages he is a clear partner to the lpga i do n't know what i expected , but he s certainly surpassed any expectation i ever had \? when i was 9 years old my father told me , i'm going to teach you about a game that will teach you more about life than i will' i thought my dad would teach me everything i ever needed to know first and foremost , as a fan and a guy who loves the game , i'm interested in talking to people and it only took me a few of those calls to realize how much more i could learn whether it s calling up an annika sorenstam or charlie mechem or going to meet tim finchem or just bending the ear of a david fay , as a golfer i find that interesting , and as an incoming commissioner who clearly has a lot to learn , where else would i get better learning \?
in an era of layoffs , unpaid furloughs and reduced benefits at most levels of government , workers for the littleknown , taxpayerfinanced agency that deals with cook county s waste and storm water are a throwback to far better times they continue to enjoy high salaries , big overtime checks and annual cash payouts for unused sickleave days the paychecks of many agency employees have grown by more than 30 percent in the past five years , far outstripping the pace in other local government agencies and the rate of inflation with a 17 billion annual budget , the district is responsible for managing storm water and for treating sewage before pouring it into the county s waterways its most famous endeavors included reversing the flow of the chicago river away from lake michigan in 1900 and the deep tunnel stormwater management project , which is designed to reduce flooding and to avoid flushing raw sewage into the lake during heavy storms an investigation by the chicago news cooperative and the better government association found that the number of employees with sixfigure salaries has more than doubled since 2005 at the the ranks of district officials with salaries exceeding 200 , 000 a year more than tripled to 16 from 5 during the same period , payroll records show for cook county taxpayers , the cost of financing the district has also risen the owner of a home worth 200 , 000 pays about 135 a year toward the district s budget , an increase of almost 30 percent in the last decade sixteen district employees will be paid more than mayor richard m daley this year , and some top executives for the agency receive tens of thousands of dollars a year more than their counterparts at city hall or in other units of local government the 229 , 316 annual salary of the district s top lawyer , frederick m feldman , is 32 percent higher than the head of the daley administration s law department , corporation counsel mara georges that gap does not even include 24 unpaid days off that ms georges and most other city workers are required to take this year one district board commissioner s aide , whose salary rose almost 40 percent in the past five years , was dominic longo , a veteran chicago democratic political operative who was convicted of vote fraud in 1984 terrence j o'brien , the longtime district board president , defended the high wages as necessary to retain hardworking , skilled employees mr o'brien said the district would not grant costofliving pay increases this year , after recently raising its tax levy to help plug a 24 million budget shortfall besides costofliving increases , the district gives merit pay increases based on evaluations from supervisors mr o'brien said the district had avoided layoffs and mandatory furloughs because it did not face budget deficits as large as those of other government units he also noted that the vast majority of the district s 2 , 100 employees must pass exams to be hired the tests were mandated when the illinois attorney general sued the district in 1985 after news media reports and a better government association investigation alleged patronage hiring our people are not here because of who they know but by what they know , and that is different from other agencies , mr o'brien said quality , professional , welleducated people do more than people who are watching the clock critics question whether the big pay increases are justified in the midst of cutbacks elsewhere do you really have to pay them that much to keep them from leaving or are you paying them so much because you can \? said david morrison , deputy director of the illinois campaign for political reform just because a taxing body is recessionproof does n't mean you have to lavish those raises on employees the agency is run by a ninemember board whose elections are far down the ballot from the higherprofile political posts despite operating in relative obscurity , the district s commissioners have not avoided charges of political favoritism in hiring in 2008 , fox news chicago reported that the sons and daughters of district employees and politically connected applicants were hired as summer interns at the time , mr o'brien responded , there are a lot of fathers and mothers out in the community if they ca n't help their children when they 're in need of some experience in the workplace , you know , shame on me the district s fulltime employees tend to enjoy long careers with the agency mr feldman , the top lawyer for the district , has worked there since 1969 in addition to his salary , he has received annual cash payments of more than 4 , 000 for unused sick leave in recent years , according to district records obtained through the freedom of information act mr feldman is one of eight lawyers for the district who have salaries higher than ms georges , the top lawyer for the city of chicago some of the biggest salary increases came in the district treasurer s office despite having the same title she had five years ago , mary a boyle , the assistant treasurer , saw her pay rise 44 percent , to about 139 , 000 a year for unionized district workers , overtime costs have shot up more than 20 percent in recent years in addition to contractually mandated wage increases , 22 workers have earned more than 100 , 000 each in overtime payments since 2005 most of the biggest recipients of overtime pay are district police officers who patrol the agency s facilities , like the sewage treatment plant in south suburban stickney it s just how we 've treated our employees because of what they have to go through to get hired , mr o'brien said who , when they get out of college , wants to take an exam \? salaries for the district s parttime board of commissioners , have also increased in recent years , with the approval of the state legislature mr o'brien , who ran for county board president in the democratic primary in february , is paid almost 80 , 000 a year , up 33 percent since 2005 kathleen therese meany , the board vice president , and gloria alitto majewski , the finance committee chairman , are the next highestpaid commissioners , at 75 , 000 a year i am here probably , sometimes five days a week , ms majewski said i'm usually here until 6 or 7 o'clock at night other commissioners , i ca n't comment on the district is very technical i spend a lot of my time reading through the documents besides supervisors , the only district employees who can be hired and fired at the whim of their bosses are the 26 aides to the commissioners some have seen their salaries rise substantially in the last five years the biggest percentage increase went to eleanor kane , an aidessistant to commissioner debra shore , whose salary jumped 44 percent , to 76 , 000 a year ms shore said ms kane the aide hads a master s degree in environmental engineering and deserved the raise after an initial probationary period at lower pay i'm not an engineer , and she s been great , said ms shore , who worked for the better government association in the 1980s one of the highestpaid aides is donna mcgowanwatson , the daughter of commissioner barbara j mcgowan both ms mcgowanwatson and another aide to her mother , lemuettia hicks , a daughter of alderman carrie m austin \( 34th ward \) , are paid almost 88 , 000 a year sometimes they work on the weekends , ms mcgowan said none of our jobs are eight hours a day , five days a week commissioner frank avila also employs his daughter , audrey , as well as mr longo , who in the last five years has seen his salary climb to almost 84 , 000 from less than 60 , 000 mr avila noted that mr longo s vote fraud conviction was more than 25 years ago i do n't know too much about that , mr avila said he must have been very young he does an excellent job asked about the high salaries for top executives , mr avila said the demands of keeping the environment clean required employees with higher technical expertise than many other local government employees had he added , very few people leave the metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago
republicans claim to be deeply worried about the deficit their favorite political target , followed closely by president obama s relentlessly demonized health care reform so why are they so determined to overturn one of the central costcontrol mechanisms of the new reform law \? republicans in both the senate and the house have introduced bills that would eliminate the new independent payment advisory board , which is supposed to come up with ways to rein in excessive medicare spending and stiffen congress s spine starting in 2014 , whenever medicare s projected spending exceeds a target growth rate , the board of 15 members \( drawn from a range of backgrounds , appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate \) will have to recommend reductions in payments to doctors and health care providers to bring spending back to target levels these recommendations would become law unless congress not known for its political courage in such circumstances passed an alternative proposal that would achieve comparable savings none of this poses any real threat to medicare beneficiaries the law prohibits the board from making proposals that would ration care , increase taxes , change medicare benefits or eligibility , increase premiums or costsharing , or reduce lowincome subsidies for drug coverage it cannot call for a reduction in payments to hospitals before 2020 if anything , we fear that the board s power will be too limited but its power to curb payments to other providers is projected to save 155 billion to 24 billion between 2015 and 2019 that has not stopped senator john cornyn of texas from trying to kill off the board in july , he introduced the ever so cutely named health care bureaucrats elimination act it currently has 11 cosponsors , and a similar version , introduced earlier in the house by the republican phil roe of tennessee , has 54 cosponsors neither bill will go anywhere so long as the democrats run congress , but expect to hear a lot of hype about bureaucrats hijacking health care and nothing about the needed savings in this fall s campaign republicans are also eagerly attacking another important source of savings the new law s elimination of the subsidies given to the private managedcare plans known as medicare advantage that is projected to save 132 billion over the next decade , but do n't expect to hear about that part on the campaign trail instead , republicans are warning seniors enrolled in these plans that their coverage may disappear senator john barrasso , republican of wyoming , even charged that the cuts would kill the medicare advantage program , which now serves some 11 million beneficiaries that is preposterous the law simply forces managedcare plans to compete on an even basis with the traditional medicare program some beneficiaries may face higher costs or lose some goldplated benefits , but only the most inefficient plans will disappear when the unjustified subsidies that are propping them up are withdrawn republicans are also eagerly , and shamefully , pillorying dr donald berwick , the new head of the centers for medicare and medicaid services there are few figures who command greater respect for uniting health professionals and institutions to improve the quality of medical care while reducing costs that is not stopping these critics from implying baselessly that he will introduce socialized medicine and death panels in this country the truth is that dr berwick has praised the socialized british health care system , especially for its emphasis on primary care this country certainly needs to do more to develop its primary care system and he has , rightly , called for an open discussion of the health care rationing that is already widespread in our system when insurers decline to cover procedures , or high prices screen out lowincome people , that is rationing dr berwick has endorsed the use of comparative effectiveness research to determine which treatments work best he would use such research to judge whether a new drug or procedure is worth the cost of coverage , a step the reform law shies away from he does not have the power to change that law but the issue will have to be addressed at some point if there is to be any hope of restraining medical spending democrats have to counter the republicans' demagoguery with facts americans need to understand that if senator cornyn and others get their way , runaway health care costs will only get worse democrats should not be shy about touting reform s benefits for improving americans' lives or its potential for reducing the deficit they also need to tell americans that there are even tougher choices to make ahead voters may find it refreshing to hear politicians tell them the truth
unless congress and president obama act soon , americans' taxes will increase in 2011 , when the cuts enacted under president george w bush are due to expire almost everyone agrees that this makes little sense given the economy s fragility but consensus ends there the president supports permanently extending the current tax rates for all except the highestincome households , while congressional republicans want the entire basket of cuts to be made permanent the prudent middle ground would be to forestall any tax increases in 2011 and to phase in higher rates on upperincome households in 2012 , when the economy will be on firmer ground the president s plan would be taking an unnecessary gamble with the struggling recovery businesses have only recently begun to add jobs , and they appear to be a long way from hiring fast enough to reduce unemployment even under the best of circumstances , the unemployment rate will remain near 10 percent well into next year the high rate of joblessness has cast a shadow on the collective psyche that will only worsen with higher taxes , raising the already uncomfortably high odds that the economy will suffer a doubledip recession in most times , raising taxes on the wealthy by such a modest amount has had little impact on the economy but these are n't most times the welltodo appear unusually sensitive to changes in their finances , probably because their nest eggs are significantly smaller with the drop in stock and housing prices only the top 3 percent of households if the president got his way , but this rarefied group currently accounts for a fourth of consumer spending if they pull back , even a bit , the recovery could be derailed successful smallbusiness owners , who power the nation s jobcreation machinery , make up onethird of these highincome taxpayers they have set up their businesses so that their profits are taxed at personal rates raising marginal tax rates , even a little , on those who have suffered during the past several years would be a mistake some people make a more nuanced argument that higher taxes on the wealthy could pay for additional economic stimulus like a bigger job tax credit or resurrected 1930sstyle work programs this view has theoretical merit some of my own analysis has been used to support it but it is asking too much of our political system now to get it just right i'm skeptical that a politicized congress would be able to pull it off , and failure to do so would leave us next year with higher taxes and a hobbled recovery on the other hand , the republican proposal to keep the current tax rates permanently in place even for the wealthy takes an unnecessary gamble with our longterm fiscal outlook tax cuts do not pay for themselves even when president ronald reagan slashed much higher tax rates in half , this argument failed in the current tax debate , it is unsupportable by definition , highincome households are where the money is higher rates would raise substantial revenue for longterm deficit reduction once the recovery is off and running , and stock and housing prices are consistently rising , allowing the bush tax cuts for highincome households to expire over , say , a threeyear period would not harm the economy the overwhelming fear among high earners that their lifestyles will be forever diminished should have faded , and the tax increases would be small enough not to materially alter wealthy people s decisions about spending , working or investing keep in mind that the economy performed admirably in the 1990s when highincome households paid the same higher tax rates and the wealthy would benefit as much as anyone from reducing the federal deficit , because that would keep interest rates low , spurring investment and job creation whatever policymakers decide regarding the tax code , they should take action , or agree not to , quickly not knowing what tax rates will be just a few months from now is adding to the collective nervousness , already high after the epic policy debates on health care , financial regulation , energy and immigration all this anxiety is most likely affecting whether businesses hire none of this means the tax code should be off the table when president obama s fiscal commission addresses how to fix our longterm problems past experience with fiscal austerity at home and overseas strongly suggests that it is best for the economy s longrun performance to restrain government spending rather than raise taxes , but taxes must also be part of our national debate in this recession , the government has necessarily made a string of momentous economic policy decisions some have worked well others have been a disaster we ca n't afford any more mistakes
ben foster likes to take walks long , meandering ones they re how he clears his head and gets into character preparing for his role as a stilljumpy army sergeant charged with delivering news of casualties in the messenger , he marched around new york , where he s only just moved after many years in california i d walk for hours and hours for about two months every night , he said , looking at windows and cars , these abandoned cars , and allowing those cars and windows to become threats so someone s in that window and shoots you , you have to be prepared it s a constant readiness so when the bagger met him for an interview the day after a snowstorm recently , we decided to walk and talk about three blocks in , mr foster pulled out a flask of whiskey gulp ! hey , it was cold it s so nice to have an excuse to have a flask in the winter , he said being a walker is it eventually we stopped and sat on a park bench for a long discussion about moviemaking mr foster , whom a o scott has written was among the first rank of young american screen actors , has seen his performance in the film overshadowed by his costar woody harrelson , who earned a golden globe nomination for best supporting actor , among other awards he plays a decorated newbie to mr harrelson s veteran captain in the unwanted job of notifying families that their loved ones have been lost mr harrelson s role is showier , with a real oscar moment when he breaks down mr foster has a similar scene , talking about a battle and the effect it had on him , but he underplays it i watched tapes and tapes and tapes of veterans telling their stories , and none of them felt like movie moments , he said they re all just telling a story , and it s tearing them up inside but the way that people talk in films , or express emotion in films traditionally , is less discordant is discordant the right word \? an imbalance of musicality there s a fluidity to feeling in film which is its own language watching these guys and talking to them and having people tell me their stories , the hardest part was not leaning into those traditions of film , not making it a movie moment , where now i m telling my monologue i so desperately didn t want it to be that , because the rest of the film was not that he succeeds the scene , toward the end of the film , where he and mr harrelson are lazing on a couch swapping war tales , is subtle and natural mr foster said it was the hardest scene to do his costar helped mr scott wrote that the characters camaraderie is remarkably nuanced and completely convincing offscreen , too , mr foster and mr harrelson are buds , taking care to praise each other , and their director and coscreenwriter , oren moverman , with whom mr foster has started a production company , the third mind \( the name is borrowed from a william s burroughs book \) before we even started shooting , i said to oren , this is the year of the woody , mr foster said and i blush when i talk about him because i love the man so deeply and the courage with which he approached this role he hasn t spilled like that on film \( true the bagger spoke with mr harrelson about it look for that interview friday \) as for his own performance , our approach was that will , his character , doesn t spill , and when we decided that early on , it became really clear that there isn t an arc , a traditionally dramatic arc to the character , he said he s just trying to get through the day like a regular guy he doesn t learn a whole hell of a lot this is not exactly the stuff that oscar bait is made of mr foster has worked the awards circuit before , for 3 10 to yuma , and called his experience mixed it s like you re invited to the club for a minute , and you re being tested and maybe you can really hang out , he said only being invited to the club tangentially for the messenger for now was fine with him , he said in the past i ve done a little more flashy stuff , he said that wasn t what this was about , and that was exciting
joe johnson wonders what if the course of the nba might have been altered when he broke an orbital bone near his left eye in the playoffs five years ago then , was a budding influence on the revolutionary phoenix suns , a 23yearold guard flanked by steve nash , amar'e stoudemire and shawn marion then , mike d'antoni was an offensive innovator with the suns , instead of his current role as the coach of a talentstarved knicks roster pointed decidedly to tomorrow then the injury came it occurred when johnson lost balance on a putback and fell facefirst on the court the injury caused him to miss six playoff games , including the first two of the 2005 western conference finals , in which the san antonio spurs took a 20 lead that proved insurmountable we were really close , johnson said at the atlanta hawks' shootaround monday morning at madison square garden for their game with the knicks we were an injury or so from winning it that s how i felt about it we had just that one year where we were all together and we had a special season , and that s something none of us will ever forget that what if' is always going to be there after that season , johnson orchestrated a signanddeal trade with atlanta , requesting that the suns not match the offer he said he wanted to stake out his own identity with a new team and bravely signed with the hawks , who had just finished 1369 it was n't a tough process , johnson said of free agency i had done my job , which was on the court and then it was time for my agent to do his work for the most part , it was n't hard at all we looked back and saw a few places and just chose atlanta as the best fit after three more years of flirting with records and ignoring the traditional basketball protocol of slowing down offenses , d'antoni also changed course and joined the knicks' reclamation project so far , johnson s hawks have shown the greater maturation atlanta is poised to improve its win total for a fifth consecutive season at 4023 , the hawks are bunched with the cleveland cavaliers , the orlando magic and the boston celtics as the eastern conference s elite teams johnson is leading the hawks by averaging 215 points a game , last month , he started in the allstar game for the first time in his nineyear career the 6foot7 johnson is an adept ball handler for his size , but he can venture through unproductive stretches in games our record indicates he s grown , hawks coach mike woodson said at the shootaround , adding that the pressure on johnson had been eased by the improvement of young players like josh smith and al horford and the acquisition of jamal crawford the foundation was built around joe when he first got here , and we 've gotten better every year because of joe johnson , woodson said the hawks have made the playoffs the last two years after missing them eight years in a row johnson said this season would be incomplete without journeying deep into the playoffs he s been a star player for a long time , crawford said it just so happens his contract is up i think he s focused on trying to win a championship here and going from there , but i think he 'd rather be here than anywhere else i hope , anyways for d'antoni , the second half has disintegrated into little more than games that double as gatherings for players who could be attractive free agents johnson became the latest in the carousel on monday night at the garden , and if he wants to attempt to begin a reclamation process with a third franchise , the opportunity will probably be there johnson rejected an offer for four years and around 60 million from the hawks so he could test unrestricted free agency this summer he is generally viewed as a borderline maximumsalary player he still says d'antoni had one of the largest influences on his career d'antoni increased johnson s playing time when the suns traded stephon marbury and penny hardaway to the knicks he just told me to go out there and do my thing , and i just tried to take full advantage of it , johnson said it turned out to be a pretty good success if d'antoni and johnson are to try to duplicate that with the knicks , the team s fans may view the effort through a prism of disappointment if he is the only major free agent the knicks land while the free agency rumors concerning lebron james , dwyane wade and chris bosh have nearly crashed the internet , johnson has received far less scrutiny flying below the surface fits johnson s lowkey demeanor but it also raises the question of whether he is willing or able to play the role of savior for an intense fan base that has endured basketball indignities for several years the hawks are expected to try to retain johnson meanwhile , the chicago bulls and possibly the los angeles clippers loom as potential suitors i think everybody is going to be in contention , johnson said i ca n't really say just one team that i'm looking forward to playing for i do n't know i think it s going to be an exciting summer , and we 'll see what happens rebounds wilson chandler blocked josh smith s shot as time dwindled , and after a review , the referees ruled that al horford s putback arrived after the buzzer , giving the knicks a 9998 victory over the hawks on monday the knicks held on despite losing nearly all of an 11point lead atlanta s final possession was set up when jamal crawford stole the ball from toney douglas danilo gallinari scored 27 points , his most since jan 16 smith had 25 points and joe johnson 22 for the hawks after setting an nba record by going 0 for 18 on 3point attempts last saturday , the knicks went 10 for 15 tracy mcgrady did not play , resting his surgically repaired left knee
the 16day continues through sunday check back regularly on artsbeat for guidance about what to see from new york times writers and editors a grim chapter in american academic history provides the potent subject matter for veritas , one of the hotter tickets at the new york international fringe festival in 1920 the suicide of a harvard undergraduate inspired an investigation into the sex lives of students that resulted in the expulsion of several young men who confessed to or were accused of engaging in homosexual acts written by stan richardson , and directed by ryan j davis , the play is a fictionalized account of the events that probably seeks a little too hard to entertain us before delving into the unhappy details of the case in the carefree days before the witch hunters gather , the students are depicted as archly spoken , sexually licentious and decoratively campy , trading bon mots and barbed apercus as if they re all desperate to turn life into an oscar wilde play the cavorting liberally laced with hightoned references to shakespeare is moderately amusing but doesn t do much to humanize \( or differentiate \) the characters the allmale cast , nattily dressed in period togs by matthew pachtman , is largely excellent , although none of the 10 central players gets enough stage time to reveal layers , except perhaps for the brother of the dead student who initiates the investigation \( a suitably fraught doug kreeger \) he ultimately ends up in a nuthouse wracked with guilt , having bizarre fantasies of appearing on a game show many years after the events depicted mr richardson departs from straightforward narrative as the play proceeds , with selfconscious theatrical gameplaying that is exacerbated by mr davis s tricksy direction ultimately veritas leaves you wanting to know more about this sad history without necessarily wanting to hear more of this particular take on it all performances are sold out , but veritas plays tuesday at 4 15 , thursday at 3 30 , friday at 5 15 and saturday at 8 at here arts center , 145 sixth avenue
it s just like the nhl to pat itself on the back and trumpet its great accomplishments , then turn around and stab itself in the back , or at least shoot itself in the foot it s a pathology the league has exhibited repeatedly when it comes to changes designed to improve the game no sooner did the league enthusiastically approve rules to take out the twoline offside pass and crack down on obstruction tactics at the end of the lockout than voices were raised by some coaches and general managers against them even today , some want to bring elements of obstruction back into the game  the same is true with hits to the head oh , how the league celebrated itself for the progressive halfstep of outlawing blindside or lateral head shots ! but as soon as players actually started being penalized and even \( gasp ! \) suspended under new rule 48 , the inevitable whining commenced how this hit or that hit really wasn t what the rule intended to prohibit and if this keeps up , body contact which the league says has never been more prevalent nor violent will be threatened with extinction the most recent protesters are the san jose sharks , who just couldn t fathom that this hit by joe thornton on the blues david perron violated the rule thornton got a major and game misconduct , as the rule calls for , and was suspended two games , which was appealed by the sharks the league denied the appeal the sharks contended that what thornton did was exactly what willie mitchell , then of the canucks , did to the blackhawks jonathan toews last year an incident that was shown on the league s video to the clubs on what is and what is not permissible under the new rule but that was rejected by the league \? why \? because thornton didn t do exactly what mitchell did on mitchell s hit , toews s head was not the principle point of contact the sharks also said the contact to the head was minimal , and that perron returned to the game and scored a goal of course , as is widely known , concussions don t always emerge immediately and perron has been out of the blues lineup since that game after experiencing headaches in saturday s morning skate in boston and more concussionlike symptons on sunday just from the elevated heart rate of walking in manhattan \( well , our city does that to visitors on occasion \) , so he didn t play sunday night against the rangers , either but none of that prevented the outcry against what is perceived as a confusing rule on the sharks web site , their radio analyst , jamie baker , ranted how the nhl is wrong ! , going so far as to say that thornton should not have gotten a penalty because the hit wasn t from the blind side and worrying aloud i have to believe that players are going to fake head injuries whenever there is contact from now on the nhl could become the ndl , the national diving league and he called for the abolition of the instigator rule so an offending player could be attacked by a teammate of a fouled player with impunity , which amazingly some still see as a cureall for hockey violence what message is the nhl sending \? baker said playing with your head down is ok \? being bigger is not ok especially when your shoulder is at the same level as someone else s chin \? faking an injury after an apparent head contact hit is ok \? the agent john thornton , whose client brother is out 77 , 41936 , registered his outrage , too , taking a different route he told espncom s pierre lebrun , the league once again failed to follow any precedent they have set when making disciplinary decisions he said the league stated his brother s hit was most similar to the senators nick foligno s hit on carolina s pat dwyer last month which resulted in only a 2 , 500 fine when joe asked the league , directly , what he could have done differently , they could not clearly explain , john thornton said and sarcastically suggested the league s only solution to avoid a suspension could have been for his brother to shrink to 5foot9 so the contact with perron would have been shoulder to shoulder we are extremely disappointed with the league s decision , and feel the continuing uncertainty with league actions will only hurt the fans of the nhl , john thornton added he neglected to add his brother had a history of suspensions while nick foligno had not of course , the blues did not seem confused at all joe thornton is a terrific player , but he crossed the line , the blues president , john davidson , told lebrun is he not supposed to be subject to what the penalties are in this league if he crossed the line \? joe thornton is not a dirty player , but he crossed the line we have a player that can t play tonight because he got a shoulder to the head that was blindsided davidson added he was upset that some even questioned whether perron was injured that s what s really disappointing , he told dan o neill of the st louis postdispatch , to know there were people out there actually being critical of him and questioning the validity of it it should be a lesson to everyone look at boston s marc savard his symptoms didn t show up until a little later and he s still trying to get back predictably , on saturday s hockey night in canada s gripefilled hotstove segment \( at about the threeminute mark \) mike milbury claimed the league dropped the ball by suspending thornton , that it should have just let the ingame penalties suffice what was milbury s reasoning for that \? all he could articulate was that the difference between the mitchell hit and the thornton hit was a fraction of a difference he added maybe there s contact on the head with one and not the other but , oh my god , if you can differentiate between those two , you re a much brighter man than i ok , mike whatever you say the truth for milbury , as he later admitted , is not really in the fractions a player who turns his head to look for a pass should be , he said , fair game he s plainly in favor of checks to the head and against rule 48 pierre lebrun followed that up with news on his conversations with league general managers the people who proposed this rule in the first place are scheduled to meet in toronto on tuesday to discuss how the rule has fared \( among other items \) lebrun said , there s confusion out there on rule 48 and supplemental discipline among players , managers and the league and characterized a number of the managers as in the gray , they re not sure they disagree on a lot of these hits \( milbury continued with a little unchecked tirade on penalties against hits from behind , which is not rule 48 , but perhaps his fellow panelists decided to let him go \) where does all this alleged confusion come from \? the rule is pretty clear and , considering how the league resists change , it s fair to suspect that no one is really confused at all instead , so consumed with defending penalized and suspended players are some that they muddy things up if there is confusion , it could be because this is a halfmeasure that prohibits some contact to the head but allows others , such as on friday night when the officials didn t call rule 48 on the flyers dan carcillo for hitting the rangers ruslan fedotenko perhaps because fedotenko was bent and off balance , perhaps because they judged carcillo couldn t avoid head contact , perhaps because it was not a blindside hit of course , carcillo certainly left his feet to deliver the hit and why charging wasn t called is a mystery so with all this alleged confusion , does that mean the general managers will urge the league to retreat on rule 48 \? if they think like milbury or feel their suspended players were victims rather than perpetrators , they might perhaps some confusion could be avoided if the nhl better explained their rulings on rule 48 and elsewhere when the rule was first proposed , bruins general manager peter chiarelli noted that one of the criteria the gm s had discussed centered around what they re classifying as the triangle , or a player s scope of vision while hits within the triangle can be acceptable , the aim is to address head shots that are delivered outside of a player s scope of vision had that terminology been adopted , there would be no question that thornton s hit fell outside the bounds of permitted head contact but the notion of the triangle of a player s scope of vision has not been part of the discourse on this rule and the fan blogger identified as mr plank on the blog fear the fin had this suggestion the league release a video of suspensions , complete with audio commentary throughout , explaining why each incident was suspendable according to the current nhl rulebook we re going to assume here that mike murphy and colin campbell went over the tape for \( at the very least \) 15 minutes before reaching their ruling it would be ridiculous to suggest otherwise in that time frame they looked at every angle available to them , took into account the game situation , analyzed body positioning , scrutinized the rulebook , and went over the offending player s disciplinary history condensing the notes and analysis from those meetings into a minutelong video released to the press and via email and web would be a quick process to undergo it explains what they saw , how they came to their conclusion , and why they chose to implement \( or not implement \) punishment in the way that they did it makes a lot of sense which is why we should not expect to see it happen any time soon
rome with tensions high on the eve of what is expected to be another round of large demonstrations here , the rome police found a rudimentary , defective bomb under a seat in the subway on tuesday , officials said the authorities isolated a subway stop , but did not shut down the system , and the mayor said the bomb would not have been able to explode a conductor found a package containing an assembly of tubes , wiring and a small amount of explosive powder about 10 am as the train was at the outskirts of the city , the rome transport agency said in a statement a remotecontrol detonator in the package was missing a necessary part , said a spokesman for the carabinieri , italy s paramilitary police force rome s mayor , gianni alemanno , said the device was too rudimentary to work i can guarantee citizens that all stations of the subway have been checked and there are no further dangers , he said in a statement concerns over possible attacks are high across europe in the wake of a suicide bombing by an iraqiborn swede in stockholm last week reports of attacks planned against germany , modeled on the 2008 raids in mumbai , india and terrorism arrests in britain , france and spain this fall , american officials warned of terrorist threats against european targets large demonstrations are expected wednesday , when the senate is expected to vote on a contentious school reform bill last week , protests against prime minister silvio berlusconi turned violent and the police used tear gas on demonstrators who smashed shop windows and burned cars an estimated 100 people were wounded , none seriously , in the worst violence in downtown rome in years several dozen young people were detained for questioning , but none arrested mr berlusconi narrowly by three votes last week , but he still governs with a razorthin majority and his government is seen to be at its weakest point in recent days , government officials have ratcheted up rhetoric , warning against violence
dokan , iraq serving small glasses of sugary tea , qadir abdulrahman ahmed explained how things went bad with the neighbors it was not true , he said , that his brothers had threatened to drown his niece if she tried to marry the young man down the street we are not against humanity , he explained i told my brother , if she wants to marry , you ca n't stop her but the couple should never have married without permission the girl and the boy should be killed , he said it s about honor honor is more important for us than religion honor killing has a long history in and here in the semiautonomous region of kurdistan but even here , this couple s case stood out because the man was killed , not the woman , and because of the political clout of the warring families as some iraqi lawmakers try to crack down on honor killing , the case in which there have been no arrests also illustrates how difficult it can be to uproot a deepseated tribal honor code more than 12 , 000 women were killed in the name of honor in kurdistan from 1991 to 2007 , according to aso kamal of the doaa network against violence government figures are much lower , and show a decline in recent years , and kurdish law has mandated since 2008 that an honor killing be treated like any other murder but the practice continues , and the crime is often hidden or disguised to look like suicide it was in this climate that mr ahmed s niece , sirwa hama amin , fell in love with her neighbor , aram jamal rasool , in this village in northern iraq on a recent afternoon in the home of mr rasool s father , ms amin , 22 , showed wedding portraits of herself and mr rasool a smiling young couple in formal dress , the bride showing none of the strain that marked the pale woman displaying the photographs ms amin and mr rasool , 27 , grew up across the dusty road from each other , where each family had expanded in a string of houses so close together that their roofs nearly touched mr rasool s father , jamal rasool salih , 58 , a retired general in the kurdish military , or pesh merga , helped ms amin s family move to dokan from iran in 1993 , and the two families became intertwined like general salih , ms amin s brothers and uncles joined the pesh merga and the patriotic union of kurdistan , the town s dominant political party one of ms amin s brothers married the general s daughter and became his bodyguard the general s son aram was a regular visitor in ms amin s home still , when the couple fell in love a couple of years ago , they kept their passion secret , knowing their families would not approve general salih said he considered ms amin s relatives unruly soldiers and hellcats , always shooting people ms amin s relatives mocked mr rasool because he limped the problems started when ms amin s brother caught her sending a text message to mr rasool on her cellphone in socially regimented iraq , cellphones and the internet have enabled lovers to communicate outside the censorious eyes of their families but this liberation has come at a price , said behar rafeq , director of the shelter for threatened women in erbil of the 24 women in the shelter on a recent day , 15 had encountered threats or violence because of their communications on cellphones or facebook , ms rafeq said ms amin said her male relatives threatened to drown her and took away her phone mr ahmed , ms amin s uncle , denied the threats if the two wished to marry , he said , the appropriate way was for general salih , accompanied by a delegation of tribal leaders , to ask for her hand instead , he sent surrogates if someone does n't come and ask respectfully , how can you agree to that \? he asked general salih said he did not want the marriage , either ms amin became a captive in her home one of mr rasool s brothers , rizgar jamal rasool , 36 , said that when he visited , he found ms amin tearful and beaten , her face swollen ms amin and mr rasool became desperate , she said , and plotted ways to kill themselves on sept 2 , 2009 , she sneaked out of her parents' house , walking across the roofs of the adjoining homes and down to a toyota land cruiser mr rasool was waiting inside , with a grenade he had stolen from his father i said , let s kill ourselves , ' ms amin said he said , no , let s only do it if they find us' instead , the couple went to the police , explaining that they had been threatened because they wanted to marry mr rasool was held for possession of the grenade ms amin was sent to a shelter for battered women he was arrested because i wanted him arrested for safety , general salih said the day they ran away , her uncle , a military captain , called me and said , i 'll burn your house and kill you all if you do n't get the couple back today' the couple appealed to the court , and two weeks later , after submitting their paperwork , they were married though ms amin s family objected to the marriage , she said , they agreed to a truce if the newlyweds promised to leave dokan and never return , her relatives agreed not to hunt her down for three and a half months the couple lived in sulaimaniya , an hour from dokan then , on jan 2 around 9 pm , ms amin said , she was in the bathroom when she heard gunshots and her husband shouting her name she opened the bathroom door and saw her husband covered in blood and one of her brothers aiming a gun at her i saw only my brother , but someone else shot aram , she said before the smoke cleared , gunmen fired 17 bullets into mr rasool s chest and 4 into ms amin s leg and hip , general salih said according to mr ahmed , the brother who did the shooting was hussein hama amin , a soldier in the pesh merga mr amin denied killing his brotherinlaw but said he paid 10 , 000 to another brother , and to one of mr rasool s brothers , to kill the couple why should she live after she has been that irresponsible about the honor of her family \? mr amin said ms amin was two months pregnant at the time the authorities in kurdistan have made great strides against honor killing , said kurdo omer abdulla , director of the general directorate to trace violence against women , a government agency every year we see a decrease in the statistics of violence against women , she said for the two families , the killing did not resolve the conflict the police arrested no one instead , the patriotic union of kurdistan , tribal leaders and clerics brought the families together in a formal council session in front of more than 4 , 000 local residents general salih said he was pressed by the party to forgive his son s killers and promise not to kill them ms amin s family was required to promise not to kill her the two families provide conflicting accounts on whether money was also exchanged her relatives said they have disowned her but would not harm her may god kill her , hussein hama amin said we will not kill her in general salih s living room , ms amin dandled her 4monthold son , named aram after her husband by kurdish custom she is now disgraced and unsuitable for marriage she lives a few hundred feet from the family that cast her out , in a house filled with weapons , afraid that her relatives will try to kill her when she leaves the house , she is escorted by armed inlaws general salih remains bitter at his neighbors , the party and the tribal leaders , who have refused to make any arrests i'm a powerful person , he said i could kill them but i do n't they should get arrested , he said instead they get salaries there is no law
montreal there is still magic this postseason for the  they were down by 21 , outshot by 259 and thoroughly outplayed by the defending stanley cup champion over two periods on thursday but then the ghosts or the mystique or whatever it is that has propelled the canadiens to unexpected glory this spring took over just 2 minutes 7 seconds into the third period , maxim lapierre twirled 270 degrees behind the penguins' net and beat goalie marcandre fleury to tie the score only 93 seconds later , brian gionta s centering pass bounced into the pittsburgh net off the leg of penguins defenseman kris letang then the canadiens' improbable postseason hero , goalie jaroslav halak , robbed at the side of the net on a powerplay chance with 10 minutes left and evgeni malkin on a breakaway with four minutes to go and as the penguins tried desperately to tie the score in the last minute , halak cleared the zone himself we have nothing to lose because we 're not even supposed to be here , said halak , whose goalkeeping helped the canadiens stun washington , the nhl s top team , in the first round no one gave us a chance to go through the first round and right now , even in the second , people thought we 'd lose four straight but here we are the series is tied at two games apiece and continues in pittsburgh on saturday what happened in the canadiens' dressing room during that second intermission \? did jacques martin , the usually laconic coach , deliver a paintpeeling speech \? he had a little fire to him , but he picked up on the mood of the whole team , montreal defenseman hal gill said we all knew it was n't good enough , that we had taken two periods off , and we had to put it together in the third jacques said it , but we were all thinking it martin also showed fire on the bench , complaining about baffling officiating from the referees paul devorski and eric furlatt their calls came in the wake of a debate that had broken out overnight in the montreal sports media over whether crosby was a crybaby and was receiving preferential treatment devorski , furlatt and their two linesmen got in the way of pucks four times during the game , once leading to a breakaway chance for crosby but what really raised the ire of the sellout bell centre crowd was what happened leading up to the firstperiod goal that made the score 21 for pittsburgh with gill off for holding , crosby clamped down on the stick of canadiens defenseman roman hamrlik with a borderline slash that was not called hamrlik fell to the ice boos were still resounding when crosby s pass bounced off chris kunitz s skate and into the net at 5 18 of the period the goal survived a long video review , and the penguins had the lead it got worse for the officiating crew later in the period , when penguins defenseman mark eaton was not called for reaching out and hitting andrei kostitsyn high at the end of the period , gill was called for breaking crosby s stick in half , an obvious slash but one that resembled crosby s play on hamrlik it did not help that crosby held up his hands imploringly for the officials , and the fans booed the player they were now convinced was a crybaby mathieu darche , who dressed for game 3 but did not play a single shift , skated for 8 12 and assisted on lapierre s goal we were worried too much about the refs at first , darche said when you have 22 , 000 people screaming at them , they do n't need us screaming at them crosby put five shots on halak and had an assist but failed to score for a fifth straight game did he feel that he would put one in soon \? i think you always feel like that , whether i have eight goals at this point or whether i have none , crosby said honestly , i would n't change what i'm doing out there you just try to make sure you 're doing your part slap shots jordan staal played 13 24 for pittsburgh just five days after undergoing surgery to repair a sliced tendon on top of his right foot but missed a second straight game with what is believed to be back spasms

at what point , in the name of entertainment , is it acceptable to just give up on trying to develop an original , nuanced perspective on history and instead merely embrace the clich s inherited from earlier media \? i doubt this is a question the developers of mafia ii , from s 2k games label , ever asked themselves if they did , their answer was obviously , right now the sad truth is that the actual historical reality of italian organized crime in the united states is basically irrelevant by now perhaps no element of american history has been as thoroughly mythologized as far as the general public is concerned , michael corleone and tony soprano might as well be real people so it would be disingenuous to say i am surprised that when 2k czech , a video game studio in brno , czech republic , set out to make a game set among new york city mafia families in the 1940s and '50s , it ended up with little more than a pastiche of tropes , stereotypes and entire scenes cut from the movies and television shows that form the pantheon of mafia folklore if you 've seen the godfather films and goodfellas \( and who has n't \? \) , you have most of mafia ii covered already let s see if any of this sounds familiar the protagonist of mafia ii the player is named vito he is born in sicily but comes to new york as a boy he enlists in the army during world war ii , returns a decorated hero and then throws himself into a life of crime there is the selling cigarettes from the back of a truck scene there is the scene and of course there is the decomposing body in the trunk that we have to go bury scene and that s all just in the first half of this 10 to 12hour story in the second half we find out that one of the mafia guys is a government informant who must be whacked we infiltrate a chinese restaurant that \( of course \) is a front for an opium distribution operation and try to sell the dope to black people in the ghetto \( the game also reflects the casual racism of the time and makes frequent use of an italian epithet for black people \) none of this is outrageously implausible but none of it is strikingly original either that said , mafia ii does a nice job of luring the player into a suspension of disbelief , as long as you accept that you are entering an interactive take on the world of mob movies visually 2k czech has superbly evoked the feel of the 1940s and '50s the game does not try to recreate new york city geography exactly , but the overall architecture and art design are close to impeccable , from the empire state building and the chrysler building looming above to the various storefronts and sidewalk scenes the voice acting is generally quite convincing within the accepted hollywood vernacular of italian mobtalk the musical scoring is excellent , and the original orchestral pieces are as evocative as those in most bigbudget films the licensed music used on the various radio stations \( split up , of course , between music by white artists and music by black artists , as one would expect \) makes all of the driving you have to do at least somewhat bearable ah , yes , the driving from a gameplay perspective the biggest problem with mafia ii is that you simply are not given enough to do far too much of the game consists of merely driving from one place in the city to another , watching a noninteractive scene that develops the plot \( such as it is \) , and then driving somewhere else where all you might have to do is go to sleep the gunfighting mechanics are enjoyable , but i found myself wishing for more involved and complicated combat situations superficially mafia ii resembles parts of its big brother , the series \( made by rockstar games , a separate taketwo division \) , but while the gta games inundate the player with side quests and optional activities throughout their urban landscapes , the world of mafia ii is surprisingly empty once you get past the attractive visuals there are just a few optional activities \( like stealing cars \) , but the bigger problem is that there is simply no need to engage in them you almost never need to do anything with the money you earn , and so the city becomes merely a backdrop for driving from one mission to the next mafia ii is not a bad game its overall production quality is excellent , and the 2k czech team clearly put a lot of effort into building the game s scaffolds but they simply did not inhabit the game with any real narrative creativity or enough gameplay depth to make it a real mafia kingpin
thierry henry is probably the most reviled soccer player in ireland now he can probably add soccer fans in the dallas area to that list henry , the red bulls striker , earned the opprobrium of much of the soccer world when his blatant hand ball during a world cup qualifier eliminated ireland and sent france to south africa that the french team imploded during the tournament brought little solace to irish fans fastforward a couple of months to thursday night s major league soccer encounter between fc dallas and the red bulls at pizza hut park in frisco , tex the match had just about everything the debut of red bulls midfielder mehdi ballouchy the red bulls leading scorer , juan pablo angel , starting the game on the bench a red card issued to dallas s brek shea for a twofooted tackle from behind on chris albright and a wonderful goal by the dallas rookie eric alexander as dallas extended its unbeaten streak in mls to 15 the red bulls escaped with a point when joel lindpere s cross from the left flank late in the match was headed into his own goal by dallas defender jair benitez but it was ballouchy s goal , which made it 11 in the waning seconds of the first half , that has prompted discussion around the league after ballouchy tucked home a cross from lindpere , dallas goalkeeper kevin hartman \( the league s top keeper this season with a 062 goal against average , 9 shutouts and a 1018 record \) stood over the ball , waiting to kick it toward the center spot in came henry , who swung fullforce with his right foot and caught hartman limplegged hartman fell to the turf in pain henry walked with him off the field , trying to assuage any damage , but hartman wanted to hear none of it he attempted to return for the second half , but was in pain and was replaced by the 35yearold dario sala it is interesting to note that henry was already playing with one yellow card and could have \( should have \? \) been shown a second yellow and ejected he was not a couple of postgame comments dallas coach schellas hyndman it was something that was not necessary henry the ball was there and like i do sometimes , i just wanted to kick the ball back in the net he put his foot out there and that s how he got injured that was unfortunate i went to apologize at halftime because i didn t mean to hurt him he put his foot out there and i just wanted to smash the ball back in the net a pure accident i told him i was sorry he accepted it it was one of those stupid things hartman it s just one of those things that happens should henry have been ejected \?
senator byron dorgan is retiring ! i know this comes as a shock to you , people also senator chris dodd ! we are only one week into the new year , and the political world is in turmoil it s a wonder we can continue on with our regular duties two democratic senators quitting is seen as a terrible portent for 2010 \( democrats' black tuesday , said a headline on msnbc \) that seems a tad overblown given the fact that six republican senators already have announced their retirements plus , dodd has been in terrible trouble back home ever since he ran for president and tried to get a jump on the competition by moving his family to iowa connecticut has feelings , too when your senator registers his daughter in kindergarten in des moines , the voters in bridgeport do n't feel the love it s really all good for the nutmeg state democrats dodd can leave with dignity he has an overall record to be proud of , including a major role in health care reform he also worked very hard on issues that have no political payoff whatsoever , like early childhood education in his place , the democrats can nominate the popular attorney general , richard blumenthal , who has been waiting in the wings since cyndi lauper was at the top of the charts he was the democrats' young man on the rise in the '70s , and he s been attorney general for nearly it s a good thing dodd decided to get out of the way now or when blumenthal s turn came , connecticut would have wound up electing a new senator who looked like robert byrd without seniority blumenthal s opponent might turn out to be linda mcmahon , who formerly ran world wrestling entertainment with her husband , vince there are other , perhaps better , republican candidates in the race , but i am rooting for mcmahon for entertainment value she used to be a central character in cable wrestling shows whose scripts had family members shrieking , betraying and , occasionally , slugging one another one episode featured a villain who broke into the palatial mcmahon headquarters while linda was recovering from a neck injury that she had received when an aggrieved wrestler flipped her upside down and slammed her head onto the floor you are a rather aggressive beauty , are n't you \? he breathed , before forcing a kiss upon her resistant lips and promising to break both her son s legs lately , there have not been all that many good times on the political front in washington , the democrats are sulky about obama spending all his political capital on health care while the sane people in both parties are completely freaked out by the tea partiers meanwhile , interested civilians are being required to spend an excessive amount of time worrying about cloture votes and yearning for the good old days when the only senators you had to know anything about were your own until recently , all i knew about byron dorgan was that he was a populist from north dakota who had once been named person of the year by the durum wheat growers now he is the center of the universe in north dakota , democrats are petitioning him to change his mind and run again the 60th vote could hang on it ! nobody seemed to have expected dorgan to call it quits even though he has been a professional politician since he was 26 and made history as the most youthful person ever appointed to the north dakota tax commission now the guy is 67 years old , and he says he wants to write books and teach i think we should give him a thumbs up on his new life plan , except for the part about how he might also like to work on energy policy in the private sector that sure does sound like a lobbyist , but perhaps it just means investing in a gas station i'm beginning to suspect that he does n't expect to go back to north dakota at all i am basing this mainly on the fact that the page on the byron dorgan web site lists 19 people , none of whom seem to actually live there in fact , seven of them are dead and one of the others is the guy who is married to the pop star fergie no wonder that when dorgan bolted , a top north dakota democrat instantly called ed schultz , the former fargo native turned msnbc talkshow host , and asked him if he had ever thought about running for the senate even the people in north dakota do n't seem to think there are any actual residents left in the state you 're giving yourself too little credit , north dakota democrats there s got to be a potential junior senator somewhere in your 641 , 000 fine residents who , of course , get exactly the same number of senate votes as the 368 million people in california but that s a complaint for another day
peshawar , pakistan a steppedup campaign of american strikes over the past three months has battered and its pakistani and afghan brethren in the tribal area of north waziristan , according to a midranking militant and supporters of the government there the strikes have cast a pall of fear over an area that was once a free zone for al qaeda and the taliban , forcing militants to abandon satellite phones and large gatherings in favor of communicating by courier and moving stealthily in small groups , they said the drones , operated by the , fly overhead sometimes four at a time , emitting a beelike hum virtually 24 hours a day , observing and tracking targets , then unleashing missiles on their quarry , they said the strikes have sharpened tensions between the local tribesmen and the militants , who have dumped bodies with signs accusing the victims of being american spies in miram shah , the main town in north waziristan , they said the impact of the drone strikes on the militants' operations on freedom of movement , ability to communicate and the ease of importing new recruits to replace those who have been killed has been difficult to divine because north waziristan , at the nether reaches of the tribal area , is virtually sealed from the outside world none of those interviewed would allow their names to be used for fear for their safety , and all were interviewed separately in a city outside the tribal areas the supporters of the government worked in positions where they had access to information about the effects of the drone campaign along with that of the militant , the accounts provided a rare window on how the drones have transformed life for all in the region by all reports , the bombardment of north waziristan , and to a lesser extent south waziristan , has become fast and furious since a combined taliban and qaeda , in southern afghanistan , in late december in the first six weeks of this year , more than suspected of being militants , according to pakistani and american accounts there are now multiple strikes on some days , and in some weeks the strikes occur every other day , the people from north waziristan said the strikes have become so ferocious , it seems they really want to kill everyone , not just the leaders , said the militant , who is a midranking fighter associated with the insurgent network headed by jalaluddin and sirajuddin haqqani by everyone he meant rankandfile fighters , though civilians are being killed , too tactics used just a year ago to avoid the drones could not be relied on , he said it is , for instance , no longer feasible to sleep under the trees as a way of avoiding the drones we ca n't lead a jungle existence for 24 hours every day , he said militants now sneak into villages two at a time to sleep , he said some homeowners were refusing to rent space to arabs , who are associated with al qaeda , for fear of their families' being killed by the drones , he said the militants have abandoned allterrain vehicles in favor of humdrum public transportation , one of the government supporters said the arabs , who have always preferred to keep at a distance from the locals , have now gone further underground , resorting to hideouts in tunnels dug into the mountainside in the datta khel area adjacent to miram shah , he said definitely haqqani is under a lot of pressure , the militant said he has lost commanders , a brother and other family members while unpopular among the pakistani public , the drone strikes have become a weapon of choice for the obama administration after the pakistani army rebuffed pleas to mount a ground offensive in north waziristan to take on the militants who use the area to strike at american and nato forces in afghanistan the pakistani military says it is already overstretched fighting militants on other fronts but the militants in north waziristan the haqqani network backed by al qaeda are also longtime allies of s military and intelligence services the group may yet prove useful for pakistan to exert influence in postwar afghanistan the army maintains a division of soldiers in north waziristan , but , the militant said , the pakistani soldiers do little to hinder militant operations , which , though under greater pressure from the drones , have by no means stopped training sessions on how to make for use against american and nato soldiers in afghanistan continue , the militant said at one eightday crash course in march , the militant said he learned how to mix explosive chemicals and how to load a car with explosives that would be used in suicide bombings in public , the pakistani government opposes the drones , citing a violation of sovereignty under american pressure , however , the pakistani intelligence agency , interservices intelligence , has provided important intelligence for targets , american and pakistani officials have said but increasingly the americans appear to have developed their own sources , the militant said an influx of young arabs turned up in north waziristan recently , presumably to replace some of the older arabs who had been killed by the drones but many militants assumed that some of these arabs were actually american agents , he said al qaeda is very careful who they take among the new arab recruits because they are informants for america , the militant said perhaps the most disturbing strike for the haqqanis was the , mohammad , on feb 16 one government supporter in the area said he witnessed the attack i was walking when i saw two drones , one going in one direction , one in another direction i had a feeling they were preparing , he said there were two blasts when a car was hit about 1 , 200 feet in front of him , he said there was total dust , everything was hazy , he said suddenly , haqqani fighters appeared out of nowhere all these vehicles rushed up , cordoned the site so no outsider could come they took away the dead bodies the question of civilian deaths is an almost daily worry , all four men said civilians are worried because there is hardly a house without a fighter , the militant said two of the government supporters said they knew of civilians , including friends , who had been killed by being in the wrong place at the wrong time but , they said , they are prepared to sacrifice the civilians if it means north waziristan will be rid of the militants , in particular the arabs on balance , the drones may have killed 100 , 200 , 500 civilians , said one of the men if you look at the other guys , the arabs and the kidnappings and the targeted killings , i would go for the drones

hooliganism is rare in tennis , on the courts or in the stands so when a heated argument turned into a brief melee thursday night in the upper reaches of arthur ashe stadium and two men tumbled down a few rows of 45 seats it was captured by fans with camera phones , not espn the fight was not bloody and none of the three combatants were seriously injured still , one of the videos has been viewed on youtube more than 180 , 000 times the rapid spread of the is another example of the power of citizenshot footage , regardless of its quality network cameras do not routinely cut to fans fighting or trespassing on the field of play unless they disturb the action or do something newsworthy but thanks to mobile devices , fans can record the action from a separate universe of violent and embarrassing behavior that does not make it on network broadcasts youtube has plenty of videos of fanonfan violence at soccer games in asia and europe , football games in the united states and at a baseball game at citizens bank park , where , as phillies fans rumbled , someone said , all i want is a cheese steak the technology of the video cellphone gives you maybe 30 , 000 deputized people at a sporting event covering what s going on in the stands , said robert j thompson , the founding director of the bleier center for television and popular culture at syracuse university you 've turned spectators into deputized producers of content , he said the melee was a new york moment it occurred in the most boisterous of grand slam stadiums , in the \( relatively \) cheap sets where gentility is not always observed , during the secondround match between novak djokovic and philipp petzschner there was the tshirted man in his 20s with his fuhgeddaboudit accent and profane language he jabbered angrily with a woman in her 40s , who , like the younger man , gave no indication that she was willing to back down and then there was her father , a septuagenarian who at one point tugged at her shirt to persuade her to sit down and be quiet what prompted the dispute was not immediately clear but she slapped the younger man the sound of palm connecting with cheek rang out on one of the videos he laughed it off he smirked i can take 20 of those , he said , bragging the argument continued , with only his voice audible in a second video he insisted that he was not talking during points and defended one reason for his being there i got a lot of money on this game , he said eventually , the woman sat down but her father stepped around her , then attacked the younger man as he settled into his seat they jostled each other and fell over rows of seats around them , the other fans did little but react to the action or shout for security to intervene \( which they did two minutes into the altercation \) the tone of the comments from surrounding fans excluding the narrator of one video indicated they were siding with the woman throw the bum out , one of them exhorted another said loudly , get it on youtube ! at the end of his threeminute production , the director producer of the viral video promised that the whole escapade was on its way to youtube and added , well , back to some tennis all three fighters were taken into custody but not arrested the daily news identified the younger man as joey pedevill , 27 the woman as tracey falco , 49 and her father as lawrence burnett , 75 chris widmaier , managing director of corporate communications for the usta , said the three were barred from attending the open until 2013 alerted that someone had fallen in the stands , espn cut twice to the upper deck , once with a very wide shot , and one that zoomed in closer but the action was over the tennis channel used none of the espn footage in its thursday night or friday morning studio programs espn did have one reaction shot to the fight it showed djokovic watching it jamie reynolds , an espn vice president , said that a quick assessment indicated that the melee was not a newsworthy event like the brawl in late 2004 between the indiana pacers and the detroit pistons at the palace of auburn hills that spilled into the stands and injured nine fans networks are not bound by their contracts with leagues to keep their cameras from covering fan fights or their intrusions onto the field sometimes , when a fan seems about to attack a player , it is difficult for a network to ignore the potential to cover breaking news but mostly , the networks stay away from showing aberrant fan behavior to discourage others from doing it but david hill , the chairman of fox sports , said , if an offfield incident occurs that the players are watching , we show it but if it s not disturbing the field of play , what s the point \? he said jokingly that he would have shown the fight at arthur ashe stadium , go to slowmo , and ask for boxing commentary but , he said , such moments often end too quickly to be captured by a network but not for the many citizen producers who are armed with cellphones or other devices christian end , an assistant professor of psychology at xavier university , said a fight video like thursday night s could distort the truth of an event a million people may watch it and they 'll say the crowd really got out of hand at the , he said but the reality is that was between three people fans using their mobile devices to chronicle activities on and off a field are no longer there for the sole purpose of rooting for their teams or relaxing with their likeminded comrades instead , they are using their phones to create a new type of fan engagement , said james e katz , director for the center for mobile communications studies at rutgers university it removes the fan from the firsthand experience while creating an artifact to be enjoyed later , he said no longer fully connected as a fan , he added , you 're responsible for holding the gadget in the right way to zoom in on the action you 're operating a machine , not having an experience or , at least a different one , as modern as fans cooling off in a pool or dining on fine food in a club while watching the game from behind glass the videographer behind the viral video from ashe stadium sounded excited when he said , hey man , i got it on video , my friend
zach lowe writes for he grew up in connecticut watching the birdera celtics with his father and hating chuck person he now lives in manhattan and dreams of a day in his adult lifetime when the celtics and the knicks are both elite teams it was only about three weeks ago that ray allen hit a record eight 3pointers in almost singlehandedly winning game 2 of the finals for the boston celtics now allen is a free agent , and traditional measures suggest signing him to a multiyear deal is a major risk allen turns 35 in july only one shooting guard in modern history reggie miller , with a distribution of 2 and 3point shot attempts similar to allen s has remained productive past the age of 35 the rest fell off quickly because of age and injuries , and were mostly out of the league by the time they turned 36 , according to basketballreferencecom  allen s traditional stats declined across the board last season his 363 percent mark from 3point range was the second worst of his career and his lowest in any season since 1999 it is very easy to craft an argument that allen is worth , at best , a oneyear deal valued at the midlevel exception \( expected to fall around 6 million \) , and team executives are surely preparing to make that argument with allen s agent this week but there is one argument ray allen has on his side his teams play much , much better when he is on the floor last season , for instance , the celtics scored about 7 more points per 100 possessions and allowed about 4 fewer points per 100 possessions when allen was on the floor , versus when he was on the bench , according to basketball value s database the celtics , in other words , were about 11 points better per 100 possessions with allen on the court only five players had a greater positive impact on their team s scoring margin lebron james , dwyane wade , kevin durant , kobe bryant and anderson varejao that 11 net impact represents just a slight jump from 2009 , when the celtics were about 9 points better per 100 possessions with allen on the floor versus with him on the bench , a number only 17 other players topped in that season it is easy to dismiss these numbers as the product of the celtics , an outstanding team , and not of allen but the numbers suggest otherwise mathematicians around the nba have developed several different adjusted plus minus systems , which tweak the numbers to adjust for the quality of a player s teammates and opponents the idea is to isolate an individual player s contributions and separate the true assets from those riding the coattails of teammates allen has topped the celtics in basketball value s adjusted plus minus metric in each of the last two seasons , and none of his teammates have come close to him over those two seasons , only three players in the nba had better adjusted plus minus marks in basketball value s system wade , james and steve nash it s not just basketball value s system , either wayne winston , a professor at indiana university and a former consultant to the dallas mavericks , has his own proprietary adjusted plus minus formula allen has ranked as one of the 10 best players in nba in his system over the last two years , winston said about 10 of the nba s 30 teams are known to use their own sophisticated statistical analyses , and the rest at least consult publicly available advanced statistics such as those at basketball value the trick in valuing allen , league executives said , is to try to figure out why allen s plus minus numbers look so good something is going right , but is it real \? asked one league executive , who requested anonymity since executives are not allowed to discuss free agents publicly before july 1 does he happen to be on the court with the right people \? should i be buying ray allen , or ray allen and a particular player with a particular skill \? one interesting thing that is going right allen seems to be able to elevate the play of bench units , something not every star player can do last season , allen played 72 minutes with the same four bench players eddie house , shelden williams , rasheed wallace and marquis daniels only six fiveman units spent more time on the court together for the celtics that unit scored about 116 points per 100 possessions better than the leaguebest phoenix suns offense averaged over the full season and allowed just 101 points per 100 possessions , according to 82gamescom the same four bench players struggled badly with paul pierce in allen s place that lineup scored just 101 points per 100 possessions and allowed 116 , numbers that would have ranked last in the league that productivity gap did not surprise obsessive boston fans , because it also happened in 2009 , when the lineup of ray allen and four bench players \( tony allen , eddie house , leon powe and glen davis \) scored 113 points per 100 possessions and allowed just 99 the same four players with pierce scored just 104 points per 100 possessions , a mark that would usually rank near the bottom of the league \( both of those lineups were among the five combinations boston used most often in 2009 , so the sample sizes are fairly large \) publicly available numbers from allen s years with the seattle supersonics show lineups including allen and at least two bench players usually outperformed seattle s starters these numbers make valuing allen one of the trickier decisions of the offseason traditional statistics and aging patterns would advise against signing allen to a multiyear deal worth 10 million per season but plus minus metrics appear to show allen is bringing something to the game that is more difficult to quantify , and his legendary workout regimen and diet might make it possible for allen to fight the nba aging process better than most players it s easy to bowl over lebron james or dwyane wade with a maximum offer and promises of a championship dynasty but how do you negotiate with ray allen and his agent \?

one of the most contentious rivalries of baseball s wildcard era has lain dormant for a half decade while a new rivalry with new villains supplanted it but this weekend , old foes will again be joined in conflict , and for the first time in years familiar names like chipper jones and bobby cox will again take on a villainous appeal for the first time since the and the flipflopped their positions in 2006 , the braves come to new york with both teams in realistic pursuit of a division title on friday , the teams open a threegame series at citi field with the braves holding a threegame lead over the mets in the national league east there s no doubt this is a big series , mets general manager omar minaya said there is a lot of baseball left to play this summer but it s the first time in a long time where we 've been first and second this late in the season , so it s important this was once a rivalry so impassioned that a string of invective from reliever john rocker could mobilize scores of police officers , dogs and helicopters where a midseason break began with a fiveinch gash on mike piazza s leg where chipper jones was regularly reminded his real name was larry and where tom glavine , despite five years in a mets uniform , is still viewed suspiciously by some for his 17 in braves colors it has been nine years since the mets and braves were last entangled in a pennant race that went until the final handful of games weeks before that showdown in 2001 , the teams engaged in one of the most memorable regularseason games the first major league baseball game in new york after the sept 11 attacks on the world trade center a somber pregame turned into a joyous celebration when piazza hit a dramatic tworun home run with one out in the bottom of the eighth inning to lead the mets to a 32 victory mets right fielder jeff francoeur , who grew up in georgia and later played for the braves , watched that game at home as a high school senior and called it the best regularseason game of all time you know how competitive bobby cox is , francoeur said he told me once that was the only time he was ever glad he lost a game he said new york needed to win that night cox s benevolence did not last long the braves went on to win that division title , crushing the mets' hopes during a saturday afternoon game at turner field \( brian jordan hit a twoout grand slam off john franco in the ninth inning \) , and would win four more division titles after that before the mets finally won in 2006 now , in cox s final year , and with jones likely to join him in retirement , it is on again this is going to be huge , francoeur said it s been a while since it really meant something to both teams , and it could be the last chapter with bobby and chipper the early stages of the metsbraves rivalry can be traced back to a contentious series at turner field just before the allstar break in 1998 , when the braves were the dominant force in the realigned nl east and the mets were the cocky upstarts scrapping for a morsel of respect from the champions the braves were working on their seventh of 14 division crowns , and the mets were nine and a half games behind them in the standings , but only three games behind the san francisco giants in the wildcard race the first half of the season ended on a close play at home plate when the umpire angel hernandez ruled that michael tucker , despite strafing piazza s leg with his spikes , had arrived safely at home under piazza s tag in the 11th inning , setting off a wild argument that resulted in a threegame suspension for franco but the mets , who missed the playoffs by one game that year , were starting to show some fight in 1999 , they won the wild card , and in the national league championship series against atlanta they nearly forced a game 7 after falling behind three games to none in 2000 , the mets missed the braves in the playoffs on their way to the world series from 2002 to 2005 the mets were either bad or rebuilding , and when they finally became contenders in 2006 , the braves were bad we were awful , francoeur said of that braves team but now it s two good teams again , just like the old days
atlanta infielder brooks conrad , who has spent , won a game for atlanta in may by hitting a grand slam in the bottom of the ninth inning a month later , his bunt in the top of the ninth drove in the winning run , and in august he won another game for the braves with a home run in the ninth none of those spotlight moments , all of which were necessary to get the braves into the postseason as the wild card , could lift the shame from conrad on sunday night turner field was a den of euphoria after pinchhitter eric hinske clobbered a tworun home run in the bottom of the eighth to give the braves a onerun lead over the in game 3 of their national league division series the next halfinning , however , the mood turned dark as conrad committed his third error of the game , which allowed the giants to score the winning run  it s embarrassing once again i feel like i let everybody down and i just feel terrible , conrad , 30 , said it s a whole lot to swallow , and i will try and do my best to get over it , and it s probably something you 're probably not going to get over for a long time , if ever i feel absolutely terrible right now , and i just want to dig a hole and go sleep in there the braves trail in the bestoffive series , two games to one , with game 4 here monday derek lowe , the braves' game 1 starter , who lost , 10 , will start on three days' rest madison bumgarner , a rookie lefthander , will start for the giants against atlanta , which has struggled this season against lefthanders for the first seven innings sunday , the giants lefthander jonathan sanchez did a pretty strong impression of tim lincecum , who stifled the braves in game 1 sanchez , who struck out 11 over all , retired 14 in a row in one stretch and carried a nohitter into the sixth before atlanta pitcher tim hudson guided a oneout single into right field the braves are trying to extend the career of manager bobby cox , who is retiring after the season the club had made a habit of lastatbat wins with 26 this season , and it looked as if it had another with hinske s homer the previous game , the braves lost closer billy wagner to injury , and it hurt them when the young relievers craig kimbrel and mike dunn could not close out the giants in the top of the ninth leading by 21 , the braves turned to the 22yearold kimbrel , who throws in the mid90s kimbrel got two outs around a walk to travis ishikawa , and the capacity crowd of 53 , 284 shook turner field with expectation of the final out but freddy sanchez singled to put runners on first and second dunn came in but allowed a runscoring single to aubrey huff that tied the game at 22 peter moylan relieved dunn , and the giants' buster posey hit a smash right at conrad up the middle the ball seemed to skid on conrad , and it went between his legs sanchez scored to make it 32 , and the crowd moaned the error was conrad s seventh in six games a second baseman , he was moved to third base when chipper jones sustained a seasonending knee injury , then moved back to second when he started making throwing errors at the end of the regular season for some reason , it s been rough , conrad said conrad committed an error in the first when he bobbled a potential doubleplay ball , and he committed his second error in the second inning , which helped the giants take a 10 lead mike fontenot , who was starting at third base in place of the slumping pablo sandoval , hit a drive to the wall in rightcenter field atlanta right fielder jason heyward had the ball in his glove when his head snapped back and hit the wall his glove hit the wall , too , and the ball popped out , and fontenot had a triple for the next five innings , it just felt like my eyes were hard to keep them open , heyward said i hit the wall with my head and it s kind of sore right now my jaw is kind of sore the next hitter , cody ross , hit a short fly toward the rightfield line conrad raced out to get under the ball in bright sunlight , but dropped it , and fontenot came home to make it 10 you hurt for him , braves left fielder matt diaz said everyone in the dugout was rooting for him to come up there in the ninth inning this should be the time of his life playing in the playoffs his first full season in the big leagues , and hopefully he can relax and start having some fun with it asked after the game if conrad would start in game 4 , cox said , i 'll have to sleep on it the braves are nearly out of gas on offense they limped into october as the wild card after leading the national league east from to they could not hit and they had trouble fielding , but survived with starting pitching and vibrant young arms in the bullpen some were beginning to believe that destiny was calling for one last title for cox on sunday , the braves were looking for stars , not liabilities , to satisfy a revvedup crowd that behaved as if this 1991 , when the braves went from worst to first they finally got that star in hinske , then lost it in one disastrous moment
as the fans and players of the 29 other franchises cringed at the union of , dwyane wade and chris bosh , miami did what it does best partied the three stood on a scaffold riser during a nightclublike ceremony friday night at american airlines arena they ascended with their backs turned to a frenzied crowd , which had scooped up all 13 , 000 free tickets in less than an hour , before smiling and dancing music blared sparks rained down smoke drifted skyward if the shock still stung from ohio to new york and seemed unbelievable most everywhere else , fans held signs with a clear message yes we did before they dribbled a basketball or dropped a bead of sweat perhaps they did under the concertlike lights james and bosh were awarded keys to the city james , wade and bosh , all in white heat jerseys , were either rock stars or basketball players no matter the consequences or feelings of scorn , they are now the top chain of basketball s evolving pecking order this is a dream come true , wade told the crowd james said the relationship between the three formed when they were drafted in 2003 and strengthened during their run toward the olympic gold in 2008 we did n't know then that we would ever get together like this , james said we 're all friends we talk all the time and we 're here now and we 're going to be here a long time bosh said , we jumped into the water and now we have to swim a day after revealing to a national television audience that he would play in miami , james arrived to a welcoming city , leaving a stinging chorus of skepticism and resentment in his wake as three of last season s top nine scorers joined one team joy reigned at the ceremony , and rejection was the order of the day in ohio and for four other disappointed franchises that lost in the james derby a procession of former franchise players wondered openly if james had tainted his legacy by leaving the cavaliers and joining wade , who has already led the franchise to a championship the tnt analyst reggie miller said he is the best player in the league can we put him now in the same category of michael jordan , who never left chicago larry bird , who never left boston or magic johnson , who has four or five rings , in the same breath \? no if he would have stayed in cleveland and won one championship built around him , we would have put him on mount rushmore miller compared james s move to alex rodriguez s joining derek jeter with the yankees lebron is the alex rodriguez , miller said it is still dwyane s team between lebron james and dwyane wade , one of those guys has to sacrifice and to me it will have to be lebron james because it is dwyane wade s team the criticism deepened from there i thought he was , i guess , more of a competitor , orlando general manager otis smith told the associated press the nba tv analyst chris webber said , i'm never mentioning him and jordan in the same sentence ever again tnt s charles barkley said lebron will never be the guy i wish he would have tried to win it by himself as the guy' besides serving as analysts after allstar careers , miller , webber and barkley share another trait none ever won an nba championship miller played his entire 18year career for the smallmarket indiana pacers , the heat president , purged salarycap space to sign james , wade and bosh with the roster now all but cleared , riley will have to lure veterans to sign minimum contracts james said he and riley talked of the heat being a family the rings are pretty cool , james added , referring to riley s championship record i want some of those on friday , riley created some room by dealing michael beasley , the second overall pick in 2008 , to the minnesota timberwolves for a secondround pick in 2011 the heat is also interested in acquiring the sharpshooter mike miller , and it completed the signandtrade deal with toronto for bosh espn reported that the veteran lakers guard derek fisher planned to meet with riley , although it is doubtful that he would leave the lakers , where he has won five championships during his courtship , james left clues that would influence his decision he often spoke of winning in committing to the heat , james also signaled he would take less than the maximum to fit under the team s salary cap however , it may not be much of a sacrifice the cavaliers , in trying to make the best of a bad situation , agreed friday to send james to miami in a signandtrade deal that will allow him to make almost as much as he would have had he stayed in cleveland in exchange , the cavaliers will get draft picks backlash lingered , not only from james s choice of teams , but also from his delivery on network television after the cavaliers fell to equal footing with five other franchises trying to woo james at times , james referred to himself in the third person and was criticized for not having the courtesy of calling the cavaliers owner dan gilbert beforehand to alert him of his decision as great an athlete as he is , i think he brought himself back to the pack in the eyes of many consumers , said david m carter , the director of the sports business institute at the university of southern california title or no title , the new york sports marketer michael paul of mgp associates said james lost out in not coming to new york he might win a championship there , but comparatively , if they were in new york and that happened , there s a nightandday difference as far as money , exposure , longterm marketing and branding , paul said james instead kept heading south and will try to win new fans the question will be if the show will be greater than the one james departed and if it will be worth it
sydney , australia with less than a week remaining in the tightest federal election campaign here in decades , prime minister used a speech to party loyalists on monday to highlight her economic credentials and try to widen the narrow lead she holds in the polls over her conservative rival polls showed that when ms gillard called the election in midjuly , she had a comfortable lead over her opponent , tony abbott , the leader of the centerright liberal party but support for ms gillard s leftleaning labor party has been eroded in recent weeks by a series of policy and public relations gaffes and damaging leaks from within the party at her official campaign launching on monday , ms gillard tried to bring voters' focus back to the economy labor has taken credit for keeping out of recession and creating about 500 , 000 jobs while many industrialized countries grapple with slow growth and doubledigit unemployment when the global financial crisis threatened this country , we said we were for jobs , and i'm proud of it , ms gillard told the gathering of labor officials in brisbane , the capital of queensland , where a large number of undecided voters could determine the outcome of saturday s election ms gillard has been campaigning for reelection almost since the day she replaced australia s former leader , kevin rudd , in surprise party revolt in june but monday s speech marked the official start of her election campaign it was an unusually lowkey occasion , with none of the pomp and ceremony typically seen at party rallies several surveys have suggested that many voters particularly in queensland and the outer suburbs of sydney and melbourne are undecided about who should govern the country both parties have held leads in polls , although two of the most recent polls have given labor a fourpercentagepoint advantage after the allocation of secondpreference votes from minor parties such as the greens many inside the labor party had hoped that ms gillard , the plainspeaking daughter of workingclass immigrants , would restore labor s credibility with voters irritated by mr rudd s bookish aloofness but the drama surrounding mr rudd s humiliating dismissal and questions about his future in the party have threatened to overshadow the campaign ms gillard has repeatedly denied orchestrating the rebellion against mr rudd , saying that she agreed to take over after it became clear that he was leading the party to defeat after just one term however , a number of damaging leaks about ms gillard from within labor ranks have suggested that all is not well within the party a public rapprochement between ms gillard and mr rudd on aug 7 went some way to resolve the issue , but the prime minister continues to be dogged by questions about the ouster of mr rudd we all make judgments in our lives , she said last week at an appearance with undecided voters i made a judgment and i stand by it there is no one who organized this there is no one who is going to be rewarded conservatives have suggested that a small group of labor party power brokers widely believed responsible for fomenting rudd s ouster would be granted senior cabinet positions in exchange for supporting gillard as prime minister others have criticized the prime minister for being bland and vague about her policies her muchpublicized to a new refugee processing center in east timor unraveled when it became clear that the prime minister had not adequately consulted the east timorese government about whether it wanted to host such a facility ms gillard made no mention of on monday , an omission that did not go unnoticed by the greens party , which is drawing extra support from labor voters irritated by their party s perceived lack of decisiveness on the issue she also was widely mocked for using the phrase moving forward more than 20 times in a single speech during the early days of the election she has since jettisoned the slogan vowed to show voters more of the real julia at a townhallstyle meeting hosted by the australian broadcasting corp , the prime minister fielded questions about her hair color , her selfavowed and whether she could represent the interests of working families as an unmarried woman with no children there s never going to be one australian who can encapsulate in their own life experience the story of every other australian , ms gillard said at the meeting you 've always got to be prepared to listen and learn from other people s experiences while ms gillard has been scrambling to shore up her image in several constituencies , mr abbott also has struggled to develop an electionwinning edge a longserving senior minister in the government of the former conservative prime minister john howard , mr abbott is well known for his combative parliamentary style and conservative views on social issues with no clear winner in sight , many analysts and party insiders are predicting an extremely close election , possibly even a hung parliament no party is in a position saying they 're going to win , a senior labor party minister , chris bowen , told the australian broadcasting corp on monday this will be tight , it will go down to the wire
we 're often told that manhattan s newmusic scene was neatly divided across the middle during the 1960s rigid modernist composers reigned in uptown academia while anythinggoes experimentalists ruled in downtown lofts diametrically opposed factions separated by a growing midtown arts complex named lincoln center , which ignored them both if that division really did exist back then , one composer never seemed to notice or consider the subject worth discussing within weeks of his 89th birthday was too busy writing his own music and teaching composition at to bother with musical politics , manifestos or myths i soon became aware of that when i entered his class in 1960 , convinced at first that i was joining the stern and sheltered world of uptown academics , whether i liked it or not the surroundings certainly tended to encourage that perception in those days the music department occupied the top floor of the university s journalism building on broadway , higher learning was all around , and the recently created had taken up residence , overseen by faculty composers with impeccable scholarly reputations otto luening , vladimir ussachevsky and , from princeton , that formidable mandarin of total serialism , milton babbitt karlheinz stockhausen , a seminal figure of german innovation and a pioneer in electronic music , came to lecture , and elliott carter , although he did not teach at columbia , was a frequent presence it was whispered that carter s thorny new string quartet no 2 , soon to have its premiere at the nearby juilliard school , would change the face of american composition somehow mr beeson , with his breezy midwestern friendliness and natty collegiate persona topped off by a buzzcut hair style and an endless assortment of bow ties , never quite fitted the picture of what an agendadriven university composition teacher ought to look like come to think of it , neither did douglas moore , the chairman of columbia s music department from 1940 to 1962 a mildmannered composer as sweettempered and sentimental as his unashamedly tunefilled hit already a repertory item at the new york city opera and making a star out of the young soprano beverly sills my preconceptions rapidly vanished mr beeson himself was then at work on what would be his own major contribution to american opera a sizzling psychological study of the troubled young woman from fall river , mass , accused of hacking her father and stepmother to death with an ax in 1892 mr beeson had seized on an ideal subject for him , one that seamlessly blended the pungent period musical flavor of churchandparlor americana with an expressive contemporary style that dug deeply into the characters' tragic dilemmas to produce a piece of flawlessly paced music theater mr beeson philosophically accepted being pegged as a conservative composer , but the description never struck me as being particularly useful , especially when i studied his scores as examples of the practical advice he offered in class each was impeccably made , often working out complex structural procedures in ways that made them seem utterly natural and inevitable and how effortlessly he tailored his music to make a perfect fit with the voice here was a composer whose sense of correct and effective word setting verged on the uncanny another of mr beeson s 10 operas \( not to mention an extensive catalog of other vocal and instrumental works \) that stands an excellent chance of survival is a lively portrait of a charismatic young evangelist based on the reallife figure of aimee semple mcpherson , who flourished as a religious media figure in the 1920s like mcpherson , sister rose ora easter mysteriously disappears one day at the height of her fame as a preacher , and the opera makes it clear that she has deserted her calling for a man here mr beeson again draws on popular american idioms of the day to lighten the otherwise tough musical fabric of what is actually a tragic love story with a frightening villainess mother rainey , rose ora s fanatically twisted mentor one of the opera s most inspired moments occurs when the truant rose ora hears her own voice delivering a recorded sermon on the radio and proceeds to sing a gorgeous duet with herself i sometimes wonder whether mr beeson was taking a sly dig at his more technologically inclined colleagues at the columbiaprinceton center by combining live music and a tape recorder so mischievously no doubt mr beeson received encouragement to experiment further along those lines from luening , who taught composition to secondyear columbia graduate students and was a pioneer in developing techniques that mix electronics and live performance despite that reputation , luening described himself as radical conservative , and his music , whether it involved electronics or not , was always agreeably approachable and stylistically diverse the man seemed more like your delightfully eccentric uncle after a few months at columbia with mr beeson and luening , it was no longer possible to think of the place as a forbidding institute that condemned musical heresies and rammed academic dogma down students' throats on the contrary , my classmates were a fascinatingly varied lot , and everyone felt free to cultivate whatever style suited his or her temperament mr beeson endorsed that completely never once in my hearing did he utter an aesthetic judgment on anyone s new piece , although his advice on technical matters was always invaluable at that level every student was expected to know the range and capabilities of all the instruments in the orchestra , but sometimes a young composer might still ask a player to do something really dumb at one point in my laboriously workedout string quartet , i directed the violist to apply a mute to play just two notes mr beeson discreetly suggested that such a tiny detail was precious , maybe even irrelevant and just a little silly everyone received the same treatment , although some of us were obviously more talented than others it was pretty clear even then that charles wuorinen was the star of our group , a status amply demonstrated by the quality of invention , fluency , energy and commitment that characterized every score he brought to class that he would go on to become the important and prolific composer that he is today seemed inevitable , although his rigorous style and richly eventful music no doubt helped encourage the snarky prejudice toward uptown elitism yes , mr wuorinen could be , but he never said an unkind word about another classmate s work , no matter how feeble it might have been , and for that i am eternally grateful harvey sollberger was the other major talent in class , a virtuoso flutist whose highly developed music was just as challenging and assured as mr wuorinen s but brushed with a slightly mad wit and theatricality that gave his style a special appeal in 1962 the two composers joined forces to create the group for contemporary music , which for many years enriched new york s newmusic scene another formidable personality , mario davidovsky came from argentina to join our group his dazzling synchronisms were yet to be written , but they would soon be regarded as classic examples of how to combine electroacoustic and instrumental resources there were about a dozen of us studying together back then , and our music ran the gamut we had our resident postwebern miniaturist , an experimentalist who composed by writing notes on cards and throwing them on the floor \( even mr beeson s tutorial talents were stretched by this \) , a determined stravinsky imitator , lots of neobartokians and me , whose rather weird amalgam of techniques lifted from janacek and barber baffled one and all there was even a fellow who said he was studying composition for the sheer fun of it and unashamedly wrote in a lateromantic style resembling that of vaughan williams his music was actually rather charming , but mostly i recall the hilarious tales of his youth growing up as the child of partythrowing diplomats stationed in paris during the 1930s , when ana s nin would arrive late at night , tear off her clothes and dance on the tables mr beeson was an inspired teacher who respected his charges' creative individuality and brought out the best in all of us the disciplines of form , structure and coherence that i learned from him served me no less in writing words than they had in composing music he once succinctly summed up his conviction that composition itself could not be taught , that all he really offered was practical advice one can only teach aspects of composing , not composition , he wrote in the march 1999 society of composers newsletter notation , some aspects of instrumental and vocal usage , and orchestration \( when , if ever , it s separable from creation \) clarity and projections , texture , coherence and shaping time over short and long spans not to speak of linewriting , pitches and rhythms which of these elements dominate and to what expressive end are what forms a style and that is none of the teacher s business
upon his return to madison square garden , david lee was treated to many kind gestures , including video tributes and standing ovations , but none so generous as the one the themselves provided on the court when lee wanted to score , he did rebounds , his favorite pastime , were plentiful and before leaving late wednesday night , he was rewarded with a precious commodity he rarely saw in five seasons here a win as much as he tried not to gloat , lee s satisfaction was evident as he led the golden state warriors to a thrilling 122117 victory over his former team lee had a seasonhigh 28 points , nearly matching the production of amar'e stoudemire \( 33 points \) , the flashy star who replaced him in a summer roster shuffle the comparisoncontrast game seemed a secondary concern , however , as the knicks \( 35 \) lost their third straight game after another messy performance the knicks wiped out a 19point deficit in the second half , but they misfired down the stretch and played erratically on defense golden state shot 528 percent from the field , scored 74 points in the paint and turned the knicks' 21 turnovers into 30 points we 're tentative and we 're not real comfortable with just playing yet , coach mike d'antoni said so we 've got a lot of work to do , no doubt about it stoudemire , whose signing in july effectively ended lee s career here , nearly led the knicks back , scoring 13 points in the fourth quarter but he missed two critical free throws with 494 seconds left and the knicks trailing by 116113 he partially atoned with a 3pointer that cut the deficit to 118117 with 168 seconds left , but the knicks could not finish the job when wilson chandler s final 3point attempt bounced off the rim , it was lee who wrapped up the rebound , his 10th he then converted two free throws to finish off the win , the warriors' sixth in eight games after a postgame interview on the court , lee departed to cheers it means a lot that i came up big at the end , lee said i wanted to do it for my teammates , not for any pride , or old stuff , old scores to settle or anything i'm just happy that we were able to win the game and my teammates played a good game the knicks basically swapped lee for stoudemire in july signing stoudemire for 100 million , then sending lee to the warriors in an 80 million signandtrade deal it was a blow to lee s pride , but he has publicly acknowledged the rationale behind the move , given stoudemire s size , skills and star power yet there was no mistaking lee s outsized enthusiasm he was fistpumping and chestbumping for most of the night when he drove for a layup and drew a foul on stoudemire early in the third quarter , lee turned , hooted and made an exaggerated andone call with his left arm and forefinger minutes later , the warriors had a 19point lead , and the crowd was unleashing a torrent of boos we just ca n't get comfortable with losing , stoudemire said that s a mentality that we ca n't have chandler made his first start of the season at power forward and delivered 27 points he nearly lost a tooth along the way , when lee accidentally elbowed him while fighting for a rebound the blow shattered one of chandler s top front teeth , and he spit a piece onto the court he said he swallowed another chip raymond felton added 20 points and 6 assists for the knicks , although he again struggled to run the pickandroll , or to find open teammates down the stretch the knicks' backcourt was thoroughly outplayed by the warriors' tandem of stephen curry \( 25 points \) and monta ellis \( 22 \) of the three players the knicks acquired in the lee trade , only anthony randolph played wednesday , scoring zero points in seven minutes ronny turiaf rested a sprained right knee kelenna azubuike has yet to play this season lee and stoudemire did not guard each other much , mostly because d'antoni shook up his lineup , benching the rookie center timofey mozgov and moving stoudemire to center the move was intended to open the court for stoudemire , primarily by putting another shooter on the court in their prior two games , the knicks had been outscored by 7444 in the first quarter our offense got stagnant , d'antoni said , adding later , our biggest weapon is amar'e , and he s having a hard time getting to the foul line or to the basket we 've got to help him a little bit on that the move might not be permanent d'antoni wants to assess the results over a few games , and he might eventually use turiaf as the starting center although stoudemire prefers to play power forward , the phoenix suns were often at their best when he started at center in an undersized lineup statistically , the knicks have also been their best with a stoudemirechandler frontcourt , d'antoni said d'antoni got the results he wanted , at least to start the game the knicks took an early 7point lead and scored 32 points in the first quarter , their highest output in four games in his five years as a knick , lee became an elite rebounder , a skilled scorer , an allstar and a fan favorite but when he was asked earlier in the day to share his best moments , he was stumped the knicks lost too often to have many i do n't know that i can put my finger on one , he said we had a couple good comefrombehind victories , lastsecond tipins , things like that in a miserable era , lee was one of the knicks' few bright spots , and he was thanked with a video tribute , packed with dunks and rebounds , one bloody nose and many hugs with children when it was over , the publicaddress announcer mike walczewski gave the traditional , once a knick , always a knick introduction as fans rose for a standing ovation lee acknowledged them with a raised hand and a bowed head after all the years of chaos and controversy , coach firings and feuds , lee had earned his moment

the israel chamber orchestra plans to play a concert next summer in bayreuth , germany , the city most associated with , whose music is taboo in the jewish state because of its embrace by hitler and because of the composer s noted antisemitism news reports said the orchestra would open the bayreuth festival , the annual celebration of wagner s operas in the festspielhaus , the house he designed but officials of the festival , town and orchestra said wednesday that the concert , scheduled for july 26 , was unrelated to the festival s offerings and that it would take place in bayreuth s town hall it s completely independent , said bj rn junge , the assistant to katharina wagner , the festival s codirector it s organized by the city of bayreuth the only link , if you want , is that has been asked to be the patron of it ms wagner , a greatgranddaughter of the composer , leads the festival along with her half sister , eva wagnerpasquier the chairwoman of the orchestra s board , erella talmi , said the group would play as guests of the mayor , outside the festival this was the original plan and the original invitation , she added mr junge noted that it would not make sense for an orchestra concert to open an festival nor did the program fit in the orchestra , while including wagner s siegfried idyll , plans to play works by other composers who are generally not heard at the festival , mr junge said the orchestra s conductor , , asked ms wagner , a friend , about playing in bayreuth , said nicolaus richter , bayreuth s culture director ms wagner passed the request on to the town , which welcomed the idea , mr richter added ms talmi confirmed that account ms wagner planned to travel to israel next week for a news conference announcing the orchestra concert but canceled the trip once word leaked out , mr junge said it was meant to be a big surprise there , but it is not news anymore now , he said ms wagner is happy about the concert , he said , adding , we 're sad it had such a bad start but ms talmi said ms wagner may also have been swayed by criticism of the trip in israeli news reports i did hear that she got cold feet and got a big scare about the situation , ms talmi said , and did not want to add to the turbulence that her visit would create ms talmi said the program would include prayer , by the israeli composer tzvi avni , and music of two composers condemned by the nazis mendelssohn \( a symphony \) and mahler \( the r ckert lieder \) the wagner piece on the program , siegfried idyll , will not be rehearsed on israeli soil , she said , and orchestra members who felt uncomfortable with the trip would be excused none have come forward so far , she said several highprofile attempts to play wagner in israel in recent years , by the conductors daniel barenboim and zubin mehta , have drawn controversy many israelis deem such performances insensitive to survivors of the holocaust ms talmi , a former flutist , said she performed siegfried idyll as a young musician in 1963 in israel in a hush hush concert at the time the issue did not loom as large , she said i did n't know there was a rejection of this music we enjoyed it tremendously but now she understands the problems , she said i personally think that as long as there is so much sensitivity in israel for the music of wagner , we should shy away from it here in israel , ms talmi said but outside the country is different we all , jewish and israeli musicians , perform wagner everywhere in the world , she said most of us try not to do it in israel , not to hurt anyone but you cannot avoid it it is among the greatest music there is , she said
los angeles here we go , folks page 133 and action ! midnight had come and gone in a huge , lightflooded plaza near the west hollywood branch of the , a place that on this crisp june night was filled , quite surreally , with openair sets for general hospital in the middle of one set , a small , trim man in a doublebreasted navy suit with a little makeup dabbed on his cheeks and forehead , stood encircled by television cameras , preparing to play a character called jeffrey deitch , director of moca a role he had just taken on in real life as well after a decadeslong career as a highprofile new york art dealer the sprawling soapatthemuseum operation was mr deitch s idea , the first public art event he had overseen since taking the helm at the museum of contemporary art three weeks earlier it involved filming a series of scenes set there , starring mr deitch s friend james franco , the actor and budding artist who strangely took a part on general hospital last year in what he has described as a guerilla performanceart piece the new scenes are his return to the show and renew his efforts to smuggle a little conceptualart contraband into middleamerican living rooms \( where , if he does his job right , the art aspect might go unnoticed \) that the museum had become a soap opera set was pure deitch , for better or worse stuntlike , crazily experimental , scrambling high and low culture , risking ridicule and seeming not to care much when it rains down on his head and the shoot was a perfect emblem of the issues and anxieties raised by the choice of mr deitch last january as the institution was emerging from deep financial turmoil and surprised the art world by picking a gallery owner to join the museum leadership ranks , which generally elevate from within no megadealer like mr deitch , 57 , had ever made the transition to running a nonprofit museum , and his selection has been parsed endlessly for what it says about the boundary between museums and art selling , a oncebright line that is becoming increasingly difficult to see \( in the 1950s james j rorimer , the director of the metropolitan museum of art , warned a young thomas hoving , who would later succeed him , if you become an art dealer , you 'll never be able to work in a museum \) mr deitch agreed to close his gallery , deitch projects , and cease all commercial activity before taking the job , a switch that will mean a considerable loss of income for him but his selection nonetheless set off alarm bells about possibilities for conflicts of interest and cronyism he made headlines almost immediately by saying that he would not rule out the possibility of selling works from his own huge personal art collection or his former gallery s inventory during his directorship , in order to meet financial obligations in new york , where he still owns two buildings in soho and rents artstorage warehouses he has also dismissed as childish the notion that he pledge not to show artists whom he promoted and befriended at his gallery so the general hospital event was as much a political statement as it was a performance piece mr franco had originally approached mr deitch with the idea of staging the soap in new york at his gallery when it became clear the gallery would be closing , mr deitch simply proposed doing it at the museum instead \( where an exhibition based on the project will be mounted this year \) like many of his projects through the years , this one would not have had much profitmaking potential in a gallery but mr deitch knew that the very idea of shuttling a show so readily between his two worlds would not sit well with some people , including a few of his new employees there are , naturally , people on the staff who are not comfortable with what i'm doing , he said , driving down melrose avenue to his soapopera star turn even before officially taking the job , he began looking for ways to attract new audiences and support for a museum still trying to right its finances he conceived and fasttracked a retrospective on the work of dennis hopper , who died on may 29 , organized by mr deitch s friend julian schnabel and opening next sunday he canceled a show that curators were already working on but that he believed to be redundant and he is working to put together a major exhibition about the influence of street art , a movement that was central to the identity of deitch projects in recent years i think it s kind of unprecedented , he said of his flurry of plans i 've hit the ground running and there s no time to lose here we 've got to make an impact during more than three months after his selection by the museum , mr deitch allowed a reporter to tag along and observe , at least to an extent , as he prepared to assume the new role and wound down his 14yearold gallery , a process that involved consolidating artstorage warehouses \( six at one point \) , finding new spaces for artists working in studios he had rented , and dealing with complex realestate litigation \( his gallery building on grand street in soho was destabilized after its nextdoor neighbor began sagging \) the transition was made much more complicated by the kind of gallery mr deitch ran it had moneymakers on its roster but also a couple of garage bands' worth of young artists whom mr deitch supported , more as patron than dealer , with the considerable money he made brokering huge sales in the secondary market a skill aided by his harvard mba there are millions in advances that i 've given to artists over the years , he said , in exchange for promises that they would repay him if they became successful it is a testament to the loyalty he fostered that , even now , almost none of the artists he represented have announced publicly that they are joining other galleries , though some will end up with the gallery s former managing director , suzanne geiss , who will be a private dealer and manager , and with two other former directors , kathy grayson and meghan coleman , who have opened a soho gallery called the hole with mr deitch s blessing and the help of his connections while some gallery owners might be able to hand the keys to a trusted lieutenant upon leaving , mr deitch s departure removes the center of gravity for a group he had put into orbit around him , in a slightly nostalgic attempt to recreate in microcosm the more freewheeling art world of the 1970s and 1980s in which he came of age \( he opened his first gallery as a college student in 1972 in a rented hotel parlor in lenox , mass , and sold out the first week later he talked his way into his first official artworld job , as a receptionist at the prestigious john weber gallery in soho , by offering to work free \) only a few weeks before mr deitch s move to los angeles he presided over the final opening at deitch projects , for a show by the celebrity street artist shepard fairey , an event that drew so many people it closed down a block of wooster street besides a few this is your life figures from mr deitch s new york career fab 5 freddy , debbie harry , the graffiti artist lee qui ones the crowd was composed mostly of people not often seen in new york art galleries a motorcycle gang member in a leather jacket approached mr deitch and shook his hand , saying , thank you for your years of service standing later on the edge of his loft office high above the scrum , in a pale red seersucker suit that lent him the air of a songanddance man , mr deitch said people keep asking , why does this man in his 50s want to be surrounded by all these kids \? ' but i was just a kid myself when i started in the art world this has always been my kind of crowd the next night he was feted by his staff and friends at a dinner at a sweltering loft in williamsburg , brooklyn , that he had rented for ms geiss mr deitch sat next to his pal jeff koons and submitted with a bemused , fastidious smile to the night s entertainment , the bawdy chanteuse bridget everett , who mussed his hair and came close to sitting in his lap as she serenaded him her song echoed the sentiment many of his new york friends had been expressing , more or less we 've got tonight , babe why do n't you stay \? late last year , mr deitch said , when he began considering whether to stay or to take the museum s offer , the decision was not simply about whether he wanted to run the institution in 2008 he had opened a new , hangarsized branch of his gallery in a former soda warehouse on the water in long island city , queens , and proceeded to turn it into something that was almost a museum in itself , one dominated by performances and other generally unsaleable art , like a final show of paintings by josh smith done directly on the walls and primered over at the end in terms of closing things down , this is what i feel the sorriest about , mr deitch said one morning as he walked around the space , which will be taken over by the gladstone gallery , mostly for art storage in the end the debate for me came down to whether to go to a public museum or to liquidate some of my assets and create a museum of my own , maybe here he said he chose the former because working for an established public institution would make it possible to collaborate with more artists , and because he sees los angeles as a paradise for museum experimentation the kind of city that would hire jeffrey deitch to run a museum maria bell , a cochairwoman of the museum s board , said it was not a decision made without some misgivings a lot of thought was given to it , she said , and i will say that there were times when people took pause and wondered whether we could do this but the board was enticed by mr deitch s populist philosophy and his conviction that contemporary museums sometimes needed to act first and ask questions later why not be nimble enough to add programming that can be done in a shorter time , to be tapping into the contemporary art world as it s happening \? she said as for concerns about conflicts of interest if mr deitch has to sell works from his own collection , ms bell said the board spent untold amounts of time discussing it but in the end she said she considered it an external problem of perceptions , not an internal one that the museum had many concerns about , calling mr deitch a man of unbelievable personal integrity who had made huge financial sacrifices to come to the public sector \( the museum has not disclosed mr deitch s salary and benefits his predecessor received almost half a million dollars a year \) we think he 'll really build our constituency and bring more people to the museum in new and exciting ways , she said in the meantime he has given up his new york apartment on the upper east side , a studio rental that became famous in the art world because it was so tiny , spartan and completely devoid of art he now lives in a rambling spanish revival house , also rented , that once belonged to cary grant in the trendy los feliz neighborhood here , with a kidneyshaped pool from his balcony he can see the hollywood sign to the north and , to the south , the tennis courts of his new neighbors , brad pitt and angelina jolie \( i wanted the whole hollywood fantasy , he said , taking in the view on a pictureperfect angeleno afternoon \) he might even hang some of his own art collection on the walls old new york habits die hard , however , and mr deitch initially planned to get by in los angeles without a car , cobbling together cab and subway rides he gave up , of course , and now drives a rented gray lexus , in which he looks very much the part of the important museum director he was asked to play on general hospital the soap opera gave him only a couple of lines to speak that night , but mr deitch nailed them with a trace of methodacting naturalism , and as the cameras pulled back the director on the set gave the new extra from out east a thumbs up love it ! he yelled that s a move on
midfielder yael averbuch helped lead sky blue fc to the championship of in the league s first season averbuch , a montclair , nj , product by way of the university of north carolina , will be filing to the goal blog during the defending champions 2010 season everyone knows what offside is but no one can explain it it s the same as love amazing quotation ! i heard it at the end of the german film eine andere liga \( another league \) at the second kicking screening soccer film festival in new york city i helped to introduce the film with ethan zohn \( the winner of survivor africa and the founder of grassrootsoccer \) i talked a little bit about the power of the game and how f tbol has influenced my life and had such a great impact on me emotionally and spiritually , as well as physically more importantly , though , i listened to ethan speak and was inspired by him and all that he does to give back through the game i was honored to be surrounded by a crowd of people who love the game from a different perspective than i m used to i am so involved in the daytoday world of players and coaches that it was really refreshing to meet and speak with new people who primarily view the game as a way to bring people together and influence social change it reminded me once again how powerful the beautiful game can be the film was moving and i found that i could relate to it in many ways it s about a young turkish woman in germany who loves f tbol and receives a diagnosis of breast cancer she finds redemption through the game , which helps her to regain her strength , battle the illness and move forward with her life although the players in the film were not especially elite , they were not meant to be there was little emphasis on success on the field , but instead importance was placed on the personal relationships created and the rewards of being part of a team i ve found that throughout my professional career thus far \( all two , long but fascinating years of it \) i go through phases of learning and having new realizations and it always seems that i learn the lessons that i need right at the appropriate time , when i am so ready for them ready for new inspiration the people involved with kicking screening , as well as viewing the film , reminded me that my involvement in this game goes beyond last weekend s game or yesterday s practice it goes beyond the goals i have posted on my bedroom wall , or my training plan written in my journal f tbol gives us the power to connect with people , to influence and in turn to be influenced in ways that are truly special just when i start to fret about my performance , or a slightly strained hamstring , or not having enough energy to do my weight lifting after a long day , things are put back into perspective so quickly f tbol is about much , much more than that i wish that i had more free time to take part in events like this , or to get involved with f tbol more off the field , but it s a challenge to do this during the season while i do try to keep a broad perspective , my focus has to be on the here and now right now , sky blue fc is in fourth place we traveled to philly to play last past weekend , and although we felt that we played most of the game in our attacking half , we lost 21 the result was especially disappointing because we didn t feel that it represented the flow of the game after playing for a dominant college program \( north carolina \) , where three losses my junior year tied us with the worst season in the history of the program , it s strange to get used to losing no , we don t plan to lose , nor do we accept it , but during the long wps season , and given the quality of every opponent , a handful of losses are inevitable similarly , individuals will have ups and downs this year i ve found that i am not analyzing each practice and game as much as last year i don t get as hung up on every comment from our coaching staff , read media match reports and replay situations over and over in my head i do try to learn from my successes and failures , but once it s done , it s done it s liberating to be able to move on i already care more about the game than what is probably a healthy amount , and i have a clear vision of the player i want to be and what it takes to get there so it is helpful for me to keep moving along that track and keep the outside influences to a minimum , while expanding the joy and inspiration i find in the game this newly adopted approach also allows me to better enjoy so many other aspects of playing when i m not so concerned about results and outside input , i can be focused in the moment to do the best that i can and enjoy doing what i love with such talented , funny , and interesting people speaking of the people in the wps , one of my longtime friends and teammates , nikki krzysik , plays for philly i ve known nikki since we were 10 years old , when we traveled to england together to tour and play a couple games we live about seven minutes from each other in new jersey , and played on the same world class club team from the time we were 15 until we went to college nikki is one of my best friends and it s always fun to play with and against her i ll always remember the first time we played against each other during our freshman year of college when nikki s university of virginia team came to play in chapel hill , we scored first , and i remember running back past her and kind of smiling , like , ha , i went to the better school ! then uva tied it up , and she ran past me , with the same smirk we joke about it now , but the friendly rivalry has continued in fact , i had the urge to go run past nikki after we tied up the game this weekend , just to return that smirk , but she was on the other side of the field and my legs really couldn t afford the extra 40yard run after our goal i find that on most wps teams i have several close friends or former teammates the league is still small enough that most of us know one another , and although we plan to destroy each other on the field , it is always great to catch up after the game it s amazing how we slide tackle one another , yell at each other for fouling our teammates , and do everything possible to win , but at the end of 90 minutes embrace like none of it happened and genuinely smile and say , i miss you how have you been \? ! now that i think of it , it s similar to the message in eine andere liga the game is about so much more than what happens on the field this week , sky blue fc travels to boston we are planning to drive up in time to watch the us england world cup game i m so excited for the world cup to start ! our team is doing a pool in which we predict the score and winner of every group game my money is on spain to win the whole thing \( i will still be cheering for the us men , but 5 was on the line , so i had to go with my f tbol favorites of the moment \) more to come as i continue my journey i am so grateful to be involved in the beautiful game !
chile established itself as an exciting team to watch , if not yet a genuine cup contender , with a swashbuckling 10 victory over honduras on wednesday in nelspruit , south africa chile attacked from the first kick and was rewarded with a goal in the 34th minute a series of passes built up to fullback maurico isla wide on the right , and his cross found an onrushing jean beausejour , who flicked in an unbeatable ball not content to protect its lead , chile poured it on the team had numerous chances to double its lead on both sides of halftime but some errant finishing and at least one great save from honduran keeper noel valladares kept the game 10 , a scoreline that more than flattered an overmatched honduras how chile s attacking style will fare against better organized european sides switzerland and spain remains to be seen but it was certainly a refreshing change in a world cup that has had more than its share of stolid games an exciting performance by chile and a welldeserved win to say the least stay tuned to the new york times for the cup debut of favored spain against switzerland cheers ! chile is finally starting to take it a bit easier breaking news shot by honduras ! sub georgie welcome tries a speculative effort from 30 yards , but he s fairly closely marked and the ball balloons over the net it really would be bizarre if honduras fluked a goal here chile really deserves a second goal here the team has had its chances , but has lacked a finishing touch in this half let s remember that before we all get too excited about chile as a bona fide cup contender mark gonzalez in for valdivia for chile just for fun , honduras is now 131 to pull off a draw in the last 10 minutes and 2751 to win i guess i ve seen stranger things in sport , but it s hard to think of many chile bring in contreras for vidal here comes walter martinez in for nunez honduras have now removed the two players who had the best attacking opportunities alexis sanchez on the left with some fancy stepovers , no one to get his cross alexis sanchez on the left with some fancy stepovers , no one to get his cross \( not a cut and paste error , it did happen twice in a minute \) after a save of a longdistance shot , valdivia gathers it and puts it in the net ! but he s offside chile have the ball in the penalty area every minute or two the chileans look like the team that is trailing and desperate for a goal thomas in for guevara for honduras and now the best free kick chance for honduras in the game sanchez brought down palacios just outside the box they ball caroms into a crowded box did it hit the hand of chilean defender waldo ponce \? the ref does not agree , and the keeper sweeps up the ball waldo ponce and chile may have caught a break chaos in the goal mouth ! chile s vidal is fed directly in front of net , he dives and heads it to the delightfully named waldo ponce , who heads on net at pointblank range saved ! great reaction save by valladares chile on the break an open shot for a charging alexis sanchez , but he puts it wide ! that really should have been the second you ve heard it before free kick chile honduras heads this one away i don t really want to knock the hondurans they re playing better than the 10001 long shots they are and their defense is dogged against many teams , chile would be up at least 20 let s welcome georgie welcome to the game for honduras he replaces pavon , somewhat surprisingly maybe the 36yearold pavon is knackered chile bring on jara , a defender , for rodrigo millar , a midfielder disappointing , but logical chile on top so far again honduras look a bit shellshocked the chilespain encounter on june 25 could be mouthwatering ! the only concern is that it could be a dead rubber a series of touch passes in the box lead to ramon nunez , and he starts with some stepover moves alas , he makes one too many and honduras intercepts and now another chance , but isla s shot is saved honduras can t even seem to clear the ball out of its own third for very long right now we re under way again in nelspruit how can honduras find a way back in the match \? the bookies now have them at 71 to get a draw and a whopping 501 to win that s a big price for a team only down a goal , but on the evidence a fair one at halftime in thailand , it s tero sasana 0 , bangkok glass 1 later today in the danish playoffs , otterup b ik will play skjold and in the faeroe islands , b36 will host b71 bitter rivals there , hope there s no trouble in the stands honduras has a free kick from 35 yards ramon nunez takes a beauty , forcing a save and that s the half wow ! either chile is the most exciting team so far at the world cup or i m crazed from lack of sleep who are the other candidates \? brazil \? germany \? what do you think \? where chile was sending five men forward , it is now sending three where honduras was sending one man forward , it is now sending three and chile s new threeman attack continues to outperform honduras s several sweet touch passes , the last from alexis sanchez , led to open fullback isla streaking down the right the simplest of crosses to an onrushing beausejour , who had beaten defender sergio mendoza , and the keeper was helpless chile dismantled honduras there now let s hope they keep attacking ! goooooool beausejour so why doesn t every football team play the attacking style we re seeing from chile \? because once in a while you give up the ball , you ve thrown seven men forward , and your opponents get a 4on3 the other way it just happened to chile , but the defenders were up to the challenge corner to chile , free kick to chile , throw in to chile could this game still be 00 \? vidal misses another , but chile must score ! now a corner for honduras ramon nunez right to keeper bravo chile counter like lightning some footwork by our key man alexis sanchez on the left wing , centers it to valdivia deflected and now a corner from fernandez no , sanchez faffs the shot high in the air dangerous moments for honduras there honduras tries to take advantage of chile s attacking shape with a counter it leads to a shot by striker pavon , which goes wide first sign of life for honduras and there s a yellow for fernandez of chile for an overexuberant tackle coach marcelo bielsa , architect of chile s attacking style , is known as loco bielsa , much to the delight of the univision announcers his supposed madness apparently extends to collecting enormous numbers of soccer videos and beausejour is almost sprung free by valdivia ! just a little too much on the ball it s all chile , folks now vidal tries a sudden shot from distance honduran keeper valadares is far from convincing on the save after a corner , 5 or 6 chile attackers flood the zone honduras fail to clear and vidal eventually gets a shot off for chile that s a fairly easy save moments later , chile tries a long ball from halfway , but it s a little too far in front of valdivia worth a try for the surprise factor alone an early yellow for carlos carmona of chile for a tackle in the honduras half the ball hasn t really left the honduras half yet chile presses forward and valdivia goes down to earn a free kick matias fernandez takes from 30 yards barely over ! they re off and kicking in nelspruit the referee is mr maillet of that footballing power the seychelles honduras lilting and white chile shouty and red the players are lined up and ready to hit the pitch for the lineups and formations , see the big graphic at the top of the page and once the game starts be sure to check out the strangely addictive heat map sadly , it s been more exciting than some of the games by the way , your correspondent worked the late shift last night , so please be forgiving of any typos , errors or flatout idiocy this morning thank you honduras coach reinaldo rueda tells the bbc the team is not at its best right now but we will kick off he tournament with everything we ve got you will see a team that is serious , dedicated and concentrating we just hope we can live up to what we have planned and prepared and we can start this dream with a victory honduras is a big , big underdog today , 51 or more , and you don t get the impression rueda is betting on his team buenos dias ! and welcome to the times s live coverage of chilehonduras from nelspruit if you mostly follow the big european leagues , you might not know a lot about chile and honduras the two teams , from western hemisphere spanishspeaking countries , might even blur in your mind a bit but in truth they are about as different as any matching up in this first week of the tournament honduras made it into the cup with a third place in the concacaf group , which again had a big talent dropoff after the united states and mexico recent friendlies have been dire two draws and two losses to belarus , azerbaijan , venezuela and romania , none of whom made it to south africa and the team plays a mostly defensive style few are expecting flashy or entertaining football from honduras but chile has the aficionados buzzing after a slow start , the team played some tremendously exciting attacking football in finishing second in the tough south american qualifying group , just one point behind mighty brazil look at some of these scores 40 over colombia , 31 at peru , 20 at paraguay , 40 over bolivia , 42 at colombia with at least three men playing forward most of the time , this team can score goals the key man to watch for honduras is probably wilson palacios , the spurs holding midfielder who is recovering from a thigh injury his brother johnny was already on the squad and just yesterday a third brother , jerry , joined them as a late callup any number of players can score for chile , but one to watch is alexis sanchez , a 21yearold starlet who plays for udinese in italy will the chileans live up to their scintillating reputation \? will honduras exceed rockbottom expectations \? time to find out !
basked in a glowing reception , then spent much of sunday afternoon shaking his head the pregame cheers for anthony soon disappeared , drowned out by the salutes to another purposeful effort from amar'e stoudemire and the  with 30 points , including 24 in the second half , stoudemire recorded his eighth straight game of at least 30 points , snapping a team record that lasted nearly five decades in the process , the knicks won their eighth straight game this time with a victory over a winning team  the guy is a monster , the knicks rookie landry fields said of stoudemire that s the only way i can describe him , a monster in outdueling anthony , stoudemire broke willie naulls s franchise record for consecutive 30point games , which was set in 1962 and anthony , in the role previously reserved for as the pending freeagent superstar , was nearly forgotten at the end of another knicks win the knicks \( 169 \) are off to their best start and longest winning streak in 14 years wilson chandler made a 3pointer to break a late tie , and raymond felton had 19 points and 17 assists , leading a group of starters who all had at least 16 points it showed me a lot of character , knicks coach said being able to throw punches and get it stoudemire , besieged by foul trouble and the possibility of an early ejection , was later pushed by home fans who cheered every basket and showered him with chants of mvp ! stoudemire scored 12 consecutive points in the third quarter , and he connected on five of his seven shots in the fourth a 7footer by stoudemire with one minute left put the knicks ahead , but anthony quickly evened the score , 122122 , with a dunk for his only basket in the fourth quarter as demonstrative as stoudemire is , chandler , a holdover from the organization s dismal days , never is too high or low chandler played superbly , scoring 27 points , and capped his performance with a 3pointer that put the knicks ahead , 125122 , with 30 seconds left he celebrated by calmly slapping a few hands and walking back to the bench i am just being aggressive and confident in myself , chandler said i missed shots before , but i was just confident to shoot after that danilo gallinari , noticing that anthony often goes left on drives , lured him into an offensive foul on denver s next possession , and felton cemented the win with four free throws they called it , and you ca n't get it back , said anthony , who led denver in points \( 31 \) and rebounds \( 13 \) that s all i can say about that there was a similar play on the baseline they called a block on the baseline i guess gallinari made a good play those who nitpicked the knicks over their recent success pointed to their lack of quality opponents the knicks hit a with a loss that left them 38 since , they are 131 we 've evolved a lot since then , d'antoni said things have changed for the better the game was marked by offense , physical play and shaky officiating gallinari started it with a hard foul on anthony , and nene , denver s center , ended it with a technical foul that left ronny turiaf momentarily dazed the matchup against the \( 149 \) started a the knicks host the boston celtics on wednesday , and james and the miami heat on friday , part of a stretch in which 12 of 14 opponents have winning records anthony departed more impressed than the last time the teams played it s a lot different , anthony said the fans are , i'm pretty sure , excited about what s happening on the court amar'e is playing at a high level just the whole team anthony s future has shadowed the nuggets , the knicks and the nets since the summer , the knicks' president , has to contemplate if he should risk trading for anthony this season if it bankrupts a roster that is playing the organization s best basketball in years anthony , who missed denver s previous two games with a sore knee , arrived early at the garden , declared himself healthy and received a warm ovation during introductions i was n't expecting that on a court like this , he said we were the away team , but i 'll take it it felt good for now , he is still a nugget gallinari made that clear early stoudemire , too , started slowly , becoming annoyed by nene the officials hit stoudemire with a technical foul in the first quarter for punching the air and nearly nene while arguing a foul call stoudemire nearly received another in the second quarter for delivering forearms as nene backed toward the rim stoudemire later said that he and nene were close friends off the court there are none , stoudemire said , on the court
stockholm two dozen members of an association to abolish the monarchy were settled around a table in a spacious apartment in the north end of the capital when someone in the back of the room muttered , two hundred years since the french revolution , and still we have a king in other times and in other places , these wouldbe regicides might have been hounded by the king s agents but here in liberal , they are thriving indeed , so fast has membership in the grown in recent months , rising to more than 7 , 300 from 2 , 500 one year ago , that the meeting was called to discuss a number of ambitious proposals , including the opening of a permanent office , the founding of an antimonarchist newspaper and the formation of a paneuropean antimonarchist movement the group envisions branches in the seven countries where kings or queens still reign , including britain , the netherlands , spain and sweden s scandinavian neighbors , denmark and norway support for monarchy is falling across europe , said mona aboujeib broshammar , the association s secretary general to be sure , 7 , 300 members is not much in a country of nine million , yet the association s growth is notable , given that sweden is riding a monarchist high in the wake of the fairytale wedding in june of crown princess victoria , 33 , to her former fitness trainer for the wedding parade , thousands flocked to the capital millions more watched on television stores across the country featured porcelain dishes and cups , wooden trays , dishtowels and aprons , postcards and fountain pens adorned with portraits of the smiling couple yet amid the monarchic euphoria , doubts lingered although sweden s leading newspaper , aftonbladet , established a team in february to cover the wedding , it supplemented bright photos and gushy coverage of the royal court with editorials and opinion pieces , even cartoons , critical of the monarchy then , last spring , a leading polling group , the som institute , published results of a survey showing that support for the monarchy had dropped to 56 percent , from 68 percent six years earlier it was important that there also be some critical pieces , too , said susanne nylen , who led the team covering the wedding all this money was being spent some were critical the attitude of ms nylen , who was the newspaper s london correspondent before assuming the royal beat , is like that of many swedes i can see that the monarchy is not in line with democracy , and i see why people are against it , she said but they are good at representing sweden it s hard to get publicity the same way with a president moreover , as the wedding date approached , less criticism was heard aftonbladet found that 74 percent of respondents in a survey supported the monarchy anders janeborn is one of those supporters i think it s good it s a historic thing , said mr janeborn , whose company sells fitness equipment king carl xvi gustaf was expected this weekend in mr janeborn s village to celebrate its 900th anniversary with a big party , mr janeborn said to those who object that upkeep of the royal family costs about 16 million a year , he argued , they bring in far more they 're selling sweden in a good way mr janeborn s surety is not shared by nina hemmingsson early on , aftonbladet invited ms hemmingsson , 38 , a cartoonist and kind of swedish , to contribute cartoons commenting on the wedding i was always very skeptical of the royal family , said ms hemmingsson , who works out of a basement studio outside stockholm they are so special , people do n't even think they go to the toilet , she said of the royalty yet , they 're a symbol of a time in history that was not democratic , so they 're a bad symbol at first , she said , aftonbladet gave her a free hand then they said , do n't call the princess in your cartoons victoria , ' just the crown princess , ' ' and then , just princess , ' she said and they said from the start , no sex' lennart nilsson of the som institute said that confidence in the royal family has dropped year by year since the institute began measuring it in 1995 it continues going down , he said yet he sees no urgency from society for making a change in september , swedes will vote in national elections , but the monarchy is not an issue other issues like jobs , education and health care are much more urgent , mr nilsson said the swedish republican association is in for the long haul , said ms broshammar , its secretary general born in lebanon to a syrian father and swedish mother , ms broshammar , 32 , is emblematic of the changes overtaking sweden she moved to sweden when her family fled lebanon because of war there i have seen how a country can fall apart for lack of democracy and human rights , she said , adding that she has received hateful messages about her heritage her father is muslim and her mother christian because of my multiethnic background , they say i should leave the country they 're racists , not monarchists still , she does not suggest that sweden will end up like lebanon my best friend is a monarchist she loves the fashion , the marketing of the royal family , she said on a rational level she agrees with me on an emotional level she disagrees the association has attracted some highpowered figures , including the minister for european affairs and leading members of several political parties most parties on the left include in their platform the establishment of a republic , but none pursue it actively the leaders of all parties in parliament were invited to victoria s wedding only lars ohly , 53 , leader of the left party , formerly sweden s communists , stayed away the members discussed a name change for the republican association , so as not to be confused with

the defining moments from the ' first eight games a successful trip against two division rivals , c c sabathia s flirting with a nohitter , an emotional championship ring ceremony are fit for a seasonticket brochure just cut and paste at the same time , identifying an early source of unease is not difficult interrupting the yankees' early harmony has been the slow start of , who has two losses to show for his second stint in pinstripes the second came wednesday at yankee stadium , where the scored four runs against him in that snapped the yankees' threegame winning streak in the yankees' previous defeat , the this one was , in a sense , more painful , if only because how close vazquez was to avoiding damage more than most pitchers , vazquez relies on his offspeed pitches his curveball and changeup , in particular and his trouble finishing off angels hitters with them spelled doom of the six hits he gave up , five came with two strikes the most damaging was torii hunter s leadoff double in the sixth , which started a tworun rally that extended the angels' lead to 41 vazquez did not make it out of the inning his command is not as good as we 've seen it at this point , manager joe girardi said , adding , he had a hard time putting guys away , and that can be the difference in the game the yankees had , but joel pineiro quieted them over seven innings wednesday relying on his sinking fastball , the pitch that rejuvenated his career , pineiro allowed one run and five hits while striking out seven and walking none from the first pitch of the game , i do n't think he threw a ball straight the whole day , derek jeter said when he s throwing like he threw today , he s going to be tough this is one of those games where he was just better than us we did n't really get anything going off him the angels were able to get going against vazquez , whose fastball was a tick or two slow it usually comes in around 92 or 93 miles per hour , but wednesday it topped out at 91 and was mostly in the 8990 range vazquez said he thought he had good life on it , and catcher jorge posada agreed but a diminished fastball can sometimes reduce the effectiveness of offspeed pitches it s just something that goes on once in a while during the season , vazquez said sometimes i 'll throw 9293 one time and then all of a sudden you go back to 8990 the arm works that way , i guess i'm 33 , i'm not 23 anymore i feel good hopefully , it will come back soon many in the crowd of 42 , 372 would surely agree it was vazquez s second outing in the bronx since , but his first as a yankee fans booed after he allowed his second run , on a noout double by bobby abreu in the third , and with gusto in the sixth , when girardi replaced him with alfredo aceves i feel like it s unfair because that was so long ago , you know , vazquez said , referring to his performance in the loss to the boston red sox five and a half years ago i'm trying , like i 've said plenty of times , to concentrate on this year girardi said as soon as he can get a win here , i think that would be best for all of us fans , like you talked about , they remember his next start will be on the road , so it would be nice to get him a win and on a roll vazquez is in line to pitch tuesday at oakland and after that against the angels the yankees may be wishing that , after his dominant outing wednesday , they will miss pineiro many yankees hitters said they had not faced pineiro since his transformation from power pitcher to sinkerballer that came last season with st louis , and the pitch helped pineiro , who was wooed by the mets , sign a twoyear , 16 million deal with the angels in january through four innings , pineiro had allowed only one base runner robinson cano , whose secondinning double plopped out of hunter s glove in center field while pounding that sinker six of his first nine outs came on groundouts we knew that going in , but until you see that , you do n't appreciate it , said mark teixeira , who is 0 for 11 since snapping an 0for17 skid saturday teixeira is a notoriously slow starter , so the yankees are hardly concerned they are equally confident that vazquez , because of his maturity and repertory , will rebound but it was discomfiting for them to see the manner in which vazquez unraveled , how , as posada said , one inning he was rolling along , and then he loses a little bit of his location the yankees had just cut the angels' lead to 21 , on nick swisher s runscoring triple , when vazquez fired two quick strikes to hunter in the sixth the 22 pitch was a cutter that posada thought was a good pitch when hunter did not swing , vazquez responded with a fastball , and it was mashed to right one out later , kendry morales ripped a fullcount changeup into the rightcenterfield gap to score hunter i'm just trying to make too good of a pitch , vazquez said i was trying to be too fine that s been my problem
lawrenceville , ga at a paperplate luncheon for lawyers and judges on friday , , the republican nominee for governor of georgia , searched for a metaphor that would resonate he wanted to describe how it feels to run a major campaign , especially amid revelations last week that he is facing more than 5 million of debt and may need to sell his house to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure what s it like \? he asked rhetorically , standing in a centuryold courtroom in this atlanta suburb it s like being in a trial that is contentious , does n't have weekends off and lasts for over a year and a half in his analogy , the jurors determining his fate would be georgia voters , who must decide in november whether to stand by mr deal , a former nineterm congressman , despite revelations about his worsening financial situation on wednesday , the atlanta journalconstitution reported that mr deal , 68 , owed 23 million to a bank , after having invested in his daughter s sporting goods store , which went out of business last year on thursday , the associated press added to the campaign s troubles , reporting that mr deal also owed 285 million on loans for an automobile salvage business he coowns none of the debts were included in filings that the deal campaign released before the republican primary runoff in august , which mr deal won by less than 1 percent of the vote the backtoback disclosures have upended an election that had been considered reasonably easy for republicans georgia is so reliably conservative with a republican governor , two republican senators and republican control of the state legislature that mr deal s democratic opponent , former gov , declined even to meet president obama when he visited the state last month gov sonny perdue is prevented by term limits from seeking reelection now , national experts are declaring the georgia race a tossup , offering a glimmer of hope to democratic leaders expecting landslide defeats elsewhere , especially in the south this is great for democrats , said larry j sabato , director of the center for politics at the university of virginia georgia is as politically red as its clay , and i would still rate deal a slight favorite , but not any more than that the 23 million debt is the result of mr deal s investment in wilder outdoors , a sporting goods store that his daughter , carrie wilder , and her husband , clint , opened in 2006 over the next few years , mr deal agreed to take responsibility for a series of loans should the wilders go bankrupt they did in july 2009 , after the store went out of business full payment on those loans is due feb 1 , less than a month after mr deal hopes to take office other loans , for 285 million , are related to mr deal s automobile salvage business his campaign says that those debts are ordinary business liabilities and that his business is profitable and secured by 5 million in assets mr deal acknowledges that his financial situation is dire but says he has the money to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure he has listed one of his two houses for sale for its market value of 985 , 000 obviously , this is going to be painful , he said in an interview but i do have resources he has tried to frame the story as the kind of financial hardship many georgians are enduring nobody foresaw the current course of the economy several years ago , he said my wife and i did what responsible parents do we supported our daughter the situation that s happening to our daughter is not unlike what s happening to other georgians the deal campaign has updated its disclosures to include the debt but contends that it was not required by state law to do so mr deal s predicament has parallels to financial problems experienced by another republican politician , christine o 'donnell , the endorsed senate candidate in delaware who won in an upset in tuesday s primary election ms o 'donnell explained revelations that she had owed tens of thousands of dollars in campaign expenses , college tuition and unpaid taxes by saying , i think the fact that i have struggled financially is what makes me so sympathetic but political experts say it will be harder for mr deal to make lemonade of his lemons , primarily because of the scale of his debt my parents might have given me a 10 , 000 loan , said charles s bullock iii , a political science professor at the university of georgia but 2 million \? voters have been divided in their reactions , with some empathetic and others upset i want to know why he left it off his disclosure statement , said gerald davidson , 61 , a lawyer and democrat who attended the luncheon in lawrenceville it s hard to overlook that much money but emory morsberger , a real estate developer and republican , said mr deal s struggles make him more sympathetic to business owners and entrepreneurs experiencing the recession in american business , people take risks , mr morsberger said most businesses are going through tough times these days even before the debt problems , mr deal faced charges of ethical impropriety in march , a week after he resigned from the house to run for governor , the office of congressional ethics released a report concluding that mr deal appeared to have improperly used his staff to pressure georgia officials to continue a state vehicle inspection program that generated hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for his automobile salvage company he denied any wrongdoing , calling the accusations a politically motivated witch hunt the barnes campaign has been mostly silent on the debt issue but in a sign that democrats believe that the scandal has made the election winnable , the last week donated 1 million to mr barnes s campaign a spokesman for the group told the journalconstitution that mr deal s personal finances are in no shape for him to run the state s finances

east rutherford , nj the family of cornerback darrelle revis spent halftime inside their suite at new meadowlands stadium on monday night they ate cookies and picked at finger foods and refilled their drinks all the while , revis s lengthy contract holdout seemed like a distant memory , even if it ended about a week ago in the first half of the jets' 109 loss to the baltimore ravens , revis had reopened his famous island , as the jets' defense swarmed its way to three turnovers in two quarters that somehow led to only 6 points revis even threw a bonecrushing block on antonio cromartie s interception return his family sat on leather couches and watched from the field , or on flatscreen televisions sean gilbert , revis s uncle and a longtime nfl , said his nephew had performed as expected we never prepared for him not to play , gilbert said it would be different if you could n't see the light at the end of the tunnel we could throughout the 36day holdout , gilbert was often portrayed as the mastermind behind the family s hardened stance gilbert himself once held out the entire 1997 season , before he left washington and signed with carolina on monday , gilbert said he had read or watched little of the coverage relating to his nephew he added that none of the perceptions bothered him because nobody knows what happened to me about what went down , gilbert said the truth is coming out now if i was the person i was portrayed to be , darrelle would n't be playing here tonight revis recently told sports illustrated s peter king that he could hold out again after making more than 32 million over the next two seasons gilbert declined to discuss that report , saying what s coming two years from now does n't matter right now , we 're down , 76 gilbert did say that no matter what happened , negotiations would be handled discreetly during this holdout , the sides eventually agreed not to discuss negotiations publicly because they had turned negative coach rex ryan impressed gilbert during his lastditch trip to see revis s family in south florida , shortly before the jets and revis came to terms gilbert said ryan came across as the kind of coach you want to play for it does n't matter how everything transpired , gilbert said darrelle is who we 're focused on i keep telling him , you 're not a superhero do what you do you 'll be fine
washington it was not quite as lofty as madeleine k albright s description of the united states as the world s indispensable nation , but secretary of state came close to channeling her predecessor on wednesday in declaring a new american moment in a speech meant to showcase the successes of the obama administration s foreign policy , mrs clinton emphatically reasserted the primacy of american power in a dangerous world whether it is american aid after the floods in pakistan or american brokering of the recently revived middle east peace negotiations , she said , the world is counting on us after years of war and uncertainty , she said , people are wondering what the future holds , at home and abroad so let me say it clearly the united states can , must , and will lead in this new century in an era of engagement and multilateralism , mrs clinton s was almost a throwback an unalloyed statement of american might it seemed intended to send a bracing message during a tough election season in the united states , with president obama battling economic problems at home but it also sent a strong message about mrs clinton herself fourteen months ago , she stood before the same audience nursing a broken elbow , and one based on partners and persuasion , rather than raw force today , as mrs clinton prepares to plunge into middle east peacemaking , the talk of partnerships and persuasion is still there , but her emphasis was far more on the need for american leadership she even dipped her toe into domestic politics , if only to argue that the swelling federal debt , and the bitter debate about it on capitol hill , threatened america s standing abroad it undermines our capacity to act in our own interests and it does constrain us where constraint may be undesirable , she said , it also sends a message of weakness internationally in the category of foreign policy achievements , mrs clinton said the administration had put american relations with russia on a new footing , deepened its dialogue with china and india , and masterminded a global response to iran s nuclear ambitions on several of these , however , it may be premature to claim victory mrs clinton said , for example , that the united states had prodded the united nations into passing its most robust sanctions ever against iran , and that the iranian government was starting to feel the heat through classic shoeleather diplomacy , she said , we 've built a broad consensus that will welcome iran back into the community of nations if it meets its obligations , and will likewise hold iran accountable if it continues its defiance but two newly ambitious players , brazil and turkey , , displeased that washington brushed aside their effort to broker a diplomatic solution it is also unclear how much sanctions have slowed iran s enrichment of uranium for nuclear fuel similarly , mrs clinton said the united states had reengaged with asia and with the alphabet soup of economic and political organizations in that region but none of that has prevented relations between the united states and china from fraying over exchange rates , north korea and military issues success in foreign policy process , in other words , has not always translated into success in foreign policy substance given the sweeping nature of her remarks , mrs clinton said surprisingly little about afghanistan , where the united states is trying to extricate itself from a nineyear war , or about north korea , where it is nervously watching kim jongil s apparent effort to turn power over to one of his sons one indisputable success is russia , where , as she noted , the white house signed an arms treaty that now goes to the senate for ratification calling for a d tente with republicans on foreign policy , she said , some things should just be beyond any kind of election or partisan calculation mrs clinton also drew attention to sudan , an oftenoverlooked foreign policy problem , saying that a referendum next january , in which southern sudan is expected to vote to break away from the north , is a ticking time bomb of enormous consequence the united states , she said , was trying to get both sides to confront the potential dangers in another eyecatching statement , mrs clinton compared mexico s rampant drug trafficking to an insurgency and said the drug cartels threatened to turn the country into colombia 20 years ago , where the narcotraffickers control certain parts of the country the last time mrs clinton spoke to the , she was battling a perception that she had been marginalized this time , the council s president , richard n haass , ribbed her over persistent washington chatter that she may one day swap jobs with vice president joseph r biden jr to bolster mr obama s chances of reelection \( she smiled and ever so slightly shook her head \) next week , mrs clinton will travel to egypt and israel to take part in the next round of talks between prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel and the president , mahmoud abbas both leaders , she conceded , faced steep domestic hurdles to making a deal still , mrs clinton said , prognosticators who write off the negotiations as an inevitable failure are wrong because both sides and both leaders recognize there may not ever be another chance
sometime in the future , when the story of the devils ilya kovalchuk era is written , this may be the signature moment as new jersey s 100 million man flubbed his chance in the postgame skills competition and the devils remained winless on home ice this season the fans are already having fun with it there s the kovalchoke with what sounds like the red army chorus accompanying him there s the history will be made knockoff and you can click here if you need to be refreshed on the patrik stefan reference and then there s this i don t know what that is in a game where the theme could have been lindy ruff coaching his 1000th game or that two of the game s top goalies , martin brodeur and ryan miller , were both out injured , kovalchuk and his baggage stole the headline and not in a good way that baggage includes his exit from atlanta , the large package the devils traded for him , his huge contract and its accompanying offseason controversy , his team s salary cap dilemma and his scoring slump it culminated in this embarrassment that prompted the crowd of \( allegedly \) 14 , 566 to boo him as he exited kovalchuk was also booed in the dying minutes of regulation when he broke into the sabres zone with a chance to win the game , but shot high off the glass other players are performing below expectations the sharks joe pavelski , the canadiens brian gionta and scott gomez , the coyotes wojtek wolski , the sabres thomas vanek and the canucks mikael samuelsson come to mind but none of them occupy the same space in hockey s firmament as kovalchuk what can you say about poor ilya \? if you re devils fan and yahoo puck daddy editor greg wyshynski , you say , wow just wow would the needle scratching across the record or the car crash sound effect better enhance that epic shootout fail \? even his bad dreams did not include losing the puck off his stick and failing to take a shot while representing the team s final hope in a shootout , wrote rich chere in the starledger and he certainly could not have imagined being booed by the same fans who so desperately wanted him to sign with the devils last summer when he was an unrestricted free agent stan fischler wrote on his msgcom blog , ilya made thousands of devils fans ill someone named dan hopper on something called bestweekevertv termed it , the saddest hockey highlight you ll ever see on fanhouse , adam gertz wrote the only positive aspect of that attempt is that at least he didn t pull a dennis wideman , by which he means this \( guess this all proves shootouts are good for something comedy \) kristie ackert in the daily news wrote , with the devils off to their worst start since 198384 , kovalchuk is the lightning rod for criticism of the team the threetime allstar has scored just three goals , as many as as rookie defenseman matt taormina mark everson in the post wrote , the 100 million man s fatal fumble is the astounding collapse of the devils in a nutshell it s not happening for him and you feel bad for him because he s such a good guy and a guy that wants to be the guy and it s not happening , said devils captain jamie langenbrunner it s unfortunate for him that he got treated that way at the end of the game truth is , kovalchuk is hardly the sole reason the devils lost the sabres were better on special teams \( perfect in seven penalty kills , 2for3 on the power play \) and new jersey played another poor defensive game johan hedberg , who faced 42 shots , did his best but got little help that won t matter to fans , who expect big things from any athlete making big money the devils previously avoided megacontracts , allowing others to overspend while they built competitive and championship teams now that plot has twisted and it is doubtful they can untangle it and , given the salary cap restrictions , get that old devils mojo back they certainly aren t going to find it without kovalchuk being the player he once was if this is the low point for him and if it s not , what could be \? you have to think he ll get angry , start playing with new fire , and find his own mojo again kovalchuk enjoys a good reputation among his teammates he wants to help out so bad , said hedberg , who knows him well from their days together in atlanta , quoted by tom gulitti on his bergen record blog he has a great heart there s not a lot of guys that care more than he does but despite his wellintentioned heart , could the 50goal kovalchuk be a thing of the past \? huge contracts seem to dull many a superstar when you see in the post the news that kovalchuk has paid 45 million for two empty acres on frick drive in alpine , nj kovalchuk plans to build a 20 , 000squarefoot home , you can t help but think that the hunger that drives elite athletes gets sated by immense wealth perhaps kovalchuk has already mentally retreated into his unbuilt mansion
during the classical period composers hewed to certain common precepts and rules the fledgling beethoven , however bold , initially adhered to a haydninspired model likewise , pupils of schoenberg during the early 20th century wrote music recognizably derived from their master s systems today , with no one compositional style holding sway , pedagogy has more to do with instilling discipline , suggesting options and encouraging individuality that point was illustrated during a concert the presented at zankel hall on friday night the event concluded the ensemble s orchestra underground season and inaugurated a carnegie hall perspectives series largely assembled by the eminent dutch composer , who currently holds carnegie s richard and barbara debs composer s chair i do n't know if he would like this description , but he s the new nadia boulanger , the composer derek bermel said from the stage , likening mr andriessen to the influential french teacher who tutored copland , virgil thomson , elliott carter and philip glass , among others differences aside , one similarity between boulanger and mr andriessen became clear from a common foundation their students veered off on wildly divergent paths here works by three of mr andriessen s students john korsrud , missy mazzoli and michael fiday had little in common , save that none of their music sounded much like mr andriessen s nor did mr andriessen s symphony for open strings represent his most familiar mature style , a spiky mix of stravinsky , minimalism , jazz and rock the 25minute 1978 piece requires 12 string players to retune their instruments individually collectively the group covers nearly four chromatic octaves , but a sequence of four consecutive notes requires four players working in tandem from a broad opening theme that sounded like a viol consort , then a wheezy harmonium , the work slowly moved through sequences of development and contrast , its complexities thoroughly disguised by affectless surfaces an early passage sounded a bit like blue moon a doublebass duet churned like stravinsky s rite of spring what the work s woolly machinations suggested most was the aural equivalent of a floppy grandfather clock fashioned by claes oldenburg in a program note mr korsrud wrote that he was encouraged by mr andriessen to venture beyond an early style influenced by john zorn s frenetic jumpcuts in come to the dark side mr korsrud deftly improvised soaring fanfares and racing , spiraling lines on trumpet over the orchestra s morsecode chatter and funky grooves what ms mazzoli learned from mr andriessen , as related in a video interview , were the virtues of selfreliant industry and composing for specific players that her music remains a transferable commodity was indicated by these worlds in us , written in 2006 and newly revised here steady and tranquil , the luminous work contrasted long , breathy sighs in the strings with shimmering bell tones and short , eloquent wind and brass melodies mr fiday s gonzo variations honored hunter s thompson with a cheeky clash of stephen foster s my old kentucky home and the jefferson airplane s white rabbit punctuating the work s earthy roil with a typewriter s chatter and ping was novel and appropriate but william anderson s writhing electricguitar lines largely failed to penetrate the din , and a lengthy final sequence featuring mr thompson s recorded voice , a white rabbit sample and electronic crackles sapped the work s momentum confidently conducted by jeffrey milarsky , the orchestra played brilliantly throughout
some people think that the way to win the office pool in the ncaa men s basketball tournament is to pick the promising underdogs to win and they believe they know which underdogs to pick but two psychology professors have this advice for them do n't bet on it the problem is that of all the prediction techniques asking sportswriters , polling coaches , following the las vegas odds , and others none does better than simply predicting that the betterseeded team will win we all feel we can guess right it s seductive , said edward r hirt , a coauthor of a published in the december issue of the journal of applied social psychology we know that we 're better off just picking the lowerseeded team , but that s boring a pool involves predicting the winner of each game in the tournament the person with the most correct picks wins in the first round , when the no 1 seeds plays the no 16s , the outcome is , for all practical purposes , preordained although there have been a few close calls , including two 1point losses , no 16th seed has ever beaten the no 1 seed since the expansion to 64 teams in 1985 but the closer the seeding , the more likely an upset becomes the game between the teams seeded eighth and ninth is virtually a tossup the researchers checked the results of espn s tournament challenge competition for 2004 and 2005 with about three million entries , it amounts to the largest office pool in the world the number of predicted upsets almost perfectly matched the actual historical pattern as the seedings became closer , the contestants predicted more upsets but they did not predict upsets correctly in 2004 , they picked 752 percent of the winners , and in 2005 they were right 729 percent of the time but if they had simply predicted the lower seed to win every game , they would have scored 875 percent in 2004 and 75 percent in 2005 it is possible that the entrants did badly because they were ignorant of college basketball and did not understand how to evaluate the strengths of the teams or it could be that their rooting interest in particular teams allowed sentiment to overcome judgment to eliminate such effects , the researchers recruited 19 fans , establishing their expertise with a college basketball trivia test just after the 2000 bracket was announced , they asked the fans to rate on a 7point scale how much they liked each team and how strong they thought each team was then they were asked to predict the outcome of the 32 firstround games the winner was promised a 20 prize the researchers found that whether fans liked a team or believed its seeding was inaccurate did not enter into their choices the fans just knew when an upset was coming but they were right only 868 percent of the time over all , when just picking the better seed to win would have yielded 906 percent correct picks two similar experiments using slightly different conditions had similar results why is basketball expertise so useless \? the outcome of a particular game is based largely on nonrandom effects that is , the team with players who are more skilled , better prepared and more effectively coached is more likely to win but the seeding process has accounted for these effects , so only random events remain an injury , a foul at the wrong moment , a lastsecond desperation shot that luckily drops in such things no one can predict it is very hard to make people understand probability the researchers described an experiment that illustrates the problem a subject is told that event a randomly occurs 25 percent of the time and event b the other 75 percent he is then is asked to predict whether a or b will occur in a series of trials guessing b every time assures a 75 percent success rate over the long haul but people do not do this instead , they try to solve the problem by guessing a sometimes and b a little more often people approach it by trying to get 100 percent right , completely misunderstanding the probability , said sean m mccrea , a coauthor of the study and an assistant professor of psychology at the university of wyoming so what advice do the two psychologists have for office pool participants \? hirt , who is a professor of psychology at indiana university , said that if you just want to win , pick the better seed but he conceded that that is not much fun , and it leaves no opportunity to show you are smarter than the experts so mccrea suggested another approach have fun , he said but do n't spend a lot of money
welcome to 8 , read the twitter message from dan harmon , an executive producer of community , to bill prady , his counterpart on the big bang theory it was may 19 , and cbs had just made the biggest television scheduling move of the season , shifting the hugely popular sitcom big bang to thursday nights at 8 , a particularly lucrative time slot for the networks mr harmon was being neighborly , like a homeowner welcoming a newcomer with a fruit basket while fretting about his suretobefalling property values it felt as if a terminator were being sent to destroy his yearold , critically acclaimed sitcom , mr harmon jokingly added an hour later mr harmon electronically greeted an executive producer of the new series my generation on abc , noah hawley , to the same time slot , and by the end of the day the two men were talking about meeting for drinks so began an unusually candid conversation largely in public view among the producers of all five shows on thursday nights at 8 on the major broadcast networks they avidly talk to their fans on twitter , and from time to time they also talk to one another in a brutal and often opaque business , their messages convey just how personal television can be for its creators there s so much at stake there s so much competition , but none of it is our fault , mr harmon said in an interview this week , after noting that none of us ask for our time slots he added , it s a beautiful thing that probably only twitter can provide in this day and age , a reminder that there s absolutely no reason for the creatives to have any animosity toward each other of course , since they are creatives , they enjoy poking fun at one another last thursday the producer of bones , on fox , hart hanson , wrote to his counterparts i forgot to wish you good luck tonight ! or did i \? forget thursdays are exceptionally competitive for the networks it is the secondcostliest night of the week for advertisers , behind sundays , according to advertising age , largely because movie studios , retailers , automotive dealers and others want to capture viewers' attentions heading into the weekend there have been legendary matchups on thursdays , like when fox placed the simpsons against nbc s reigning champ , the cosby show , in 1990 a few years later nbc coined the phrase must see tv for its thursday sitcoms like cheers and friends a little more than two weeks into this season community and the big bang theory are coexisting relatively peacefully big bang has averaged 135 million viewers , a gain of 3 percent from last season , when it on monday nights at 9 30 cbs said the show had exceeded its expectations community draws a much smaller audience 48 million viewers so far this season but nbc said it was satisfied with the ratings for the moment , and pointed to its particular strength among 18 to 34yearolds , a particularly enticing demographic for movie advertisers also at 8 pm bones is up 6 percent , and the vampire diaries , on the cw , is down 8 percent over last season s averages mr hawley s my generation was the loser in the closely watched competition , having been canceled by abc on friday after just two lowrated episodes the next day mr hanson expressed his condolences to mr hawley on twitter on the web there is an obvious strain of sympathy among producers , something that mr harmon learned after community started in september 2009 at first , he recalled , he playfully disparaged bones on twitter , but mr hanson only ever responded with smiles and electronic hugs he buddhaed me , mr harmon said the two men have n't met in person , but mr harmon s mother is a big fan of bones , so mr hanson recently mailed her a box of dvds and tshirts mr prady has largely remained above the fray of the producer chatter he did n't respond to mr harmon s welcome message in may , and in an interview he said he decided back then not to have a conversation about the other shows that are on at 8 i see no point in turning twitter into professional wrestling prematch boasting , he said , opting to use it to talk to fans instead but last week , when big bang fans asked mr prady what he thought of mr harmon and community , he answered on twitter , seems like a nice and funny guy mr harmon shared that remark with his followers , along with a joke see \? assassins can have class kind words and commiseration about network tv life are one thing outright promotion of the competition is another when mr hanson of bones wanted to tell mr harmon how much he enjoyed community last season , he did so through twitter s private messaging function , rather than sending it to him publicly in a way twitter is a direct injection into your fans , and i do n't want to confuse them , mr hanson said i do n't want them watching dan s show i want them to watch my show after reflecting for a moment , he added , i do n't mind them dvring dan s show
baghdad announced on tuesday the return of hundreds of looted antiquities that had ended up in the united states , even as a senior official disclosed that 632 pieces repatriated last year and turned over to the office of prime minister nuri kamal almaliki were now unaccounted for the latest trove reflects not only a history dating from the world s oldest civilizations but also a more recent and tortured history of war , looting and international smuggling that began under , accelerated after the american occupation and to this day the returned items include looted from here after the american invasion in 2003 an even older stolen in the 1990s and seized before an auction at christie s in new york last december and smuggled out of iraq that were seized by the american authorities in 2001 and were being stored in the world trade center when it was destroyed there was also a more recent relic a chromeplated ak47 with a pearl grip and an engraving of mr hussein , taken by an american soldier as booty and displayed at fort lewis , wash kitsch , certainly , but priceless in its own way while iraqi officials celebrated the repatriation of what they called invaluable relics the return of iraq s heritage to our house , as the state minister of tourism and antiquities , qahtan aljibouri , put it the fate of those previously returned raised questions about the country s readiness to preserve and protect its own treasures appearing at a ceremony displaying the artifacts at the ministry of foreign affairs , iraq s ambassador to the united states , samir sumaidaie , pointedly said a previous shipment of antiquities had been returned to iraq last year aboard an american military aircraft authorized by gen david h petraeus , only to end up missing they went to the prime minister s office , and that was the last time they were seen , said mr sumaidaie , who has worked fervently with american law enforcement officials in recent years to track down loot that had found its way into the united states it was not immediately clear what happened , and mr sumaidaie said he had tried and failed to find out he did not directly accuse mr maliki s government of malfeasance , but he expressed frustration that the efforts to repatriate works of art and antiquities had resulted in such confusion and mystery ali almousawi , a government spokesman , demanded that the american government account for the artifacts since an american military aircraft delivered them we did n't receive anything , he said in a telephone interview mr jibouri , one of mr maliki s advisers , said that if the relics were not somewhere in the prime minister s custody , then they would probably be with the ministry of culture , which oversees the country s museums its spokesman declined to comment amira edan , the director of the national museum , said none of the objects had been returned to her collection , which is where , she said , they all belonged mr jibouri said a committee would be formed to investigate perhaps with this uncertainty in mind , mr jibouri and foreign minister publicly signed documents transferring custody of the latest batch of artifacts which arrived in baghdad on monday , packed in wooden crates , aboard a specially chartered aircraft to the museum the artifacts are what s pushing us to build the present and future , so we deserve this great heritage , mr zebari said during the ceremony the united states has returned 1 , 046 antiquities since 2003 , when looters ransacked buildings across iraq , including its museums , according to the american embassy here for all the international outrage the looting stirred toward the united states and its allies , many of the items were smuggled out of the country before the invasion , often with the connivance of officials in saddam hussein s government , according to archaeological officials here they have been tracked and seized by the fbi , the , and other law enforcement agencies , often working on tips from experts and officials with the iraqi embassy in washington , which stored many of them at its building on massachusetts avenue for safekeeping as iraq remained engulfed in violence only a handful of the items returned on tuesday once belonged to the national museum the most prominent is the statue of king entemena , the oldest known representation of a monarch from the ancient civilizations that once thrived in mesopotamia carved from black diorite , it is 30 inches tall and headless , and inscribed with cuneiform that says it was placed in a temple in ur , in what is now southern iraq , to please the god enlil it weighs 330 pounds but disappeared from the museum during the looting , only to be when someone in syria tried to sell it to an art dealer in new york another sumerian sculpture , a bronze depicting a king named shulgi , had been shipped by federal express from a london dealer to a collector in connecticut , but was seized at newark liberty international airport many such pieces are items that iraq never knew it had lost iraq has 12 , 000 known archaeological sites where sumerian , akkadian , babylonian and persian cities and later islamic cities once stood many are unprotected , and have been badly looted for years , especially during the bloodiest years of war in 2006 and 2007 a special police force created in 2008 has yet to fill its ranks , mired at its inception by the government s bureaucracy and a lack of support for cultural preservation the national museum , which officially reopened last year though many of its galleries , has recovered roughly half of 15 , 000 pieces that were looted from its collection all told , iraqi officials say they have confiscated and returned to government property more than 30 , 000 antiquities and artworks since 2003 , from inside and outside iraq the museum can hold only a fraction of those we can make 15 museums like the one we had , its deputy director , muhsin hassan ali , said on tuesday the ultimate fate of the saddam hussein ak47 also remains unclear , though it too was signed over to the custody of the national museum some material belongs to the fourth millennium bc , ms edan , the museum s director , said laughing , and the new ones belong to saddam s iraq the assault rifle ended up at the headquarters of the third stryker brigade of the second infantry division the agency said it had been taken legally via official army channels with the intent of placing it in a military museum as a war trophy agents confiscated it after mr sumaidaie s in a local newspaper report a factory in iraq once produced ak47s , including some plated in gold and chrome , which mr hussein distributed as gifts at the time the rifle was recovered , a special agent of ice in new york , peter j smith , called it a priceless symbol of iraqi history
washington the , having weathered criticism of its regulatory failings and interest rate decisions in the years before the , is facing a new source of anger the  take , for example , three republican nominees for the senate who relied on support from tea party activists to vanquish primary rivals supported by the party establishment in utah , mike lee has accused the central bank of trying to monetize the debt by printing money to buy government bonds a motivation that fed officials have hotly denied ken buck in colorado has called for shining a light on the federal reserve , saying it is too cozy with private interests and in kentucky , rand paul has argued that the fed is devaluing and causing boombust cycles through its easymoney policies they have made the fed a target of their ire , linking it to their criticisms of president obama s stimulus effort and the wall street bailouts begun under president george w bush none of them has gone as far , though , as mr paul s father , representative ron paul , a texas republican and libertarian activist who is seeking to abolish the central bank \( his 2009 book , end the fed , is popular in tea party circles \) the senior mr paul , who ran for president in 2008 , is in line to lead a house subcommittee that oversees the fed if republicans win control of that chamber in november criticism of the fed has been more of a simmering undercurrent in this election cycle than a dominant theme , even for insurgent candidates but fed officials , who try to avoid public discussion of electoral politics , have become increasingly attuned to the probability that their critics will have a louder voice in the next congress the likely outcome is greater scrutiny of the fed , even though the wall street regulatory overhaul that mr obama signed in july already calls for a onetime audit of the fed s emergency lending programs as well as a study by the government accountability office of how the central bank is governed the fed has become politicized , whether we like it or not , said tyler cowen , an economist at george mason university who writes a macroeconomics blog to be sure , mistrust of central banking has been an enduring theme in american history the fed , established in 1913 , is the nation s third central bank the other two expired in 1811 and 1836 when their charters lapsed there s always been this strong tension between people who are likely to be debtors , and who are in effect in favor of cheap money , and people who are creditors and in favor of hard money , said benjamin m friedman , a harvard economist whose 2005 book , the moral consequences of economic growth , argued that growth was essential for social and political progress historically , anger at the fed has been voiced from the left and the right , but lately it has been more pronounced among conservatives mr friedman said the anger had understandable origins , saying it resulted from stagnation in the incomes of ordinary citizens , compounded now by high unemployment some critics , however , say the fed has been too eager to fight unemployment and should be more attentive to inflation risks one is peter d schiff , who runs a brokerage firm in westport , conn , and unsuccessfully sought the republican nomination for the senate in connecticut this year , with tea party support mr schiff assailed the fed s decisions to cut shortterm interest rates to nearly zero and buy 17 trillion in mortgagebacked assets and to stimulate the economy what we need now is higher interest rates , severe cuts in spending , he said and that will bring about a severe downturn , but there s no way around it we have to swallow some bitter medicine if we do n't , we 're going to get sicker and sicker he added the fed is the enabler , by keeping credit flowing it is a drug dealer mr schiff who warned in a 2007 book of impending economic collapse and has made web videos on the topic is hardly outside the republican mainstream representative spencer t bachus of alabama , the top republican on the house financial services committee , has also used a drug analogy to describe the fed s interventions as with any addiction , an altered state is created where the only choices are permanent addiction or a sometimes painful withdrawal , mr bachus said at a house hearing in february dick armey , a former house majority leader and now a tea party organizer , blames the fed for abetting the crisis by keeping interest rates too low for too long after the 2001  a few tea party candidates , like mr lee in utah , have come close to urging a return to the gold standard , which the united states essentially abandoned in 1933 mr lee , in a forum with voters last year , questioned the use of fiat money , currency that has no intrinsic value but the full faith and credit of the government that issues it maybe we ought to return to the gold system , he said i do n't really care whether it s gold or silver or platinum or grapenuts or corn flakes it s got to be based on something the ire at the fed may be broad but not very deep a found that tea party supporters were more likely than all adults surveyed to say they had heard or read about the fed while a plurality of tea party supporters and all respondents said they had confidence in the fed to promote financial stability , a sizable minority of both groups said they did not know enough to say even so , the anger has been strong enough to raise some concerns among republicans the positions that have become almost mainstream , at least on the right , used to be extreme positions , vin weber , a republican and a former congressman from minnesota , told bloomberg television this month only the john birch society used to call for the auditing of the federal reserve in an essay titled published in the national review in june , josh barro , a fellow at the manhattan institute , noted with dismay that tea party activists had gotten the maine republican party to adopt a platform calling for an audit as the first step in ending the fed there s always a problem with unaccountable government agencies , but on the other hand the fed has had a free hand to do things that have been necessary and unpopular , mr barro said in an interview if congress had had the power to stop all the asset purchases the fed has done , we might have dropped into the last couple of years thomas m hoenig , president of the federal reserve bank of kansas city , is the most prominent inflation hawk at the fed , having dissented repeatedly from the fed s stance that it intends to keep interest rates near zero for an extended period mr hoenig appeared recently before the hope for america coalition , an antifed group , in lenexa , kan he noted that financial panics regularly troubled the economy before the fed was created he might not have changed their minds , he said , but the crowd was polite and appreciated his willingness to dissent
washington the democrats' strategy to preserve their house majority became clearer thursday as the party made a 28 million investment in television advertising for the final weeks of the fall campaign , a plan meant to build a defensive firewall to protect freshmen and some vulnerable longtime incumbents the democratic congressional campaign committee reserved television time on behalf of 40 lawmakers , 18 of whom were first elected two years ago , when president obama ran atop the party s ticket nine others are democrats who were elected in 2006 , when the party swept control of congress from the republicans the list of atrisk democrats also contains wellestablished members , including john m spratt jr of south carolina , chairman of the budget committee ike skelton of missouri , chairman of the armed services committee and paul e kanjorski of pennsylvania , a senior member of the financial services committee none of the 40 districts are held by republicans , a signal that the democratic plan is rooted in defense the decisions , which were confirmed by party strategists and advertising buys made on local television stations , help define more precisely the battlefield on which the two parties will fight for control of congress over the next four months as republicans work to reclaim the majority the democratic committee plans to make two more waves of advertising buys to reserve time for television spots in the closing two weeks of the race in addition to the junior members , party strategists have identified vulnerable veterans , including chet edwards of texas , who is seeking his 11th term earl pomeroy of north dakota , who is seeking his 10th term and leonard boswell of iowa , who is seeking his eighth term several incumbent democrats are bracing for something they have rarely faced serious competition their predicament is the latest sign of distress for their party and underlines why republicans are confident of making big gains in november and perhaps even winning back the house democrats are playing defense in every corner of the country , hoping to use their fundraising advantages to preserve their 40seat majority in the house the 28 million in advertising commitments represents the bulk of the 34 million in cash that the party committee had available at the end of june i feel very confident about the ability of my members , who are the greatest salespersons in america , to go into their districts and make the case for what we did , speaker told reporters on thursday , adding that the party s accomplishments in congress would ultimately prove to be winning issues in november while ms pelosi and other party leaders worked aggressively to persuade democrats to support key pieces of legislation , like health care , the economic stimulus and energy legislation , the list of 40 districts on thursday suggested that support for the party s agenda was not a requirement for its campaign dollars five firstterm democrats who supported the health care bill are receiving help from the campaign committee , but 10 democrats who opposed the measure are also receiving support an independent arm of the committee decides which races merit investment the democratic house committee has a 17 million advantage over its republican counterpart , so democrats can afford to invest in far more districts yet only one of the contests being focused on is an open seat , in the third congressional district in kansas , where dennis moore , a democrat , is retiring if you want to get an idea of what the democrats' strategy is this fall , just follow the money , said ken spain , a spokesman for the national republican congressional committee the political environment has become so toxic that democrats in washington are gearing up to spend millions of dollars to defend what were once perceived as some of the most entrenched incumbents in congress some of the 40 districts are represented by democrats who have been viewed as ripe for a republican takeover , but others provide the first sign that the ranks of vulnerable democrats may be deeper than previously acknowledged the list also was being studied by republicans for any head fakes districts in which democrats were trying to entice their rivals into spending their limited resources the 40 districts that democrats selected , which can be added to or subtracted from , were based on polling , candidate fundraising and the strength of republican opposition the group includes five seats in ohio , four in pennsylvania , three in arizona and in virginia , and two each in florida , illinois , indiana , new york and texas several of the decisions signal new signs of worry from democrats like stephanie herseth sandlin of south dakota , betty sutton of ohio , allen boyd of florida , joe donnelly of indiana , gerald e connolly of virginia and jerry mcnerney of california the dccc is going to aggressively use every tool media , voter contact programs and research to retain the house , said jennifer crider , a spokeswoman for the committee voters will have a clear choice this november the republican committee has 17 million in available cash , according to records filed this week , and intends to make its first television advertising decisions as soon as next month
peter orszag s wellremunerated transition from the white house to one of the banks that our federal government recently bailed out provoked a thoughtful post from will wilkinson , who suggested that the revolving door between wall street and washington illuminates a tension within the progressive strand of liberal thought no matter how ingeniously or idealistically progressives deploy government power as a countervailing force against the imagined oppressive and exploitative tendencies of market institutions , he wrote , it seems that time and again market institutions find ways to use the government s regulatory and insureroflastresort functions as countervailing forces against their competitors and , in the end , against the very public these functions were meant to protect jonathan chait , everready to defend liberalism s honor , immediately cried foul  i don t think private capture of public functions represent a major , recurring problem with liberal governance does the minimum wage result in regulatory capture \? does social security \? the earned income tax credit \? libertarians are very interested in the phenomenon of regulations being turned into weapons of business power , but this phenomenon seems like the exception rather than the rule this strikes me as a little bit obtuse first , there s an obvious distinction as wilkinson notes in his reply to chait between regulatory regimes and straightforward taxandtransfer programs a program like social security isn t vulnerable to industry capture in exactly the way that , say , a capandtrade regime tends to be , because it isn t a regulatory structure ditto the earned income tax credit the minimum wage , on the other hand , is a regulatory structure and it s also an example of how even the most simple and straightforward regulation can become a tool for big corporations to use against their smaller competitors \( what , you thought walmart spoke up for minimumwage increases out of the goodness of its corporate heart \? \) it s also worth noting that not all captures of government programs look like textbook cases of regulatory capture \( they aren t all as straightforward and egregious as , say , the exploitation of certain alternativeenergy tax credits by some clever paper manufacturers \) where the big programs that chait is defending are concerned , it s usually more complicated than that the capturer isn t usually some completely mercenary corporation that s figured out how to game the system instead , it s often a group or organization that s integral to the purposes the government is trying to pursue , but \( alltoounderstandably \) ends up putting its own interests , or those of its members , ahead of the common good so the welfare state gets captured by the teachers who benefit from uncompetitive workplaces , the publicsector unions who benefit from inflated salaries and goldplated benefits , the doctors and hospitals who benefit when the government subsidizes unnecessary treatment , the pharmaceutical companies who benefit when the government subsidizes their drugs , the lawyers and lobbyists who benefit from the complexities of the estate tax , the mortgage lenders and real estate brokers who benefit from the homemortgage deduction , and so on and so forth note that none of these groups have turned the programs in question completely away from their intended ends the public schools still educates america s children , medicare still pays for seniors health care , california s prisons still hold inmates and the trains in new york still carry people to work , the estate tax still collects money that can be redistributed to the poor , the homemortgage deduction still \( god help us ! \) encourages middleclass homebuying this kind of commonplace capture isn t a pure and obvious betrayal of liberal purposes it s just a corruption of the process , a skimming off the top , a layer of interestgroup involvement that distorts programs and makes them vastly more expensive without wrecking them entirely and to some extent , it s something that we have to live with \( a point that wilkinson makes , eloquently , at the conclusion of his original post \) , as the price of trying to run any kind of government in a nation of 300 millions but when conservatives and libertarians worry about the pathologies inherent in an evermoreexpansive state , this is what they have in mind not the possibility that the programs in question will be completely corrupted , but the certainty that they ll generate higher costs , redound to the benefit of more entrenched interests , and prove far more difficult to fix than liberals often seem to expect
princeton , nj it would have been completely understandable if princeton running back jordan culbreath , brimming with potential off the field , had decided never to play football again a mechanical and aerospace engineering major , he , along with a friend , invented a coldwater treatment tub with a refrigeration and filtration system that has saved princeton thousands of dollars on ice then there was worry over his physical wellbeing none of us wanted him to feel guilty about not being able to play football , coach bob surace said we just wanted him to lead a normal life a senior and a former firstteam allivy league selection , culbreath missed the final eight games of the 2009 season after receiving a diagnosis of aplastic anemia , in which bone marrow cannot produce enough blood cells his body was unable to control bleeding , making any football hit potentially lifethreatening culbreath , though , was determined to return i'm a football player it s part of me and my identity , he said getting back on that field for me is almost like not allowing that illness to beat me early in his first game this season , against lehigh , a linebacker hit him squarely and muttered , welcome back culbreath smiled to himself as he jogged back to the huddle once a week he has his blood tested , and twice a month he receives a platelet infusion at the campus health center those sessions allow culbreath to keep playing football after being treated for the disease for the better part of a year , culbreath surprised his teammates by showing up at preseason camp in august he regained his starting job and , in the tigers' second game , scored in a 3633 doubleovertime victory over lafayette you ca n't script all the things that came to place , surace said last september culbreath was rushed to robert wood johnson university hospital in new brunswick , nj , where he underwent blood and platelet transfusions in the weeks before , culbreath had not shown many outward signs of trouble internally , though , he could feel that something was wrong as the preseason pick for ivy league offensive player of the year in 2009 , and a team captain , he expected to have a memorable senior season but in training camp , he began lagging behind in conditioning drills and breathing abnormally headaches developed , his fingers tingled and his gums bled he grew lethargic and felt cold constantly he just looked terrible , said dr margot putukian , the team physician it looked like he was running in quicksand as the symptoms worsened , culbreath remained quiet early in the 2009 season s second game , culbreath twisted his ankle when he went to the sideline , blood was dripping from his mouth at halftime , he finally told putukian how he had been feeling i was confused , culbreath said i did n't know what was going on with my body putukian ordered a blood test the results were startling hemoglobin , platelets and white blood cell counts were at what she called panic values she told culbreath to get to the hospital immediately the doctors were surprised i could even walk into the building , let alone play a game on the previous saturday , culbreath said after five

katmandu , nepal s parliament on monday failed for a fifth time to select a new prime minister , in a deepening political stalemate fueled by ego and ideology that is alienating the public and crippling the government and the economy in this himalayan nation on monday , after months of political turmoil , legislators repeated the same unsuccessful pattern from four previous attempts to name a new prime minister the two largest political parties in the 601member parliament , the maoists and the smaller nepali congress , again fielded rival candidates , and again , leaders of the other political parties claimed neutrality and prevented either rival candidate from achieving a majority now we must take some time , before going to another round of elections , to discuss the core issues of the peace process and to reach an agreement , said the nepali congress party candidate , ram chandra poudel lawmakers will try again to select a prime minister on sept 5 the failure of monday s vote may intensify pressure for a breakthrough the maoist chairman , pushpa kamal dahal , known as , had been trying in vain to peel off enough votes from lesser parties to form a majority maoist government the pressure also will be on the country s third largest party , the communist party of nepal \( unified marxistleninist \) , known as the cpnuml a moderate leftist party , it has faced growing criticism that its neutrality stance is intended to prevent either of the two leading parties from winning a majority the voting for five rounds has shown that a majority government could not be formed , said the communists' chairman , jhalanath khanal there now is no alternative to forming a national consensus government meanwhile , the public is growing disillusioned with the impasse , and the economy is suffering many people who work outside the country are struggling to get visas from government offices , and many government projects are frozen by the uncertainty kunda dixit , publisher of the weekly magazine , said a popular callin radio program on monday was filled with the voices of people disgusted by the spectacle nepal is in the midst of one of the most volatile and challenging political transitions in the world once a feudal monarchy , then a weak parliamentary democracy , nepal experienced a bloody 10year maoist guerrilla war that with the maoists handing over their weapons \( if not their army \) and forming a political party earlier this year , political leaders to complete a new constitution and conclude the peace process instead , the negotiation process was extended for another year one obstacle had been the maoist demand for the resignation of former prime minister madhav kumar nepal when mr nepal on june 30 , the battle to succeed him became a battle for the upper hand in shaping the new constitution \( in the interim , mr nepal is serving as a caretaker prime minister \) the new constitution is expected to change nepal s federal governmental structure and for the first time create states yet many difficult issues are impeding progress on that document and the unfinished peace process , none more contentious than the fate of more than 19 , 000 former maoist combatants who have spent more than three years inside camps monitored by the united nations under the peace deal , many of them are supposed to be integrated into nepal s security forces , a process that has been delayed by sharp disagreements another point of tension has been the role of nepal s dominant neighbor , india india , facing , is wary of a possible maoistrun government in nepal while india has denied meddling in nepal s political affairs , mr dixit echoes many other analysts when he says that india is trying to prevent the maoists from getting into power , by hook or by crook ego and rivalry are also major factors , and not just among competing parties the maoist leader , prachanda , has quarreled with other top maoist leaders , among them baburam bhattarai , who is considered more open to a compromise governing arrangement
and have a common ancestor it takes a long time and considerable patience to get to that surprise denouement of faces of america , a fourpart series , beginning on wednesday , about family roots by the harvard professor and even with charming celebrities , and of jordan are among the 12 whose genealogy is explored almost back to paleolithic times the telling can at times be a little wearisome but that is perhaps fitting for the subject watching this solemn , painstaking examination of immigrants' roots is a little like trying to pry juicy family stories from an elderly aunt at thanksgiving dinner there are some tedious detours and false starts , but the unexpected details and touching sidebars are worth the effort mr gates , the film s narrator and writer , put a huge effort into this project , which is obviously dear to his heart the director of the w e b du bois institute for african and african american research at harvard , mr gates is a founder of the genealogy web site , and the editor in chief of the root \( \) , a site on africanamerican news , culture and genealogy he has also done two previous series about africanamerican genealogy for pbs some may wonder whether heritage and ethnicity really matter anymore in a society that fancies itself postracial , but mr gates has his recent beer summit experience as evidence to the contrary it was while returning from a trip to china last summer to research mr ma s ancestry that mr gates was handcuffed after breaking into his own house in cambridge , mass \( the arresting officer said mr gates had been uncooperative and said he would speak to your mama that sounded like a slur but could also have been namedropping , though mr gates later told the new york times columnist maureen dowd that he had n't mentioned yoyo ma in the altercation \) at the time of the arrest , mr gates was outraged , convinced that he was suspected of burglary only because he was black turns out , he is n't even so black in the film he reveals that like many africanamericans , he has white ancestors , and more european roots than african the writers malcolm gladwell , and are interviewed so are the chef mario batali , television s dr mehmet oz and the figure skater kristi yamaguchi ms streep s background is less exotic but more exalted than most on one side of her family her roots go back to founding fathers and a quaker who left his church rather than cease agitating for independence from the british i know it should make me feel even more important than i already am , she says selfmockingly the comedian , raised roman catholic in an irish immigrant family , is surprised to learn that some of his ancestors were lutheran , or , as he puts it , heretics he is not shocked to learn that he has no african or asian traces in his dna , and is of 100 percent european ancestry i am the inescapable black hole of white people mr gladwell , whose mother is jamaican , is a bit chagrined to discover that one of his jamaican ancestors was a free colored woman who was also a slave owner there are all kinds of genetic surprises , though none are truly shocking mr nichols is related , not so distantly , to albert einstein , just as his mother used to claim he says that he is astounded that the thing you 've been bragging on , thinking you 're a liar , is true what is more surprising is how little some people know about their own histories queen noor , who was born lisa najeeb halaby into a family of syrian christian immigrants , says she was the only one in her successful , assimilated family to take a real interest in its arab roots but she did n't know that her grandfather najeeb , a firstgeneration immigrant , was buried in brooklyn mr gates takes her to visit the gravestone for the first time queen noor , who converted to islam when she married king hussein of jordan in 1978 , prays at the site her ignorance about her own roots is as telling about the willful amnesia that clouds many immigrants' assimilation process as anything else she reveals but mr gates does n't ask questions , he answers them he tells ms yamaguchi , whose parents were born in california internment camps during world war ii , that her grandfather enlisted in the 100th infantry division and fought in europe throughout the war , the only japaneseamerican in his unit she did n't know he was a war hero and tears up when mr gates shows her a new york times clip from the period , a news article about the promotion to lieutenant of a nisei , the term used to describe americanborn children of japanese immigrants some celebrities , like mr batali and mr ma , turn surprisingly emotional about remote ancestors , but one refuses to look too closely into ancient roots ms erdrich , a novelist \( love medicine \) and chronicler of american indian life , declines to have her genome sequenced and decoded , possibly for fear that dna results would complicate her claim to chippewa ancestry she tells mr gates that her relatives said that it was their dna too , and not hers alone to share with the world ms longoria , who is mexicanamerican , is not afraid to look at her pie chart and discover that while she is 70 percent european , she is also 27 percent asian \( and 3 percent african \) when told that she has a genetic tie to yoyo ma , she jokes , he s mexican \? a little like people who claim to have lived past lives , almost everybody in the group seems to have a drop of blue blood ms alexander , who , like mr gates , turns out to be more european than african , is descended from king john of england

philadelphia dave righetti , the ' pitching coach , knows what baseball fans are expecting in game 1 of the national league championship series on saturday tim lincecum and are scheduled to face each other in the most highly anticipated matchup of aces in years , and if their first appearances in the postseason last week are an indication , it could be something to behold in their playoff debuts , pitched the second nohitter in postseason history , and threw a masterly shutout with 14 strikeouts and only three base runners lincecum was so good in that victory against the in game 1 of the teams' national league division series that some even said he was better than halladay , who was so commanding he missed a perfect game by only one pitch you saw two pitchers really go out and dominate a game in a playoff situation , and it s fun to compare them , righetti said hey , maybe this one was as good as that and now they 're facing each other \? this is a baseball fan s dream , in a sense i would n't miss it righetti felt the same way about a similarly compelling playoff matchup 20 years ago two aces faced each other twice , and their second confrontation fizzled into a bizarre display of anger and emotion in one of the biggest playoff meltdowns in history on oct 6 , 1990 , righetti had just finished another season as the yankees' closer although he was n't in the playoffs , he made sure to be in front of a television for game 1 of the american league championship series as a pitcher , a student of the game and a fan , he was not about to miss the big confrontation of aces , roger clemens of the boston red sox against dave stewart of the oakland a s , in what was seen before the game as an epic matchup they were two of the most dominant pitchers of their time clemens had won two cy young awards and was 216 that season with a 193 earned run average stewart was 2211 with a 256 era , and they went on to finish second and third behind oakland s bob welch \( 276 , 295 era \) for the cy young the clemensstewart pairing was regarded as alifrazier on a pitcher s mound , and in game 1 the aces did not disappoint clemens did not allow a run in six innings and stewart gave up only one , but the a s crushed the red sox bullpen to win , 91 the rematch the event everyone remembers came four days later in game 4 during a brilliantly sunny day in oakland the red sox were trailing by three games to none , and everything depended on clemens , who wore eye black to heighten his fearsome mound presence but instead of a masterly duel , clemens gave up three runs in the second inning and lost his cool , becoming embroiled in an argument with the home plate umpire , terry cooney , who instead of a classic rematch , fans ended up watching stewart pitch most of the game against relievers tom bolton , jeff gray and larry andersen \( who combined for six and a third scoreless innings \) oakland won , 31 , and advanced to the world series while many people hope that halladay and lincecum can provide a memorable game , righetti cautioned that it does not always end up that way they 've got baseball players on the other side trying to stop you from doing it , righetti said a pitcher with a baseball in his hand is the most unique thing in sports once it leaves his hand , it only takes a millisecond , and then the rest of the teams are involved that s how i look at it there s players on both sides lincecum and halladay both recognize the significance of their meeting , especially after what each did in his last outing lincecum said he saw bits of halladay s performance in the clubhouse in san francisco like righetti taking in clemens and stewart , halladay said he watched lincecum s game as a fan i think other pitchers enjoy watching those types of guys go out there , halladay said i think we all want to see wellpitched games you hate to see the hitters dominate all the time lincecum said on friday that the blister that developed on his right middle finger against atlanta had calloused over and would not be a problem saturday he also said he hoped to contain his emotions as much as possible , even while pitching in a duel of aces my approach on this game is the same as any other start , lincecum said obviously , it s a big game but i do n't want to get too overamped as long as he does n't come out with eye black on , he should be fine
beijing the banquet organized friday night to celebrate the news that the jailed chinese dissident had won the nobel peace prize was over before it began while the two dozen bloggers , rights lawyers and academics were arriving at the private room they had reserved at a beijing restaurant shortly after the norwegian committee s announcement , the police rushed in and briskly led the celebrators away , according to those who were there by sunday , 10 of the 20 people who had been picked up were released , said zhang zuhua , an activist who is in touch with the detainees three were given eightday jail terms for disturbing the peace and seven were escorted out of beijing , he said as presidents , religious figures and rights advocates around the world praised the nobel committee and called on the chinese government to release mr liu , one of s most prominent dissidents , the chinese government reacted with unrestrained ire they called in the norwegian ambassador in beijing for a dressing down , placed scores of dissidents under house arrest and angrily described the decision to honor mr liu as blasphemy and an insult to the chinese people mr liu , 54 , a former literature professor who has spent the past 20 years pressing for political reform in china , is serving an 11year sentence for inciting subversion of the state , based on his writings and a prodemocracy manifesto , charter '08 , that he helped to draft the document , which demands an end to singleparty rule and calls for expanded liberties , gathered 10 , 000 signatures before government censors blocked its circulation on the internet in an editorial on saturday , the global times , a state newspaper , accused the nobel committee of imposing western values on china , showing contempt for its legal system and seeking to split the nation by provoking social strife every chinese can sense a deliberate maliciousness in doing so , it said the englishlanguage version of the same newspaper expanded on the theme , quoting an international relations professor at renmin university , who said that the decision to select mr liu for the prize was intended to humiliate china such a decision will not only draw the ire of the chinese public , but also damage the reputation of the prize , said the professor , shi yinhong on friday night , scores of journalists gathered outside mr liu s home , but the police refused to allow his wife , liu xia , to come out and would not let reporters enter the police later led her away , promising to escort her to jinzhou prison , 300 miles away in liaoning province , to see her husband she returned to beijing on sunday after visiting her husband , mr zhang said ms liu could not be reached for comment in an interview last week , ms liu said she had little expectation that her husband would win the prize but said that if he did , she hoped it might prompt the authorities to release him earlier as my friends have said , how can they keep a nobel peace prize winner in jinzhou prison \? she said few chinese citizens seemed aware of the honor accorded mr liu , even 24 hours after its announcement never heard of him , but we also have n't watched tv recently , said yang guwen , dressed in a denim cowboy shirt , as he and his girlfriend walked beneath a huge television screen that hangs over one of the capital s ritziest shopping malls had he followed news reports , mr yang would not have learned that a chinese citizen had won one of the world s most respected prizes except for the global times editorial and a brief foreign ministry condemnation posted on the internet , chinese newspapers and webbased portals ignored the news anyone typing the words nobel peace prize or liu xiaobo into google found themselves facing a blank screen a veteran civil rights lawyer , teng biao , said he was on his way to meet a foreign journalist on saturday when he was stopped by national security agents at the beijing university where he teaches the officers say that the police have rigid orders from higher authorities that they must work resolutely to thwart celebratory activities to mark this event , he said in a cellphone interview , having briefly stepped away from the agents to take a call they are keeping a strict eye on the most active people , in order to reduce its impact to the smallest degree possible the activists who gathered for the celebratory meal on friday night were no strangers to police surveillance earlier in the evening , they had met in a park with yellow ribbons pinned to their shirts and clear plastic sleeves the kinds favored by conventioneers slung around their necks the sleeves carried two portraits of mr liu one dark and somber , the other brightly lighted and decidedly cheery when word of the arrived , they turned the happy photo to face out , walked to the restaurant and tacked a portrait of mr liu on a wall by the time paul mooney , an american freelance journalist , arrived , the police had already shown up after a brief scuffle , the men and women were led away , leaving mr mooney alone with a roomful of officers and the crumpled portrait of the nobel laureate on the floor out of curiosity , he asked the young officers if they were familiar with mr liu none of them even knew who he was , he said

not long after the first european explorers encountered the gulf of mexico , word filtered back to the continent that along this warm , exotic coastline , oysters grew on trees this caught the european imagination imagine a place so abundant that the oysters grow on trees ! there was even a kernel of truth to it the trees in question were mangroves , and in florida oysters indeed did grow on their roots in the tidal zone more often , the oysters thrived at the margins of the seemingly limitless marshes that stretched to the horizon , perched between sea and sky there was also a second , more important truth underpinning this tale the gulf really was a paradise of abundance where else do you have a river the size of the mississippi draining a region as fertile as the midwestern heartland into a wellenclosed body of water as warm as the gulf of mexico \? this is why the gulf has continued , despite the damage we have done to it , to produce marine life at astonishing rates with its bounteous populations of mollusks , shrimp and finfish , the gulf holds one of the best supplies of health food on the planet and has been a natural engine of prosperity key to the gulf s productivity are its marshes , the nurseries of the sea fed by the regular supply of sediment washed over them by the mississippi and its distributaries , the marshes have built up over 5 , 000 years into the vast network of estuaries we know today tucked safely into its marshes , seagrass meadows , oyster reefs and other critical habitats form the base of the marine food chain we think of fish as living throughout the oceans , but most of the action happens close to shore where the food is indeed , 97 percent of the commercial catch of fish species in the gulf depends on its estuaries and their nursery habitats for survival to take just one example , the gulf s famous shrimp which account for 73 percent of the nation s total harvest and hundreds of millions of dollars in dockside revenue alone lay their eggs in the open gulf , but then their hatched larvae head for the estuaries , where they live in salt marshes until they are ready to return to the open water as adults no salt marshes , no shrimp no estuaries , no fish the animal most responsible for maintaining the integrity of these estuaries is the oyster , which provides much more than new orleans s most delectable appetizer oysters occur in great abundance in the gulf s shallow coastal waters by gluing themselves to each other s shells , they create reefs much like coral reefs that literally hold the coastal ecosystem together oyster reefs form a living breakwater that protects the soft marsh shorelines from erosion and storm damage they also serve as the condominiums of the sea , providing intricate habitats and hiding places for many small and juvenile creatures at the foundation of the gulf food web studies show that the commercial value of the gulf s oysters \( more than 60 million dollars per year , about 67 percent of the nation s total \) is easily surpassed by the commercial value of the fish that need these reefs there are few other places on earth still like this they are the single most imperiled marine habitat the oyster reefs of the gulf are not merely the best in the nation they are the best in the world , a global treasure yet some 50 percent to 90 percent of the gulf s oyster reefs have been lost , and that was before bp s oil spill the marshes , too , are in sharp decline the mississippi river levee system , completed after the great flood of 1927 , helped control flooding by shunting much of the river s water deep into the gulf , but it also robbed the marshes of the sediments they need to replenish themselves the thousands of miles of canals dug through the wetlands by the oil industry in its search for new reservoirs further eroded the marshes a football field of land disappears into the gulf every half hour the fastestshrinking area is the baratariaterrebonne estuary , west of the mississippi river delta , which has been hit hard with oil from the deepwater horizon paradoxically , before the oil spill , scientists had come to a consensus that the only place on earth offering a realistic opportunity for oyster reef restoration on a scale that could support a truly sustainable fishery was the gulf of mexico but there had never been the political will for such a project now that the spill has brought such attention to the gulf coast , perhaps we can agree to the kind of national response that has been needed for so long just cleaning up the spill will not be sufficient federal , state and local governments have written many plans for restoration of the gulf , beginning even before hurricane katrina , but none were intended to do more than slow the losses we should get off the defensive and come up with a winning vision of coastal restoration the work would start in the mississippi river delta , where we need to reengineer levees to divert a portion of water flow so that the valuable sediment can spill out of it when done properly , such diversions can be carefully controlled to have little impact on shipping or flood control it s a tremendous undertaking , though largescale marsh restoration requires scores of barge and backhoe operators , as well as engineers , to create the diversions , distribute the sediment , grade the marsh banks , and maximize the inlets and channels that make a healthy , productive marsh \( what matters to estuarine creatures like shrimp is not the total area of the marsh shrimp ca n't travel inland but rather the amount of habitat on the marsh s edge \) as for the oyster reefs , we need to think of them as an investment rebuild the natural capital and harvest only the yearly interest , leaving the principal untouched crews will be needed to load and haul oyster shells and to manufacture artificial reef blocks that create the base of new reefs many of these workers , and the smallbusiness owners who will support the effort , would be the same people whose jobs have been destroyed by the spill an example of such oyster reef restoration began april 5 off mobile , ala a 29 million grant that was part of the obama administration s stimulus package is paying for the creation of 15 miles of oyster reefs , which will protect 30 acres of seagrass beds and two miles of shoreline the project has already created 35 jobs , as workers fabricated concrete and steel frameworks to serve as the foundation of the new reefs , then carried the new material by barge and put it in place , along with many tons of oyster shells , at the project site how much would it cost to do this on an ecosystemwide scale \? before hurricane katrina , the initial price tag for restoring the mississippi river delta was 17 billion , and given the damage of the storm and oil spill , it would be vastly more expensive today but in the long run , the benefits would outweigh the tremendous outlay and the spill gives us some new options for financing the project the white house and congress are considering increasing the fees paid into the by all oil companies on each barrel of oil produced in or imported to the united states as of now , money from the fund is used to cover only direct damages and cleanup costs , not past damage associated with the extraction and shipping of natural resources any increases in the fees should also include provisions to support a longterm coastal restoration fund it would be the kind of smart government intervention that creates jobs , lifts the economy and improves quality of life the longsuffering people of the gulf coast deserve no less
durban , south africa in the second round of the world cup , of spain bore in on the portuguese goalkeeper , shooting with his left leg , reaching for the rebound with his right leg , punching the ball into the net with the same versatility in his feet that a boxer has in his fists while didier drogba has gone home with a broken arm , and wayne rooney and lionel messi have departed with shattered expectations , it is villa who is tied for the lead in the tournament with five goals , putting into the semifinals for the first time in a highly anticipated match against here on wednesday he is in a state of grace , as it were , vicente del bosque , spain s coach , said tuesday of villa he has scored whenever he wants well , almost there could be , should be , six goals instead of five , but villa somehow sent a penalty shot wide in the first round on a failed bid for a third goal against honduras , leaving his face full of shock and disgust otherwise , he has been clever and predatory , sliding ecstatically on his knees in celebration , saluting fans with a matador s wave , the soul patch on his chin suggesting jazzy improvisation and rapacious intent he is extremely skilled technically , excellent one on one , very fast , joachim l w , germany s coach , said of villa when it comes to finishing his chances , he s almost second to none even villa s nickname , the kid , conjures a gunslinger s quick shot and threatening audacity david is very selfassured , the spanish midfielder xabi alonso said he s been a menace for every defense so far he is the reference when it comes to our attack we hope he can keep doing it to the final , and others can follow his good performance spain s most visible striker , fernando torres , scored the winning goal in a 10 victory over germany in the final of the 2008 european championship but has gone silent here , not yet having gained his form and confidence after having two knee operations this year his knee is stable but his reliability is not , leading to much speculation and opinion about whether torres will be or should be benched for the semifinal del bosque would not tip his hand tuesday , saying of torres i do n't think he is too much under pressure he is used to playing in top matches all the time he knows his way around football villa has spoken supportively of torres , appreciative of the way he serves as a kind of cursor , dragging defenders and goalkeepers away , leaving space for him to dart between two opponents the way villa did for a spectacular goal against honduras with his right foot , or to curve a shot into an open net from 40 yards the way he did against chile with his left foot such dexterity was born of necessity after villa broke his right femur as a 4yearold in the asturian mining village of tuilla with his right leg plastered in a cast , villa insisted on continuing to play soccer , so his father taught him how to use his left leg he would be there throwing me the ball over and over , villa told the guardian of london i can barely remember a single training session when my dad was n't there at 28 , villa has scored a remarkable 43 goals in 63 appearances for spain one shy of tying the national team record held by ra l along with 160 goals in 258 club matches in la liga over the past five seasons he was the leading scorer at the 2008 european championship \( even though he missed the final \) he and torres led spain with three goals apiece at the 2006 world cup here in south africa , villa has scored all but one of spain s goals , most recently pinging the ball off both goal posts in a 10 victory over paraguay in the quarterfinals as his teammates dogpiled on top of him in rapturous liberation i'm happy with my five goals because they 've been decisive , villa said it s different when you win by a lot of goals it does n't hold the same feeling as winning this way after the world cup , villa will join barcelona in la liga , spain s top league but until now , he never played for the biggest clubs , and seldom in the biggest club competitions , as he moved from sporting de gijon to real zaragoza to valencia yet he has repeatedly distinguished himself when called to play for his country the stage and the spotlight have inspired and elevated instead of diminished he has n't played for the big clubs , so we have n't seen the real villa until now , said damian lopez , a reporter for rac 1 radio in barcelona in the world cup , he is being discovered unlike a lot of strikers , he does n't have to receive the ball with his back to the goal he can face the goalkeeper and make a play for himself and he can play with other great players , moving the ball , dribbling some strikers can only make goals he can play l w conceded tuesday that spain was the world cup team with the most stringent organization and best firepower if germany s 40 victory over argentina was any indication , its midfield will try to squeeze xavi , spain s playmaker , and attempt to rush forward in a blistering counterattack except for its opener against switzerland , though , spain has always found a response with the steeliness of villa he is very clever , good on the left and on the right , miroslav klose , a german forward who has four goals , said he is like lionel messi it takes a whole team to work together to keep him quiet when he is one on one , he can be very dangerous
so , what big mistakes have i made over the years \? two , i think the first was in the mid1990s , when i poohpoohed claims about a surge in us productivity growth i saw some bad logic in the arguments the productivity enthusiasts were making , and being the professor i am i extrapolated that into being dismissive of everything they were saying in fact , the productivity surge was real the second was circa 2003 , over the bush administration s use of the illusion of victory in iraq to push through more tax cuts , even though the optimistic budget projections used to justify the first round had proved completely wrong it s worth pointing out that the situation was not at all like the present , where i support temporary deficit spending to deal with a depressed economy the bushies were pushing permanent tax cuts that had nothing to do with economic stimulus , and did so at a time of war with no offsetting spending cuts \( and then pushed through an unfunded expansion of medicare too \) this struck me at the time as bananarepublic behavior , and still does however , i wrongly believed that markets would look at it the same way , and that they would lose faith in american governance , driving up interest rates on our debt instead , bond investors discounted the politics , and acted as if they believed that america would eventually pull itself together and start behaving responsibly the jury s still out on that , but clearly my shortrun prediction proved wrong i learned from both these mistakes in the 90s , i learned to take very seriously what people on the ground are saying about the economy , even if it isn t wellargued after 2003 , i learned that there is a great deal of ruin in a nation that markets give advanced countries a lot of benefit of the doubt so yes , i ve been wrong let those who are without error cast the first stone update just to be clear , i m talking about professional mistakes the other kinds of mistakes are none of your business
several composers have made operas of a christmas carol , the dickens classic , but none of the works have gained a foothold in the seasonal repertory the latest , s god bless us , every one ! , may have better luck , partly because it offers a fresh view of the story s characters here they are seen 20 years after the ghosts of christmas past , present and future have transformed scrooge from a miserly malcontent into a charitable model citizen and christmas celebrator heard in its premiere on thursday evening at the , this oneact work has ample charms , including an efficient , singable libretto , by bill van horn and michael capasso , and an invitingly melodic score , with shapely vocal writing , lively choruses and trim , colorful orchestral writing that never gets in the way of the singing as mr capasso and mr van horn tell it , the story begins in the offices of scrooge , cratchit marley the morning after scrooge s death tim cratchit , no longer tiny , has been restored to health , thanks to scrooge s benevolence , and scrooge s nephew , fred , is visiting london from new york , where he lives with his daughter , fan tim and his fianc e , elizabeth , plan to join fred in new york , but elizabeth , insecure about their future , leaves tim as they are about to sail the distraught tim fights alongside fred in the union army during the and becomes fan s guardian when fred is killed the heart of the piece is the courtship of fan and beau braxton , and a supreme act of forgiveness is required of tim in the work s final moments distant as all this is from the original story , mr capasso and mr van horn pepper the piece with allusions to the dickens tale they also include a couple of ghosts scrooge is one his death , far from stopping him from singing , has freed him to roam through most of the scenes as a sort of ghost of christmas , period mr pasatieri gives him several characterful arias , and , a bassbaritone , sang them with power and panache fred makes a brief but crucial appearance as a ghost as well , though in most of the work he is alive , a settled , responsible figure in this telling willy falk gave him a sympathetic , ably sung portrayal both vocally and dramatically , traced tim s emotional ups and downs affectingly , and catherine clarke nardolillo sang elizabeth s music , particularly her reconciliation duet with tim , exquisitely julie ladouceur played a sweettoned fan to nicholas provenzale s beau the production , a collaboration with the , is spare but attractive , and mr capasso , doubling as director , moves his singers around the stage with an effective naturalness that gives way to stylized set pieces only when the scene a battle or a ghostly revelation demands them john nardolillo , the conductor and ms nardolillo s husband , paces the comfortably and gets a fine , polished sound from the chamber orchestra
ukraine versus spain usually means two guys anchored to the baseline blasting ground strokes at one another for hours on end but not sergiy stakhovsky and feliciano lopez  lopez grew up on the red clay of spain , but developed a game far better suited for the faster grass and hard courts in 2005 , lopez became the first spaniard since 1972 to reach the quarterfinals of wimbledon , which he did again in 2008 he has not had quite the same success here his best open culminated in a terrific fourset loss in the fourth round to the eventual champion roger federer in 2007 this year , he has some impressive tour wins over top players , including marin cilic and rafael nadal on court , lopez has a strong serve and forehand , but wins with variety , power , spin , finesse whatever it takes he has one of the best slice onehanded backhands going , and uses it to set up a forehand drive or net approach although lopez has a betterthanaverage serve , and is completely comfortable coming in behind it , he prefers to come to net only to put points away stakhovsky plays a similar game , which is why this matchup is intriguing the lanky 24yearold ukrainian plays a beautiful allcourt game , mixing powerful ground strokes with subtle lobs and stinging volleys stakhovsky s serve can touch the high 120s , but he wins points off of it by mixing speeds and placement , not just power his real weapon is one of the smoothest onehanded backhands in the men s game , which he relied on time and time again to squeak by the american phenom ryan harrison in a fifthset tie breaker friday stakhovsky and lopez are , in fact , coming off tough fiveset wins , with lopez rallying from a set down to win a fourthset tie breaker and a 62 fifth against benoit paire on paper , the 23rdseeded lopez would seem to have the advantage but stakhovsky comes into the open fresh off a win at the pilot pen , and playing some of the best tennis of his young career , now ranked 36th in the world assuming there is not lingering injuries to either man \( stakhovsky struggled with his back throughout his last match \) , this should be highly competitive and entertaining francesca schiavone vs anastasia pavlyuchenkova pavlyuchenkova is a young player on the rise who won three grand slams as a junior and now looks ready to break into the top tier among the women through three rounds here , pavlyuchenkova has hardly been challenged , beating her first three opponents kristina barrois , sania mirza and gisela dulko easily in straight sets but none of those women were in schiavone s class , so this match will be a much tougher test for pavlyuchenkova schiavone , the no 6 seed and current french open champion , is a tour veteran who is just now seeing her career blossom she is quick around the court , and plays a true allcourt game , keeping opponents on the move with her ground strokes , and sneaking into the net to finish points this match will be a classic battle of power against finesse schiavone should win , but the way pavlyuchenkova has been playing so far in the tournament , an upset is possible andy murray vs stanislas wawrinka all the buzz at last year s open was about murray after he made the final the year before but that made his fourthround exit all the more shocking this year , the spotlight is still on , but is not nearly as bright so far , murray seems dialed in , dispatching his first two opponents relatively easily that said , neither dustin brown nor lukas lacko is in the same league as wawrinka , who is seeded 25th here the last time these two met was in the fourth round of wimbledon last year , and that match went five sets , with murray pulling out the win murray will win , but this will be a good early test for the no 4 seed , and a good opportunity for fans to see him in the more intimate louis armstrong stadium other matches to see samantha stosur vs elena dementieva , ana ivanovic vs kim clijsters , david nalbandian vs fernando verdasco , tommy robredo vs michael llodra
even as the phoenix coyotes' amazing season continues before sellout crowds dressed in playoff white , the intrigue surrounding the nhlowned club persists last week , the city council in glendale , ariz , approved the lease agreement negotiated by jerry reinsdorf s glendale llc group for use of the cityowned jobingcom arena , clearing the path for his group to finally assume ownership from the league but the process is controversial a rival bidding group of canadian and american investors the nhl had also courted , ice edge holdings , had its leasing plan rejected by the council reinsdorf , owner of the chicago white sox and the chicago bulls , has worked with local government because the white sox hold spring training there jerry will be a great owner in phoenix , wayne gretzky , a former coyotes coach and ownership partner , said last week in manhattan he s got a relationship with the city of glendale because of the white sox , and he lives in phoenix periodically in the winter the sports teams he already owns have been very successful , so i think he s the right guy coming in to do the right job for that city the deal calls for reinsdorf to pay the league 100 million for the coyotes , with glendale kicking in as much as an additional 65 million the nhl bought the club for 140 million last october and brought it out of bankruptcy glendale will pay for its portion through the creation of a special funding district near the arena , in which commercial landowners will charge higher parking fees and finance bonds to raise the 65 million some of the cost of the bonds would be passed along to fans , concertgoers and other visitors who park , shop and dine in the area those landowners include steve ellman , who once owned the coyotes and was responsible for their move from downtown phoenix to glendale , an area where he could develop property adjacent to the arena ellman sold controlling interest in the club to jerry moyes , who had been a minority partner , in 2006 when the coyotes declared bankruptcy last may , moyes said the team lost more than 300 million in his eight years of ownership part of the new agreement protects reinsdorf s group from losing money in addition to the 65 million glendale plans to raise through the special district , another 25 million annually is to be set aside in a reserve fund so that the city can fully reimburse the reinsdorf group if the coyotes remain unprofitable after five years after five years , the reinsdorf group would be free to sell the team , although glendale would get first crack at finding another buyer to keep the team in town the phoenixbased goldwater institute , which has successfully challenged municipal subsidies in the area , contends this new agreement may violate state law prohibiting public subsidies of private enterprises the reinsdorf deal creates serious legal questions , carrie ann sitren , a goldwater lawyer , said last week it puts a huge amount of risk on the city , whereas reinsdorf takes on virtually none it could be a contract without a give and take from each side , which would be illegal beyond that , the city might make substantial payments to support reinsdorf s ownership and still lose the team after five years economists have called glendale s agreement unprecedented for its generosity to a prospective owner the city is still paying off a 180 million debt for the rink , and would have no chance to pay it off if the coyotes left i have worked with dozens of government entities , and i ca n't think of anyone who would entertain anything like this , marc ganis , a sportsbusiness consultant , told the arizona republic but the whole bankruptcy situation has been unprecedented nhl owners must approve reinsdorf s bid for the coyotes boucher ends dry spell when brian boucher shut out the devils in game 1 of their firstround series wednesday , it was his first playoff victory since may 20 , 2000 his gap between postseason victories of 9 years 329 days is the third longest in nhl history sugar jim henry went 10 years 1 day between victories , from when he was a ranger in 1942 until when he was a bruin in 1952 sean burke had the secondlongest gap , 9 years 347 days between wins as a devil in 1988 and as a flyer in 1998 arena turns 100 last friday was the 100th birthday of matthews arena , the world s oldest indoor

game in 1924 until they moved to boston garden four years later it was the birthplace of the new england whalers \( now the carolina hurricanes \) , the hockey programs of northeastern , boston college and boston university , the beanpot tournament and the region s schoolboy tournaments i think a lot of hockey purists would agree with me when i say it s a hockey cathedral , said greg cronin

portauprince , haiti the gray toyota corolla edged closer to the center of the intersection , trying to sneak past the man with a limp , directing traffic in jordanian army fatigues , with a whistle and purple plastic wand but du du would have none of it he pointed his baton behind him , then spun around to confront the violator a sharp whistle an angry stare the threat of gridlock faded i'm a professional , du du said if i want to make traffic go or stop , i do it that may not sound like much , but in portauprince after , driving is a 10th ring of hell picture roads overrun with tents , rubble , pedestrians and peddlers stopping suddenly , dump trucks coughing black exhaust , few stoplights , 99degree heat , no airconditioning , dust , beggars and angry drivers blaring horns now imagine a symphony orchestra because that is exactly how du du \( whose full name is levy azor \) treats what the rest of us experience as chaos no official entity has hired him he is simply a freelancer with a passion for order and at a time when s government attracts mostly anger for its absence , du du who works only for tips and refuses to join the police or military has quickly become a symbol of hope a whistleblowing reminder of the creativity that blossoms in a stateless void his friends and neighbors say that in his 23 years of unsanctioned service , he has never been more appreciated he s working for the country , said michelle anthony , 38 , as she watched him recently from a food stand a few feet away he is working for us not surprisingly , the earthquake nearly killed him when the tremor hit around 5 pm , du du was in his usual spot the middle of borgela and sansfil streets , a hilly hairpin intersection between downtown and the airport a utility pole fell onto his legs as the buildings around him crumbled and the cars shook like toys nearly five months later , the area has yet to recover a 360degree tour of du du s intersection now runs past a row of tents , buckled homes , a trash heap and vendors in tilted shacks his tworoom apartment close by where he lives alone , with a mattress on the floor and only a calendar on the teal wall managed to survive but there have been other losses du du , 43 , is slower now , with his scarred legs many of his relatives are living in tents also , many of the drivers who used to give him larger tips of around 100 gourde \( 250 \) no longer drive past du du s bright mahogany eyes fade when he mentions them maybe they 're dead , he says maybe they left the country the traffic has changed too , he says drivers are more hottempered there are fewer alternative routes because of the rubble and more trucks from nongovernmental organizations with utopian names , like world vision nonetheless , there is a rhythm and a style to du du that seems to work no matter what the circumstances his purple wand which is actually a plastic stake for horseshoes usually leads , but his body and his whistle work right along with it on one recent afternoon , du du almost seemed to be dancing , as he waved , spun , whistled and bounced , moving a truck to take a right turn , guiding a station wagon forward , then skipping forward to stop traffic for a group of young girls returning from school in their navyblue skirts one girl looked up , amazed , as though she had come face to face with a superhero indeed , part of why du du matters to this city , and is almost universally known by its inhabitants , is because he brings joy to an unlikely location nearly every driver who passed during several recent traffic sessions smiled , seemingly thrilled to see that du du was there and in charge occasionally , people shouted go , du du ! or great job ! while one of every 20 or so drivers gave him a tip du du says he does not really do it for the money in fact , when an older white man offered him an american quarter on his way through the intersection , du du waved it away , explaining later that the driver had been promising to give him a tip for months and offered the coin only because a reporter was watching he works on his own , he said , to preserve that measure of independence asked why he never became an official police officer or a soldier , given his collection of military fatigues , he said he had no interest in working for a government that does so little for its people i'm just trying to make my own way , he said i love my job
over 100 former members of congress many of whom won their own races by pointing out defects in their opponents have written to all members of congress as well as house and senate candidates , imploring them to reject excessive partisanship as they enter the home stretch of this highly contentious political season signed by people including geraldine a ferraro of new york and bob packwood of oregon , the letter says none of us shrank from partisan debates while in congress or from the partisan contests getting there during our time in congress , partisans on the other side may have been our opponents on some bills and our adversaries on some issues they were not , however , the enemy this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo
when the going gets tough , the tough take accounting when the job market worsens , many students figure they ca n't indulge in an english or a history major they have to study something that will lead directly to a job so it is almost inevitable that over the next few years , as labor markets struggle , the humanities will continue their long slide there already has been a nearly 50 percent drop in the portion of liberal arts majors over the past generation , and that trend is bound to accelerate once the stars of university life , humanities now play bit roles when prospective students take their college tours the labs are more glamorous than the libraries but allow me to pause for a moment and throw another sandbag on the levee of those trying to resist this tide let me stand up for the history , english and art classes , even in the face of today s economic realities studying the humanities improves your ability to read and write no matter what you do in life , you will have a huge advantage if you can read a paragraph and discern its meaning \( a rarer talent than you might suppose \) you will have enormous power if you are the person in the office who can write a clear and concise memo studying the humanities will give you a familiarity with the language of emotion in an information economy , many people have the ability to produce a technical innovation a new mp3 player very few people have the ability to create a great brand the ipod branding involves the location and arousal of affection , and you ca n't do it unless you are conversant in the language of romance studying the humanities will give you a wealth of analogies people think by comparison iraq is either like vietnam or bosnia your boss is like narcissus or solon people who have a wealth of analogies in their minds can think more precisely than those with few analogies if you go through college without reading thucydides , herodotus and gibbon , you 'll have been cheated out of a great repertoire of comparisons finally , and most importantly , studying the humanities helps you befriend the big shaggy let me try to explain over the past century or so , people have built various systems to help them understand human behavior economics , political science , game theory and evolutionary psychology these systems are useful in many circumstances but none completely explain behavior because deep down people have passions and drives that do n't lend themselves to systemic modeling they have yearnings and fears that reside in an inner beast you could call the big shaggy you can see the big shaggy at work when a governor of south carolina suddenly chucks it all for a love voyage south of the equator , or when a smart , philosophical congressman from indiana risks everything for an inoffice affair you can see the big shaggy at work when selfdestructive overconfidence overtakes oil engineers in the gulf , when gogo enthusiasm intoxicates investment bankers or when bonechilling distrust grips politics those are the destructive sides of the big shaggy but this tender beast is also responsible for the mysterious but fierce determination that drives kobe bryant , the graceful bemusement the detroit tigers pitcher armando galarraga showed when his perfect game slipped away , the selfless courage soldiers in afghanistan show when they risk death for buddies or a family they may never see again the observant person goes through life asking where did that come from \? why did he or she act that way \? the answers are hard to come by because the behavior emanates from somewhere deep inside the big shaggy technical knowledge stops at the outer edge if you spend your life riding the links of the internet , you probably wo n't get too far into the big shaggy either , because the fast , effortless prose of blogging \( and journalism \) lacks the heft to get you deep below but over the centuries , there have been rare and strange people who possessed the skill of taking the upheavals of thought that emanate from the big shaggy and representing them in the form of story , music , myth , painting , liturgy , architecture , sculpture , landscape and speech these men and women developed languages that help us understand these yearnings and also educate and mold them they left rich veins of emotional knowledge that are the subjects of the humanities it s probably dangerous to enter exclusively into this realm and risk being caught in a cloister , removed from the market and its accountability but does n't it make sense to spend some time in the company of these languages learning to feel different emotions , rehearsing different passions , experiencing different sacred rituals and learning to see in different ways \? few of us are hewers of wood we navigate social environments if you 're dumb about the big shaggy , you 'll probably get eaten by it
portland , ore my friend allegra s had a bad year first , she tore a ligament in her knee playing soccer two weeks later , she was let go from the two jobs she worked to pay her rent in a large , worn house just east of portland s broadway bridge yeah , it pretty much bites , she said we were walking our dogs at sandy river delta , a stretch of grassy meadow near the columbia river allegra s tight blond curls caught the sun , as did her polyester flowered miniskirt i asked her how she was getting by , and she just shrugged unemployment and my snap benefits work at the farmers' market , she said , referring to the supplemental nutrition assistance program that is , food stamps some of the markets have this program where if you spend a dollar in snaps , they match you a dollar allegra pulled out a little plastic bag here , she said , gesturing to a bunch of ripe blackberries bursting on a tangle of bushes , which we started to pick i got jars at goodwill i'm making jam i went with allegra to a small neighborhood farmers' market a few weeks later to experience the match program the sky was a clogged mess of white and gray , and the market felt lazy and slow allegra does n't believe in taking anything unless you really need it but she ca n't work until after her surgery a surgery that oregon health and science university hospital is paying for in full because she is uninsured she gets about 200 a month to spend on food while we were shopping , we ran into a friend of allegra s , a beautiful young woman with loosely pinned black hair , holding a baby allegra gave her a hug and cooed at the pudgy 6monthold are you on food stamps \? she asked her friend , explaining that i was researching an article for this newspaper her friend looked momentarily horrified at the exposure , but conceded that , yes , her family was on food stamps she had recently completed acupuncture school and her husband had just finished a graduate program in art history i spend nearly all my foodstamp money at the market , said allegra s friend if you avoid packaged foods , the money goes a long way and it s a better way to eat it s hard not to draw unhappy comparisons between portland s markets , where fruit spills from boxes , artisanal sausage sits politely on wooden boards and vats of ch vre soften in the air , and the farmers' market in las cruces , nm , the city i left a few months ago las cruces sits at the base of the organ mountains , craggy , ruthless peaks that cast a shadow over the dry and barren chihuahua desert there s just a short growing season for the smattering of farms and the diversity of crops is limited late in the spring and summer , the market does have tomatoes , squash , spinach and basil , but none of it is organic i spoke by phone to the farmers' market coordinator there we ca n't really offer organic food , he explained it s just too expensive for our population we have to compete with walmart or we wo n't get the customers we need the median family income in las cruces is 45 , 211 \( as compared with portland s 64 , 193 \) in an indication of what the farmers at the market in las cruces are up against , the busiest vendor , week after week , is the man selling kettle corn the coordinator said that the city did have programs to help lowincome families , the elderly and pregnant women or nursing mothers buy fresh produce at the market the most money you 'd get to spend at the market would be 28 a week \? i asked a season , he said we 'd love to be able to take food stamps , but snap benefits come on a card and the issue is the electronic swiper , he explained unlike the portland markets , the market in las cruces does n't have the money to buy them allegra decided that she wanted some extra squash she changed a few more of her snap benefits into wooden market coins i did n't need much , so i picked up a small bundle of organic kale for 250 and a pint of golden raspberries for 3 two ingredients for 550 in most of the little restaurants in las cruces , that would buy an entire meal of tortillas , beans , meat and soda allegra ruminated over blackberries on the one hand , she wanted to make a pie here , she 'd need to spend 9 if she drove 40 minutes to the dog park , she might be able to pick them for free but would they be ripe \? was it worth it \? then she turned longingly toward the flowers under a white tent dahlias , irises and hydrangeas all clustered together in white tubs , a little chorus of color contrasting with the clouds you ca n't buy those with food stamps , allegra said for flowers , she uses her savings
to the editor re , by jaron lanier \( oped , aug 9 \) it is apropos that such an essay on the promise and dangers of technological innovation would appear just days after the anniversary of the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima perhaps technology should be presented without metaphysical baggage or religious ideas , but i disagree with mr lanier s statement that we must take responsibility for every task undertaken by a machine when the automobile was created , none of the inventors could have foreseen the oil spill in the gulf of mexico or the war in iraq , both of which can be connected to our dependence on the internal combustion engine it is impossible to take responsibility for our machines because it is not clear what the consequences of their inclusion into our lives will be technology should not be perceived in a frankensteinian light , as mr lanier rightly says , but the real danger is when it is presented as a futuristic solution to whatever problem confronts humanity perhaps if the motivation for technological innovation were something other than ease or profit , we would all be better off \? larry hoffner new york , aug 9 , 2010  to the editor i would like to respond to some of the views attributed to me by jaron lanier i do not claim that the internet itself performs creative thinking \( or indeed any kind of thinking \) similarly , though i believe that twitter is technologically and socially important and likely to become more so , i have not likened it to a global brain , nor , as a social constructivist , would i ever do such a thing since mr lanier characterizes my views without quoting me or using terms that i use , i ca n't figure out which of my writings would lead him to ascribe those views to me i have long resisted the phrase artificial intelligence , as he also does , and was an early and public skeptic of the aiinflected work on the project known as the semantic web my focus is on the ways communications tools affect the real and messy world of human interaction mr lanier and i disagree about many issues tied to the cultural and intellectual changes being wrought by the internet just not , curiously , the ones that he ascribes to me clay shirky brooklyn , aug 9 , 2010
last season , lakers forward adam morrison sat on the los angeles bench in a suit while his team won its 16th championship , putting him up , 10 , over players like patrick ewing and charles barkley in career championship rings as with every postseason , this year offers another chance for some unexpected players to win their first titles and take home a ring boston celtics averaging 3 points and 47 minutes a game in the postseason , robinson probably feels the six games in which he has appeared are a luxury after escaping mike d'antoni s doghouse in new york earlier this season surprising candidates for a second ring rasheed wallace and michael finley orlando magic the former college star never won an ncaa championship under mike krzyzewski at duke , but he might win one for stan van gundy in orlando , contributing 48 points a game in 14 minutes off the bench surprising candidate for a second ring jason williams los angeles lakers acquired to take the spot of the departed trevor ariza , the 30yearold out of st john s may finally add a championship to a r sum that includes an allstar appearance and the 2004 defensive player of the year award surprising candidate for a second ring adam morrison phoenix suns the second former knick on this list , frye was supposed to be the player who saved isiah thomas s job , but instead he found a home in phoenix , his third nba team averaging 87 points and 56 rebounds a game this postseason , frye has been a solid contributor surprising candidate for a second ring none no one on the roster has won a ring at what point does hawks forward marvin williams , above , start being listed among the game s worst draft busts \? drafted second over all in 2005 behind andrew bogut of the milwaukee bucks , williams has not been a bad player , averaging 119 points , 51 rebounds , 11 assists and 05 blocked shots over five seasons for comparison , one of the most frequently discussed busts , sam bowie of the trail blazers , who was drafted second over all in 1984 , averaged 118 points , 87 rebounds , 22 assists and 22 blocked shots a game in his first five seasons what pushes williams into bust territory over lesserperforming players is that the two players taken immediately after him , chris paul of the hornets and deron williams of the jazz , are duking it out to claim the throne as the nba s best point guard of the future helping matters some for williams in the bowie comparison is that while paul and williams have been superlative , they cannot compare to the player that portland passed up to pick bowie michael jordan

late one summer night 40 years ago this month , yosef mendelevich , a young soviet jew , camped with a group of friends outside the smolny airport near leningrad the next morning , they planned to commandeer a 12seat airplane , fly it to sweden and , once there , declare their purpose to move to israel , a dream they had long been denied most in the group were pessimistic about their chances but none more than mr mendelevich he felt sure they would get caught , but to his mind , a group suicide was preferable to a life of waiting for an exit visa that would never arrive even a botched attempt , he figured , would at least attract the eyes of the world early the next day , as the plotters walked onto the tarmac , they were , indeed , caught the kgb had known of their plan for months and the two leaders were later sentenced to death but mr mendelevich was also right that their desperate act would make their demand for free emigration impossible to ignore now largely forgotten , this planned hijacking , and the soviet government s overreaction to it , opened the first significant rip in the iron curtain , one through which hundreds of thousands would eventually flee with great drama , it undermined communist orthodoxy after all , if the bolsheviks had built the perfect society , why would any welladjusted citizens want to leave , let alone risk their lives to do so \? the essential weakness of the soviet union was exposed to survive , the regime had to imprison its own population this would be the beginning of the end jews were understandably at the forefront of the emigration battle even as they were forbidden to exercise any kind of jewish identity , they also had no option to assimilate in soviet society their internal passports were stamped jew , a word that three generations after the 1917 revolution signified little more than their status as outsiders many had come to feel that their existence inside the soviet union was untenable , that the only way to escape this paradox was to move away but the doors were firmly shut those who requested permission to leave were refused and then ostracized the push to emigrate , which had begun in the early 1960s as an underground movement , had grown by 1970 into an open campaign letters to the united nations were signed by hundreds of soviet jews only a few months before the hijacking attempt , the kremlin had called for a public relations counteroffensive that would paint zionism as a vanguard of imperialism a large press conference was arranged with acceptable jews , including the prima ballerina maya plisetskaya and the comedian arkady raikin , vowing loyalty to the soviet union and denouncing zionism as expressing the chauvinistic views and racist ravings of the jewish bourgeoisie this was only the opening act on the morning of june 15 , 1970 , kgb agents tackled the wouldbe hijackers on the tarmac in leningrad and threw them in jail afterward , dozens of jewish activists unconnected to the plot were arrested the government saw an opportunity to present zionists as nothing more than subversive hooligans but six months later , at their trial , the hijacking plotters offered the more compelling narrative their story of unrequited longing for a homeland in her closing statement , sylva zalmanson , the only female defendant , recited from psalm 137 , if i forget thee , o jerusalem , may my right hand wither while she was trying to repeat the words in hebrew , the judge shouted at her to use a language recognized by the court in the end , mark dymshits and eduard kuznetsov , the two leaders , were sentenced to face a firing squad worldwide reaction to the news was immediate overnight , the small cause of soviet jewry until then supported only by impassioned students and isolated activists became a mass movement italian longshoremen in genoa refused to unload soviet ships students in stockholm marched with torches through the streets even salvador allende , chile s marxist president , called for clemency in israel , airraid sirens blasted through the cities and 100 , 000 people gathered in front of the western wall in washington , richard nixon held an emergency meeting with leaders of jewish groups more was at stake than just the fate of the two men as the times editorialized , the real defendants in the court were not the handful of accused , but the tens of thousands of soviet jews who have courageously demanded the right to emigrate to israel on new year s eve , less than a week after the trial , eduard kuznetsov was taken from his cell , certain he was going to be shot but the prison warden told him , a humanitarian gesture has been made on your behalf his sentence was commuted to 15 years most of the hijackers had their time reduced , though they still spent years at hard labor camps in the urals only in 1979 were mr dymshits and mr kuznetsov released in a spy exchange yosef mendelevich was freed in 1981 by overturning the death sentences , the soviet government tacitly accepted that the hijackers' cause was one the world found to be just and demonstrated that it was not deaf to outside opinion apparently , the leaders realized a hammer alone could not solve their jewish problem yet neither could they simply meet the jews' demands to allow unfettered emigration as anatoly dobrynin , the longtime soviet ambassador to the united states , would later admit in his memoirs , the kremlin feared that emigration would offer a degree of liberalization that might destabilize the domestic situation still , within a month of the trial , more exit visas were being granted to jews by the end of 1971 , 13 , 000 had been issued more than in the previous 10 years combined the following year , 32 , 000 people got permission to leave the bravery of the hijacking plotters also ignited a movement in the united states that would lead congress , a few years later , to pass the jacksonvanik amendment , which withheld preferred trading status from the soviet union until it allowed tens of thousands of jews to emigrate the american action so exasperated leonid brezhnev , the soviet leader , that he demanded that his politburo find more creative answers to the jewish question zionism , he told them , is making us stupid emigration was now linked to the sovietamerican relationship in 1979 , when the soviets were hoping to buy more american grain and wanted to make sure a new arms limitation treaty would be signed and ratified , an unprecedented 50 , 000 jews were allowed out just as quickly , a year later , after the soviets invaded afghanistan , the spigot was turned off ronald reagan saw in the soviet jews the perfect poster children for his view of the soviet union as an evil empire unlike richard nixon , president reagan was publicly sympathetic to the emigration movement , and unlike jimmy carter , he wielded human rights as a strategic weapon rather than just touting it as a moral cause only a few months after yosef mendelevich was let out of prison , he was invited to the white house george shultz , the secretary of state in the reagan administration , made it clear time and again that not only trade but even arms control talks would depend on the emigration issue by 1985 , well before glasnost and perestroika , anatoly chernyaev , a foreign policy aide to mikhail gorbachev , would write in his diary , we have to solve the jewish question , the most burning of human rights problems but the true solution was no less mortal a threat to the soviets in the late 1980s than it had been in 1970 if they let the jews leave , what would keep everyone else from doing the same \? when soviet jews finally emigrated en masse nearly 15 million by the end of the 1990s it looked like just another happy side effect of the soviet union s collapse , another wall crumbling forgotten were the decades of pushing from the inside the soviet union might have gone the way of china and had an economic liberalization that ignored human rights but this option was not open , because the soviet jews made it clear that any change would need to include open borders as a result , not only were hundreds of thousands of soviet jews able to build new lives , but forces were set in motion that would bring down the berlin wall and , eventually , an empire a worldshaking transformation born from the hopes once placed on a small airplane that never even left the ground
here are excerpts from the mostviewed posts on this week s bay area blog muni of all the problems facing san francisco s cashstrapped city hall , none has more political and financial impact than the crisis at the city s municipal transportation agency muni , which already made sweeping changes to bus routes and cut 80 jobs in december to save 32 million , faces a midyear deficit of 169 million one immediate measure to close the gap proposed by the transit workers' union seems to be unworkable senior union leaders have , in theory , agreed to forgo a unionwide raise worth at least 8 million , said people familiar with the talks who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak on the matter but the city s charter which guarantees muni drivers the secondhighest wages in the country does not permit such a wage giveback transit and union officials are now looking for other ways to achieve the concessions , like cuts in pension contributions

washington was hardly the consensus choice to become chairman of the , scrambling to the top early last year after surviving multiple ballots in a crowded field mr steele s supporters rallied around him as a compelling advocate at ease making the republican case on television and someone who would be the first africanamerican to lead the party his opponents were apprehensive about mr steele s equally strong reputation as a showboat , an inexperienced manager given to advancing his own ambitions and prone to bursts of indiscretion even as the committee settled on him at the end of hours of balloting , republican leaders were never quite sure which michael steele they would get fourteen months later , the answer has become clear at a time when the is looking to take advantage of democratic troubles and make gains in congressional elections , mr steele is commanding attention mostly for questionable expenditures by the committee , lagging fundraising , staff defections and dismissals , an aggressive round of paid speeches and speaking appearances and politically inopportune remarks on monday , confronting criticism of the committee for picking up a 2 , 000 tab for donors and staff at a west hollywood strip and bondage club , mr steele said in response to a question on good morning america on abc that he and president obama were being held to tougher standards because they were black in the best of circumstances , the head of a party out of power is the voice of the loyal opposition at worse , the chairman is an irrelevance barely known outside party headquarters , hustling for time on the afternoon cable news shows but mr steele , who did not respond to a request for comment , has become something else a remarkably public presence that even some republicans say is distracting his party at a moment of high opportunity that concern spiked as mr steele , ken mckay a popular figure who , republicans said , learned of his dismissal when his wife saw the report on msnbc implicitly blaming him for spending abuses , including the strip club , that mr steele said he had only learned about by reading his committee s report to the federal election commission the concern is evident in the extent to which big donors are writing checks to other republican committees and how some prominent republicans are voicing concerns about him right now it is crucial for the rnc to get off the front pages of the newspapers , said katon dawson , a former south carolina republican committee chairman who ran against mr steele get back to the mission of winning elections mr dawson , who did not rule out challenging mr steele when his term is up , suggested that mr steele did not appreciate the fact that not all publicity is good publicity , even for a chairman whose role includes keeping his party \( and himself \) in the spotlight lee harvey oswald had 100 percent name id and none of it was any good , mr dawson said the bad press hurts us on the ground one donor called me up and said , i'm not going to give those guys any money' mr dawson s views of frustration and concern were echoed often on background by other top republicans the chairman of the should be able to lead , alex castellanos , an unpaid senior adviser to the committee , said in an interview and right now i think he s lost the confidence and the support of the people he s leading in one sense , there is little that republicans can do about mr steele it takes a twothirds vote of the committee to remove him that is a fight few republican leaders want and mr steele has made clear he would not leave quietly he strongly suggested at his party s winter meeting in honolulu his intention to seek another term and the last thing republican leaders want now is an internal fight that would draw attention away from democratic problems which is not to say that republicans have not been acting in recent weeks , a number of party officials including karl rove , the former adviser to former president george w bush , and ed gillespie , a former chairman of the party have set up an independent committee to help republican candidates this fall top republicans said they have advised donors to send checks not to the republican national committee but to the committees financing senate and house candidates mr mckay s dismissal was followed by the departure of curt anderson , who had been one of mr steele s top advisers mr anderson issued a statement supporting mr mckay on tuesday , sean mahoney , one of three republican national committee members from new hampshire , resigned , giving the union leader of new hampshire a that excoriated mr steele for the spending abuses the recent scandal involving rnc funds being used to entertain a small crowd at a los angeles strip club is the straw that broke the camel s back , mr mahoney wrote faced with so many races in play , the republicans cannot afford to have a dropoff in contributions the strip club episode could turn off conservative voters and the questions about lavish republican spending undercut the republican party as it seeks to present itself as the party of financial constraint and good governance john weaver , a republican consultant , said mr steele had been given a needed second chance with the shakeup we 're not going into a presidential cycle without him facing a challenge , mr weaver said what he does in the next few months will decide whether he can survive that

this blog has recently been examining poor afghan marksmanship , focusing on remarkably bad taliban performance with rifles in combat and some of the probable reasons behind it we ll shift now to a discussion of afghan government units , which regularly provide an opportunity to assess outgoing fire puncturing some of the legends of afghan fighting prowess has value for at least two reasons first , when assessing the taliban and other insurgent organizations which few people dispute form a resolved and adaptive force it is important to be wary of exaggerating their traditional fighting skills , as opposed to their social and political skills , their effectiveness as criminal organizations , and their shift in recent years toward improvised explosives the taliban s shoddy marksmanship also raises questions about how fighting in afghanistan has evolved is the taliban s shift toward using improvised explosives an indication that they have learned from the insurgents experience in iraq \? or is it an indication that the taliban realized that their rifle fire was usually ineffective \? both \? second , when the discussion turns to deficiencies in the marksmanship of government troops , the conversation has another use it provides insights into the overall state of the government security forces and it leads to a natural question what return has the united states received in afghanistan on its extraordinary investment in the afghan national army \? more on that in a moment first , let s look quickly at behaviors that tyler hicks and i have observed of afghan government troops and their rifle skills the first two views are made possible by two of tyler s pictures from operations in different provinces in them , behaviors that guarantee errant shooting are obvious the first is of an afghan soldier fighting out of an ambush in oruzgan province in early 2007 he is firing his romanianmade kalashnikov assault rifle while pointing it from his shoulder without putting his eye to the sights this was a complex ambush , with taliban fighters firing on a joint afghandutch patrol from multiple shooting positions that all but surrounded the patrol the initial ranges were not long a little more than 150 meters but the ranges were much too long for this kind of shooting style to have more than a suppressive effect , especially because the taliban fighters were behind walls or firing from within vegetation , and presenting very small targets pointing is not aiming american trainers in afghanistan endlessly tell their afghan trainees not to fight this way , but this kind of shooting remains on regular display during one brief firefight in marja , we watched three afghan soldiers lean their rifles on a wall and pull the triggers onehanded , sending rounds off into the sky at about a 20degree angle that s not aiming , either it s barely even pointing \( as an aside , if you noticed the mud clinging to the bottom of this soldier s muzzle and the riflecleaning rod , it s there not because the man had poor riflecleaning habits like most everyone on that patrol , at the start of the ambush he had dropped in a wet poppy field , and he had been crawling and dashing and fighting for his life in the minutes afterward you can see the same mud on his knee , elbow , shoulder and magazine pouches many afghans do pay attention to a weapon s cleanliness this is one matter that is often tended to \) the next picture is of another afghan soldier , this time in an overwatch position in korangal valley in 2009 , above the village of donga look closely at the soldier s olivegreen rifle sling it is wrapped tightly around the front sight post of his assault rifle , blocking his sight picture this rendered the sights useless the range in this case was at least 400 meters , arguably beyond the outer limit at which a soldier could be expected to hit a mansize target with a kalashnikov and iron sights this is pointingnotaiming writ large \( another aside to the observant yes , there is one encouraging sign on this picture the position of the rifle s selector lever visible just above the soldier s extended right index finger shows that the soldier had set his rifle to fire semiautomatically , and not on automatic that was the right choice for the range at hand handheld automatic fire does have its uses this was not a situation for it \) the third example was in the mountains of nuristan province in 2008 , during a very dark night , so we have no pictures an american unit worked from a tiny outpost with an afghan platoon as part of their duties , the afghans manned an observation and listening post in a spur of high ground nearby taliban attacks were common , though most attacks were smallscale on this night , the afghan soldiers on the listening post panicked , and opened fire for several minutes they emptied their magazines into the darkness it developed into a roaring crescendo of fire what they were shooting at , no one could say the americans with nightvision equipment saw nothing it took several minutes of shouting to get the firing to stop , and then it might have stopped because the afghans needed to reload \( not all of the illdiscipline was afghan one american private first class leapt from his bunk , stepped out from his sleeping bunker and fired a magazine from his m4 carbine into one of the steep hill faces directly in front poor discipline can be contagious \) what do these three examples suggest \? the wild shooting , and position of the soldier s sling , speak not just to a poor appreciation of the fundamentals of marksmanship , but also to the low state of smallunit leadership in any selfrespecting western unit , a noncommissioned officer or lieutenant would not permit a soldier to wrap a sling around a rifle in this way in afghan units , a soldier can patrol like this for hours no one says a thing and the freeforall on the hilltop was the sort of display that makes welltrained soldiers cringe not to mention the way it rattles local villagers and serves to undermine efforts at securing local trust and this is perhaps , in the eyes of one senior american trainer , what is most worrisome about the marksmanship habits of afghan soldiers what they indicate unlike the taliban , the afghan army has the backing of a large and welloff conventional military force it cannot blame poor performance on the poor condition of its rifles , or to mismatched ammunition , or to an absence of entrylevel training and professional supervision american taxpayers provide functioning equipment and underwrite formal training , along with mentoring in the field but it is not unusual to see afghan troops who seem , on patrol and in firefights , to have a very limited sense of basic fighting skills one senior american trainer , with several years of experience with afghan recruits and their training program , sent several email messages last year discussing institutional shortfalls in preparing afghan soldiers for war \( the officer asked not to be named in print , because he has continued to work alongside afghan and american trainers identifying him might endanger his job \) the officer said that the way training has been conducted almost guarantees poor marksmanship skills soldiers are not required to qualify on their assigned weapon \( m16 \) prior to graduation a fitness test is not required either the list goes on and on soldiers graduate from basic and advanced training simply because they did not go awol if they are present on graduation day then off they go to their units since this trainer wrote that paragraph , the obama administration has emphasized preparing afghan security forces to assume a greater role in the war this week , the same trainer said that the problems remain , and that after years of working with afghan soldiers , and an extraordinary investment of american money and soldiers time , two fundamentals are missing from that army the first is discipline there really is none and the second is accountability next week we will close our series on this theme with a post about the taliban s recent use of snipers , which will be accompanied by a video
berlin chancellor on monday unveiled a major austerity package aimed at finding savings of more than 85 billion by 2014 , but it was immediately criticized by the opposition and trade unions , which pledged that they would unite to fight cutbacks they claimed would undermine the country s generous social welfare system the savings offer no perspective whatsoever , said michael sommer , leader of the german federation of trade unions speaking after two days of intense talks in the chancellery , mrs merkel said the savings program the largest in the country s postwar history was the only way for to stand on its legs she said the cuts were designed to bring the budget deficit under control and , more important , comply with a legal ruling whereby germany is bound by the schuldenbremse , or debtbrake , which the german parliament passed into law last year the law stipulates that the government has to limit its debts to a maximum of 035 percent of gross domestic product by 2016 , which puts immense pressure on the government to find savings between now and then net borrowing , which soared to 858 billion , or 125 billion , this year , about 48 billion more than 2009 , was the largest figure since world war ii justifying the savings , mrs merkel insisted they would make the german economy more efficient and more competitive i am optimistic about our goal , she said but it is not a view shared by many economists and certainly not by those at the us treasury who argue that trimming spending is not the road to economic recovery timothy f geithner , the us treasury secretary , over the weekend urged stronger domestic demand growth in european countries , especially in germany , europe s largest economy , which has a large trade surplus opinion polls published monday indicated that germans were not willing to spend and instead would save because of the fear of losing their jobs this is despite the fact that the unemployment rate in germany fell for the 11th month running in may , a rare exception among eurozone countries the decline pushed the adjusted jobless rate down to 77 percent in may from 78 percent in the previous month , according to the federal labor office a combination of wage restraint and more flexible labor contracts has helped to make the german economy more efficient and encourage companies to begin hiring again , according to deutsche bank research but germans have been very cautious about spending mrs merkel said savings for next year would amount to 111 billion , rising to 171 billion in 2012 , 257 billion in 2013 and 324 billion in 2014 she said the savings will include cutting 10 , 000 jobs in the federal administration , reducing special parental allowances for the unemployed and trimming the armed forces defense minister karltheodor zu guttenberg had wanted to introduce radical cutbacks by reducing the number of soldiers to 150 , 000 from 250 , 000 and even abolishing conscription , which will already be reduced next month to six months from nine months it became clear during the past two days that mrs merkel s conservative bloc was so divided over abolishing conscription that she had agreed instead to establish a special commission to consider how the armed forces can be modernized everything is up for discussion , mrs merkel said whatever the outcome of that commission , the armed forces , which have a budget of 30 billion for 2010 , will make cuts of 4 billion between 2013 and 2014 at the same time , certain subsidies for the energy sector will be abolished and a special environmental surcharge will be imposed on airline passengers none of the savings are to be financed by an increase in the , sales tax or any other taxes , said guido westerwelle , foreign minister and leader of the probusiness free democratic party his party , which is committed to a major tax reform and tax cuts , fought tooth and nail during the negotiations to prevent any tax increases mrs merkel will present her proposals in the coming weeks to the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , where she is expected to be receive a very tough reception from the opposition the opposition , consisting of the social democrats , greens and left party , are in a combative mood , capitalizing on mrs merkel s political woes her own popularity and that of her conservative bloc have been falling , even more after horst k hler resigned as president last week and a leading conservative premier , roland koch , quit , saying that he had had enough of politics even more worrying for mrs merkel is the surge of public support for joachim gauck , an eastern german and former head of the special committee overseeing the secret police files of the former east germany mr gauck was nominated monday by the social democrats and the greens as their presidential candidate the left has yet to decide whom to nominate mr gauck , 70 , could pose a formidable challenge to christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony , who was selected by regional party leaders as presidential candidate over mrs merkel s preferred candidate , the labor minister , ursula von der leyen
washington in the late 1950s , after poverty near the capitol became a national embarrassment , blocks of old row houses in the southwest waterfront district here were bulldozed in a radical slumclearing effort built in their place were several crisp apartment blocks by i m pei and a pair of angular brick theaters by the chicago architect harry weese , who later designed washington s metro stations the theaters , home to the arena stage company , were soon beloved by architecture buffs for their taut geometry , and by theater buffs for layouts encouraging artistic experimentation but the neighborhood continued to languish as recently as 2001 , the architect bing thom recalls , cabdrivers did n't want to take me there arena , meanwhile , had grown into one of the country s most prominent regional theaters , and its trustees wanted to move it to a larger space in a better neighborhood in 1999 they even chose a location , in the growing entertainment district of northwest washington but several board members protested the plan to abandon the southwest after they prevailed , the theater was left with the problems of the original weese complex , including a shortage of public spaces and little room for backofthehouse operations enter mr thom , a hong kongborn architect who has worked in vancouver , british columbia , for 40 years mr thom , 69 , was one of 50 architects the board considered , but he made a strong impression on the theater s artistic director , molly smith \( for one thing , he asked for a copy of its mission statement , something none of the architects thought to do , she said \) mr thom proposed maintaining the two original buildings and adding a smaller third theater , beneath a massive cantilevered roof that meant they would become objects in a larger composition a kind of threering circus under a big top the arrangement recalls the kennedy center , two miles away , which also joins performance spaces under one huge roof but it is covered in inchthick marble mr thom s 100 million complex , which officially opens oct 23 , has clear glass walls , giant timbers and exposed concrete floors , which make it seem almost informal i came here thinking washington takes itself too seriously it has to loosen up a bit , ' mr thom said in an interview and open up a bit mr thom conceived of the new arena stage building , he said , as a shortcut for the community on one side of the building is a connection to the waterfront , he said the other side is a connection to the subway when the doors are open , people can treat the theater as part of the public circulation of the city it s not balkanized private space zelda fichandler , a founder of arena stage in 1950 who was its artistic director for 40 years , said the two small theaters have never looked better than they do from the elevated circulation spaces mr thom created they 're gorgeous forms that harry weese designed before , they were so close that you could n't take them in now i love looking down on them and seeing them as sculptures but mr thom s biggest achievement may be the third structure , the kogod cradle , a small theater for new and developing productions that is anything but a black box an elliptical space paneled in darkstained wood , it feels almost spiritual it can be a forest , it can be a ship , it can be a church , ms smith said of the interior just getting into it is a theatrical experience mr thom created an entrance that is probably like no other a passageway that curves along the outside of the performance space , following nearly three quarters of the ellipse , its torqued walls recalling the work of richard serra i wanted to have people go from the big spaces into this space and lose their memory in the journey , mr thom said he first came to southwest washington in the mid 1960s as a student at the university of british columbia he was touring with other canadian architecture students , seeing united states landmarks , but what made a real impression was seeing block after block of cruel urban renewal it was more than 30 years later that he received the arena commission and began thinking about how the theater could help heal the neighborhood when he was presenting his plans to anthony williams , then the city s mayor , he said , he was asked to help with a plan for sections of the city near the anacostia river these days mr thom remains involved in that effort , unofficially , partly to ensure that planned apartment buildings do n't block arena s views \( he had to leave an interview recently to press his point with the city government \) this year he picked up another large commission in the area , after donald and mera rubell , the miami hoteliers and art collectors , saw arena stage they paid 65 million for a historic school building a few blocks away and hired mr thom to turn it into a contemporaryart museum and hotel and condominium complex ms rubell , who is used to promoting the work of unknown artists , asked him later why are n't you famous \? i ca n't afford to have you not be famous \( reached by phone in aspen , colo , she added it s a joy to discover a young talent it s a triple , a quadruple , joy to discover a talent who is n't necessarily young \) in canada , mr thom is known mostly for public buildings like the vancouver aquarium and the chan center for the performing arts at the university of british columbia his projects in the united states have included a campus for tarrant county college , in fort worth , completed last year , and a master plan for reusing a former industrial section of that city he said that working on american projects like these is a dream , a step toward fulfilling another dream , to design cities in china at meetings potential clients in china have asked , why should we be your guinea pigs \? mr thom said if i can do a major building in the capital of the us , maybe when i go back to china , they will listen to me for all his concern about the urbanistic qualities of his work , mr thom is focused on the details during a preopening tour of the building he indicated the giant carpet in the lobby , designed by his wife , bonnie thom , in a range of colors if someone spills red wine , it does n't matter , he noted cheerfully in the ladies' room he pointed to a ledge behind the sinks , where members of the theater company will place framed pictures , helping to bridge the gap between the audience and performers he also tries to bridge that gap in his new theater , where he insisted that the seats be on concrete platforms , rather than movable risers when the actors come out , they need to feel , instantly , like the audience is n't falling away , he said , but that it s right there with them and the neighborhood , he said , should feel the same way about arena stage , which is n't going anywhere in the foreseeable future i sometimes analogize a city to a string of pearls , he said as an architect i'm as interested in the string as in the pearls
on sunday , mike leake , the cincinnati reds rookie pitcher , is expected to start the game , becoming the 21st player to go straight to the majors since the draft began in 1965 the reds will be hoping that he has more to offer in his debut than most of the pitchers who have had similar career paths of the 21 players to go straight to the majors , 12 have been pitchers in their debuts , the group has combined for 50 and a third innings pitched , or just over 4 innings a player as a group they allowed 22 earned runs , giving them a respectable earned run average of 393 while that number may seem impressive , they have proved to be rather wild , walking 38 batters while striking out 26 their managers have , in general , had them on short leashes , with just three of the pitchers managing to earn decisions in the games , combining to go 21 leake will be the third product of arizona state university to accomplish the feat \( no other school has produced more than one \) and just the 10th pitcher to be tapped to start another former asu player that went straight to the majors , third baseman bob horner , hit a home run off bert blyleven in his debut for the atlanta braves in 1978 perhaps the most striking debut of the players in this group was that of mike morgan , who was the starting pitcher for the oakland athletics on june 11 , 1978 , despite having just finished high school he pitched a complete game , walking five , striking out none and taking the loss the long , yet somewhat mediocre debut perhaps was an omen for morgan s career , which lasted 22 seasons , producing 141 wins , 186 losses and a 423 era
whether it s correctly called a movement , a backlash or political theater , state declarations of their rights or in some cases denunciations of federal authority , amounting to the same thing are on a roll gov mike rounds of south dakota , a republican , signed a bill into law on friday declaring that the federal regulation of firearms is invalid if a weapon is made and used in south dakota on thursday , wyoming s governor , dave freudenthal , a democrat , signed a similar bill for that state the same day , oklahoma s house of representatives approved a resolution that oklahomans should be able to vote on a state constitutional amendment allowing them to opt out of the federal health care overhaul in utah , lawmakers embraced states' rights with a vengeance in the final days of the legislative session last week one measure said congress and the federal government could not carry out health care reform , not in utah anyway , without approval of the legislature another bill declared state authority to take federal lands under the eminent domain process a resolution asserted the inviolable sovereignty of the state of utah under the tenth amendment to the constitution some legal scholars say the new states' rights drive has more smoke than fire , but for lawmakers , just taking a stand can be important enough who is the sovereign , the state or the federal government \? said state representative chris n herrod , a republican from provo , utah , and leader of the 30member patrick henry caucus , which formed last year and led the assault on federal legal barricades in the session that ended thursday alabama , tennessee and washington are considering bills or constitutional amendments that would assert local police powers to be supreme over the federal authority , according to , a research and advocacy group based in los angeles and utah , again not to be outdone , passed a bill last week that says federal law enforcement authority , even on federal lands , can be limited by the state there s a tsunami of interest in states' rights and resistance to an overbearing federal government that s what all these measures indicate , said gary marbut , the president of the , which led the drive last year for one of the first firearms freedoms , laws like the ones signed last week in south dakota and wyoming in most cases , conservative anxiety over federal authority is fueling the impulse , with the or its members in the backdrop or forefront mr herrod in utah said that he had spoken at tea party rallies , for example , but that his efforts , and those of the patrick henry caucus , were not directly connected to the tea partiers and in some cases , according to the tenth amendment center , the politics of states' rights are veering left rhode island , vermont and wisconsin , for example none of them known as conservative bastions are considering bills that would authorize , or require , governors to recall or take control of national guard troops , asserting that federal calls to active duty have exceeded federal authority everything we 've tried to keep the federal government confined to rational limits has been a failure , an utter , unrelenting failure so why not try something else \? said thomas e woods jr , a senior fellow at the , a nonprofit group in auburn , ala , that researches what it calls the scholarship of liberty mr woods , who has a phd in history , and has written widely on states' rights and nullification the argument that says states can sometimes trump or disregard federal law said he was not sure where the dots between states' rights and politics connected but he and others say that whatever it is , something politically powerful is brewing under the statehouse domes other scholars say the state efforts , if pursued in the courts , would face formidable roadblocks of the constitution says federal authority outranks state authority , and on that bedrock of federalist principle rests centuries of back and forth that states have mostly lost , notably the desegregation of schools in the 1950s and '60s article 6 says that that federal law is supreme and that if there s a conflict , federal law prevails , said prof ruthann robson , who teaches constitutional law at the city university of new york school of law it s pretty difficult to imagine a way in which a state could prevail on many of these and while some efforts do seem headed for a direct conflict with federal laws or the constitution , others are premised on the idea that federal courts have misinterpreted the constitution in the federal government s favor a lawsuit filed last year by the montana shooting sports association after the state s firearms freedom law took effect , for example , does not say that the federal government has no authority to regulate guns , but that courts have misconstrued interstate commerce regulations national monuments and medical , of all things , play a role as well mr herrod in utah said that after an from the united states department of the interior was made public last month , discussing sites around the country potentially suitable for federal protection as national monuments including two sites in utah support for all kinds of statements against federal authority gained steam and at the tenth amendment center , the group s founder , michael boldin , said he thought states that had bucked federal authority over the last decade by legalizing , even as federal law held all marijuana use and possession to be illegal , had set the template in some ways for the effort now and those states , mr boldin said , were essentially validated in their efforts last fall when the justice department said it would no longer make medical marijuana a priority in the states were it was legal nullification , he said , was shown to work whether the political impulse of states' rights and nullification will become a direct political fault line in the national elections this fall is uncertain , said mr woods of the von mises institute but in utah , at least , a key indicator is coming much sooner the party caucuses to determine , among other things , whether candidates will face primary elections , are to be held next tuesday , and mr herrod said the states rights' crowd would attend and push for change those politicians who do n't understand that things are different are in big trouble because a few people showing up to caucus can have a big influence , mr herrod said a spokeswoman for gov gary r herbert , a republican who signed a firearms law like south dakota s last month declaring exemption from federal regulation for guns made and used within the state said mr herbert was still studying the new batch of bills passed this week and had not yet made decisions about signing them
for almost 40 years , the society for american baseball research has painstakingly unearthed and saluted the accomplishments of longforgotten contributors to the game now it will honor the stars of its own by creating , in effect , the baseball historian hall of fame sabr announced on monday the inaugural class of winners of its new henry chadwick award \( fittingly \) nine people whose work is far better known , even among casual fans , than most realize for every bill james and lawrence ritter honorees whose immortality is guaranteed with the baseball abstract series and the glory of their times , respectively there are other inductees far more anonymous david s neft , for example , was the primary force behind the construction of the first baseball encyclopedia for macmillan in the 1960s this was a massive undertaking as entitled as we all now feel to complete , unfettered access to every historical statistic imaginable , to that point no book presented biographical and statistical data on every major leaguer a recent graduate of columbia university , neft and his staff \( which included a collegiate steve hirdt , now of the elias sports bureau \) had to untangle the rat s nest that all the numbers were in , including the building of a new mainframe database structure that could doublecheck whether everything matched up they also consulted at least two newspaper accounts of every game before 1920 to recreate runs batted in and earned run average for every player every single one when they were done , the 2 , 338page behemoth was called the book i d take with me to prison by a new york times reviewer , and ultimately sold more than 100 , 000 copies of its first edition like so many of his fellow historians , neft was never honored with the jg taylor spink award essentially the baseball journalist wing of the hall of fame in cooperstown because he never was a member of the baseball writers association of america \( an injustice shared by bill james , roger angell and a few others \) neft is finally getting his due this is like being in the initial class of the hall of fame , said neft , now retired and living in manhattan none of us are going to get into cooperstown , so i think it s really wonderful i m in effect sharing the honor with a whole bunch of people who participated in the project one of them was lee allen , the longtime columnist for the sporting news whose lifelong collection of biographical information on almost every major leaguer ever name , birthplace , death date , etc was of huge value to the baseball encyclopedia another sabr honoree is pete palmer , a fellow statistical maven who along with john thorn not only compiled the total baseball series but also wrote the seminal the hidden game of baseball in 1984 palmer was one of the first to popularize the use of onbase percentage in conventional stat sheets and also discovered errors in ty cobb s hit total and batting average that rewrote record books every time you visit baseballreferencecom , you re probably looking at a statistic collected by palmer that made its way onto the web many years ago the other four henry chadwick award winners are bob davids , the founder of sabr peter morris , the author of the twovolume game of inches and one of the most prolific living baseball researchers harold seymour , whose doctoral thesis for cornell university in 1956 evolved into the a threevolume history of the game that became a mustread for every researcher who followed and jules tygiel , the author of most notably the classic 1983 book baseball s great experiment jackie robinson and his legacy sabr will continue to induct more of its own hall of famers every year each will stand as tall in his field as ruth and cobb did in theirs
david kim is the cofounder of , a site that rates the accuracy of fantasy experts , and provides simple tools that reduce the time and stress involved in making good fantasy decisions you can  congrats if you re reading this , you ve probably outsmarted most of your buddies to earn a spot in your fantasy playoffs just remember not to pull a desean jackson by celebrating too early there s plenty of virtual football left to be played and every yard is worth infinitely more now in the fantasy playoffs , one bad start sit decision could cost you everything i m not sure if everything means a few bucks , months of ridicule , or god forbid having to pay up on a really stupid side bet , but if there s ever a time to seek professional advice , now is it so which experts should you count on to avoid having to oil up another man s beer belly \( or whatever bet you get dragged into under the influence of beer and testosterone \) \? we ve been tracking the accuracy of fantasy prognosticators since last season , so we think we have a good read on who the top experts are by no means do we suggest that you blindly follow their advice \( especially when it s you that has so much on the line \) , but we do think it s worthwhile to at least hear what these consultants have to say after all , it s their business to know more about who should start than the rest of us after 13 weeks of battling it out , here are the top five fantasy experts in terms of pay \( prediction accuracy yield \) out of the 40 we track 1 john paulsen the scores report 2 david dodds footballguys 3 andy behrens yahoo ! sports 4 chet gresham razzball 5 fantasy football nerd those of you familiar with fantasypros will recognize john paulsen s name he s been a fixture at the top of our standings for the past nine weeks you may also recognize chet gresham he provided some fantasy advice here at the fifth down david dodds and andy behrens are wellknown experts , and they re in familiar territory as incumbents from 2009 s top five standings \( note that the other three experts making up our current top five were not tracked in 2009 \) finally , fantasy football nerd , a site that aggregates rankings from other sources , makes its debut in our overall leader board speaking of aggregation , this idea of combining multiple expert rankings into one consensus ranking has really taken off i m not sure if our members are hesitant to rely on one expert , or if they just believe that two heads are better than one , but our cheat sheet wizard has been asked to generate thousands of custom combinations as it turns out , the most popular versions of these custom rankings have produced accurate advice all of the four combinations below would have ranked in the top three for accuracy this year \( we do not include these mixed cocktails in our published leader board of most potent experts \) so why have consensus rankings performed so well \? our theory is that these consolidated recommendations help to reduce the negative impact of outlier predictions in other words , as a general rule , it s better to play it safe when making lineup decisions we ve analyzed how successful individual experts are when they go against the majority opinion , and more often than not the risk outweighs the reward rolling the dice on a bold prediction might make you look like a fantasy guru if you re right , but there s usually some solid rationale for why most experts think it s a long shot even though going with the majority tends to produce decent results , it may not produce the best results we think it s important to know which experts are recommending one player over another our members seem to agree they ve done almost one million requests for this information for example , if you re trying to decide between starting fred jackson or mike tolbert this week , you can get an instant list of which experts are backing each player you ll notice that a majority of the experts think you should go with jackson however , you might also notice that four of our five top experts would prefer to start tolbert ! so you should roll with tolbert , right \? if it were that easy , fantasy football would be pretty darn boring , wouldn t it \? in this case , it s interesting to note that this has been a very tough call for the experts as a group , they ve only been right 42 percent of the time on jackson vs tolbert predictions the best expert for this decision so far has been the staff at kffl they have a 74 winloss record \( 64 percent \) and they re rolling with jackson this week we recognize that a handful of start sit predictions is not enough to crown any one expert a specialist for a player or set of players that s why we re working on analyzing all our data to determine if certain experts have particular players pegged better than others we also recognize that many of you just want to know how to get the most accurate advice , without all the gory details we re working on ways to do more accuracy analysis on the data we capture so that we can simply report on what fantasy advice relevant to your team has the greatest chance of bringing you a championship for now , our goal is to ensure that none of our members have to oil up beer bellies over the holidays with that in mind , from all of us at fantasypros , good luck in the playoffs and happy holidays !
ottawa the annual hunt for harp seals off the coast of eastern will barely take place this year but this is not good news for the seals an exceptionally mild winter in the usually frigid gulf of st lawrence has combined with several related factors to discourage canadian hunters from pursuing the seal pups , whose pelts are prized by the fur industry the grim spectacle of pups being bludgeoned on the ice by hunters has long been cited by animal rights activists seeking to curtail the annual hunt the same phenomenon that is behind the decision of most seal hunters to keep their boats in harbors this spring the warm weather that left the waters off the coast largely icefree also threatens the young harp seals harp seals make ice their main habitat , and they give birth on ice , partly as protection from predators on land in port au choix , newfoundland , and other communities around the gulf , hundreds of desperate harp seals arrived in late winter to give birth on fragments of ice clinging to the shoreline then , a few weeks ago , seal pups born elsewhere began floating in on small , shrinking pieces of ice it s the talk of the island , said jeannie billard , who tracked the seals with binoculars from it s very unusual if you see it twice in your life , you 're very lucky the combination of little ice and scattered herds of harp seals has persuaded most hunters around the gulf to stay home we have n't seen any seals around the shore here anywhere , said robert courtney , the president of the north of smokeyinverness south fishermen s association in cape breton , nova scotia i think they went to the north , 300 miles from where we are it s too far mr courtney thinks that none of the 30 to 40 boats from cape breton that usually participate in the seal hunt will this year the situation is much the same in the neighboring magdalen islands of quebec only one boat , whose crew hopes to , has set out so far nonetheless , seal pups are dying many drowned at birth after slipping or being tossed from small slivers of ice others survived , only to be crushed by moving ice or separated from their mothers those born on beaches or shore ice have fallen prey to coyotes and even bald eagles the lack of ice also means that survivors will not have vital spots to rest when they head to sea mortality is going to be higher than normal , said garry stenson , a biologist with , who is based in st john s , newfoundland mike hammill , a fisheries department biologist from mont joli , quebec , said the last time circumstances were so dire for the seal pups was in 1981 that year , the entire year class seemed to disappear , he said while scientists are generally reluctant to attribute individual weather events to , many gulf residents view the icefree spring as a sign of global warming environment canada , the government department that provides weather forecasts , reported that until midmarch the ice was at its lowest in more than four decades of record keeping the canadian government counts 69 million harp seals in the gulf of st lawrence herd in a normal year , they would produce about 280 , 000 pups while it is too early to estimate the extent of this year s losses , government scientists have observed unusual patterns in the seals' activities this year many female harp seals delayed giving birth for up to two weeks as they searched for ice a large number of seals traveled about 100 miles beyond the usual northern limit of their range to find ice , although it is unclear how many females produced pups after the long journey the recession and a on the sale of furs and other products from commercially harvested seals have lowered the value of seal pelts where they once sold for more than 100 , they now fetch 8 to 15 each the government has not formally canceled the seal hunt this year , a decision that animal rights groups have criticized because of concerns over how many pups will die because of the unusual circumstances sheryl fink , a biologist and senior researcher with the international fund for animal welfare , returned recently to guelph , ontario , from the gulf , where she said she had seen dead and dying pups on newfoundland beaches the quebec marine mammal emergency response network said it had received about 50 telephone calls recently from people who had found baby seals struggling to survive on shore most years , it said , it gets at most one or two such calls the response to callers , said v ronik de la cheneli re , a biologist with the group , is always the same let nature take its course harp seals generally do not thrive in captivity , and scientists are concerned that seals brought into captivity and then released will introduce diseases into the gulf that may harm other species , particularly beluga whales in some cases these animals are probably condemned to death , she said when people find this little furry ball on the shore , they tend to react as they would after finding a lost kitten or puppy but these are wild animals they have to be left alone
washington the supreme court has heard 25 arguments so far this term , but the court s newest member , justice elena kagan , has been on the bench for just 10 of them her empty chair is an emblem of the supreme court s sometimes rigorous , sometimes idiosyncratic and often quite mysterious recusal practices justice kagan s absences were rooted in her r \? m \? she was until recently the united states solicitor general , the federal government s top appellate lawyer , and she worked on many cases that are now before the court in her confirmation hearings , justice kagan said she would recuse herself from any case in which i served as counsel of record and any case in which i played a substantial role her participation in the court s work will rise as the term progresses and the aftereffects of her last job start to recede last week , she gave some strong hints about how she would apply that standard in cases concerning two major social issues the hints came in two terse and routine orders from the court saying only that the justices would not intervene in proceedings under way in the lower courts one concerned the recent health care legislation there justice kagan indicated that she would not recuse herself the other was about the military s do n't ask , do n't tell policy restricting openly gay , lesbian and bisexual people from serving in the military there she stepped aside how do we know this \? the order in the second case but not the first said justice kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this application that is the court s stock formula justices stephen g breyer and sonia sotomayor used essentially the same language in noting their own recusals from other cases last week there was no indication , on the other hand , that justice clarence thomas had disqualified himself from the case involving the health care law his wife , virginia thomas , has been affiliated with a group that opposes the law and has not disclosed its contributors none of these justices explained why that is both routine and in its way quite odd in other parts of the justice system , there is general agreement on a couple of points one is that you should not be a judge in your own case the other is that courts gain legitimacy by explaining the reasoning for their decisions we do have an inkling about justice kagan s thinking about cases on the health care law in responses to a letter from republican senators during the confirmation process this summer , she said she had had almost nothing to do with the law or a lawsuit filed in florida seeking to strike it down i attended at least one meeting where the existence of the litigation was briefly mentioned , she wrote , but none where any substantive discussion of the litigation occurred on the rare occasions when justices address recusal standards , they often say they should avoid stepping aside for fear of a 4to4 tie that automatically affirms the decision under review in a oneline order with no reasoning but those deadlocks are quite unusual according to a 2005 analysis by ryan black and lee epstein in the journal of appellate practice and process , the court decided 6 , 815 cases from october 1946 to the summer of 2004 for various reasons including recusals , ties were theoretically possible in 1 , 319 of them but there were deadlocks only 74 times lower court judges model their behavior on that of supreme court justices in 2008 , for instance , chief justice brent d benjamin of the west virginia supreme court declined to step aside in a case involving a campaign supporter who had spent 3 million to help elect him in justifying his decision , chief justice benjamin cited a 2004 memorandum from justice antonin scalia explaining why he would not recuse himself from a case involving a hunting companion , vice president dick cheney in the end , the united states supreme court last year took chief justice benjamin off the west virginia case , saying that 3 million in campaign spending was just too much money justice anthony m kennedy , writing for the majority , also noted that the judicial process had been compromised the sole trier of fact , justice kennedy wrote of chief justice benjamin , was the one accused of bias but justice kennedy did not explore the implication of that point for himself and his colleagues in a recent article in the syracuse law review , steven lubet , a law professor specializing in legal ethics at northwestern , wrote that justice kennedy failed to draw the most obvious lesson from this contretemps the lesson , professor lubet said , is that the full court should review recusal motions chief justice william h rehnquist was dismissive of the idea in 2004 when senators asked him about justice scalia s duckhunting trip while a member of the court will often consult with colleagues as to whether to recuse in a case , there is no formal procedure for court review of a justice in an individual case , chief justice rehnquist wrote this is because it has long been settled that each justice must decide such a question for himself you could call that second sentence reasoning , but you would be being generous photo justice elena kagan , standing , with , from left , justices samuel a alito jr , anthony m kennedy and ruth bader ginsburg justice kagan s old job has presented some conflicts in her new one \( photograph by doug mills the new york times \)
identifying the force driving the yankees early success is not difficult the rotation s earned run average stands at 317 , which is all the more remarkable considering javier vazquez s miseries that is the secondlowest team era in the american league behind tampa bay \( 261 \) and the fifthbest in baseball the cardinals , at 252 , entered thursday s games with the lowest in the majors the yankees are waiting for mark teixeira and nick johnson to hit consistently , and for alex rodriguez s power output to increase but none of the offensive woes has truly dragged them down because their top four starters are pitching so well cc sabathia , aj burnett , andy pettitte and phil hughes , in 22 starts , have combined to go 151 with a 214 era not bad how long this run will last could hinge on the health of pettitte , who left wednesday s game after five innings because of elbow stiffness it is all but certain that , after the magnetic resonance imaging exam showed what the team called mild inflammation , pettitte will miss his scheduled start tuesday in detroit the yankees said that they will treat him conservatively and evaluate him daily if the yankees skip pettitte , sergio mitre would seem the logical choice to fill in because , with dave robertson struggling and chan ho park injured , alfredo aceves is more valuable in the swing role he has carved out for himself in the bullpen and mitre is more stretched out than aceves , which also gives him an edge i wrote this about pettitte s first start this season , and it still holds true no team in baseball has a pitcher as old as pettitte \( he turns 38 on june 15 \) more critical to his team s fortunes he is a no 3 starter in the wake of vazquez s struggles in the no 4 spot , that doesn t mean much once the season started for a team aiming to repeat as world series champions pettitte has dazzled at times this season the april 24 start against the angels , in particular and the yankees have won all six times he has pitched counting pettitte s marvelous work in the playoffs , his left arm has logged 3 , 214 and onethird innings , and he ranks second to jamie moyer among active leaders in innings pitched there has always been some anxiety over his elbow , though he has avoided trouble in new york over the last few seasons the yankees are hoping he will hold up
baghdad during the iraqi parliamentary elections on sunday , this city s main thoroughfares presented an almost overwhelming visual mosaic of politics from the karada neighborhood in the south to the adhamiya district in the north , from poor sadr city to rich mansour , posters for the capital province s 1 , 300 candidates hung from almost every tree and lamppost billboards crowded medians and roundabouts , promising change , justice , unity , jobs , security and more iraq s underlying political currents are even more cacophonous among the candidates are soccer stars , tv news anchors , judges and prostitutes still , it is the images of iraq s big political players that dominate the city s landscape , especially prime minister nuri kamal almaliki and his two predecessors in that post , ayad allawi and ibrahim aljaffari winning the poster contest , of course , may not mean much in terms of the actual election messrs maliki , allawi and jaffari are each part of a complex crosssectarian coalition each draws support from intricate and often contradictory sources given the convoluted party list system employed in the balloting , about the only thing certain is that nobody will win the election outright the kurds , who are likely to win 15 percent of the vote , are open to forming an alliance with almost anyone the provinces and smaller cities with no big names running in them will return an unpredictable grab bag of members of parliament influential smaller candidates like ahmed chalabi , the onetime american favorite in iraq , and bayan jabr , the finance minister , only add to the complexity we should know the polling results in a few days then , once the parliamentary seats are allocated , the game will start all over again coalitions will crack , new alliances will form , and every seat in the 325member parliament will have its price as a handful of leaders compete to build majorities five years ago , in january 2005 , when a free iraq had its first elections , it was not like this the politics was simpler the sunnis boycotted , and the 2005 election posters many of them remain , faded and tattered , on those spots of wall in baghdad not blanketed by the current posters referred mostly to a handful of big parties and emphasized the religious figures who forged them , as opposed to today s myriad individual candidates the streets were different , too , in 2005 there were no traffic lights , and no solar panels on the lampposts drivers did not hurry to put on their seatbelts when slowing for a checkpoint a police uniform was something to run from , not to , in a crisis the iraqi army then had none of today s organized , fit , selfconfident air the americans , invisible today , seemed everywhere a foreign visitor to baghdad , always in fear at the time of the 2005 elections , now waves at the little boys selling kleenex in the traffic jams \( however , the city was less thoroughly wrecked back then \) as i revisited old haunts in baghdad in recent days , it became clear to me that the increasing order on iraq s streets and the bewildering scramble in its politics are of a piece in sadr city , my old acquaintance fattah alsheikh , who was elected to parliament in 2005 as part of the bloc loyal to the extremist shiite cleric moktada alsadr , is now with the baathtinted , mostly sunni party of ayad allawi in iraqi politics there is no more extreme conversion than that from sadrist to baathist i'm a patriot above all else , he told me and the iranians have more or less kidnapped moktada alsadr , so i stand against them opportunistic as this claim may appear , fattah s stand , and his ability to survive in sadr city as a vocally antiiranian candidate , exemplify the postsectarian flexibility that is the hallmark of these elections salaam smeasim is another iraqi i have known for years she s now 55 , and a candidate for the largest shiite opposition party , the iraqi national alliance salaam wears a veil , and her coalition , which includes many sadrists , has relations with iran would you agree with something like the iranian system here in iraq \? i asked her the day before the vote of course not , she said , giving me the only angry look i have received in recent weeks while talking to iraqis about politics as a shiite i do feel something for iran but between iran and america , only america is interested in freedom and human rights in iraq there is nowhere like america for freedom walking in the spring sunshine up and down the length of abu nuwas park along the tigris a green and tempting place i had always admired from hotel rooms across the street but had never felt comfortable venturing into i spoke to a man of about 65 who had a young grandson on his knee in the shade of a tree that is my son , he said , pointing at a young man on a nearby bench one of his brothers i found beheaded in the street the other is still missing the grandfather would not say whether he was a sunni or a shiite i asked how he viewed these elections in light of his personal calamities the rest of the middle east is in a stage of political infancy , adolescence at best , he answered saudi arabia , syria , iran , even lebanon , they are all juvenile but we are passing this stage of a politics about who you are' this election in iraq is about the politics of what you want' and we want an end to sectarianism i continued my tour of a city that seemed to be enjoying its election holiday a christian carparts dealer outside the syrian catholic church in karada , which is largely upper middle class , told me he would be voting for whoever would end the religious violence \( the deaths of attest to how difficult that task remains \) nearby , the manager of baghdad polling station no 7 said voting was normal for iraqis now this is our fifth time in five years , he pointed out and he would be voting for security , jobs and public works , not religion marwa , a 24yearold accounting student whom i spoke to on sunday as she voted with her mother , noted that this was her fourth time going to the polls , and that while it was no longer exciting it was certainly her duty to her country at the karkh hospital i met jassim , a 39yearold army sergeant whose lower leg had been blown off the day before \( soldiers voted on friday so they could provide security over the weekend \) recuperating in his bed , he showed me a purplestained forefinger and said iraq needed a leader to serve the whole nation most iraqi politicians have caught the antisectarian mood that is why prime minister maliki , a shiite , had the confidence to break with the big coalition of his coreligionists that dominated in 2005 and run alongside several major sunni tribal leaders it is why once virulent shiites like fattah , the former sadrist , now see mr allawi s party as a good bet it is why the iraqi national alliance includes not only salaam smeasim , a proamerican shiite in a veil , but also sharif ali bin alhussein , a sunni cousin of iraq s last king and the chief claimant to the longvacant throne with more sunnis participating this time even as the old religious monoliths break down , iraq s coming governmentformation phase will be slow and complex during the weeks of horsetrading and grandstanding , the rhetoric will occasionally be vituperative , iraqi leaders from all parties will be accused of unsavory relationships with foreign powers and the overall winning faction may well have an identitybased core still , as that grandfather in abu nuwas park explained to me , this messy process reflects the decline of sectarianism , a necessary and hopeful step in iraq s political maturation
the cello is now so firmly established as a solo instrument that it s easy to forget that it was mostly a bit player until the 19th century boccherini , a virtuoso cellist , was dedicated to advancing the cause , upgrading the cello s status from bass line accompanist to equal partner he wrote at least 10 concertos and more than 40 sonatas for the instrument conducted the and carter brey , its principal cellist , in the orchestra s first performance of boccherini s cello concerto in d \( g 479 \) on wednesday evening at avery fisher hall the concerto is amiable but unmemorable , an apt description for much of the concert mr muti conducted competently , but the music making often seemed uninspired and perfunctory mr brey played well , except for a few minor intonation problems in the first movement with an appealing tone , he conveyed the lively spirit of the opening allegro and the nuances of the adagio he performed his own idiomatic cadenzas the program opened with a lackluster rendition of mozart s symphony no 34 in c mr muti elicited some gracious phrasing in the first movement , but for those who prefer a crisper , more articulated approach , textures \( especially in the andante \) sounded treacly matters improved in a spirited rendition of the joyous finale the program concluded with schubert s symphony no 4 in c minor \( tragic \) symphonies are sometimes nicknamed by someone other than the composer , but in this case it was schubert \( who wrote it at 19 while a schoolteacher \) who titled it many have noted that the symphony , inspired by the sturm und drang tradition of haydn , mozart and beethoven , is not as tragic as its name implies tragic or not , the music is certainly personal , passionate and intensely expressive , none of which qualities mr muti conveyed in this dutiful performance
st petersburg , russia not long ago , yelena s chizhova was engaged in what has become a standard winter pastime for s middle class taking the sun at a giant resort hotel in egypt she and a girlfriend , who also grew up in st petersburg , joined the river of people flowing into the warehousesize dining hall , its tables heaped with steaming meat and pastries and then something passed over them like a shadow the women felt so uneasy that they had to step away for a moment , and ms chizhova asked her friend what she was thinking about but she did not need to ask what the two women had in common was relatives who starved in the 872day , as st petersburg was then known , when army engineers set off explosives in the fields and shoveled corpses into the craters for a moment , ms chizhova had the strange feeling that she was seeing the piles of food through the eyes of her dying relatives born in 1958 , she learned the official version of the siege from soviet textbooks , which cast it as a patriotic triumph the sifted down to her when she eavesdropped on her mother and greatgrandmother , who lost most of their family in the siege , as they talked quietly over cups of tea these snatches of conversation are at the core of her novel , time of women , which won last year s , the country s most prestigious literary award ms chizhova tells the story of three elderly women raising a small girl in a communal apartment in the early 1960s , where the ordinary business of dishes and laundry is interrupted by memories of purges and famine it is an earthbound and frankly emotional novel , especially in a literary scene long dominated by the cerebral trickery of postmodernism ms chizhova is hoping that russian artists are ready finally to address the good and evil of the soviet past under brezhnev , people averted their eyes from that past out of fear under vladimir v putin , she said , it was replaced by apathy for the vast majority of people , it simply is not interesting , said ms chizhova , 52 , who smokes and talks with the energy of a coiled spring they do not have the feeling that history continues it seems to them that in the 1990s , we just started over as if we were all born then but st petersburg is a city where blotting out history is difficult ms chizhova s mother watched two brothers die of hunger while profiteers were taking fistfuls of gold jewelry in exchange for bread her father was forced into a detachment of irregular fighters who were sent against german tanks in groups of five , provided with only one rifle neither would have dreamed of explaining this to their daughter but ms chizhova s greatgrandmother was different she turned over the memories absently , almost as if she was talking to herself when ms chizhova , then 5 , recited a poem about cannibals in africa , her greatgrandmother explained matteroffactly how the starving residents of leningrad resorted to eating bodies i would ask , where did they get it \? ' ms chizhova said for me it was like a fairy tale she said some of them bought it in the market , thinking it was just meat and then she would explain that when she worked in the hospital , they would store the bodies near the hospital gates , and by the time they went home in the evening , some of the soft parts were cut off she would talk about that calmly , she said and i heard it calmly though the conversations stopped abruptly when ms chizhova turned 6 , they had already engraved something on her when her teachers told her , all leningrad , like one person , stood in defense of the city , her private thought was it was a crime not to evacuate the children and 40 years later , the insistent voices of old women began to declaim in ms chizhova s head , and she sat down to write a novel a slender 95 pages , told in a sometimes cryptic stream of conversation , time of women was not favored to win the , and some critics dripped contempt summing up the books of the year for the magazine literaturnaya rossiya , kirill ankudinov sneered at literature sitting on grandmother s trunk and becoming drunk on memories of how well people behaved under brezhnev , and yevgeny yermolin bemoaned the popularity of cemetery erotica there is no question that the past is exerting a pull on russian art all the novels shortlisted for the prize vibrated with the feel of the 20th century , noted elena dyakova , a critic at the newspaper  after the period of postmodernism , people are searching for some moral bearings , and it s easiest to find that in the lives of your own grandmothers , she said theoretically , we consider that there are no decent people in russia , but empirically , we can show that they used to exist , in any case so it is with ms chizhova s fictional grandmothers , hardly dissident types , who find themselves at war with the soviet system as they struggle to keep the girl , sonia , who is mute , out of a state home for the handicapped at a moment of despair , knowing too well the bleak life that awaits sonia in state custody , one of them tries to prepare her you may be locked up and we may not be allowed to see you , the grandmother whispers fiercely to the girl you will have to manage alone but you should know wherever you are locked up i am with you any day i am outside the fence i will keep walking as long as god gives me life you may not see me , but you should remember my granny is there last month , ms chizhova was still adjusting to her victory , raising her eyebrows when a stranger called to invite her to join his literary circle \( now that i have won a prize , she remarked dryly , it seems i have changed a great deal \) as the soviet union began to fall , she bounced from an economics department her thesis was on regulated costs in machinetool building enterprises to english instruction to the wobbly business world of the 1990s the last bounce took place on a burning cruise ship off the coast of turkey , when she spent six hours shut in her cabin , waiting to see if help would come i sat by myself and tried to answer the question of what would be better to explode or to throw myself into the sea , said ms chizhova , who is married and has two grown daughters i understood that i had done a lot in my life , but none of it was right and when we were saved , i decided to throw it all away and sit and write that was 1996 since then she has written for six hours a day without weekends or vacations , producing five novels , three of them finalists for the booker prize it is not surprising , given this , that she speaks about her work with moral urgency history repeats itself in russia , she said , the same evils appear in new guises , and failing to study it means repeating terrible mistakes but her tone softens and blurs when she is asked whether her novel is political if i am honest , i wrote it for those who died , she said i wrote it for them i was speaking with them i always had the feeling that they were listening to me

rustenburg , south africa when bob bradley was the princeton soccer coach , he took a team of college players to italy , where he met fabio capello , the manager of the italian and european champion ac milan when you make wine , capello advised bradley , the grapes are not always the same for bradley , the meaning was not instantly clear the first few times he said that to me , i thought he was actually talking about making wine , bradley recalled i have thought about it , and i realized he was trying to tell me something about football more than 15 years later , bradley and capello will try to blend different quality grapes into a winning 2010 vintage the between the united states and england on saturday will have none of the flavor of the teams' historic 1950 world cup game , when an amateur american team featuring a dishwasher and a hearse driver beat a squad of english professionals in brazil there will be few surprises for either team this time is full of accomplished players from the premier league , the most popular league in the world the has a dozen players who play or have played in the premier league , and eight others who earn paychecks from overseas clubs that international experience has helped the national team as much as the national team s success has helped american players earn the respect of their international rivals they know what we have to offer , carlos bocanegra , the united states captain , said it s not a secret really between the two teams we 're familiar with each other the americans will try to defend against a , spearheaded by wayne rooney and featuring a number of midfield players with scoring punch england won 9 of its 10 qualifying matches and scored 34 goals , the most in europe half of them were scored by opportunistic midfielders and tall , strong defenders who are particularly dangerous on corner kicks and free kicks we know exactly what kind of game we 're going to be in , american goalkeeper tim howard said we 're under no illusions if the american defenders fail to clear the ball adequately , midfielder frank lampard will be lurking he likes to shoot from long range or spot open lanes to run through the penalty area steven gerrard and joe cole , his midfield teammates , can win loose balls and push forward with speed , putting constant pressure on even the fittest teams we 're comfortable letting them create the rhythm and then finding our own rhythm within the game , howard said we understand our role very well bradley has his players believing that team spirit and persistence can win games , even against superior opponents the players buy into it because it worked last summer against spain , the topranked team in the world in the confederations cup semifinal here , spain outshot the united states , 299 , and had 56 percent of the possession but by playing tight team defense and counterattacking quickly , the  for that to work against england , the united states must steady its center back oguchi onyewu , who has not played a full game since he injured his knee last october , insists he is healthy but jay demerit and clarence goodson have started the americans' warmup matches goodson , who plays at ik start in norway , lacks international experience but has in recent games if one guy gets beat , the next guy is going to be there , midfielder michael bradley said in addition to that , i think we 've shown we have good ability to be dynamic and mobile going forward as well for all of the england players' skill , they will be desperate not to lose , which would be hugely embarrassing at home where the public mood about the team vacillates between supreme confidence \( the sun tabloid called the group easy england , algeria , slovenia , yanks \) and crippling anxiety the england rugby team won its world cup in 2003 and the cricketers won the world twenty20 title in may but soccer is the country s pride their compatriots' success would only highlight the soccer team s failure capello has england wound tightly , and the expectations at home are great , so the players may be very cautious not to give an inch to the americans , who have shown a craftiness in exploiting a single opportunity to score on the counterattack that offense received a lift friday when bob bradley announced that forward jozy altidore , who scored the first goal in last year s upset of spain but was recovering from a sprained ankle , would start against england i want to see the spirit of the team that i saw during qualifying for the world cup , capello said i do believe this time around we have a squad that can make it to the final , he added the hype surrounding this game in south africa , in england and the united states outpaces its importance if you 're a casual sports fan , you would think this is the world cup final , landon donovan said we could lose and still advance we could win and not advance knowing the winner will not necessarily lift the world cup trophy and the loser will not go home may free the americans to take some chances the english may not i would much prefer to play england in the first game than the last game , howard said

direct medical evidence \? none autopsy \? not performed medical records \? nowhere to be found corpse \? disappeared yet according to a recent article in an academic journal , researchers have posited at least 118 causes of death for  a modest industry of medical speculation has grown up around the subject , evidence of our fascination with what cut down great creative artists in history in mozart s case published speculation began within a month of his death in 1791 , and musicologists , physicians and medical scholars have regularly joined the fray ever since dr william j dawson , a retired orthopedic surgeon who is the bibliographer for the performing arts medical association , decided to organize the theories he examined most of the 136 entries in the association s database dedicated to mozart s death , a list by no means comprehensive reviewing the publications on this topic finds many of them to be confusing , complicated , conjectural and contentious , dr dawson , an emeritus professor at northwestern university s medical school , wrote in the latest issue of the association s journal , his conclusion is not surprising controversy will rage on , unabated with direct evidence lacking , researchers have had to rely mainly on accounts by mozart s widow , constanze mozart , and her sister , sophie haibel , given some decades later evidence also comes from an undated document by mozart s son karl thomas and from a description again , decades later by a viennese doctor who spoke to the physicians who treated mozart in his final days scholars have also examined accounts of mozart s ailments in letters written by family members , especially his father , leopold , to uncover signposts regarding his final sickness speculation about an abnormality in the shape of his ear has even led some to suggest that was likely , since urinary tract deformities are sometimes related to ear abnormalities the indirect evidence itself rests on a quicksand of changing medical definitions , sometimes mistranslated phrases from original testimonies and leaps forward in the understanding of diseases and how the body works as people read the symptoms and patterns of the disease as written by the contemporaneous authors , dr dawson said in a recent interview , these physicians , in their own minds , try to put together , what does this represent \? ' the outline of mozart s final illness is clear he took to his bed on nov 20 , 1791 , after an intense period that produced the magic flute , la clemenza di tito , the clarinet concerto , a masonic cantata and parts of his requiem his hands and feet swelled he grew listless , suffered fits and ran a  on dec 4 several friends apparently went to his bedside to sing parts of the requiem in the evening mozart took a turn for the worse , and his doctor , thomas closset , was summoned from the theater but sent word that he would come once the show was over when he arrived , he ordered cold compresses applied to mozart s head , which witnesses said caused the patient to shudder an hour past midnight on dec 5 , mozart was dead , at 35 closset diagnosed mozart s ailment as acute miliary fever , which is more a description than a disease , miliary being a term used to describe milletsized pustules effectively , a rash it was put down as the official cause of death in the in vienna mozart s body was buried , without marking , in a common grave , according to the typical practice of the day for the viennese middle class , ensuring that no remains that are indisputedly his are available for testing dr dawson is not the first to survey theories about mozart s death one of the major scholars in the area is l r karhausen , a physician in france who came up in 1998 with the figure 118 for the causes of death that dr dawson cites in his article dr dawson declines to give his own specific number but he divides the causes into five groups poisoning , infection , cardiovascular disease , kidney disease and miscellaneous bloodletting as a treatment may also have hastened mozart s death the poisoning theory whether by mozart s colleague antonio salieri or by mozart himself to treat \( an illness long since discounted \) was knocked down fairly summarily after a round of early19thcentury gossip mozart himself was said to have suspected poisoning , then changed his mind in his final months in the infection category bacterial , streptococcal , tuberculosis and parasitic infestation have all been proposed rheumatic fever has been a major candidate since a landmark study in 1966 by carl b r , a swiss doctor under cardiovascular disease , the causes include a stroke and the most citations found by dr dawson fall under , a buildup of toxins in the blood caused by kidney disease if i had to put two cents on something , it would probably be kidney failure , dr dawson said it was probably the most common diagnosis people who know more about these things than i consider it the probable principal cause the cause of mozart s kidney problems remains in dispute too another major theory , propounded in detail in the 1980s by the researcher peter j davies , blames sch nleinhenoch syndrome , a rare disorder of the blood vessels , as the underlying cause the syndrome caused kidney failure a and were the coups de gr ce , mr davies put forth all this gives rise to a question why does the subject arouse such intense interest \? earlier this year , for example , a researcher at mount sinai school of medicine , after testing what are believed to be shards of beethoven s skull , called into question the theory that he died of  part of the reason may lie in the close overlay between music and medicine a high proportion of doctors seem to play instruments in fact , dr dawson is an accomplished and active bassoonist the very idea that remarkable individuals who gave life so much beauty could be brought down by ordinary physical ailments , particularly diseases that are now easily treatable , is inherently fascinating that perception makes people of genius seem closer to us they 're immortal and mortal at the same time , said dr jeffrey r saffle , a general surgeon and director of the burntrauma unit at the university of utah medical center they 're largerthanlife figures from the standpoint of what they created , but they are very ordinary in terms of their lives and births and deaths dr saffle and his brother michael saffle , a music historian at virginia tech , wrote a survey of the literature regarding the medical histories of prominent composers medical people like to extend their expertise to this sort of investigative work , he added for dr dawson , studying the deaths of composers fits in with our desire to become closer to them this , he said , is another part of what those lives are about
baghdad even as s parliament convened monday , three long months of , and after it was elected , saif ali , a shopkeeper , was venting his anger at iraqi politicians it was 119 degrees , and he had only a few hours of electricity frankly , the politicians are just wearing us out , he said unemployment \? electricity \? housing \? since 2003 for seven years now no one has solved it yet his brow sweaty , mr ali shook his head even the water is dirty lawmakers hailed monday s 18minute session as a milestone , however symbolic , in forging a government perhaps but officials , diplomats and politicians themselves worry that the frustration of mr ali and others may pose , for the first time , a bigger threat to that fledgling political process than sectarian strife or a diminished but resilient insurgency except for the kurdish parties and the followers of moktada alsadr , a populist shiite cleric , few politicians have any real grassroots support to help in dealing with an increasingly angry public that has welcomed better security but now demands better lives in almost any conversation , cynicism runs deep toward a political class imbued with an opportunism many see as common to almost every iraqi government since the monarchy was overthrown in 1958 there is clearly a divide , said ryan c crocker , the former american ambassador to iraq and a longtime diplomat in the middle east he described an elitist authoritarianism that basically ignores the people right now , what i'm concerned about is the persistence of the political culture in which the governors simply do not really care about the governed , he said saddam did n't invent it this is part of a persistent iraqi political culture , and it did not produce a happy state after 1958 at any point , and i would worry that it will not now iraq s politics have proved prone to deadlock and brinkmanship but monday s session stood as a microcosm of a tangled political process in which nearly every step , procedural or otherwise , is contested kurdish lawmakers insisted that the oath be read in both arabic and kurdish \( it was , eventually \) none of iraq s leaders spoke at the session because , politicians said , their opponents had demanded equal time loyalists of mr sadr , whose militia twice fought the american military in 2004 , threatened to walk out of the session if christopher r hill , the american ambassador , attended \( in the end , they did not \) you can expect anything at any time , said omar almashhadani , a spokesman for the departing parliament speaker , ayad alsamarrai , shaking his head from prime minister nuri kamal almaliki on down , politicians are defensive about the protracted negotiations , even as they acknowledge the public s growing anger real issues are at stake , they say namely , who will govern iraq as the united states withdraws nearly 90 , 000 troops by the end of 2011 whatever coalition eventually coalesces will help determine the formula by which the shiite majority governs a country deeply divided by sect and ethnicity the eventual prime minister will face attempts to shift power from his office to the cabinet and parliament , delineating the state s authority the plethora of factions makes the process harder , too everyone is negotiating with everyone , with varying degrees of sincerity and hardly any success there is no real progress up to now , nothing real , said adel abdul mahdi , a vice president and candidate for prime minister we are still at a standstill some people , though , have angrily termed the negotiations theater , and there is indeed an element of that indecision is so ingrained that president jalal talabani , who has the right to convene parliament , issued a statement soliciting opinions on the date he should choose mr maliki s shiite allies smuggled his sunni opponents a video that seemed to undermine mr maliki s argument to form the next government then there is ayad allawi , the frequently flying leader of a secular and sunni muslim coalition that won the most seats in the march 7 election i challenge anyone to tell me that allawi has stayed more than seven days in iraq since the election , said ali almousawi , a spokesman for mr maliki s government mr allawi s aides defend his travel as necessary to help repair iraq s relations with its neighbors mr abdul mahdi wondered whether the very clubbiness of the politicians made it harder to make decisions as a boy , he swam with ahmad chalabi in the pool of mr chalabi s father both attended the same school as mr allawi in exile in the 1970s , mr talabani and mr abdul mahdi circulated in the same circles in lebanon because of friendlier relations , courtesies , sometimes real issues are not raised , mr abdul mahdi said you think your friend is making a mistake , and you ca n't be so frank with him his sense of generosity is not shared beyond the green zone , where everyone from grand ayatollah ali alsistani , the country s most powerful shiite cleric , to merchants along the barricaded streets of baghdad has warned of the discontent the refrain of their conversation is masalih , or interests and politicians are working for their own i'm worn out , the weather is hot , business is bad , and so is the government , shouted mohammed ali , a merchant along palestine street in baghdad , as he wagged his finger the subject is over that s it can i tell you anything more than that \? a deep current of conspiracy and suspicion runs through such sentiments , much like what was heard during the early days of the american occupation in 2003 rarely are individual politicians blamed often it is the entire state , its institutions having failed to deliver the most basic services or to ameliorate the siegelike sense to the fortified city they know our problems , but they do n't care , said alaa sabah , shopping on a trashfilled street the people who elected them \? they do n't figure into their thinking mr hill , the ambassador , suggested that an angry public might force politicians to reach an agreement on a coalition sooner than they otherwise would have they 're going to have to solve that or be judged as having allowed their personal ambitions get in the way of the public s interests , he said but like many others , riyadh mehdi simply saw a disconnect between government and the governed the owner of a clothing store , he said he had no faith in the parliament seated monday when they hand out the salaries , every single one of them will be there , he said when there s a session on the problems of iraq , you 'll be able to count the number who attend with both hands seven , eight they 're there for money and power that s it he paused , looking out at a sundrenched street i swear , he said , a monarchy would be better than this republic
for 16 years , marshall a cohen served as a director of the american international group , stepping down just months before the company s nearcollapse in 2008 several months later , mr cohen was again

fed the risktaking the ceo s get most of the attention because there s so little expectation that the board should have done something , mr gillespie said in our corporate system the directors are supposed to be in charge , not the ceo , yet they rarely get any of the blame because they 're typically dominated by the ceo a gleacher spokesman declined to comment mr cohen , a toronto lawyer and

little time looking at the role of corporate boards the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations held four hearings on the causes of the financial crisis , none of which focused on the role of directors the financial crisis inquiry commission , appointed by congress , has held myriad hearings and interviews with executives of failed institutions although the public sessions have not included testimony from any outside directors , the hearings did touch on corporate governance , and the commission has privately interviewed directors , according to phil angelides , the commission s

a halfcentury ago , before the phrase pop art was even coined , a taxi tycoon named robert c scull started buying up dozens of works by artists like jasper johns , robert rauschenberg and andy warhol when mr johns had an exhibition at castelli gallery , and none of it was selling , mr scull bought the whole show he commissioned warhol s first portrait he gave james rosenquist his first sale after a visit to his studio he gave john chamberlain enough money to let him quit his hairdressing job and focus exclusively on being a sculptor as much as anyone , mr scull and his wife , ethel a fashion plate and socialite whom everyone called spike created the market for pop , making it the occasion for lavish parties , an emblem of high society and the new face of art in the 1960s then , in 1973 , they auctioned off a huge chunk of it 50 paintings and sculptures and walked away with 22 million , dozens of times more than they had paid much of the art world was scandalized new york magazine s art critic railed at the banal , nouveau riche sculls , whose greed , shamelessness , and sheer , unadulterated chutzpa killed contemporary art not with a whimper but with a bid soon after came the divorce , a vicious court battle that raged for 11 years and ended after robert s death at 70 , in 1986 with another auction , of the sculls' remaining 142 works it brought 10 million , much of which went to pay lawyers and tax collectors , and scattered the art collection across the world in the mid1960s , tom wolfe had profiled the sculls as the folk heroes of every social climber who ever hit new york by the time ethel died , at 79 , in 2001 , they were remembered mainly , if at all , for the gossip and the uproar but now acquavella galleries , on the upper east side , has gathered 44 of the most striking works from their collection , on loan from 11 museums , 2 foundations and 22 private collectors in five countries the museumstyle show amounts to less than onefifth of what the sculls bought through the years , but it may be enough to rehabilitate the couple s reputation the art critic and historian irving sandler once wrote that he liked the sculls because they were vulgar , knew it , and did n't give a damn but in a recent interview he added that robert was one of the only people at the time who understood this art it s a major collection , he said certainly the exhibition and the lavish catalog , written by its curator , judith goldman , make the case that robert scull was one of the greatest collectors of american art , maybe the most perceptive of the postwar era he grew up poor on the lower east side , the son of a garment district worker and a homemaker , jewish immigrants from russia at 10 , his life changed when his grandfather took him to the metropolitan museum of art he started taping posters of his favorite paintings on his bedroom wall he studied drawing at the art students league , but had to quit to earn a living he was a frustrated artist , said jonathan scull , his oldest son , now 62 and the owner of a home entertainment marketing firm he had a big ego , and he was an aggressive collector but he bought all that art because he was crazy for it , and nothing was going to get in his way robert scull had the eye for art ethel supplied the seed money her father was the original taxi magnate , and when she married robert , in the mid1940s , he gave his soninlaw half of the fleet scull expanded that into an empire of 135 cars , 400 drivers , and a lucrative taxi insurance business by the mid1950s , he had enough money to buy serious art , focusing on abstract expressionism \( the acquavella show has a few of these paintings \) but he 'd come late to this movement , and when he saw the jasper johns show at castelli , he knew right away that this art was the art he wanted art that , as he put it in a 1964 interview , portrayed what we really are in one bright , luminous and concentrated thing , whether a beer can or a flag he befriended the young pop artists , spent weekends at their downtown studios and bought their art when they could barely afford to pay rent within the next few years , pop caught on as the next big thing among the city s cultural tastemakers , who suddenly realized to their delight or horror that the realm was already dominated by this loudtalking , cigarchomping , jaguardriving taxi king and his wife , who modeled dior and courr ges in vogue the shock of the '73 auction stemmed not just from mr scull s skyhigh profits but from the realization that this art , which some still saw as a fad or a goof , possessed enduring value thaw , a rauschenberg combinepainting that mr scull had bought for 900 , sold at the auction for 85 , 000 warhol s largecanvas flowers , which he had bought for 3 , 500 , sold for 135 , 000 mr johns s double white map , bought for 10 , 000 , fetched 240 , 000 after the auction , rauschenberg , who later admitted that he had been drinking , shoved mr scull in the chest and berated him for making so much money off his hard labor not all the artists were angry when mr johns heard about the results , he and his crew took a break from making lithographs to uncork some champagne he knew , as mr scull tried to explain to rauschenberg , that the high prices would mean higher prices for the works he was making now roy lichtenstein , who had also sold some paintings to mr scull , said of rauschenberg s reaction , what did he want , the work to decrease in value \? mr sandler said that , more than any other single event , the '73 auction kicked off the art market that we know today at the 1986 estate auction , rosenquist s f111 an 85footlong , 51panel painting that castelli was ready to break up into separate pieces until mr scull bought the whole thing for 45 , 000 sold for 19 million warhol s 200 dollar bills , which brought 385 , 000 at the 1986 auction , sold at sotheby s last fall for 46 million four years ago , the entertainment mogul david geffen , who owns a number of scull treasures , sold mr johns s false start to the hedge fund manager kenneth griffin for 80 million jonathan scull , who lives in a rentcontrolled apartment in chelsea , has held on to a few small works from the golden years , but not many the night before his bar mitzvah , in 1961 , mr johns gave him a sculptured painting of a

he arrived in a cloud of dust and departed in silence , leaving anxious suitors behind and wonder in his wake all that is left now is a decision that could alter the nba landscape after three days of nonstop courting , withdrew from the hype saturday afternoon and retreated to some quiet corner to consider his options a decision is expected soon he left no hints about when , how or why but james left every team , six in all , feeling hopeful about the possibilities none of them more than the , his longtime employer we had a very good meeting with lebron and his group , chris grant , the cavaliers' general manager , said saturday in cleveland we had fun and it was very interactive the cavaliers and the , widely regarded as the favorites in the chase , gave the final presentations , concluding a threeday process that included pitches from the , the miami heat , and the  james s decision could have farreaching ramifications for all of them , for the other freeagent stars dwyane wade , chris bosh , amar'e stoudemire and joe johnson and for dozens of other players who are waiting for contracts the knicks , the nets , the bulls and the heat will not spend their millions in salarycap space until james makes a commitment the cavaliers cannot choose a path contending or rebuilding until james chooses his and james , wade and bosh are all lobbying one another , with visions of creating a superpower in the eastern conference two of the three seem likely to end up as teammates every day brings another report , or several , about where they are leaning the teams have no idea , said mark bartelstein , a chicagobased agent who represents dozens of nba players that s one thing i can tell you 100 percent for sure bartelstein does not represent any of the stars in this freeagent class , but he does represent david lee , one of the most coveted players in the next tier lee has met with minnesota , chicago and miami , has spoken with the nets and remains on the radar of the knicks , his team for the last five seasons of that group , only the can offer a contract now chicago , miami and new jersey , they 're kind of frozen until lebron decides what he s doing , bartelstein said one star did come to terms saturday according to multiple reports , dirk nowitzki , as expected , completed a deal to stay with the dallas mavericks the bulls got the final word with james , with a threehour presentation that surely emphasized their promising young core , which includes derrick rose and joakim noah the chicago delegation led by the owner , the team executives gar forman and john paxson and coach tom thibodeau was booed by cavaliers fans as it left the cavaliers' contingent featured grant , his assistant lance blanks , the owner dan gilbert and their newly hired head coach , as james s hometown team , they appealed to his sentiment and sense of humor as much as his competitive drive according to the cleveland plaindealer , the cavaliers showed an animated film filled with inside jokes , a reminder that they know him best it mimicked the style of one of james s favorite shows in an effort coordinated by the team , fans greeted james as he arrived and threw talcum powder \( provided by the team \) in the air , a tribute to his pregame ritual progress is being made on deals with some of the most coveted free agents johnson is said to be close to choosing either the knicks or the atlanta hawks both have made maximum contract offers , although atlanta s is worth 28 million more , because of cap rules that favor the home team in the meantime , the knicks are trying to keep their options open they are talking to lee and pursuing mike miller , the veteran sharpshooter they are prepared to give stoudemire a fiveyear , 997 million deal , although team officials insist that a formal offer has not yet been made nor is it a certainty because of the complex nature of this freeagent market logically , the knicks cannot make a commitment to stoudemire as long as they remain in the running for james , wade and even bosh , who is close friends with both of them bosh also ranks slightly higher on the knicks' list of power forwards than stoudemire in any case , a knicksstoudemire marriage will not be consummated until they meet in person they are expected to do so on monday stoudemire landed in new york late saturday afternoon and on his twitter account just touched down in ny , going to a broadway show tonight it s going to be great what else is good this evening \? while knicks officials spent most of the week wooing the top stars , they have not given up on lee , who made his first allstar team this year in fact , if the knicks are shut out by james and wade , one alternative would be signing stoudemire , lee and miller to form a new frontcourt lee and stoudemire would be interchangeable at power forward and center , forming a potent scoring tandem , albeit one that would struggle defensively miller , a brilliant passer and shooter , would fit nicely in coach s offense and , along with danilo gallinari , help keep the floor spread for stoudemire for now , all anyone can do is monitor the twitter feeds and wait for the phone to ring anyone that says they know what someone s going to do , bartelstein said , is out of their minds
on the third wednesday of every month , the nine members of an elite wall street society gather in midtown manhattan the men share a common goal to protect the interests of big banks in the vast market for derivatives , one of the most profitable and controversial fields in finance they also share a common secret the details of their meetings , even their identities , have been strictly confidential drawn from giants like jpmorgan chase , goldman sachs and morgan stanley , the bankers form a powerful committee that helps oversee trading in derivatives , instruments which , like insurance , are used to hedge risk in theory , this group exists to safeguard the integrity of the multitrilliondollar market in practice , it also defends the dominance of the big banks the banks in this group , which is affiliated with a new derivatives clearinghouse , have fought to block other banks from entering the market , and they are also trying to thwart efforts to make full information on prices and fees freely available banks' influence over this market , and over clearinghouses like the one this select group advises , has costly implications for businesses large and small , like dan singer s home heatingoil company in westchester county , north of new york city this fall , many of mr singer s customers purchased fixedrate plans to lock in winter heating oil at around 3 a gallon while that price was above the prevailing 280 a gallon then , the contracts will protect homeowners if bitterly cold weather pushes the price higher but mr singer wonders if his company , robison oil , should be getting a better deal he uses derivatives like swaps and options to create his fixed plans but he has no idea how much lower his prices and his customers' prices could be , he says , because banks do n't disclose fees associated with the derivatives at the end of the day , i do n't know if i got a fair price , or what they 're charging me , mr singer said derivatives shift risk from one party to another , and they offer many benefits , like enabling mr singer to sell his fixed plans without having to bear all the risk that oil prices could suddenly rise derivatives are also big business on wall street banks collect many billions of dollars annually in undisclosed fees associated with these instruments an amount that almost certainly would be lower if there were more competition and transparent prices just how much derivatives trading costs ordinary americans is uncertain the size and reach of this market has grown rapidly over the past two decades pension funds today use derivatives to hedge investments states and cities use them to try to hold down borrowing costs airlines use them to secure steady fuel prices food companies use them to lock in prices of commodities like wheat or beef the marketplace as it functions now adds up to higher costs to all americans , said gary gensler , the chairman of the commodity futures trading commission , which regulates most derivatives more oversight of the banks in this market is needed , he said but big banks influence the rules governing derivatives through a variety of industry groups the banks' latest point of influence are clearinghouses like ice trust , which holds the monthly meetings with the nine bankers in new york under the doddfrank financial overhaul , many derivatives will be traded via such clearinghouses mr gensler wants to lessen banks' control over these new institutions but republican lawmakers , many of whom received large campaign contributions from bankers who want to influence how the derivatives rules are written , say they plan to push back against much of the coming reform on thursday , the commission canceled a vote over a proposal to make prices more transparent , raising speculation that mr gensler did not have enough support from his fellow commissioners the department of justice is looking into derivatives , too the department s antitrust unit is actively investigating the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the credit derivatives clearing , trading and information services industries , according to a department spokeswoman indeed , the derivatives market today reminds some experts of the nasdaq stock market in the 1990s back then , the justice department discovered that nasdaq market makers were secretly colluding to protect their own profits following that scandal , reforms and electronic trading systems cut nasdaq stock trading costs to 1 20th of their former level an enormous savings for investors when you limit participation in the governance of an entity to a few likeminded institutions or individuals who have an interest in keeping competitors out , you have the potential for bad things to happen it s antitrust 101 , said robert e litan , who helped oversee the justice department s nasdaq investigation as deputy assistant attorney general and is now a fellow at the kauffman foundation the history of derivatives trading is it has grown up as a very concentrated industry , and old habits are hard to break representatives from the nine banks that dominate the market declined to comment on the department of justice investigation

to the editor re \( front page , june 16 \) a nice speech , but words are hollow when unaccompanied by actions with oil still spewing into the gulf of mexico , president obama has an opportunity to point the path toward real change in the way americans think about their energy consumption squandering this opportunity would be failure of leadership on a breathtaking scale the american people are at a crossroads in the face of this tragedy they can either face the reality of what consequences flow from their addiction to a fossil fuelbased lifestyle , or retreat into apathy and continue as before mr obama , as president , is uniquely positioned to influence this decision , and the fact that he is doing nothing more than offering platitudes and a wholly inadequate energy policy that emphasizes cap and trade is inexcusable perhaps he ca n't personally plug the leak , but he can , and should , be pushing much harder to see that the lessons of this tragedy do n't go unheeded mark rutkowski syosset , ny , june 16 , 2010  to the editor sure , we must reduce our dependence on oil but president obama s implication that the gulf oil spill is our fault , the american people s fault , is nothing but defensive rhetoric the gulf disaster is not our fault any more than a highway pileup is the fault of everyone who drives it is the fault of bp , with its costsaving , sloppy drilling , and the fault of the government bureaucracy that was put in place to ensure drilling safety period the buck stops there not here samuel reifler rhinebeck , ny , june 16 , 2010  to the editor re \( column , june 16 \) maureen dowd and others keep beating up on president obama for his seeming emotional detachment in his response to the oil spill he has been thoughtful , eloquent and responsible in reaction to the bp catastrophe do we really want a leader to muster the adrenalin to go full bore \?

columbia , mo only something so heavy could lighten their burden three men gripped a 150pound headstone around the edges , lugged it 40 feet across the grass and lowered it into the dirt got it \? the anesthesiologist asked , tilting the slab in gently yeah yeah , over here , the insurance man said they rose from their knees , brushed off their hands and stood back from the grave big bill gatewood , the historian said with a sigh for almost 50 years , william m gatewood lay in obscurity in an unmarked grave here at memorial park cemetery but that ended tuesday , when three baseball fans continued their quest to locate every former negro leagues player without a headstone and do their share to right the wrong was a star pitcher and manager in the early negro leagues who is credited with giving james bell his nickname , cool papa , and teaching satchel paige his hesitation pitch gatewood died in columbia in 1962 with no one to arrange for a grave marker on tuesday , he became the 19th player for whom the has provided a headstone the project volunteers track down unmarked graves , raise money for headstones and install them , often with their own hands these were great ballplayers who do n't deserve to be forgotten , but they have been , said dr jeremy krock , a 52yearold anesthesiologist from peoria , ill , who began the effort seven years ago a lot of these guys , by the time jackie robinson made it , they were way past their prime it was too late for them and not having a marker on their grave for people to remember them only made it worse krock was joined at the gravesite tuesday by larry lester , a negro leagues historian from kansas city , mo , and dwayne isgrig , a customer service representative for a st louis insurance company they convened under the beaming sun in central missouri , drawn to bill gatewood s grave by baseball , negro leagues history and purposeful regret since 2004 , the remains of highpockets trent \( burr oak cemetery outside chicago \) , steel arm taylor \( springdale cemetery , peoria \) , gable patterson \( greenwood cemetery , pittsburgh \) and other baseball pioneers have been tracked down and memorialized by the group it raises money for the 700 headstones primarily through members of the , although after hearing about the effort , some in baseball have quietly written checks , including the chicago white sox owner jerry reinsdorf , the former commissioner fay vincent and the former player , manager and coach don zimmer at the annual symposium of sabr s research committee on july 15 in birmingham , ala , sap ivory a first baseman for the local black barons from 1958 to 1960 will get a headstone above his nearby grave the group s primary targets now include two members of the national in cooperstown , ny , and , among about 20 more on its growing list hill s remains have yet to be found , and white is buried in an unmarked group grave at frederick douglass memorial park on staten island we do n't want these men to continue to be unrecognized and invisible , lester said beside gatewood s new marker that s just not acceptable ron hill , pete hill s greatnephew , who has been in touch with krock s group to help find his hall of fame relative , said in a telephone interview you wonder who these people are but they were very sincere krock is a st louis cardinals fan who had no particular interest in baseball history before he began the effort essentially by accident some older relatives had grown up in ardmore , mo , and still talked reverently about a 1930s negro leagues outfielder from the town , krock consulted an obituary , wanted to learn where crutchfield was buried and eventually determined that he lay in an unmarked grave near chicago a conversation with sabr s negro leagues committee led to a mention in the group s newsletter , and 25 checks from strangers started arriving at krock s home krock came across two more players at burr oak , got headstones for them , too , and soon was after others for negro leagues players who died destitute enough to end up in unmarked graves , only fraying cemetery records can lead krock to remains , as groundskeepers walk off distances with tape measures to pinpoint where the players might lie in the early negro leagues , gatewood a huge man for his era at 6 feet 7 inches and 240 pounds was the righthanded equivalent of c c sabathia gatewood won 117 games for more than a dozen teams from 1906 to 1928 and pitched the first documented nohitter in the newly organized negro national league , in 1921 he threw another in 1926 , when he was 45 as a manager , he mentored cool papa bell , converting him from pitcher to star outfielder , and coached that quirky righthander named satchel many decades later , krock tracked down gatewood s remains at memorial park cemetery just off interstate 70 although that was an even harder task than usual , because the original burial records burned in a church fire decades ago and big bill s file read gatenwood isgrig was a gatewood fan because of their mutual ties to missouri and arranged for the headstone for his forgotten hero on tuesday , krock spent his day off from the children s hospital of illinois by driving three hours to st louis , transferring the stone from a monument company pickup to his own honda pilot in a denny s parking lot , and driving another two hours to columbia to meet lester and isgrig at the cemetery on mostly open grass made wavy by sunken graves , the three hoisted gatewood s stone by hand and placed it in a newly dug rectangle at what had previously been known to groundskeepers as calvary 5 , row 3 , space 9 krock wore a white polo shirt and khakis as he delivered prepared remarks isgrig and his two young children stood in kansas city monarchs shirts the gleaming stone read negro leagues baseball pitcher and manager big bill william m gatewood 1881 1962 instead of a hyphen between the years , they put a drawing of a baseball inside a glove , symbolizing gatewood s passion for the game that they , too , had inherited none of gatewood s family , including four surviving grandchildren to whom krock wrote letters , attended the ceremony it wo n't be a tourist attraction , isgrig said , but it s something several cemetery employees stood nearby to pay their respects and listen to stories about a man they had no idea was on their grounds the westwood memorial sales director , bill boos , had known nothing of the big pitcher or negro leagues baseball hearing everything today , he said , it almost feels like big bill gatewood is coming back to life he offered krock help connecting the group with other cemeteries as others walked toward the concrete path after the ceremony , krock stopped , bent down and used his

bristol , tenn \( ap \) it took roughly 40 minutes with nascar for the drivers carl edwards and brad keselowski to put their longsimmering feud to rest at least that was how it appeared as they exited smiling from their highly anticipated meeting saturday at bristol motor speedway we laughed , we cried , said edwards , who playfully slapped at keselowski s shoulder as they hustled to their cars after the meeting in the end , i think it s going to be good the nascar president , mike helton , summoned edwards , keselowski and their car owners into his attrack office to discuss a longrunning feud between them that exploded when edwards intentionally wrecked keselowski two weeks ago in atlanta the accident caused keselowski s car to sail into the air before bouncing on its hood although edwards wrecked earlier in the race after contact with keselowski , he has maintained that his deliberate retaliation stemmed from animosity created from several past incidents with keselowski aggressive and ultraconfident , keselowski has gone bumper to bumper with several veterans the past two years and refused to back down this meeting was n't about atlanta , said helton , who added it was about brad and carl s relationship a conversation that we 've had with other drivers in the past more than a dozen photographers and television cameras crowded the back of nascar s trailer to capture the drivers' exit , and the crowd followed them to pit road to meet them after their nationwide series qualifying laps they parked side by side after their laps keselowski won the pole for saturday s race , while edwards qualified fourth and edwards leaned over keselowski s hood to speak to his rival then both vowed to move on in their relationship hopefully it will be productive to where we can move forward and continue to race each other hard and not have any more incidents like we did at atlanta , keselowski said you have to understand that carl and i have a mutual respect in a sense , we 're almost the same people we come from similar backgrounds and drive the same way i had a lot of respect for him before and after the accident , so hopefully that will stay the same what remains to be seen is how other drivers react ontrack , beginning with sunday s race at bristol the 00533mile bullring is a track that creates aggressive driving , excessive contact and extreme tempers edwards begins a threerace probation period this weekend that has him under careful scrutiny from nascar , which will not tolerate anything out of line from him but keselowski still has a long list of drivers who are adamant that he needs to turn his aggression down a notch , and bristol is an easy place to send a message that could go unnoticed by nascar officials i think he 'll learn , juan pablo montoya said he s going to say he s going to race the same way , but i'm sure he wo n't and if he does , somebody else will wreck him again race hard because you want to show you can get the job done but you 've got to learn to respect everybody roger penske , owner of keselowski s car and one of the most respected leaders in the racing industry , vowed his support for his newest driver keselowski got his break in the nationwide series driving for dale earnhardt jr , spent time in development with hendrick motorsports , but signed with penske last fall when a sprint cup series ride with hms did not materialize aside from the atlanta incident , none of keselowski s issues have occurred under the penske banner he s a terrific talent , penske said i do n't tell my drivers to run hard or to run soft i think he knows what he has to do on the race track with his peers and quite honestly , he s not making any statements about what he s going to do or not do i think the media has taken some of that and moved it further and made him with a bigger circle around him what i want him to do is run fair on the race track and be competitive but he s got to respect the other drivers they have to respect him
thousand oaks , calif on saturday at the chevron world challenge , nobody caught , who is in hot pursuit of topranked lee westwood a half a world away woods , who finished winless this year on the pga tour for the first time in his professional career , carded a and holds the 54hole lead , at 17under 199 , for the first time in 2010 if woods is victorious sunday and westwood finishes second or worse at a 12man invitational in south africa , woods will regain his no 1 ranking he sat atop the world rankings for 281 consecutive weeks before being supplanted by westwood , an englishman , this fall westwood , like woods , has shown no signs of surrender he will take a into the final round of the nedbank golf challenge while the battle for no 1 continued , the american took possession of another prestigious title , with the pga tour announcing saturday that he was voted player of the year by his peers furyk , 40 , the reigning champion of this event , won a tourleading three tournaments , none of them majors this is very meaningful , furyk said , adding it s a proud moment for me it s special because my peers voted for me unlike the weather the first two rounds , the conditions were digthehandsinthepocket cold when woods and his nearest challenger , graeme mcdowell of northern ireland , teed off mcdowell , the runnerup at this tournament last year , started and ended the day four strokes behind after matching woods s 68 woods has never lost when taking a lead of more than three strokes into the final 18 there are five par5s on the 7 , 027yard sherwood country club layout , and in the first two rounds , woods played them in 10 under par when he was winning with numbing regularity on the pga tour , his mastery of the long holes was his calling card from 2003 to 2009 , woods finished first or second on the tour six times in the category of par5 birdies or better he was fifth in 2008 , when he was limited to six events because of knee operations that was woods s lowest showing in the category until this year , when he ranked 32nd on the second hole saturday , a 531yard dogleg right , woods split the fairway with his drive instead of aiming for the middle of the multitiered green , he took aim at the pin tucked like a pocket handkerchief on the left side , which was protected by a creek woods s ball splashed in the water , and he made a bogey it was n't the shot to play , he said the bailout has to be to the right that was a mental mistake on my part mcdowell made a birdie , and woods s lead was halved mcdowell pulled to one behind woods with a 4foot birdie at the par3 third hole , but on the par5 fifth , woods made the first of three consecutive birdies to give himself breathing room he carded a 3 on the sixth by sinking his longest putt of the week , a downhill lag from 20 feet that died in the hole woods also made an 18foot putt to save par at the 14th hole and capped his round by rolling in a 2foot birdie it was a pretty good day over all , woods said amy yang of south korea birdied the last two holes for a oneover par 73 that allowed her to cling to a onestroke lead over maria hjorth of sweden after the third round of the lpga tour championship yang , seeking her first lpga triumph , was sixunder 210 after 54 holes of the seasonending tournament in orlando , fla

peace arch state park , wash the has spent the past four months touring north america , spanning its coasts , crossing its heartland and scaling its mountains in a 28 , 000mile route to the 2010 winter olympics in vancouver yet on tuesday , there was still new territory to explore the united states last year , international olympic officials decided that the torch would travel only within the home country of the games beginning in 2012 their goal was to keep crowds friendly after widespread accompanied the torch relay , and embarrassed china and olympic officials , before the 2008 summer olympics in beijing canada signed on early to the new rules but then bent them on tuesday , albeit barely for perhaps a hundred footsteps , phil mahre , the 1984 olympic gold medalist in the alpine slalom who grew up skiing in the cascade mountains of washington , took hold of the flame just after dawn here at the canadian border and carried it into his home country a vivid sunrise lit up semiahmoo bay as members of the semiahmoo first nation danced and performed a fire keepers ceremony hundreds of people stood on frostcovered grass and cheered and waved flags of both countries gov christine gregoire of washington and premier gordon campbell of british columbia spoke of international friendship if there were protests , they could not be seen or heard from the , a monument at the heart of adjoining state and provincial parks the border between blaine , wash , and surrey , british columbia went off without a hitch , mike milne , a spokesman for the seattle office of the united states customs and border protection , confirmed in an email message vancouver is less than 30 miles from blaine , and the united states has made a substantial investment in security on this side of the border , hiring additional border agents and bringing in extra air and marine units for patrols a passport is now required to enter the united states from canada by land , a fact that concerns people on both sides who worry about crossing delays customs and border protection has promised to open 10 inspection lanes at the blaine port of entry into the united states , the busiest crossing with canada on the west coast but none of that was an issue here on tuesday no passports were required to watch the torch relay and ceremony at the peace arch , which shares its name with the two parks children of a common mother is inscribed across the top of the arch , which was built to commemorate a century of open border with canada , beginning in 1814 may these gates never be closed , reads another inscription mr mahre ran past those words , and through the arch , on his way back to canada he was greeted by ms gregoire and mr campbell ms gregoire said that a year ago mr campbell proposed having the torch cross into the united states here i said i ca n't think of a better way to celebrate our friendship , said ms gregoire , who wore red olympic mittens members of ms gregoire s and mr campbell s staffs meet regularly , and the state and the province share many similar policy goals , particularly on efforts to curb but ms gregoire is not mr campbell s only ally on the west coast on friday , the day of the opening ceremonies at the olympics , gov arnold schwarzenegger of california , who has joined with mr campbell in working to reduce carbon emissions at the state and provincial levels , will run with the torch in vancouver
walking around the olympics in her georgian team jacket , allison reed often gets an acknowledging nod , a pat on the back or words of sympathy , like sorry for your loss it did n't matter that i did n't know him , said reed , referring to nodar kumaritashvili , the luge athlete from the republic of georgia killed here last week the impact on me is just as strong it s still heartbreaking that i lost a teammate reed , 15 , is an ice dancer from warren , nj , but is competing in the olympics for the republic of georgia in a move that is not unusual for a sport in which compatible partners are hard to find she and the georgian ice dancer otar japaridze paired up last may four months later , they unexpectedly qualified for these winter games by november she had a georgian passport now she is a dual citizen the reed family celebrated suddenly , they had three olympians , not just two , at the dinner table , but none were skating for the united states allison s older siblings , cathy , 22 , and chris , 20 , were headed to vancouver as ice dancers , too for japan the ice dancing competition begins with the compulsory dance friday i know it sounds a little crazy and confusing but we 're so happy to be at the olympics together , no matter what country we 're representing , cathy reed said of the threeolympian family to be honest with you , this whole experience has been a little crazy the reed children were born in kalamazoo , mich their mother , noriko reed , is from japan their father , robert reed , was born and raised in nebraska while chris and cathy have obvious ties to japan , allison did not have any connection to georgia before becoming one of its athletes she knows only a few words of the language , including hello and thank you , and that the capital is tbilisi but since the olympics started , she has felt closer to that country than she ever thought she would she and japaridze , 22 , have been on a bittersweet , turbulent ride here after the death of the 21yearold kumaritashvili during a training run the entire crowd at bc place rose to meet the georgian delegation , with its seven athletes , as it marched into the opening ceremony reed and japaridze , wearing black bands around their right biceps to honor their fallen teammate , could not hold back tears after the opening ceremony , the georgians watched a video of kumaritashvili s fatal run allison reed said that the emotions of seeing it had overwhelmed her , and that it was a tremendous relief to have nearly her entire family here to lean on her mother is her chaperone and is sharing a room with her chris reed said he had later tried to distract allison from the accident by playing foosball with her in the athletes' village this started out as such a great experience for all of us , so it s too bad that allison s olympics started out this way , he said now we 're just trying to stick together noriko reed is trying to keep things business as usual for the family that normally spends its days in two separate ice rinks cathy and chris train in hackensack , nj , and allison trains in mount laurel at the olympics , noriko reed meets her children for breakfast and attends their practices she does both of her daughters' hair each day , creating complicated designs with braids she applies allison s makeup , too , loading on the eye shadow and blush noriko reed estimated that it costs more than 70 , 000 a year for chris and cathy s training , and that the japanese figure skating federation has only begun to kick in funds this year when allison moved closer to her rink last summer , renting an apartment on her own , the cost to finance the family hobby increased sharply , noriko reed said i never planned for this , but my children are competing in the highest event every athlete dreams of , so why not do everything you can to help them \? said noriko reed , who will wear red and white during the ice dancing competitions because the flags of japan and georgia are those colors my biggest wish for cathy and chris was to skate at us nationals i never thought they were going to win it after falling short of mastering the jumps and spins of singles skating , cathy began ice dancing when she was 13 chris joined her when he was 11 he was too weak and short to lift her when they started , but they improved as he grew in 2006 they won the united states novice championships at the time , though , there was too much depth at the top of ice dancing in the united states \( two united states teams are favorites to win medals at these games \) so their coach , nikolai morozov , had a solution try to compete for japan there , singles skating is the priority , so there is room at the top in dance as athletes with dual citizenship , they soon became japan s top ice dancers , winning three consecutive national championships they competed at the world championships twice , finishing 16th both times while they grew up speaking a little japanese , communication with their skating federation is still difficult , so their mother is often around to translate it is a little bittersweet to compete for japan because we did compete for the us for a long time , so it was a hard decision , cathy reed said but i do n't regret the decision i love skating for japan we consider ourselves japanese while her siblings excelled , allison reed stewed she wanted to be an ice dancer , too , but never found a partner to suit her so she competed solo i used to be a tiny bit jealous about how great they were skating because i was always left out , allison reed said it was always hard and a little painful to watch from the bleachers then japaridze came along he had been training at the same rink as cathy and chris when he first had a tryout with allison , who was too young and too short for him but when they reconnected last may , allison reed had grown to 5 feet 4 inches , which matched his 60 build it felt like we 've been skating together for years , japaridze said she was still so young , but was so talented right away , we knew it would work within a week , allison reed left watchung hills regional high school to train with japaridze now , she is homeschooled her first international competition was the nebelhorn trophy in germany , in which she and japaridze finished 12th to qualify for the olympics once she arrived here , she received all of her olympic gear , just as her brother and sister had she said that she received seven or eight items with the georgian olympic team logo on it her siblings , though , received two gigantic bags full of japanese team gear they had an entire extra bag full of stuff , allison reed said of course , they got more olympic gear than us , but the olympic games is the olympic games i'm proud just to be here i especially feel honored to compete in the memory of our teammate that died
all around us information seems to be multiplying at an ever increasing pace new books are published , new designs for toasters and igadgets appear , new music is composed or synthesized and , perhaps above all , new content is uploaded into cyberspace this is rather strange we know that matter and energy cannot increase but apparently information can it is perhaps rather obvious to attribute this to the evolutionary algorithm or darwinian process , as i will do , but i wish to emphasize one part of this process copying the reason information can increase like this is that , if the necessary raw materials are available , copying creates more information of course it is not new information , but if the copies vary \( which they will if only by virtue of copying errors \) , and if not all variants survive to be copied again \( which is inevitable given limited resources \) , then we have the complete threestep process of natural selection \( dennett , 1995 \) from here novel designs and truly new information emerge none of this can happen without copying i want to make three arguments here imitation is not just some new minor ability it changes everything it enables a new kind of evolution the first is that humans are unique because they are so good at imitation when our ancestors began to imitate they let loose a new evolutionary process based not on genes but on a second replicator , memes genes and memes then coevolved , transforming us into better and better meme machines  the second is that one kind of copying can piggyback on another that is , one replicator \( the information that is copied \) can build on the products \( vehicles or interactors \) of another this multilayered evolution has produced the amazing complexity of design we see all around us the third is that now , in the early 21st century , we are seeing the emergence of a third replicator i call these temes \( short for technological memes , though i have considered other names \) they are digital information stored , copied , varied and selected by machines we humans like to think we are the designers , creators and controllers of this newly emerging world but really we are stepping stones from one replicator to the next as i try to explain this i shall make some assertions and assumptions that some readers may find outrageous , but i am deliberately putting my case in its strongest form so that we can debate the issues people find most interesting or most troublesome some may entirely reject the notion of replicators , and will therefore dismiss the whole enterprise others will accept that genes are replicators but reject the idea of memes for example , eva jablonka and marion j lamb \( 2005 \) refer to the dreaded memes while peter j richerson and robert boyd \( 2005 \) , who have contributed so much to the study of cultural evolution , assert that cultural variants are not replicators they use the phrase selfish memes but still firmly reject memetics \( blackmore 2006 \) similarly , in a previous on the human post , william benzon explains why he does not like the term meme , yet he needs some term to refer to the things that evolve and so he still uses it as john s wilkins points out in response , there are several more classic objections memes are not discrete \( i would say some are not discrete \) , they do not form lineages \( some do \) , memetic evolution appears to be lamarckian \( but only appears so \) , memes are not replicated but recreated or reproduced , or are not copied with sufficient fidelity \( see discussions in aunger 2000 , sterelny 2006 , wimsatt 2010 \) i have tackled all these , and more , elsewhere and concluded that the notion is still valid \( blackmore 1999 , 2010a \) so i will press on , using the concept of memes as originally defined by dawkins who invented the term that is , memes are that which is imitated or whatever it is that is copied when people imitate each other memes include songs , stories , habits , skills , technologies , scientific theories , bogus medical treatments , financial systems , organizations everything that makes up human culture i can now , briefly , tell the story of how i think we arrived where we are today both memes and genes are vast competing sets of information , all selfishly getting copied whenever and however they can first there were genes perhaps we should not call genes the first replicator because there may have been precursors worthy of that name and possibly rna like replicators before the evolution of dna \( maynard smith and szathmary 1995 \) however , dawkins \( 1976 \) , who coined the term replicator , refers to genes this way and i shall do the same we should note here an important distinction for living things based on dna , that the genes are the replicators while the animals and plants themselves are vehicles , interactors , or phenotypes ephemeral creatures constructed with the aid of genetic information coded in tiny strands of dna packaged safely inside them whether singlecelled bacteria , great oak trees , or dogs and cats , in the genecentered view of evolution they are all gene machines or dawkins s lumbering robots the important point here is that the genetic information is faithfully copied down the generations , while the vehicles or interactors live and die without actually being copied put another way , this system copies the instructions for making a product rather than the product itself , a process that has many advantages \( blackmore 1999 , 2001 \) this interesting distinction becomes important when we move on to higher replicators so what happened next \? earth might have remained a onereplicator planet but it did not one of these gene machines , a social and bipedal ape , began to imitate we do not know why , although shifting climate may have favored stealing skills from others rather than learning them anew \( richerson and boyd 2005 \) whatever the reason , our ancestors began to copy sounds , skills and habits from one to another they passed on lighting fires , making stone tools , wearing clothes , decorating their bodies and all sorts of skills to do with living together as hunters and gatherers the critical point here is , of course , that they copied these sounds , skills and habits , and this , i suggest , is what makes humans unique no other species \( as far as we know \) can do this song birds can copy some sounds , some of the other great apes can imitate some actions , and most notably whales and dolphins can imitate , but none is capable of the widespread , generalized imitation that comes so easily to us imitation is not just some new minor ability it changes everything it enables a new kind of evolution this is why i have called humans earth s pandoran species they let loose this second replicator and began the process of memetic evolution in which memes competed to be selected by humans to be copied again the successful memes then influenced human genes by genememe coevolution \( blackmore 1999 , 2001 \) note that i see this process as somewhat different from geneculture coevolution , partly because most theorists treat culture as an adaptation \( eg richerson and boyd 2005 \) , and agree with wilson that genes keep culture on a leash \( lumsden and wilson 1981 p 13 \) benzon , in responding to peter railton s post here at the stone , points out the limits of this metaphor and proposes the chess board and game instead i prefer a simple hostparasite analogy once our ancestors could imitate they created lots of memes that competed to use their brains for their own propagation this drove these hominids to become better meme machines and to carry the \( potentially huge and even dangerous \) burden of larger brain size and energy use , eventually becoming symbiotic neither memes nor genes are a dog or a dogowner neither is on a leash they are both vast competing sets of information , all selfishly getting copied whenever and however they can to help understand the next step we can think of this process as follows one replicator \( genes \) built vehicles \( plants and animals \) for its own propagation one of these then discovered a new way of copying and diverted much of its resources to doing this instead , creating a new replicator \( memes \) which then led to new replicating machinery \( bigbrained humans \) now we can ask whether the same thing could happen again and aha we can see that it can , and is as temes proliferate , using ever more energy and resources , our own role becomes ever less significant a sticking point concerns the equivalent of the memephenotype or vehicle this has plagued memetics ever since its beginning some arguing that memes must be inside human heads while words , technologies and all the rest are their phenotypes , or phemotypes others arguing the opposite i disagree with both \( blackmore 1999 , 2001 \) by definition , whatever is copied is the meme and i suggest that , until very recently , there was no memephemotype distinction because memes were so new and so poorly replicated that they had not yet constructed stable vehicles now they have think about songs , recipes , ways of building houses or clothes fashions these can be copied and stored by voice , by gesture , in brains , or on paper with no clear replicator vehicle distinction but now consider a car factory or a printing press thousands of nearidentical copies of cars , books , or newspapers are churned out those actual cars or books are not copied again but they compete for our attention and if they prove popular then more copies are made from the same template this is much more like a replicatorvehicle system it is copy the instructions not copy the product of course cars and books are passive lumps of metal , paper and ink they cannot copy , let alone vary and select information themselves so could any of our modern meme products take the step our hominid ancestors did long ago and begin a new kind of copying \? yes they could and they are our computers , all linked up through the internet , are beginning to carry out all three of the critical processes required for a new evolutionary process to take off computers handle vast quantities of information with extraordinarily highfidelity copying and storage most variation and selection is still done by human beings , with their biologically evolved desires for stimulation , amusement , communication , sex and food but this is changing already there are examples of computer programs recombining old texts to create new essays or poems , translating texts to create new versions , and selecting between vast quantities of text , images and data above all there are search engines each request to google , alta vista or yahoo ! elicits a new set of pages a new combination of items selected by that search engine according to its own clever algorithms and depending on myriad previous searches and link structures this is a radically new kind of copying , varying and selecting , and means that a new evolutionary process is starting up this copying is quite different from the way cells copy strands of dna or humans copy memes the information itself is also different , consisting of highly stable digital information stored and processed by machines rather than living cells this , i submit , signals the emergence of temes and teme machines , the third replicator what should we expect of this dramatic step \? it might make as much difference as the advent of human imitation did just as human meme machines spread over the planet , using up its resources and altering its ecosystems to suit their own needs , so the new teme machines will do the same , only faster indeed we might see our current ecological troubles not as primarily our fault , but as the inevitable consequence of earth s transition to being a threereplicator planet we willingly provide ever more energy to power the internet , and there is enormous scope for teme machines to grow , evolve and create ever more extraordinary digital worlds , some aided by humans and others independent of them we are still needed , not least to run the power stations , but as the temes proliferate , using ever more energy and resources , our own role becomes ever less significant , even though we set the whole new evolutionary process in motion in the first place whether you consider this a tragedy for the planet or a marvelous , beautiful story of creation , is up to you \( susan blackmore s essay is the subject of among the humanists and

two words for cubs manager be careful you do n't want to pick a fight you ca n't win in going after steve stone , the white sox s broadcaster , before game 1 of the city series last week , piniella was taking on the city s most influential baseball thinker he was sputtering mad as he began a tirade against stone over stone s assertion that piniella was mishandling the rookie outfielder tyler colvin piniella called it criticism and questioned \( loudly \) stone s credibility as a source for it , saying that stone no longer calls cubs games and does n't see enough of the team to have an informed point of view stone , mildly amused , said it was an observance , offered within the purview of his role as a baseball analyst for various news media outlets stone is in his third season as a white sox broadcaster after 20 years with the cubs fans of both teams revere him for his knowledge , his insight and his opinions , while those whose work he is analyzing tend to be less enamored he might well be more popular than the teams he is covering , as the cubs learned when he departed their tv booth following the 2004 season , after he was made to feel unwelcome by testy players and staff members for mercilessly dissecting their plunge from wildcard contention over the final 10 days of the season dusty baker , the manager at the time , was still miffed by criticism of his handling of his bullpen in the '03 playoffs he was not a stone fan and was viewed as an enabler of the players' hostility toward the broadcaster baker lasted two more years in chicago , but it was never the same for him , and it might not have been for the cubs if they had n't come up with bob brenly as a capable replacement for stone brenly can be just as blunt , but is more goodnatured about it piniella s wrath obscured his reasoning when he said stone had never done anything in baseball besides talk about it stone has n't been a pitching coach , or a farm director , and none of those ownership groups he was reportedly a part of ever coalesced and bought a team but he was a thinkingman s pitcher for 11 years , including stints with the cubs and the white sox and a cy young award season with baltimore in 1980 he has been a thinkingman s analyst for twice that long he does his homework , and he talks to people his opinions are smart , credible and informed it s how he delivers them that can be grating no one disputes that stone is a very bright guy , in his own mind the brightest guy in most any room he enters that means he has the sharpest insights and most valid opinions , at least in his view some people who have dealt with him find this selfassurance rather irksome and condescending the white sox said they were delighted with the stoneken harrelson pairing in their tv booth the hawk has been calling games longer than stone has , and he is every bit as opinionated thus they occasionally talk on parallel tracks rather than converse , but viewers seem to embrace it stone also is a regular contributor to wscr670 am talk shows he discusses his former team as much as his current one and sometimes seems to delight in the cubs' struggles , as if he is still bitter over what happened in 2004 but listeners love it as well a producer said the station could never accommodate all the callers who wanted to get on with stone during his segments joe morgan brings his own knowitall certitude and a hall of fame ego to the espn booth , but he said he had never had an incident comparable to stone s with piniella you have to have strong , smart opinions to do this job or else they would n't need you they could get anybody to do it , morgan said but there are ways to do it and not offend people i do n't think i ever sound like i want to manage somebody s team , because i do n't ozzie guillen , the sox manager , has no problems with stone never , he said he says what he has to say everybody has an opinion in baseball everybody it s one of the great things about this game if you 're a manager , you 're going to hear them stone , i think , is as good as it gets on baseball i always feel i 've learned something from his broadcasts , whether he s predicting the outcome of an atbat , making chip caray sound tolerable in the cubs booth or playing droll straight man to chip s bombastic grandfather stone s response to one longago harry caray rant about latino players being notoriously freeswingers was classic nobody walks off the island , harry he knows he s good , too a few years back , i was working on a story about kerry wood , and i approached stone for his thoughts on the injuryplagued marvel , who had become a disabledlist fixture since striking out 20 batters in his fifth bigleague start as a 20yearold i wonder if i might ask a few questions of america s foremost authority on pitching , i said thank you very much , stone replied i still do n't know if he was kidding i do know he s going to be around here long after lou piniella is gone
paris a russian warship was steaming toward an tanker that was hijacked at dawn with 23 russian crew members aboard 350 miles off the coast of yemen , the european antipiracy naval force said wednesday the tanker had been on its way from sudan to china with a valuable cargo of crude oil its seizure seemed a setback for the european naval force , which has recently been claiming successes for a new strategy to intercept pirate vessels far out at sea before they attack shipping lines in a , the britishbased force , which is made up of units from nine countries , said the 106 , 474ton tanker was heading east into the indian ocean when it was seized the ship , carrying 86 , 000 tons of crude oil , was flying the liberian flag but was operated by a russian company with an allrussian crew the cargo was worth an estimated 52 million according to the master , a group of people armed with automatic weapons opened fire and tried to board the vessel using two speedboats , the novorossiysk shipping company said the master of moscow university established contact with the russianflag warship marshal shaposhnikov which is currently proceeding to the vessel s position a later account from the shipping company said the company suspects the managed to board the tanker according to the latest information received from the master none of the 23 seafarers on board have been hurt , the vessel and the cargo sustained no damage the european naval force said that the vessel s crew had not been harmed and that it is understood that a russian warship is heading towards the hijacked position reuters quoted a pirate identified only as abdi as warning against any rescue attempt as the tanker sailed towards the somali coast any attempt to rescue the ship will certainly endanger the crew , the pirate said there was no immediate word on demands for a ransom the usual price exacted by pirates in return for freeing crews and vessels , particularly oil tankers with valuable cargoes piracy has flourished in somalia as the country has descended into chaos , penury and conflict between a weak united statesbacked government and radical islamist groups seeking its ouster the threat became more complex last weekend when radical islamist insurgents , one of the country s bestknown pirate havens , raising a possibility that militants with links to al qaeda could threaten the sea lanes and tap into the lucrative business of holding ships to ransom according to maritime experts , ship owners have paid somnali pirates more than 100 million in ransom in recent years a vast sum in a land of such grinding poverty the potential rich pickings have encouraged pirates to prey on vessels in the busy gulf of aden and prowl up to 1 , 200 miles offshore in recent weeks , the european force has made public in which warships thwarted pirates either before or during attacks on may 4 , the force said , a greek warship , the elli , closed on a highspeed skiff with seven people aboard 50 miles south of mukalla in yemen when the skiff refused to stop , elli used her main gun which had the effect of stopping the skiff and the persons on board surrendered earlier , the naval force reported that two french warships , the tonnerre and the lafayette , destroyed mother ships used by pirates to refuel far from their home base usually in somalia after spotting them far from land in the indian ocean but those clashes did not seem to deter other wouldbe attackers in a separate statement on wednesday , the european force said a 39 , 833ton south korean vessel , , came under attack by somali pirates 200 miles northwest of the comoros islands but the crew managed to evade the attack and all personnel are reported to be well , the force said according to news reports , somali pirates are currently holding almost 20 vessels and about 300 crew members seized in recent months
some congressional democrats are growing increasingly nervous that the white house will give in to republican demands for a temporary extension of all of the bushera tax cuts without getting enough in return top obama administration officials , including treasury secretary timothy f geithner , met with bipartisan negotiators from both the house and senate for two rounds of talks on wednesday some democrats are now predicting an announcement of a tax deal by sunday or monday between now and then , democrats will scramble to hold a series of symbolic votes aimed at showing republicans defending lower taxes for millionaires the first of those votes is expected to take place today in the house republicans view an extension of the lower rates for everyone , for two years or more , as inevitable as a result of their big victories in the midterm elections and what in hindsight are clear strategic missteps by democrats in letting the debate come down to the wire if congress does not act by the end of the year , all of the tax rates expire for everyone many democrats , however , had been hopeful of getting republicans to agree to at least some of their priorities in return in particular , they want to extend unemployment benefits for millions of jobless americans whose aid is starting to run out at the top of the white house wish list is that senate republicans vote to ratify the new start arms control treaty with russia from one end of pennsylvania avenue to the other , officials will insist that none of these issues necessarily has anything to do with one another and yet when it comes to congress , everything is connected if nothing else than by the limited number of hours in the day and days in the week that lawmakers have to work on wednesday , the senate republicans made that clear by threatening to stop all business on the senate floor until the tax debate was resolved and a deal was reached on a temporary spending measure to finance the government that gave democrats a stark choice cave quickly on the tax issue or face the prospect of accomplishing nothing else between now and the end of the year when they lose their majority in the house and their numbers shrink by five in the senate the tax fight , however , is far more complicated than many people realize nearly all of the attention has been focused on the marginal income tax rates , and the debate over president obama s campaign promise to let the lower rates expire on income above 250 , 000 a year for couples or 200 , 000 for individuals but there are a dizzying array of other tax issues to be dealt with , including the estate tax , which republicans want to eliminate entirely , and taxes on dividends and income when the republican senate leader , mitch mcconnell of kentucky , tapped his no 2 , senator jon kyl of arizona , as the lead negotiator in the tax talks , some democrats and republicans noted that mr kyl has been the leading republican voice on the new start treaty , and wondered if a deal might be in the works in making his pick , mr mcconnell bypassed senator charles e grassley of iowa , the senior republican on the taxwriting finance committee , and senator orrin hatch of utah , who will take over that slot in january the majority leader , harry reid of nevada , by contrast , chose the chairman of the finance panel , senator max baucus of montana , not senator charles e schumer of new york , who has emerged as his top political lieutenant but mr kyl , who serves on the finance committee , has also been a leading voice in debates on the estate tax permanently eliminating that levy , which republicans derisively refer to as the death tax , is nearly as important to them as preserving the lower marginal rates for the highest earners his designation as the lead senate republican negotiator in many ways simply indicated that while death and taxes may be a certainty , in the view of ascendant republicans , the existence of any death tax at all may be one of the few points left to negotiate
there could be the commissioner s party at the american museum of natural history and another party with a view of the statue of liberty from liberty state park maybe a breakfast at tiffany company for team owners and their families perhaps even a float in the macy s thanksgiving day parade the bid to host the 2014 super bowl at new meadowlands stadium , portions of which were obtained by the new york times in advance of its wednesday unveiling , dresses the super bowl in a giant i love new york tshirt , spinning even the prospect of bad weather as a chance to go old school and embrace a link to some of the s storied coldweather games yet for all the spectacular possibilities proposed , the mundane realities of dealing with winter are likely to dominate the conversation about the bid the plan includes elaborate contingencies for super bowl week , everything from providing hand warmers to fans at the game to having hundreds of people standing by with shovels to dig out the stadium no wonder the proposal calls other public spectacles that have played out in the area , like papal masses , practice for the super bowl the focus was on those things that only this community and this stadium can provide , said one bid official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans were not final a super bowl bid is a document of eyeblurring detail it covers a description of the stadium seating \( 19 inches wide and plastic , except for the padded club and suite seats \) , the availability of 1 , 000 taxis \( no problem , although it also notes the owners can land at two helipads at the stadium \) , which three golf courses are recommended \( none , because they are closed in february \) and whether bowling is an option \( it is \) there are sections about the necessity of police escorts for taking the teams to practice , the news media to interview sessions and the officials to the game , and where there is space to rehearse the halftime show \( rutgers university \) the host committee , enamored of compact super bowl locations like new orleans , has put nearly all major events and sites in midtown and in the area around the meadowlands and the bid encourages the use of public transportation , noting that the yards from the stadium entrance can move 10 , 000 fans per hour from penn station to the stadium that s about the fear of the unknown we wanted to feature that so we could try to address what some people have in the back of their mind , that s it s going to be impossible to get around new york , the bid official said owners will award the 2014 super bowl at a meeting may 24 , and the new york new jersey bid is the favorite to prevail over tampa and south florida , two traditional hosts in recent years , the nfl has used the super bowl as a carrot for communities to contribute to the construction of new stadiums among owners , this is viewed as an opportunity to reward the giants and the jets , and the area , for building a billiondollarplus stadium still , there is no escaping the snowplow in the room the weather gives many owners pause , presenting the bid s most significant hurdle and producing incredulity among some fans who imagine sitting outdoors the nfl has put super bowls in cold climates before , but those stadiums had roofs the does not in the bid materials , the average high temperature in february is listed as 40 degrees with an average low of 241 degrees , and average precipitation of 27 inches some team owners and commissioner roger goodell have little problem with the game being played in the elements , pointing to memorable games the ice bowl , for one robert k kraft , the new england patriots' owner , whose team played one of its most important games in snowglobe conditions the tuck rule playoff victory over the raiders said playoff games in frigid foxborough were the franchise s most memorable the atlanta falcons owner arthur blank said he was not concerned with game conditions it s going to be cold and what you hope for is that the worst it will be is snow , blank said in a telephone interview snow , cold players have done that their whole lives to fans , it s a different experience you have to ask yourself , are people going to come for three or four or five days and deal with the elements \? are people prepared to come to new york and deal with cold weather \? without a super bowl , they do it now the bid tries to make the best of the weather playing the game in a cold weather outdoor setting will add yet another element of intrigue , it reads the game will take on the old school' feel of the great outdoor contests of the past , yet it will be played in one of the league s most technologically advanced stadiums the committee is prepared for the worst , though the teams , which will practice at the giants' and the jets' new facilities in new jersey , which both have indoor fields , will stay at hotels within a few miles of the sites the bid is built on having up to 800 people with shovels ready to clear the stadium , although more could be added if needed part of the bid calls for covering some of the openings in the stadium to cut down on the wind and for using heaters to warm the concourses there will be seat and hand warmers and perhaps fire pits in the parking lots before the game we 're really trying to embrace the weather and make it more of a communal experience , the bid official said that may be a tough sell to even the most enthusiastic owners but the appeal of putting the league s showcase event in the world s news media and business capital is obvious the bid also says that 36 percent of the 20 million people who live in the region were born outside the united states , a boon for a league with ambitious goals to increase the game s popularity there is little doubt that staging a super bowl in the new york region will be more expensive than anywhere else , said robert baade , an economics professor at lake forest college the host committee is responsible for raising 40 million toward the cost while the host committee estimates a gain for the region of 550 million , other estimates vary widely baade said the region might benefit more than warmweather cities because february is not a traditionally touristheavy month in new york but he said conventions and residents could stay away for fear of super bowl crowds baade estimates that the region might realize just a 55 million uptick the biggest beneficiary of any bid , baade said , is the nfl the owners , after all , are the host committee s most important constituency with south florida needing stadium renovations , the race for the 2014 game is between tampa and new york for some owners , though , the bid needs little selling come on , kraft said in march it s new york

the have all kinds of reasons to be nervous going into game 3 of the stanley cup finals wednesday in philadelphia , and all kinds of reasons to be confident they lost the first two games of the series to the , but narrowly and on the road both recent history and distant history suggest that the flyers can readily climb back or that the blackhawks could let their 20 lead slip through their fingers if you 're asking if this team can overcome obstacles or overcome adversity , we 're so far beyond that , coach peter laviolette told reporters in philadelphia on tuesday , noting that at one point this season the flyers were 29th over all in the nhl standings i do n't think you get to this point in the season where you 're 29th at christmas and not be able to overcome adversity , he said , ticking off the flyers' high points their playoff qualification on the regular season s last shot their rally from a threegamestonone deficit against the boston bruins in the second round of the playoffs and their bounceback from seasonlong injury epidemics this team is capable , laviolette said i'm 100 percent confident that this team is capable the flyers take heart in the closeness of the first two games of pond hockey saturday and that required a superb thirdperiod performance by chicago goalie antti niemi to stave off a philadelphia onslaught we 're still feeling good about it , said flyers forward danny briere , who , like laviolette , said the flyers outchanced the blackhawks in obviously , we would rather be up 20 or even 11 , but we 've been in the same situation before , and we believe we can come back we believe in our team that is the optimism part , but there is also cause for nervousness the blackhawks , for example , are working on a sevengame road winning streak there is also evidence that laviolette has been outcoached by the blackhawks' joel quenneville one reason for chicago s game 2 victory was a brilliant stroke of intuition from quenneville on the faceoff immediately after marian hossa s goal , which gave the hawks a 10 lead late in the second period quenneville , counterintuitively , put the big fourthline wing ben eager out on the first line alongside jonathan toews and dustin byfuglien the lowscoring eager , skating in place of the glamorous but undersize sniper patrick kane , struck for what turned out to be 28 seconds later quenneville said after the game that eager is strong on the forecheck , and hopefully he creates a little bit of space quenneville s brief but effective firstline adjustment stood in contrast with laviolette s firstline tinkering , which did not work at all he dressed dan carcillo to skate on the flyers' first line alongside mike richards and jeff carter in game 2 , and although carcillo , nicknamed car bomb , certainly stirred things up physically , the flyers got off only three shots in the first period carcillo was dropped to the third line for the rest of the game \( perhaps his accidental flattening of carter had something to do with it \) , and with simon gagne back in his accustomed place on the top line , the flyers' offense improved in the third period gagne scored the flyers' only goal , which raises the question of how well they might have done if gagne had played the whole game on the first line these are reasons for the flyers to be nervous but there are reasons for the blackhawks to be nervous after , in the words of chicago s dave bolland , stealing the first two games chicago is the 34th team to win the first two games of a bestofseven stanley cup finals at home of the 33 previous teams to do so , 31 went on to win the cup but the two teams that failed were last year s red wings and the 1971 blackhawks after blowing their twogamestonone advantage , the '71 blackhawks held a 20 lead halfway through game 7 at a humid chicago stadium fog rising from the ice caused goalie tony esposito to lose jacques lemaire s routine slap shot from the red line , and the montreal canadiens rallied to win , 32 , a result that still haunts chicago hockey fans then there is the intimation of bad luck for the blackhawks , who have lost five straight cup finals since winning in 1961 on sunday evening kane and his family , who are from buffalo , ate dinner at a chicago restaurant also at the restaurant , according to the chicago tribune , was the former buffalo bills coach marv levy , who went over to kane s table to wish him well levy , of course , was the bills' coach when they lost four straight super bowls
miami gardens , fla at pierre garcon s feet tuesday sat a cooler containing six bottles of gatorade , an nfl sponsor arranged on the round table in front of him was a gatorade tea towel , another bottle of gatorade and the official reebok xliv baseball cap , its bill pointing toward the cameras so the game logo was in clear view the commercialization of professional football s biggest game was in full bloom during media day , but garcon , a secondyear receiver with the , did his part to shift the focus to compassion he sat down to face a scrum of reporters holding a small cloth flag of haiti , his parents' homeland , from which he fashioned a bandanna i hope i do n't get fined for it , garcon said as he tightened the knot and adjusted the cloth on his forehead at the beginning of the season , it was easy to overlook garcon , a former division iii player stuck behind another young receiver , anthony gonzalez , on the colts' depth chart after gonzalez was lost for the season with an injury in the opening game , garcon , 23 , stepped in and made 47 catches , including four for touchdowns four indianapolis players had more regularseason receptions than garcon , but none commanded more attention before the colts met the baltimore ravens in the playoffs on jan 16 four days before the game , a 70 magnitude struck haiti , leveling much of the capital , portauprince , and resulting in an estimated 200 , 000 deaths as one of a few haitianamericans in the nfl , garcon , who was born in new york and raised in south florida , stepped to the fore he teamed with the northwest haiti christian mission to raise money for earthquake relief the goal to raise 150 , 000 and provide more than 500 , 000 meals i felt like i had to represent haiti , garcon said there are people out there trapped and dying as we speak , children with legs being amputated i had to play for them garcon has been a revelation in the postseason he made five catches in a victory against the ravens and an american football conference championship gamerecord 11 receptions in the colts' win against the jets , after which he exuberantly wrapped the afc championship trophy in the haitian flag garcon s flags to riches story won him a cluster of new fans , and not just in indianapolis in little haiti , an area of miami not far from sun life stadium , where sunday s game against the new orleans saints will be played , drugs are rampant and a serial arsonist is on the loose it can be a bleak place even on the sunniest day , but when garcon waved the flag after the afc championship game , he sent a refreshing breeze through the streets at chef creole , a corner restaurant famous for its shrimp creole and conch fritters , the mention of garcon s name prompted a patron , franklin monge , to kiss the tips of his fingers he s a nice guy , and what he s doing is good for the country , monge said vermet sejour , the restaurant s manager , was born in haiti but has lived in south florida since 1996 he lost two younger brothers and a younger sister all in their 20s in the earthquake sejour said his sister sustained internal injuries and died last week after being transported to the dominican republic for treatment her funeral is saturday it hurts , he said , but i have to be here i have to be strong sejour will take time off from work sunday to attend the game , having been able to trade on the restaurant s renown to procure a ticket following garcon s lead , he will carry a haitian flag into the stadium after feasting on creole barbecue at a tailgate party because of garcon , sejour will be rooting for the colts he s waving the haitian flag , and right now that s all we 've got , sejour said , adding , he s showing all the haitians , look , i know where i came from' at the atlantis barber shop in the heart of little haiti , the owner , jean calixte , leaned back in one of his chairs and said he had never heard of garcon before last month i do n't know nothing about him , but i 've seen him on tv , calixte said intrigued by the prospect of a haitianamerican performing well on the national stage , calixte watched the afc title game to me , he seemed like he win for the country of haiti , calixte said , adding we are miami dolphins fans , but now we have a reason to watch the super bowl since garcon is a member of the colts and he s a haitian , i think most of us are going to cheer for the colts now to cheer for him is like cheering for haiti there are roughly 250 , 000 people of haitian descent in south florida garcon , who grew up in west palm beach , used to accompany his mother when she made on the 75minute drive to little haiti to shop for groceries if garcon were to walk into his shop this week , calixte said , he would cut his hair at no charge if i have an opportunity just to shake his hand , it would be my honor , calixte said in a little over a year s time , garcon has gone from a practicesquad player to a marquee name in the super bowl he attributes his success to hard work and perseverance i'm trying to give them a little bit of hope , garcon said it s a hard time people need it i'm trying to do something positive for our community there s a lot of bad aspects of being haitian , so trying to do something to let people know that we care and let kids know that they can be anybody they want to be his message is simple if he can realize his dreams , anybody can you do n't have to be from the biggest country , garcon said you do n't have to be from the best place you just have to work towards your goals and stay focused perseverance takes you a long way dogged determination and an influx of new blood carried the saints and their city from the depths of despair after to the class of the national football conference what new orleans went through is kind of like what haiti s going through right now with the earthquake , garcon said saints linebacker jonathan vilma has relatives who live in haiti and his parents are from there he is selling a department of domeland defense tshirt that he designed , with proceeds going to the haitian relief effort vilma was moved nearly to tears when he saw highlights of garcon parading the flag around lucas oil stadium as if it were the afc trophy itself that was very moving , very touching , vilma said there are not many times i get emotional watching football but i got emotional when i saw that it gives garcon pause to consider how different his life might be if his parents had not moved to the united states in search of a better life for their children if he had listened to people who said he was n't good enough to play in the nfl if gonzalez had not been injured i'm glad to be here , he said a few minutes later , garcon stepped off the podium , leaving behind the baseball cap , the tea towel and the cooler of drinks
