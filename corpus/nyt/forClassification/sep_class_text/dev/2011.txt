say what you will about michele bachmann , she s not mediashy nor is she particularly hesitant about stating her beliefs and judging from the level of coverage she has received since announcing her candidacy for president on the republican ticket , the media is quite interested in her every public move a moment captured by the times s jeff zeleny in iowa this week seemed to confirm this newt and callista gingrich were standing on a street corner , an aide snapping pictures , as they waited for yet another campaign day to begin , zeleny wrote a swarm of photographers gathered a block away to capture the arrival of michele bachmann \( the reason for all this attention \? a top adviser to bachmann s fellow candidate tim pawlenty offered an explanation , but if you re a public official , i suggest choosing a theory you don t have to immediately retract \) bachmann s latest attentiongetting move came thursday when she became the first and thus far only candidate to sign a pledge drawn up by a christian conservative group in iowa the pledge , called the marriage vow a declaration of dependence upon marriage and family , requires signers to promise , among other things , to keep marital fidelity , support the defense of marriage act and robust childbearing and reproduction , and oppose gay marriage , abortion , sharia islam , intrusively intimate commingling among attracteds in the military , and the abuse of women and children through human trafficking , pornography and prostitution the group , called the family leader , run by bob vander plaats , a former iowa gubernatorial candidate and influential conservative , promises to withhold political support from any candidate who does not sign \( as always , we suggest you read the document itself the group s pledge and accompanying notes can be found here in pdf form \) so with a possible presidency on the line , why sign onto an ideological script penned by others \? at huffington post last week jason linkins and elyse siegel noted the trend yep , pledges and litmus tests are all the rage in politics at the moment sign on and you ve maybe started down the path to securing an important endorsement beg off , and you re likely to draw fierce criticism if not from the field itself , then certainly from the sidelines and if you get on the wrong side of someone who s significant to an early contest , you might be kissing your chances in that contest goodbye well , that explains it thinkprogress had the distinction of getting out in front thursday night with a post on bachmann s signing of the pledge , with a headline and blurb that quickly went viral bachmann pledges to ban pornography  the very notion of banning pornography apparently inflamed a heck of a lot of leftleaning bloggers who knew \? evidenced by the slew of outraged commentary that followed and it is a grabby banner , isn t it \? problem is , technically , it s not true the vow does not explicitly call for a ban on pornography a blogger called ampersand at atlas ! points out the error  i m already seeing this quoted around the blogosphere and on twitter but it s wrong you can read the full text of the pledge it s full of all sorts of extreme , sexist , homophobic , racist garbage , allegedly for the purpose of protecting marriage but it doesn t call for a blanket ban on pornography here s the relevant passage , in which the candidate vows humane protection of women and the innocent fruit of conjugal intimacy our next generation of american children from human trafficking , sexual slavery , seduction into promiscuity , and all forms of pornography and prostitution , infanticide , abortion and other types of coercion or stolen innocence a footnote then explains human trafficking , child pornography and prostitution , pimping , sexual slavery and forced abortion are inherently coercive of vulnerable females infanticide and abortion are inherently coercive of the babies who are killed unless i ve missed something , that s all the document says about pornography the ban assertion was repeated elsewhere , including at a washington post blog justin elliott at salon was a bit more forgiving when he wrote that the pledge includes a reference to protecting children from all forms of pornography that could arguably be read as an endorsement of a porn ban but sister toldjah , a selfdescribed conservative southern belle thinks the error is part of trend of irresponsibility and bias in which the msm actively inserts itself into the public debate over various hot button issues with emotionbased reporting that routinely ignores or paints in a negative light the other side of a given argument and she is clearly having none of it  i know there are people who have issues with michele bachmann , primarily due to her stance on social issues like gay marriage and abortion i understand that and can respect those disagreements but what i will not respect nor tolerate is when mainstream media outlets accept without question the bogus reporting done by prominent liberal blogs and websites , which is clearly what has happened here as a result , their lack of reading the actual document itself and instead relying on a liberal blog whose reputation is questionable at best has poisoned the information stream that average joes who do not follow politics like you and i do rely on to help them form opinions on both issues and candidates this is unacceptable later on at thinkprogress alyssa rosenberg avoids making the ban assertion , but thinks bachmann s signing of a pledge that includes pornography among a list of outright crimes suggests a possible slippery patch on the first amendment slope equating pornography with human trafficking , prostitution , or infanticide suggests that bachmann doesn t know very much about any of those things , or much about the sex lives of actual americans \( particularly those she claims to represent \) and if bachmann interpreted that pledge as a mandate to seek a governmental ban of pornography and pornography broadly defined \( rather than , you know , folks doing the work to keep kids away from material they don t want them to access \) , it would be a demonstration of what startlingly low value bachmann places on the first amendment all forms of pornography can be interpreted to include a lot of art and popular culture none of this is surprising , i think , but it s not minor and it merits pointing out and pushing back against but enough pornography many found much else to fume about in the content of the pledge of particular note was this passage , featured at the very top of the document slavery had a disastrous impact on africanamerican families , yet sadly a child born into slavery in 1860 was more likely to be raised by his mother and father in a twoparent household than was an african american baby born after the election of the usa s first africanamerican president this did not escape the attention or wrath of cheryl contee , a k a jill tubman , at jack and jill politics , who wrote given that families were broken up regularly for sales during slavery and that rape by masters was pretty common , this could not be more offensive i mean , putting aside the statistics on this , which are likely offbase , i could not be more angry when will republicans inquire with actual black people whether or not we re ok with invoking slavery to score cheap political points \? it has to stop it is the opposite of persuasive and is another reason republicans repel us it s hard to believe that michele bachmann would be foolish enough to sign this pledge tommy christopher at mediaite espied devious intent , or at least less than rigorous research , in the direct reference the president obama to be fair , the marriage vow doesn t appear to be arguing that slavery was good \( hey , they said it was disastrous \) , but rather , that barack obama is worse than slavery that s a key difference that needs to be highlighted besides , they used a footnote to a study by black scholars , so shouldn t jill just relax a little \? for my money , this is where the story gets really disgusting the study that they cite was published in 2005 , which means that any comparison to slavery must be made , not with our first black president , but with our 43rd white one furthermore , the data in the study only dates back to 1880 , which means they not only had to stretch their pretzel to include barack obama , but also to conflate the data with slavery mark kleiman a the realitybased community singles out the religious angle for questioning sharia islam is an interesting phrase they re not talking about the imposition of sharia law through civil legislation they believe in letting religion dictate public policy , but only fundamentalist protestantism the statement seems to imply that there s some form of islam not involving sharia and therefore tolerable , but that sharia islam is a form of totalitarian control now , sharia is simply the legal aspect of islam , as halacha is the legal aspect of judaism both , of course , are fiercely contested within the two traditions , but there is no more an islam without sharia than there is a judaism without halacha so the candidates are being asked to vow hostility to an entire faith tradition andrew belonsky at towleroad saw danger in a passage in the document s notes asserting that marriage has been debased in part by antiscientific bias , in the complete absence of empirical proof , that nonheterosexual inclinations are genetically determined , irresistible and akin to innate traits like race , gender and eye color belonsky wrote i sincerely hope that the mainstream media takes her to task on this one , because the choice debate is one of the most dangerous and incendiary weapons in the rightwing arsenal , and can be used to justify all sorts of discriminatory measures but remember , this was supposed to be about marriage and family , of which , the pledge asserts , fidelity is an indispensable part \( yes , dan savage would beg to differ \) to that end , michelle goldberg at the daily beast points out some possible knotty implications for other republicans who may be weighing the tactical pros and cons of following bachmann s lead it will be curious to see how other candidates respond the thricewed newt gingrich is in a bind to sign a document pledging personal fidelity to my spouse and r espect for the marital bonds of others would highlight his hypocrisy , but so would not signing tim pawlenty , too , is in a tough spot he needs to do well in iowa , but promising such farreaching intrusion into americans private lives probably wouldn t help him in a general election among the religious right , combining economic libertarianism with social authoritarianism seems natural , because the movement holds that only a society run according to a strict christian morality can properly govern itself and avoid the crushing imposition of socialism to much of the country , though , the idea of defending what the pledge calls our exceptional and free society by limiting citizens freedoms might not make quite as much sense there s a lot of anger sloshing about , maybe rightly so , but is there anything funny about this \? well , maybe not , but this post , sarah moricebrubaker , a guest blogger at religion dispatches magazine , greets the pledge s emphasis on robust childrearing and reproduction with a sense of humor  for too long , childrearing and reproduction has been allowed to be an exhausting , sleepdepriving business not without its blessings , to be sure , but one could hardly call it robust in my own experience , the addition of newborns to our household resulted in a marked decrease of robustness , from which none of the adults have recovered the children , meanwhile , keep getting robuster and robuster and that is , quite frankly , bad planning granted , the pledge does not spell out how childrearing will become a robust enterprise , but i can only imagine that it will involve things like long morning constitutionals for all parents deep breaths of good country air meals of dark bread from the old country and pints of guinness slow knee bends trips to the seashore , and mineral tonic this is all to the good , surely finally , greg sargent at the plum line attempted to put the whole matter in perspective , and issues a warning of sorts expect lots more of this the real question is what bachmann \( and cain , and santorum \) wouldn t sign if asked by social conservatives and what , if anything , mitt romney , or tim pawlenty , or rick perry would actually oppose as too extreme the answer appears to be nothing it s true that bachmann is the only one to make this vow so far but it s early yet it s probably worth noting that the gop is far , far , from the mainstream on these issues it s fairly well known that pluralities have now swung over to approval for samesex marriage , but that one is still contested , so i wouldn t call bachmann and friends out of the mainstream on that one but on the rest well , people seem to support women in combat overwhelmingly , for example and while i m not sure how they feel about intrusively intimate commingling among attracteds , i m fairly confident that no one is going to run for president on an antismut platform in hopes of winning swing voters reminder we still have months remaining for the candidates to bid against each other for the support of these folks this is only going to get more extreme and more crazy more crazy , yes that s a promise
when adrienne jarocki arrived at the on thursday , it appeared as if she had walked through the wrong door i'm not sure what a fencer is or is n't supposed to look like , but most people who meet me say i do n't look like one , said the 5foot11 jarocki , a former beauty pageant queen and champion ballroom dancer from middle village , queens , who attends the bronx high school of science jarocki , 16 , the only child of polish immigrants , began competing on a new stage two years ago , leaving behind a world of tiaras and strobe lights for a mask and saber last month , she made her first real mark on the fencing world , finishing fifth at the gevhuniber cup in godollo , hungary the competition , considered one of the toughest in the world , featured 140 girls from 18 countries , including a dozen other americans who finished behind jarocki for adrienne to have come so far in such a short amount of time is astonishing , said her coach , jason sheridan , who owns the upper east side academy that bears his name a lot of her unusually quick success can be attributed to her background in pageants and dancing when she started fencing , she was already confident and poised , she knew how to handle pressure , and all of that training greatly improved her coordination , balance , strength and stamina like an experienced athlete , she already knew how to move extremely well he added i 've coached a lot of kids who have received top ratings , but none of them have been this successful in such a short amount of time nobody makes that kind of jump jarocki has been a champion in other pursuits in 2007 , she was named model of the year \( for 12yearolds \) by the international model talent association in new york in 2008 , she was crowned miss new york preteen , and that year she and her ballroom partner , dominick kaczor , defeated 14 other couples to finish first in the under13 category at the usa dance national dancesport championships in baltimore by the next year , jarocki had outgrown kaczor by several inches , and had outgrown her interest in dancing altogether ballroom dancing , which basically involves the same 10 routines you are trying to perfect , over and over again , became too predictable , she said it s like being a part of a ballet or an opera fencing is the exact opposite it is completely unpredictable as a fencer , you 're always thinking , you 're always trying to stay one step ahead of your opponent , and the best part is that it is an individual sport , so i do n't have to rely on a partner to succeed that s what i needed , something less predictable and more competitive it was in march 2009 that she discovered fencing her mother , anna jarocki , was flipping through the pages of a polish newspaper and found an advertisement placed by the , which has sites in greenpoint , brooklyn , and linden , nj i told my daughter why not give this a try \? it s something different , something challenging , ' anna jarocki said she had been ballroom dancing since she was 5 and now she needed something else to push her i said , fencing is a physical sport , but it s also a sport that requires a lot of intelligence' jarocki began going to the fencing school , splitting her workouts at the two locations for three months before starting at the sheridan fencing academy , where she now trains three hours a day , five days a week when adrienne joined our team , you could tell almost immediately that she had a gift for fencing and that she would do really well , said cordelia avery , a 16yearold student at the dalton school in manhattan who is ranked 16th in the country by the united states fencing association she s gotten so much better in such a short period of time , and that is the result of a lot of hard work jarocki , who takes the subway to practice every day after school her mother drives her home every night made her first international appearance in september , finishing 54th among 140 participants in the european cadet circuit in konin , poland after her eyeopening fifthplace finish in hungary , jarocki earned a bronze medal in october at the north american cup in richmond , va , and now finds herself ranked 10th among cadets , or fencers under 17 , by the united states association there s two things going on here , anna jarocki said jason sheridan is a great teacher , and my daughter is a great student jarocki hoped to improve on her overall ranking this weekend at the north american cup in austin , tex she took gold friday in the cadet group , with the junior event , for those under 20 , on sunday there will be 150 girls in the tournament , jarocki said the week before traveling to texas , and if i can finish anywhere in the top eight , my ranking should improve i think i have a good chance of accomplishing that jarocki , who speaks polish , french and japanese and maintains a 945 average i think i want to be a scientist , or maybe a polish diplomat , she said hopes to attend an ivy league college with a fencing program i do n't know how far this sport is going to take me , she said , but i just want to make sure i finish college first in the meantime , jarocki hopes to make the united states junior world team by february 2013 , which would place her among the top three female fencers in the country she hopes that by the time she is a sophomore in college , she will earn a spot on the senior world team , which could put her on an early track to olympic competition the olympic games are certainly within her reach , sheridan said while 2012 is certainly too soon , 2016 and 2020 are certainly possible it s really just a matter of motivation and dedication , and adrienne can go as far as she wants jarocki , who recently finished doing work for mmg , a modeling agency in new york , has not yet given up on the beauty pageant circuit this summer , she will throw her tiara back in the ring at the miss teen new york pageant i was a beauty queen turned fencer , jarocki said , smiling now i have an even greater competitive edge , and i want to be a fencer turned beauty queen
london for five months the stories poured out into the courtroom , describing the worst and best of human behavior stories of bystanders fighting their way into mangled , pitchblack subway cars and refusing to leave passengers whose lives were slipping away stories of body parts strewn in the rubble of a slicedopen bus stories of grievously wounded people who somehow cheated death because of resilience , luck and the extraordinary efforts of strangers and the story , too , of how four british men of pakistani descent committed one of the worst acts of terrorism in british history on july 7 , 2005 , setting off four bombs in london s transportation network that killed 56 people , including themselves , and wounded at least 700 more nearly six years later , after a highly unusual inquest in which the final moments of each of the 52 victims' lives unfolded in detail in a courtroom here , the coroner in the case made her ruling unlawful killing it was a foregone conclusion , as , in a way , was her other finding that the evidence i have heard does not justify the conclusion that any failings on the part of any organization or individual caused or contributed to any of the deaths but the coroner , lady justice hallett , explained that the inquest , standard practice after violent deaths in britain , had in this case a larger purpose to provide a way for the surviving families to find out what happened , how their loved ones died and if their deaths could have been prevented the inquest into the 7 7 bombings , as they are known , has been widely praised for its humane and sensitive approach though inquests are usually held soon after someone dies , this one was delayed until after the end of several terrorist trials that had bearing on the evidence it was an immensely complicated proceeding , dealing with four crime scenes , three in the subway system and one on a bus in central london , and detailing the background and movements of the four men responsible it heard from 309 witnesses , including intelligence officers , and listened to the written statements of 197 other people in her remarks , lady justice hallett said she was certain that the bombings could not have been prevented , even though two of the bombers were known by mi5 , britain s domestic security service she also acknowledged that there were widespread problems in the emergency response to the bombings some people who survived the attacks died while waiting for up to an hour to be rescued but she also said that after hearing all the medical evidence , she was convinced that none of those victims would have survived the evidence i have heard does not justify the conclusion that any failings on the part of any organization or individual caused or contributed to any of the deaths , the coroner said but she made a number of recommendations about how the security services could improve intelligence gathering and the emergency services their coordination and organization the families of some of the victims said that her recommendations did not go far enough and called for a new inquiry at the same time , 10 of the families said they were grateful for how the inquest had been conducted the coroner should be commended for her efforts in ensuring that these proceedings have been conducted at all times in a dignified , timely and sensitive manner to those who lost their lives , they said in a statement day after day , the inquest heard from an array of witnesses , some arriving in wheelchairs or using crutches or canes , others still traumatized and in counseling some of the witnesses said that anyone would have helped the way that they did the inquest heard how group capt craig staniforth of the royal air force smashed his way into one of the bombed subway cars , swinging onto the wreckage from handrails and then discussing his daughter s college applications with a severely wounded passenger in an effort to keep him conscious i can almost reel off to this day what four universities those were , the passenger , john tulloch , told the inquest it heard how another passenger , steve hucklesbury , climbed into a wrecked car to try to resuscitate laura webb , 29 , with help from a woman shouting directions through the window , but how he had to give up when her mouth and nose filled with blood and it was clear that nothing more could be done it heard how gill hicks , on the subway near the russell square station , seeing that her legs were literally hanging by a sinew of skin , fashioned two tourniquets out of her scarf and willed herself to remain alert because otherwise , you know , i would die , she said she lost 75 percent of her blood and both her legs until i started this process , i had no idea that people could survive injuries as horrific as yours , lady justice hallett told her at the inquest you are amazing and it heard how gerardine quaghebeur , a neuroradiologist who was sitting in the same subway car as one of the bombers , refused to evacuate the wrecked , pitchblack train filled with wounded , dead and dying passengers , stacked one on top of the other speaking of a woman who had been seated near her , ms quaghebeur said she asked , you ca n't be leaving us you are n't going to leave us \? ' no , she replied no , i 'll stay

washington the obama administration on tuesday gave congress a harshly critical assessment of s efforts to defeat and other militants , saying that after years of work with the pakistani military there remains no clear path toward defeating the insurgency that thrives in the country that conclusion , buried in a 38page report on the state of the war in afghanistan and the efforts to defeat al qaeda in pakistan , comes just three months before is scheduled to announce the pace at which american troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan it amounts to a concession that the effort to match mr obama s surge of troops in afghanistan with a new strategy to squeeze al qaeda and the taliban from the pakistani side of the border has yielded virtually no results for more than a year american officials have expressed frustration with the slow pace of the pakistani effort , which was further complicated by the devastating floods there last summer but rarely have they gone public with the scope of those frustrations the report issued tuesday was not accompanied by any public statement by mr obama , who , like president bush before him , has been loath to publicly criticize the efforts of pakistan but the report states clearly what many administration and pentagon officials have long said in private without pressure from the pakistani side of the border , it is virtually impossible to wipe out the strongholds of taliban or al qaeda , except through americanled predator strikes from the air the report noted that an effort by the pakistani military to clear militants from mohmand , a part of the tribal areas in northwest pakistan , was failing for the third time in two years the failure was a clear indicator of the inability of the pakistan military and government to render cleared areas resistant to insurgency return , the report said the country cannot keep its helicopters flying , the report said , and is reluctant to accept usprovided helicopter maintenance teams , part of a broader concern about letting american troops operate openly on the ground in pakistan what remains vexing is the lack of any indication of hold' and build' planning or staging efforts to complement ongoing clearing operations , the report concluded as such , there remains no clear path toward defeating the insurgency in pakistan , despite the unprecedented and sustained deployment of over 147 , 000 forces , and the deaths of 2 , 575 pakistani troops since 2001 the report also lamented the fact that four coordination centers operated by american , pakistani and afghan troops are up and running on the afghan side of the border , but none are yet operating on the pakistan side , despite a pledge in 2009 from pakistan to do so independent experts on pakistan as well as congressional aides said the report s assessment was more critical of pakistan s counterinsurgency abilities than analyses in two earlier reports , which the administration sends to congress every six months it s pretty tough , said one senate staff member who read the report on tuesday afternoon it does sound like an expression of frustration that goes beyond previous reports in the past , the administration has praised the pakistani efforts to carry out offensive operations against taliban and other insurgents in six of the seven tribal areas all except north waziristan but has chided the civilian government and military high command to do more in a report to congress last september , the last before this week s , the administration essentially gave pakistan s counterterrorism operations a pass , citing the effects of the floods that crippled much of the country the disaster diverted pakistani troops from conducting counterterrorism operations near the afghan border , to delivering flood relief , for several months the september report sought to find a silver lining in the cataclysm , noting that the military s rescue and relief efforts have positive effects on vesting the population with the national government , especially when those impacted citizens are in areas that are also facing threats from insurgents an administration official on tuesday acknowledged the critical appraisal of pakistan s efforts to combat its militancy an effort the united states pays more than 1 billion a year to support but the official cautioned that the american assessment was a snapshot in time this particular snapshot wraps up challenges that we 've talked about piecemeal over several months , said the administration official , who was not authorized to speak on the record about the report in this case , we did n't see a clear path toward defeating the insurgency in pakistan but the official emphasized that the critique was not a forecast of worse to come he pointed out , for example , that the report also noted that pakistan s troops in the northwestern and southwestern parts of the country were cooperating more closely with afghan and nato troops on the other side of the border in afghanistan the report also painted a grim portrait of the country s financial wellbeing as a result of political gridlock , the government continues to be unable to develop consensus on difficult economic and fiscal reforms that are urgently required , including systemic tax reform , the report concluded what steps the government of president asif ali zardari has taken are not likely to be enough to win the confidence of international donors and the international monetary fund , which have been urging wideranging changes to shore up the faltering economy the deterioration of pakistan s economy and slow progress on economic reforms poses the greatest threat to pakistan s stability over the medium term , the report said
a paradox of the new music industry albums sell less and less well every year , but as a marketing tool they are now more important than ever a case in point is lady gaga , whose new album , born this way \( interscope \) , was released on may 23 and , according to nielsen soundscan some 662 , 000 of those sales , or about 60 percent , were digital downloads , the most any album has ever sold in a week the extraordinary success of born this way it outsold the next 42 albums on billboard s chart combined are a testimony to , which devised one of the most extensive and savvy marketing campaigns ever mounted in music once an artist s biggest source of income , recorded music now plays second fiddle to touring , endorsements , merchandise sales and once considered ancillary that s especially true for an artist like lady gaga , who has lined up in the last six months than most artists will in a lifetime people lose sight of how an artist becomes successful in 2011 , said bill werde , billboard s editorial director she could have sold 600 , 000 albums , or a million , or two million but in terms of revenue that s going to be a smaller piece of the pie if there is any asterisk on her achievement , it s that about twothirds of the digital downloads are owed to , which helped sales pass the million mark the huge discount drew an angry reaction from brickandmortar retailers who saw their sales drop in response ish cuebas , vice president for music merchandising of trans world entertainment , which operates 460 music and media stores , including fye , said that his shops sold about half as many copies of born this way as he had expected i do n't think it sends a good message , mr cuebas said of amazon s deal i can understand what amazon did , but i think it devalues music even further in the customer s mind it s worth 99 cents but something is still needed to organize the flurry of products , activities and side deals that now constitute an artist s business , and most often that role is filled by an album , no matter what the cost the album still establishes an artist s sound , look and message and provides an anchor around which long promotions can be built , from early singles \( and leaks \) to concert tours and television appearances recognizing this , interscope and lady gaga s manager , troy carter , built their campaign around the release date , which they chose late last year to take advantage of musicrelated high points on the television calendar , like the grammy awards in february \( \) and the \( where she sang her latest single , the edge of glory \) we wanted to approach this like we were opening a blockbuster film , said steve berman , vice chairman of interscope geffen am it became we 'll put a flag in that date well in advance we wo n't move and what we 'll do for the next six months is pour gas on that fire every day , really branding the date' like any good movie campaign the selling of born this way began nearly a year in advance and continued as a welltimed drumbeat of promotional appearances , retail tieins and media deals that rose to a climax as the release date approached lady gaga announced the title of the album at mtv s video music awards last september and gave the release date on new year s eve as the promotions piled up in recent weeks , she became inescapable if you missed her hbo concert special or saturday night live appearance , her gagaville online game or fashion sale through gilt groupe , then perhaps you rode in one of the new york city subway cars decked out top to bottom with born this way advertising lady gaga , whose real name is stefani germanotta , apparently knows the value of these deals mr carter said she accompanied him on numerous trips to retailers and to silicon valley startups eager to attach themselves to the gaga brand but the most effective offering may have been the one the gaga team knew nothing about on may 23 amazon put the digital version of the album on sale for 99 cents to draw music fans to cloud drive , its entry into the world of socalled cloud music services , which store a user s songs on remote servers amazon paid interscope s distributor , universal , the full wholesale price for the album between 8 and 9 and accepted the difference as a loss , according to several people briefed on the sales arrangement , who were not authorized to speak publicly about the details billboard reported that amazon s twoday sale yielded about 440 , 000 digital sales if correct , that would mean that the retailer lost more than 3 million on the promotion \( amazon declined to comment \) several other new releases reached high on billboard s album chart this week , but none came close to born this way brad paisley s new this is country music \( arista nashville \) is no 2 with 153 , 000 copies sold , and glee the music , vol 6 \( columbia \) sold 80 , 000 , reaching no 4 adele s 21 \( xl \) , which has been no 1 for a total of nine weeks this year , fell two spots to no 3 with 127 , 000 mr carter , lady gaga s manager , said the prerelease promotional campaign for born this way had been in full swing for six months if you look at the fame , ' mr carter continued , referring to lady gaga s first album , it was n't marketing ploys that drove the success of that album it was the quality of the content and gaga s willingness to go around the world and play for the fans , do the promotion , do the tv shows , visit the radio stations and the club dj s there s a lot more of that than there are marketing ploys that means the promotion for born this way is far from over this is where the work begins , he said
the composer is also an adventurous conductor who founded and directs both , based in new york , and , based in ostrava , in the czech republic every now and then mr kotik brings his groups together , as he did on wednesday evening at zankel hall as in previous collaborations , their chemistry was just about perfect the program was varied , if on the long side , at nearly three hours , and if it had a unifying notion , it was an odd one that the soloist in a concerto \( or a concertolike work \) need not be the work s principal focus true , keeping the soloist from monopolizing the spotlight is an unusual , almost nihilistic approach to concerto writing but listening to both concerto for piano and orchestra \( 1988 \) and , you become so enmeshed in the string , woodwind and percussion textures that you can forget , for long stretches , that the piano is the solo instrument the same could be said of brash , rhythmically elastic pendulum 7 , which has a central saxophone line , performed here by the composer and though luca francesconi s riti neurali is scored for solo violin and an ensemble that mirrors the instrumentation of the schubert octet , hana kotkova s fiery account of the violin line was generally subsumed in the general mayhem that said , if you suppress any expectations of virtuosic derringdo , these scores offer ample riches the ligeti is a fascinating study of quickly changing harmonic and rhythmic density , with earcatching juxtapositions in its slow movement , for example , rapidly bowed , muted string figures were overlaid with shrill woodwind timbres , and within that highcontrast fabric a quiet , intensely chromatic piano line created an air of mystery daan vandewalle , the pianist , gave an assured performance that blossomed in the finale , where ligeti gives the instrument greater prominence in the cage , the piano part , played here by joseph kubera , is whatever the player makes of it the soloist builds it by choosing from a compilation of 64 short pieces the ensemble players have similar leeway , working from graphic notation that includes the instruction , any number of pages may be performed , including none at all obviously , no two performances will sound alike , and the possibility of a train wreck looms curiously , mr kotik and company made the work sound entirely coherent , with plentiful interplay and internal dialogue the program opened with mr kotik s in four parts 3 , 6 11 \( for john cage \) , a percussion trio that explores shifting timbres and tempos compellingly the evening s most consistently alluring piece , though , was wilder shores of love , a quiet but lush meditation inspired , ms chen wrote , by the sweeping motions of both paintings and the pacific ocean ms chen captured that sense of motion in steady , almost impressionistic waves of crescendos and diminuendos \( or sometimes just the crescendos \) , and in an alluringly nebulous harmonic language perhaps most crucially , the work afforded a few moments of relative serenity and unity amid the wildness of the rest of the program
what s not to watch \? tuesday s matches were moved back because of the rainout , and assuming the weather cooperates , holders of daysession tickets for the united states open on wednesday are in for a smorgasbord of tennis caroline wozniacki vs andrea petkovic for someone who has been dominating the women s game for the better part of the past two years , wozniacki always looks so darn beatable on court without a dominant shot , wozniacki , the world no 1 and 2009 open runnerup , wins by keeping balls in play and waiting for her opponents to beat themselves she is virtually immune to pressure and seems to know exactly when her opponent is about to crack the 10thseeded petkovic is having her best year as a professional and comes into this match knowing she can beat wozniacki on hardcourts , having defeated her in miami this summer does she have the mental game to overcome wozniacki in a quarterfinal on one of the biggest stages in tennis \? i want to say yes , but i feel wozniacki is going to find a way to win this match roger federer vs jowilfried tsonga watching tsonga play , you ca n't help but wonder why he does not win every time he steps on court when he is on , tsonga , a frenchman , can dominate in every phase of the game at wimbledon this year , federer was up two sets to none when tsonga came screaming back to win the next three last month , tsonga again beat federer on hardcourts in montreal i'm calling this one for tsonga , who i think will outhit federer , a fivetime champion serena williams vs anastasia pavlyuchenkova pavlyuchenkova , a young russian , is the breakout starinthemaking of this tournament , but her run ends with this match as she has done before , williams has come back from injury looking as good as ever on the hardcourts of the national tennis center williams has a better serve , a better net game and is pavlyuchenkova s equal off the ground unless williams suddenly feels the effects of her long layoff , she will move on to her sixth open semifinal aron pilhofer
on feb 12 , gene powell , the chairman of the system board of regents , sent a note to francisco g cigarroa , chancellor of the ut system , about the newest regents appointed by gov rick perry the new members all have extensive experience in higher education and all of them are hard core conservatives and none of them are shy we will see no break in' period from these individuals , he wrote it was an early hint of the changes afoot at the ut board and the tense months some of the most tumultuous in institutional memory , with the regents seemingly pitted against the flagship university in a highly public spat that lay ahead of that new crop of board members , none have received more scrutiny than alex cranberg sitting in the student center at the university of texas campus in austin in early june , mr cranberg , the 56yearold chairman of aspect holdings , a lucrative energy company based in denver , said the time had come to push a reset button on the relationship between the regents and the leadership of the university individuals who encountered mr cranberg as an undergraduate student at ut he received a degree in petroleum engineering in 1977 remember him as a spirited debater who enjoyed challenging others and being challenged in return and it may not be what he expected , but he has certainly been challenged lately suspicion has surrounded mr cranberg from day 1 first , there was the speed with which he became a regent one of the most prestigious appointments a governor can bestow upon a texan mr cranberg received the nod just two weeks after registering to vote in the state following a move from colorado for personal reasons frankly , i 've got a lot going on and would not have moved specifically for this job , he said then there were his associations mr cranberg is a longtime friend of jeff sandefer , the austin energy investor who wrote a controversial set of seven proposals for changing higher education and has promoted them with mr perry s aid i do n't expect anybody to tell me what to do and have me do it , mr cranberg said of all the regents , mr cranberg was the one closest to rick o 'donnell , a fellow former coloradoan and an associate of mr sandefer who had publicly questioned the value of academic research the ut system s hiring of mr o 'donnell as a special adviser to the board was one of the sparks that lit the statewide controversy \( mr o 'donnell s employment was terminated after 49 days , during which he was unfairly attacked , mr cranberg said \) at the height of the debate , mr cranberg was widely considered by critics in the legislature and the academic community to be the ringleader of a bloc of regents who were influenced by mr sandefer and others aiming to , among other things , stage an attack on academic research and coordinate an ouster of ut s president , william powers jr most recently , after a request for extensive data on all the faculty members in the system , mr cranberg was accused by the same groups of trying to micromanage the universities if i read some of the stuff about me that i read in the paper , i 'd be against me , said mr cranberg , who denied all the details of what he called a caricature when mr cranberg heard that his data request was overwhelming the small staff at the university of texaspan american , he asked the university s president , robert s nelsen , to write a grant proposal for him to personally finance it surprised me very much , mr nelsen said it was a very generous offer on his part when asked if other universities shared concerns publicly expressed by many in austin about the data , mr nelsen said i know my faculty are concerned and my staff are concerned we 're not worried , but we would like a better idea of what the data will be used for mr cranberg said that his grant offer , which ultimately was not accepted , was as symbolic as it was sincere i want to show that i'm willing to share the sacrifice , he said i expect it to be symbolically understood that i'm not asking for stuff out of some arrogant desire to be given whatever i want mr cranberg has a long history of investing in causes he cares about in colorado , when a school voucher initiative he backed failed , he joined with others to create the alliance for choice in education , a nonprofit group that provides scholarships to schoolchildren an advocate of expanding pathways to citizenship for immigrants , mr cranberg paid 10 , 000 to conduct a poll in his colorado district just to confirm his belief that he was not an anomaly in the republican party i 've got two kinds of energy , he said i 've got my own personal energy inside my body , and i 've got this stored energy that s called financial resources or cash i intend to use both up as fully as humanly possible by the time i die mr cranberg , the son of a prominent physicist , grew up in the world of academia , which he said influenced him greatly , as did work toward an mba from stanford university his stint on the board of trustees of the metropolitan state college of denver , from 2002 to 2007 , informs much of his behavior as a regent i saw some things there that i wish i 'd done differently , and i do n't like to ever look back on something i did and wish i 'd done things better , he said on the denver board , he said , he learned of the critical importance of data , especially granular information that one can slice and dice different ways that s not micromanagement , he said that s just good analysis his requests for data are not likely to subside , despite the complaints he said he intended to ask for detailed data on faculty peer reviews he anticipates that the request could be burdensome , but also informative of a controversial , widely publicized study by richard vedder , an economist at ohio university , which used unverified data to allege that ut functions inefficiently , mr cranberg called the analysis simplistic still , while the criticisms of the report resonate with him , so do mr vedder s concerns mr cranberg said he hoped to win the hearts and minds of those who still had reservations about his intentions as he sought to address those concerns that the legislature created a new highereducation oversight committee in response to the continuing controversy might indicate that he has a long way to go mr cranberg said he welcomed the new oversight committee , which some conservative bloggers have strongly criticized , and said he believed that most of its members were aligned with his vision i'm the one that s been arguing for transparency , he said , so why should i argue about going before some legislative committee \? the most important issue moving forward , mr cranberg said , is which groups will rally together post reset to embrace the changes that he believes must happen he added , though , that he and the other regents would not relinquish their responsibilities just because they 're being critical , especially if they 're being critical of something we do n't even recognize as our position
the united nations security council unanimously approved sending an additional 2 , 000 to the , citing the lack of security facing the more than 9 , 000 troops and police officers already there so many soldiers are required to protect the golf hotel , home to alassane ouattara , the recognized president , as well as senior officials , that there are none to spare elsewhere in the country the new troops are expected to deploy by june raila odinga , kenya s prime minister , announced after two days of meetings that the latest african attempt to resolve the crisis had failed
when your next arrives on the halfshell , pause to consider it it is a remnant of a vanished ecosystem and a reminder of a time when new york was oyster city you can almost imagine the wholesale oyster barges docked along the east river and the sight of oystermen working the waters around staten island in the mid19th century those were mostly bedded oysters brought in from other locations and grown to size within easy reach of new york what is vastly harder to imagine is a more distant past when new york was surrounded by immense natural oyster reefs the temperatezone equivalent of tropical coral reefs oyster reefs were once a major ecological force in coastal waters all around the globe but according to a recent survey published in bioscience , an international team of marine biologists has concluded that 85 percent of oyster reefs have been lost and that they are functionally extinct in much of north america , europe and australia what destroyed them was overharvesting , pollution , habitat destruction and the practice of bedding , which replaced wild , native oysters with nonnative cultivated ones what has been lost is n't just the oysters themselves it s all the beneficial effects that huge oyster reefs used to provide filtering water , providing habitat for other species , and serving as a coastal buffer against the erosive action of waves even now we can witness the ecological importance of coral reefs , whose existence is threatened by ocean acidification but none of us have ever seen the almost inconceivable extent of historic oyster reefs , and when we think of oysters now we think of them as a cultivated fishery , not an ecosystem oysters are prolific , and that means there is a chance to conserve existing oyster reefs and restore depleted ones , something that is already beginning in the chesapeake bay , and in north carolina , ireland and denmark this will mean learning to value oysters for the benefits they bring to coastal ecosystems , not just for how they taste with lemon and some hot sauce
the often react to postseason failure by spending a lot of money on the best available player they can find it is the equivalent of running to tiffany s to buy something shiny to fix a damaged relationship the gift will solve none of the underlying problems , but it s sparkly and pleasantly distracting , for a while so , who will be the beneficiary this time , now that the yankees have left the postseason stage after five games , losing , three games to two , in their division series with the detroit tigers \? will it be a freeagent starter , like c j wilson , mark buehrle or edwin jackson \? none of the big bats , like prince fielder , albert pujols and david ortiz , seem to fit on a team that has mark teixeira through 2016 and alex rodriguez through 2017 teixeira and rodriguez helped deliver the yankees a championship in 2009 so did and a j burnett the yankees had to guarantee those four almost 700 million but they got the ring , after eight seasons without one now they are living with the cost rodriguez s physical decline , teixeira s decreasing productivity , the puzzle that is burnett but the first bill stamped urgent is the one for sabathia after missing the playoffs in 2008 , the yankees were so eager to sign sabathia that they gave him more than just a sevenyear , 161 million contract they allowed him to opt out after the 2011 season sabathia has always explained this as something his agents wanted , and the yankees have said it was simply a way to give sabathia an escape hatch if he did not really like new york but that is not the point of an optout clause the point is to make more money yes , sabathia is a very large man who had knee surgery last offseason , and it is always harder to keep off weight as a person ages but on the open market , sabathia , 31 , could possibly make more than the four years and 92 million remaining on his deal would the yankees dare him to test the open market \? they might and the decision might have been easier if at least one of the young pitchers they were grooming a few years ago had blossomed into an ace ivan nova had an impressive rookie season , his abbreviated game 5 loss aside but joba chamberlain , handled with such caution , is a middle reliever recovering from reconstructive elbow surgery phil hughes followed an 18win season by going 55 with a 579 earned run average ian kennedy earned 21 victories this season , but he did it for the arizona diamondbacks kennedy , at least , brought the yankees their dynamic center fielder , curtis granderson , one of seven players in next year s potential lineup who will be 32 years old or younger next season the others are teixeira , robinson cano , brett gardner , russell martin , jesus montero and nick swisher , who has a 1025 million club option for 2012 the only older players are derek jeter , 37 , who hit 338 from july 9 through the end of the season , and rodriguez , 36 , who just posted the lowest onbaseplusslugging percentage of his career \( 823 \) while breaking down again with injuries jeter is signed for three more years , rodriguez for six the yankees will take what they can get from rodriguez and jeter , knowing that eduardo nunez is a useful fillin for either player , as long as the team keeps the designated hitter spot flexible offense is not the yankees' problem , anyway it broke down in the clutch in game 5 , but finished second in the majors in runs scored in the regular season the boston red sox finished first in runs , and as discouraged as yankees fans must feel right now , they can always revel in the plight of their bitter rivals things are a whole lot worse on yawkey way than they are in the bronx after blowing a ninegame wildcard lead in september and parting with terry francona , the red sox need a manager they might need a general manager , too , if the front office lets the chicago cubs lure theo epstein away a culture change is also needed in a clubhouse that took advantage of the genial francona , who had the audacity to trust his players to act like professionals conveniently for the red sox , a genuine clubhouse leader might come onto the market , and he happens to be an elite starting pitcher sabathia few teams would have the resources to sign sabathia for more than the yankees owe him , but boston is one that is another reason the yankees must act quickly to add another two years to their ace s contract and keep him from opting out , who is expected to resign as the yankees' general manager , was smart last winter to invest in undervalued assets like bartolo colon and freddy garcia his professional scouting staff made wise recommendations in complementary parts like luis ayala , eric chavez , andruw jones and cory wade cashman opposed the threeyear , 35 million investment in rafael soriano , who will surely exercise his player option for 2012 how does cashman support sabathia in the rotation \? burnett , hughes and nova will be back , but chances are the yankees will pursue a stabilizer for the no 2 spot investing in free agents rarely pays off , so perhaps cashman can find a trade partner would the pitchingrich tampa bay rays dangle james shields , coming off a career year and presumably at peak trade value , with three option years at a total of 28 million remaining on his contract \? the yankees have a stable of prospects to deal , though the rays would have many suitors if they put shields on the market whoever it is , someone new will join the yankees , almost certainly in the starting rotation and the yankees will have to trust that sabathia will stay fit enough to continue pitching at an elite level the yankees won 99 games , including their two victories in the division series there really is not much to worry about because a strong detroit team beat them in the playoffs but the rotation is the foundation of any team , and with so little depth behind him , sabathia is the most important figure , and the first priority , in the yankees' world
medicaid money created quite a nice life for the levy brothers from flatbush , brooklyn the brothers , philip and joel , earned close to 1 million a year each as the two top executives running a medicaidfinanced nonprofit organization serving the developmentally disabled they each had luxury cars paid for with public money and when their children went to college , they could pass on the tuition bills to their nonprofit group philip h levy went as far as charging the organization 50 , 400 for his daughter s living expenses one year when she attended graduate school at new york university that money paid not for a dorm room , but rather it helped her buy a coop apartment in greenwich village the rise of the levy brothers , from scruffy bearded social workers in the 1970s to millionaires with homes in the hamptons , sutton place and palm beach gardens , reveals much about new york s system for caring for the developmentally disabled those with conditions like cerebral palsy , down syndrome and autism the state spends , by far , more than any other caring for this population 10 billion this year , and roughly 20 cents of every dollar spent nationally more than half of that money goes to private providers like the levys , with little oversight of their spending and the providers have become so big and powerful that they shape much about how the system operates , from what kinds of care are emphasized to how much they will be paid for it they 're bigger than government in some ways , said thomas a maul , former commissioner of the state s office of mental retardation and developmental disabilities that is n't what our system was supposed to be the organization run by the levys , the young adult institute network , has been among the most aggressive , and is now the largest operator of group homes for the state , collecting more than 1 billion from medicaid over the past decade and running homes with a total of 700 beds , along with day programs , a school , dental care and transportation for the developmentally disabled the organization and the levys have earned many admirers in the field for the quality and range of their programs they are known for recruiting and keeping good employees , many of whom spend decades with the organization but their spending is seldom scrutinized , and , even when state officials turn up questionable expenses , there are few consequences the state , of course , has a financial interest in maintaining and expanding the programs , which bring more federal money and more jobs , especially to areas upstate , where many of the nonprofit organizations are major employers at the end of june , two days after the new york times asked about the spending for his daughter s apartment , philip levy , 60 , abruptly retired as chief executive joel m levy , 67 , also departed in june , after serving as a 250 , 000ayear parttime consultant following his departure from the chief executive s position in 2009 a spokesman said the changes were unrelated to the inquiry by the times filling a vacuum philip and joel levy were running saturday night bingo games to support a tiny program for 15 developmentally disabled people in the early 1970s when their whole world changed in 1972 , geraldo rivera , then a young reporter at wabctv , found his way inside the willowbrook state school on staten island , a staterun institution that housed some 5 , 000 developmentally disabled residents in deplorable conditions his footage showed naked children huddled on floors , feces smeared on walls , and an attendant oddly grinning through the darkness public outrage exploded a lawsuit brought by a parents group , the new york state association for retarded children , resulted in a court order that forced the state to quickly move thousands of people into smaller community homes the state released a wave of public money and turned to nonprofit providers , which opened more than 100 group homes from 1976 through 1979 the young adult institute , founded by a psychologist and his wife in 1957 , emerged as a leader , opening and operating a dozen group homes the levy brothers were determined to be a part of the revolution in care , and ascended at the young adult institute , eventually taking over the top jobs in 1979 joel as executive director and philip as associate executive director their ambition to expand sometimes conflicted with the views of the network s board of directors , made up mostly of parents of children with developmental disabilities , who felt that the organization should remain small and focused on their children over the years , the parents were replaced by professionals from other fields who supported growth they were the most entrepreneurial folks that i ever met , said barbara b blum , who was in charge of the deinstitutionalization effort for new york when we were under court order to provide all kinds of services , the levy brothers recognized the fact that there really was a vacuum , and they walked into it ms blum credited the brothers with persuading firstrate dentists , doctors and other medical professionals who would n't have touched some of the folks at willowbrook , she said to treat developmentally disabled people
on thursday , nbc s news division staged an elaborate presentation for advertisers , seeking to sell commercial time in nbc s news programs over the next year all the members of msnbc s primetime lineup spoke at the lunch with one exception keith olbermann , the network s biggest star for the last several weeks , mr olbermann and the network have been in negotiations to end his successful run on msnbc , according to executives involved in the talks who requested anonymity because the talks were confidential the deal was completed on friday , and mr olbermann made the announcement on his final countdown hours later friday s separation agreement between msnbc and mr olbermann includes restrictions on when he can next lead a television show and when he can give interviews about the decision to end his association with the news channel the executives involved in the discussions confirmed that the deal carries limitations for mr olbermann in terms of when he can next work on television , though he will be able to take a job in radio or on any forum on the internet the deal also prohibits the host from commenting publicly on the deal , the executives confirmed mr olbermann did not respond to requests for comment friday or saturday none of the executives who discussed the deal would reveal the exact length of the restrictions the decision was completed one year to the day from the last time nbc decided to end a relationship with an onair star conan o brien mr o brien agreed in the deal not to start up a new television show for nine months , and not to grant interviews for five months the executives involved in the discussions with mr olbermann said his agreement was not dissimilar to mr o brien s many of mr olbermann s fans responded to the decision by accusing comcast , the incoming owner of nbc universal , of forcing him out for political reasons several of comcast s top executives have been financial supporters of republicans mr olbermann is largely credited with establishing msnbc s liberal voice comcast issued an official statement friday denying any involvement in the decision , saying it had no operational control of the company yet , and adding we pledged from the day the deal was announced that we would not interfere with nbc universal s news operations we have not and we will not but the company is still drawing criticism for the move marvin ammori , a law professor at the university of nebraska , said in an email friday , keith olbermann s announcement tonight , the very same week that the government blessed the comcastnbc merger , raises serious concern for anyone who cares about free speech comcast proved expert in shaking down the government to approve its merger comcast s shakedown of nbc has just begun professor ammori is a former adviser to the nonprofit group free press , which opposed the comcastnbc deal months before comcast was expected to gain control of nbc universal , comcast officials were worried about the perception that they might interfere with msnbc for political reasons one executive , who asked not to be identified because comcast had instructed employees not to speak about the situation , said the company dreaded the prospect of being blamed if mr olbermann were to quit soon after the takeover mr olbermann had butted heads with his superiors long before the comcast deal , including phil griffin , the top msnbc executive according to several senior network executives , nbc s management had been close to firing mr olbermann before , most recently in november after he revealed that he had made donations to several democratic candidates in 2010 one of them , coincidentally , was representative gabrielle giffords , who has been the subject of many of his recent shows after being shot in an assassination attempt mr griffin said the donations had violated nbc news standards mr olbermann was suspended brian stelter contributed reporting
updated , 1 23 pm sunday in a tense showdown above the east river , the police arrested more than 700 demonstrators from the occupy wall street protests who took to the roadway as they tried to cross the brooklyn bridge on saturday afternoon the police said it was the marchers' choice that led to the enforcement action protesters who used the brooklyn bridge walkway were not arrested , paul j browne , the chief spokesman for the new york police department , said those who took over the brooklynbound roadway , and impeded vehicle traffic , were arrested but many protesters said they believed the police had tricked them , allowing them onto the bridge , and even escorting them partway across , only to trap them in orange netting after hundreds had entered the cops watched and did nothing , indeed , seemed to guide us onto the roadway , said jesse a myerson , a media coordinator for occupy wall street who marched but was not arrested a video on the youtube page of a group called we are change shows some of the arrests around 1 am , the first of the protesters held at the midtown north precinct on west 54th street were released they were met with cheers from about a halfdozen supporters who said they had been waiting as a show of solidarity since 6 pm for around 75 people they believed were held there every 10 to 15 minutes , they trickled out into a night far chillier than the afternoon on the bridge , each clutching several thin slips of paper their summonses , for violations like disorderly conduct and blocking vehicular traffic the first words many spoke made the group laugh all variations on i need a cigarette david gutkin , 24 , a phd student in musicology at columbia university , was among the first released he said that after being corralled and arrested on the bridge , he was put into plastic handcuffs and moved to what appeared to be a metropolitan transportation authority bus , along with dozens of other protesters , for over four hours they headed first into brooklyn and then to several locations in manhattan before arriving at the 54th street precinct men and women had been held separately , two or three to a cell a few said they had been ziptied the entire time we sang 'this little light of mine , ' said annie day , 34 , who when asked her profession said , i'm a revolutionary ms day was wearing laceless converse sneakers police had required the removal of all laces as well as her belt she rethreaded them on the pavement while a man who identified himself as a lawyer took each newly freed person s name none of the protesters interviewed knew if the bridge march was planned or a spontaneous decision by the crowd but all insisted that the police had made no mention that the roadway was off limits ms day and several others said that police officers had walked beside the crowd until the group reached about midway , then without warning began to corral the protesters behind orange nets the scene outside the midtown south precinct on west 35th street around 2 am was far more jovial only about 15 of the rumored 57 people had been released , but about a dozen waiting supporters danced jigs in the street to keep warm they snacked on pizza one even drank coors light beer , stashing the empty bottles under a parked police van when a fresh protester was released , he or she ran through a gantlet formed by the waiting group , like a football player bursting onto the field during the super bowl this is so much better than prison ! one cheered it s cold , said rebecca solow , 27 , rubbing her arms as she waited on the sidewalk , but every time one is released , it warms you up the march on the bridge had come to a head shortly after 4 pm , as the 1 , 500 or so marchers reached the foot of the brooklynbound car lanes of the bridge , just east of city hall in their march north from zuccotti park in lower manhattan headquarters for the last two weeks of a protest movement against what demonstrators call inequities in the economic system they had stayed on the sidewalks , forming a long column of humanity penned in by officers on scooters where the entrance to the bridge narrowed their path , some marchers , including organizers , stuck to the generally agreedupon route and headed up onto the wooden walkway that runs between and about 15 feet above the bridge s traffic lanes but about 20 others headed for the brooklynbound roadway , said christopher t dunn of the new york civil liberties union , who accompanied the march some of them chanted take the bridge they were met by a handful of highlevel police supervisors , who blocked the way and announced repeatedly through bullhorns that the marchers were blocking the roadway and that if they continued to do so , they would be subject to arrest there were no physical barriers , though , and at one point , the marchers began walking up the roadway with the police commanders in front of them seeming , from a distance , as if they were leading the way the chief of department joseph j esposito , and a horde of other whiteshirted commanders , were among them
on friday , i wrote about two social enterprises samasource and digital divide data that extend computerbased employment to people with modest educations in developing countries the strategy of harnessing the internet to bring lowcost data management jobs to remote and impoverished communities has been called impact sourcing some estimate that the market for these services , 45 billion today , could rise to 20 billion by 2015 , providing jobs to 780 , 000 people \( pdf , p14 \) a number of readers thought the idea had great potential to alleviate poverty in the developing world david griesing , from philadelphia , \( 29 \) saw it as a way to allow more people to work with dignity while improving their productive capacity patrick mcnamara , from the boston area , mass \( 46 \) , noted that it could be a way to increase global security , as well since poverty and income inequalities can lead to violence and have a negative impact on our economy and our own homeland security tim bal , from belle mead , nj \( 1 \) , described impact sourcing as a great innovation that would raise millions of the world s poor out of poverty but he noted that it presents a problem it reduces the job demand in developed countries like the united states most readers had the same concern and some took me to task for supporting an idea that they felt gave corporations a green light to exploit poor people in the developing world tombo , from new york state \( 34 \) , wrote that impact sourcing was another attempt to put lipstick on the globalization pig and luanne de , from taos , nm \( 40 \) commented that ethical outsourcing was , itself , an oxymoron it is now possible to create jobs that would otherwise have been handled poorly by machines or not handled at all at a time when so many americans are in distress because they can t find work , it may seem that impact outsourcing is the wrong idea to champion more than 70 percent of americans believe that outsourcing harms the us economy outsourcing is usually characterized as moving jobs overseas as if it s necessarily a oneforone tradeoff but it s not that simple many of the jobs that are handled through impact sourcing could not be justified on economic terms if they had to be handled in the united states these are laborintensive tasks that companies , governments , nonprofits or individuals would like to do but will only do if the costs are not prohibitive accurately digitizing large swaths of information falls into this category we re focusing on the lowest rung of outsourcing work that even the big indian companies don t want any more because it s priced too low for them , explained leila janah , the founder of samasource , a nonprofit organization that currently channels microwork small tasks like entering , cleaning or verifying data to 1 , 600 people in haiti , india , kenya , pakistan , uganda and south africa at higher prices , it simply wouldn t make sense for many businesses to offer most of this work , she said , because they wouldn t be able to make a profit on the output now that such microwork can be distributed and managed affordably around the world , it s possible to create jobs that would otherwise have been handled poorly by machines or not handled at all to our knowledge , none of the assignments we ve taken were for work previously done in the us , explained jeremy hockenstein , the founder of digital divide data , which employs 900 people in cambodia , laos and kenya he offered an example the harvard crimson would never have paid 5 million to digitize its archives but they could afford to pay a few hundred thousand dollars to do it i have the same problem like most journalists , i record several interviews each week and usually have to transcribe them myself , which takes hours i would love to hire a locally based professional transcriber to do the work so i could devote more time to research or writing or relaxing with my family but i can t afford it the rates are too high for me however , there are plenty of people around the globe who would be willing , even happy , to do this work at a rate i can manage if i find a woman in kenya or india and give her the job , am i hurting the american transcribers i wouldn t have hired \? of course , if i were a rich , bestselling author it would be a different story which is why readers disapproved of the idea when they assumed that impact outsourcing is about big and wealthy corporations taking advantage of poor people when they have other options ng , from florida \( 9 \) , wrote i can t help but think that big business will exploit this to make even bigger profits that could happen and that s why i focused on two social enterprises that are structured as nonprofits no one in our organization can grow personally wealthy , explains janah this ensures we re aligned with our social mission this is fundamentally different from forprofit outsourcing companies , which have generated seven billionaires in the last two decades we no longer live in a zerosum world , where one person s , or one country s gain , must be another s loss although samasource highlights the marquee companies it has worked with , most of the requests for its services actually come from small businesses , startups , nonprofits and educational institutions for resourcestrapped organizations like these , outsourcing labor is the only option , adds janah they cannot afford to innovate with american labor , both because of the high costs , and because it s extremely complicated to hire someone in america one of the mistakes i made in the article was mentioning the amounts that samasource s workers earn at least 5 a day , and often more without putting the figure in perspective adam , from philadelphia \( 17 \) described this as paying people peanuts in third world countries to sell to people in the first world and shotsie , from albuquerque , \( 2 \) , asked at 5 a day , how are these people going to boost their local economy enough to actually buy local or imported products \? the amounts have to be considered in the context of people s lives rates of malnutrition and child mortality are very high among samasource s target group , and life expectancy is low the people we help earn less than what 3 a day would buy you in the united states \( in 2005 dollars \) , which is pretty shocking , explains janah our initial target population is living at a level that is hard for most americans to fathom over all , samasource s workers double their previous incomes samasource ensures that its workers are paid above guidelines set by the fair wage guide , which stipulates wage levels that allow workers to support themselves and contribute to their local economies according to the world bank , in 2010 per capita income was 780 per year in kenya and 760 per year in cambodia even the minimum salary of 5 a day represents more than a 65 percent increase over these averages \( assuming five days of work per week for the full year \) but many workers earn more at adept technologies , one of samasource s partners in kenya , the average monthly earning for a samasource worker is about 170 , according to diana gitiba , adept s cofounder this figure represents an annualized income of more than 2 , 000 a year , or roughly 250 percent of kenya s percapital income graduates of digital divide data s workstudy program typically earn 400 percent the national income in their countries , notes hockenstein even so , nobody is getting rich the wages these jobs provide are not enough to get workers into the middle class , explained hockenstein but they are enough to provide for food , shelter and transportation and they often allow people to pay for schooling for themselves and family members this is far from peanuts the readers who complained about outsourcing seem to hold the view that outsourcing of any form should be discouraged again , this response is understandable given the current unemployment crisis but it s not just americans who need jobs people around the world are suffering in poverty and an earnings increase that would be barely significant in the us context say , 3 a day can , in a country like india or kenya , mean the difference between families eating well , having decent clothing , and being able to send their children , especially daughters , to school it s hard to argue against making these opportunities available particularly through social enterprises that are missiondriven and offer people work that is a stepping stone to a better life at the same time , it s necessary to do more to address the opportunity gap in this country including through domestic outsourcing samasource plans to launch a site in the united states within a year we chose to start internationally to demonstrate that the model would work even in very poor regions where there is much less infrastructure than the us , explained janah as the author robert wright has argued , we no longer live in a zerosum world , where one person s , or one country s gain , must be another s loss it s possible , and indeed necessary , to construct winwin scenarios the success of a young person in kenya , cambodia or india can improve the world we all live in diana gitiba , the cofounder of adept technologies in kenya , put it this way which software do we use \? we use american software what hardware do we use \? we use american hardware we use dell computers in the office the more work we get in kenya , the more we can trade with other countries , and the more everybody can have what they need at the moment , i m just happy that the 50 people we work with have a sure meal at their table tonight for dinner and the more we do that for more people it will be a happier world to live in join and follow updates on  is the author of , which has been published in 20 languages , and , and is coauthor of he is the founder of , a media site that reports on social innovation
as the aug 16 release of their fourth studio album approaches , life on the road for texas' eli young band is predictably routine long bus rides and early wakeup calls are quickly followed by phone interviews , sound checks , more interviews , dinners with country radio programmers , and meetandgreets with fans the pace can feel simultaneously dizzying and dull but then there s the singalong at each show , mike eli , the band s lead singer , turns the microphone toward the crowd , which eagerly sings a chorus or three of crazy girl , the highestcharting and fastestclimbing single of the band s career it s an incredible feeling , mr eli said when the crowd sings so loud you ca n't hear yourself singing , it s pretty powerful in some way , mr eli said , the singalongs feel like validation for what has been a hardfought success story in 2000 , the band s eponyms mr eli and the guitarist james young started gigging while they attended the university of north texas the subsequent years , often filled with 200date touring schedules , yielded their first major label record deal , a pair of academy of country music award nominations and a 2008 album , jet black jealous , that sent three songs to the billboard country charts but none of those hits came close to crazy girl , the centerpiece of their coming album , life at best in march , the song made its debut at the top of the itunes country songs chart with more than 47 , 000 downloads the first week since then , it has averaged 30 , 000 downloads a week , and the recording industry association of america recently certified it gold for selling more than 500 , 000 downloads given those prerelease single sales , life at best seems poised to open in the top five of billboard s country albums chart and perhaps within the top 10 on the billboard 200 those numbers would signal not just a national breakthrough for the , but also something of an anomaly for a band so closely associated with what has become known as the texas country scene , a community of artists who have built cottage industries out of relentlessly touring across texas and independently selling records over the years , the band has played alongside many of the scene s torchbearers , like kevin fowler and the randy rogers band and while pat green and jack ingram , two of the movement s architects , have enjoyed some national success , legitimate breakouts are rare i once had a radio programmer question a texas band s success by saying , sure they play there all the time , ' said jimmy harnen , president of republic nashville , the band s label and i asked if they 'd been to texas lately they 're not riding around on stagecoaches dallas has schools and starbucks like they do in seattle or san francisco that it somehow matters geographically where a band worked hard and proved on their own that people would buy tickets and albums never made any sense if there is a single factor why texas country acts have difficulty finding success nationally , it s the theory of financial complacency when you add shows , album sales , royalties from regional radio play and merchandising , the top acts can earn 1 million or more instate every year bands with national hits are expected to play radiosponsored shows in cities with a major country station , often for little to no money the moment you really start trying to play out nationally , you 're making less money , mr eli said you 're making a sacrifice to grow your fan base you just have to look at it as an investment relative to other texas country acts , the eli young band established a national audience early it earned its first record deal after opening for miranda lambert in 2003 \( prenashville star \) , and the success of the 2008 single always the love songs earned the band receptive ears in february when it crisscrossed the country playing selections from life at best for influential radio programmers crazy girl emerged as a single , but there were still challenges convincing programmers that the song can fit on playlists between brad paisley and sugarland , and that it s not the album s only hit it definitely helped that we had a little bit of history and heard other songs on the record that sounded like hits , said nate deaton , the general manager of station krty in san jose , calif it does n't make sense for us to play oneanddone songs the followup single has not been selected yet , but the band s current headlining tour has already sold out in cities like san diego , denver and chicago places that are rarely strong markets for bands from the texas country scene no matter the success of crazy girl and life at best , mr eli is adamant that his band is not going to shy away from playing texas or disavow itself from texas country we want to take this thing as big as we can take it , he said but when you 're playing shows in texas after you 've been outside the state , you 're almost kissing the ground texas audiences sing every song they buy the records and listen to it in its entirety it s not just about the single
louisville , ky however successful the 2011 breeders cup turns out to be , it could have been a lot better once again thoroughbred racing s yearend showcase has been robbed of its brightest stars despite admirable changes and significant progress in recent years , the greatest enemies of the sport s world championship extravaganza continue to be two factors seemingly beyond control the fragile nature of the equine celebrities on which it depends and the reluctance of some major players to show up keep depleting its pizazz last year s version hinged on the wildly popular mare zenyatta s taking on the men , and this year it is depending on another boy girl clash that is only a pale imitation but imagine the 5 million classic with the filly havre de grace and the comeback sensation uncle mo taking on a full field that included the kentucky derby winner animal kingdom , the wood memorial champion toby s corner and the european sensation frankel , reputed to be the best horse in the world what if the favorite in the sprint were the australian rocket black caviar , who might well be the world s best and fastest \? and consider the 3 million turf with cape blanco , acclimation and winchester still healthy enough to compete even without the missing havre de grace , the ladies classic would shape up as a corker if blind luck and zazu were not sidelined every year a horse or horses whose rivalry would produce the kind of thrilling competition and marketing appeal the sport craves is a noshow for one reason or another the greatest potential equine rivalry in decades , which would have been a bonanza for the 2009 breeders cup , never took place simply because losing to zenyatta might have cost rachel alexandra horse of year honors , which her owner jess jackson believed she had locked up by winning the preakness although eventual horse of year designation and its financial rewards often accompany victory in the classic , the honor sometimes cuts both ways in the decisions of owners and trainers about whether to run the 2003 classic , for example , could have been a showdown between empire maker , winner of the belmont stakes and the most exciting 3yearold colt , and mineshaft , north america s leading older horse , who was bred , owned and campaigned by this country s leading breeding farm , lane s end but empire maker bruised a foot preparing for the jockey club gold cup and was retired , his trainer explaining that his owner prince abdullah of saudi arabia considered him too valuable to risk with the horse of the year honors virtually in the bag , lane s end announced that mineshaft had chips in his ankle and would skip the breeders cup these were decisions made by two of the sport s wealthiest players if their horses were truly at risk , they should not be questioned but a founding principle of the breeders cup was to pit the horses best known to fans and bettors alike , the stars of the kentucky derby , the preakness stakes and the belmont stakes , in a classic distance race against the best but probably lesserknown older horses from around the world but too often the classic , though it has seen a couple of marvelous twohorse races over the years , ends up being one of the least competitive and least interesting because the 3yearolds have been sidelined by a combination of injury and success , and the best older champions have gone to stud since 2001 , only 13 of the 33 winners of the derby , the preakness and the belmont have still been around to compete in the breeders cup the year of their victories , which includes the gelding funny cide and war emblem , each having won two of the three triple crown classics this year s field includes this year s belmont winner , ruler on ice , and the 2010 champion , drosselmeyer the 2011 preakness winner , shackleford , is competing in the dirt mile none of the three figured in any of 3yearold pretriple crown hype for the most part , the horses advertised to be the stars in the triple crown uncle mo , the factor , archarcharch , dialed in , soldat , stay thirsty and to honor and serve never were one by one they fell victim to the rigors of 2yearold training and the compulsion to earn enough graded stakes money to qualify for the alwayscrowded kentucky derby field uncle mo , a 2yearold champion colt who tapped out early , is back from injury in time for the big show and an exception to the rule he is one of only four 2yearold champion colts to make it the classic the next year , the others being looking at lucky , street sense and macho uno five others midshipman , war pass , stevie wonderboy , action this day , and vindication went to stud early , and the sixth was a gelding , declan s moon , who never regained competitive form as proof that injury is gender neutral among the young , the 2year old filly champions fared no better in the last decade , not a single one was around to contest the ladies classic , formerly known as the distaff , the year after her juvenile championship but the disparity between female values and those of the colts is evidenced by the fact that the fillies were not rushed to the breeding shed and showed up in breeders cup races in succeeding years the 2002 juvenile filly champion storm flag flying did not compete in the 2003 distaff but finished second in 2004 blind luck , one of this year s missing and most popular stars , lost the 2009 juvenile fillies and the championship to she be wild , but she finished second and havre de grace third in the 2010 ladies classic apparently the clear lesson from all this was not lost on the recently revamped and invigorated breeders cup board of directors , which has correctly traced the problem to a combination of shortsighted training methods and health hazards connected to raceday medications , mainly painkillers that mask undetectable stress fractures and other limb maladies common to young horses being rushed to competition and the diuretic furosemide formerly known as lasix , now called salix , furosemide leaches calcium out of equine bones that in 2 and 3yearolds are barely halfway through their remodeling stages the best science available suggests that all horses , as well as human athletes , suffer some degree of bleeding after strenuous exercise but 2 percent to 4 percent of horses bleed badly enough to impair performance australia , for example , where lasix is not permitted on race day , reported that only 1 percent of its horses qualify as bleeders and only 02 percent bleed a second time in the last year , a total of 26 horses were retired because of excessive bleeding by prohibiting raceday furosemide in the 2yearold races beginning in 2012 , the breeders cup is moving at a snail s pace in concert with the thoroughbred owners and breeders association , \( toba \) whose gradedstakes committee has taken an identical step but at least the sport is finally moving the most obvious next step is for the triple crown races to follow suit and change the way 2yearolds earn selection for entry in the derby , the preakness and the belmont counting graded stakes earnings from early 2yearold stakes races is the compelling factor in rushing young horses to the track , shortening their careers and undermining the breeders cup
waukee , iowa the 2012 presidential campaign is beginning , whether the candidates are ready or not republicans have been far more eager to criticize president obama than to formally jump into the race and start jockeying for the right to challenge him but their hesitation , or strategic patience , has done little to slow the early stages of the party s nominating contest things reached a preseason high monday when six prospective republican contenders at least three of whom are viewed as long shots were drawn to iowa an evening candidates' forum was billed as the first such gathering of the year , filling a church auditorium with republican activists and a crush of reporters so large that it seemed like election eve a curious trend is emerging in the early days of the 2012 presidential race republican voters are searching for candidates far more aggressively than candidates are searching for voters four years ago , nearly all of the contenders from both parties were already in the race by now this time around , none of the big names have plunged fully in , the former house speaker , became the first major candidate to start raising money last week , but kept his options open , a tease that left some republicans wondering whether he was truly committed to , and ready for , a campaign whether it is because they see mr obama as a more formidable rival than they expected , or because they want to delay the scrutiny that comes with a formal declaration , or because they want to see the field gel before making any final decisions , the most prominent of potential candidates are remaining coy for now but coming off major republican gains last fall and with the helping to energize the party at the grassroots level , the entrepreneurial spirit of republican activists in earlyvoting states is alive and they are going to great lengths to try to kickstart the race at point of grace church , which sits on a sprawling campus in this western suburb of des moines , more than 1 , 000 republicans turned out to begin taking a measure of some of the party s contenders at a forum sponsored by the the evening at the megachurch took on the feeling of a religious service , including passing the envelope for attendees to make contributions to the group the event not only marked the unofficial opening of the iowa caucus campaign , it also provided an early window into the balance that candidates will seek to strike as they navigate the demands of fiscal and social conservatives some of the biggest names in the were not on hand , which left some in the audience wondering if the party was taking too leisurely an approach on the difficult task of defeating a sitting president iowa voters want to meet the candidates , said gov terry branstad , a republican they want to be able to ask them the tough questions they want to make their own evaluation and decision mr gingrich , former gov of minnesota and former senator of pennsylvania delivered their pitches , pledging to keep social issues like opposing abortion rights and gay marriage central but the slowtodevelop race has also created an opening for an array of political figures and celebrities to enjoy a moment in the spotlight sarah palin , mike huckabee and mitt romney declined invitations to come to iowa on monday but herman cain , a former chief executive at godfather s pizza , and former gov buddy roemer of louisiana made their debuts on the 2012 campaign stage in an evening that was on cspan i have a breaking news announcement for president obama , mr cain said the united states of america is not going to become the united states of europe not on our watch mr roemer vowed to cap his campaign contributions at 100 he introduced himself as a fighting outsider , saying the nation is hurting and washington , dc , is a boomtown how does that grab you \? the iowa prospecting also included a visit from representative ron paul of texas , who appeared at a separate event they were all joined in the flurry of news coverage by a top aide to donald trump , who flew to des moines and staged a news conference with a trump plane in the background hopefully he decides to run in june , said michael cohen , executive vice president of the trump organization the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary , the contests that traditionally open the presidential nominating season , will not take place until early next year but the first republican debates are less than two months away , creating a sense of anxiety among some voters who are eager to find the strongest challenger to mr obama as he walked from the church , mingling with people from the crowd , steve scheffler , chairman of the iowa faith and freedom coaltion , said that time was running short for candidates to open their campaigns and begin making their case to iowans at some point in the next month or two , they are going to have to come here and plant their flag or caucusgoers will be looking for other alternatives , said mr scheffler , who is also a member of the republican national committee caucusgoers expect to be talked to and listened to
the criminal allegations against jerry sandusky , the former assistant football coach accused of sexually abusing young boys , have prompted questions about what officials at penn state knew and when but the public s access to emails , phone records and other potentially critical evidence is restricted because penn state has a special exemption from having to disclose a host of information that state agencies and many other state universities are forced to divulge under pennsylvania s right to know law historically , pennsylvania had one of the most restrictive open records laws of any state all state records were presumed to be closed unless citizens could prove why the information they wanted should be disclosed but scandals involving campaign financing , pay for state lawmakers and spending abuses by a state agency led legislators in 2008 to drastically rewrite the law for the first time in a half century now , the assumption is that all state records are open unless public officials can argue otherwise when the wideranging overhaul of the state s open records provisions was made three years ago , however , exemptions were included practically none of the revisions pertain to penn state , the university of pittsburgh , temple university and lincoln university , which have a special staterelated status in pennsylvania because they receive public financing but maintain independent administrative control they are required only to issue annual reports by may 30 and make public the salaries of their officers and directors and 25 highestpaid employees representatives of these universities pushed for their colleges to be exempt because , among other things , they said they would have a harder time soliciting donations if the donors' identities could be made public that would put them on an uneven footing when competing for dollars with private universities however , critics then and now argue that any university that receives taxpayer funds should be open to scrutiny this fiscal year , the four staterelated universities will receive about 560 million in public money , with nearly half , or 272 million , of that money destined for penn state any time you have dimes and dollars and put them in the dark , you have the potential for significant problems , said terry mutchler , the executive director of the state s office of open records having the strongest righttoknow laws would n't have prevented what happened , but there might have been more availability , and it might provide a reverse road map mutchler said her office has received a flood of requests for information about how to request internal documents from penn state since sandusky was charged last week because of the growing scandal at penn state , state senator john blake , a democrat from northeastern pennsylvania , says he plans to introduce legislation that would end the exemption for staterelated institutions there s no reason why they should n't be held to the same provisions as any other institution of higher learning that gets state funding , said blake , who was not in office when the records law was rewritten it seems to me whether a citizen , organization , business or media interest wants to access to public records , the hurdles should n't be any different blake does not have a cosponsor for his bill , but he said he hoped that dominic pileggi , the majority leader in the state senate and the prime sponsor of the open records law revision three years ago , would help close the loophole erik arneson , a spokesman for senator pileggi , said the senate was considering various amendments to the law , but that there was no timetable for action on any proposed changes it is always good and proper to review open records law as situations arise , and this is clearly one of those situations , arneson said
it was all predicted , but the unanimous decision by senate republicans on tuesday president obama s jobs bill was still a breathtaking act of economic vandalism there are 14 million people out of work , wages are falling , poverty is rising , and a second recession may be blowing in , but not a single republican would even allow debate on a sound plan to cut middleclass taxes and increase publicworks spending the bill the republicans shot down is not a panacea , but it would have a significant and swift effect on the current stagnation macroeconomic advisers , whose forecasts are often used by the federal reserve , said it could raise economic growth by 125 percentage points and create 13 million jobs in 2012 moody s analytics estimated new growth at 2 percentage points and 19 million jobs those economists say that republican ideas for increasing growth would have no measurable effects in the next year the republicans offer no actual economic plans , only tired slogans about cutting regulations and spending , and ending health care reform the party seems content to run out the clock on mr obama s term while doing very little on tuesday , mr obama s campaign manager , jim messina , of trying to suffocate the economy in hopes that the pain would work to their political advantage they are doing little to refute that charge their lack of serious ideas was on full display in both the senate and the presidential debate on tuesday night in new hampshire the debate was ostensibly about the economy , but when the freshest and mosttalkedabout idea is herman cain s ridiculous 999 tax plan , it is clear that the economy they were debating is not the one americans are forced to live in mr cain whose rise in the polls says everything you need to know about the amateurhour decline of his party wants to replace all federal taxes with a 9 percent levy on corporate income , personal income and sales as bruce bartlett , an economist who has worked in republican administrations , recently , it is a formula designed to cut taxes for the rich and increase them for the poor , raising the deficit and doing nothing for growth the other candidates were no less vacuous mitt romney offered an ash heap of used ideas , saying he would push a balancedbudget amendment , cut back on regulations , and go chest to chest with china on trade rick perry , when he could be stirred to speak , vowed to somehow put 12 million people to work in the energy industry , as if the whole country were texas and drills could pop up on every block republican candidates fear the tea party too much to acknowledge that economists are solidly behind government intervention to awaken growth the jobs bill rejected by republican leaders will now be reintroduced piece by piece , and republicans are not likely to go along with much more than an extension of the payroll tax cut \( which is opposed by mr romney \) but at least the record is increasingly clear who is advocating real ideas and who is selling an empty vessel
on dec 3 , 1861 , president abraham lincoln delivered his first annual message , the equivalent of our modern state of the union in the 19th century , presidents summarized progress at the end of the year rather than the beginning , which gives a little more perspective on things the phrase the state of the union dates from 1934 , when franklin d roosevelt used it for the first time nor was it spoken , as it has been , generally , since woodrow wilson chose to travel down pennsylvania avenue and deliver his message verbally in 1913 \( jimmy carter sent his in in 1981 , a confession that things had not gone so well \) instead , lincoln composed a long written document , and sent it to congress the delivery of the annual message of 1861 may have lacked the pomp and circumstance we have come to expect it was simply read and entered into the record by a clerk but lincoln had turned in another remarkable effort , the longest product of his pen since the special message of july 4 it lacks the crystalline perfection of the gettysburg address , the moral grandeur of the second inaugural , the legal impact of the emancipation proclamation it is what it is a long government document , reporting dutifully from the executive branch to the legislative , on the year that had just passed but the annual message was instantly noteworthy for two reasons 1861 was the worst year in american history , and the author was abraham lincoln there have been other dismal years 1929 and 2001 were awful in their way but 1861 was an annus horribilis by any measure eleven states had seceded and were in open rebellion the mighty union forces had inflicted little damage on the confederacy , and scattered ignominiously at bull run the trent affair was poisoning relations with britain congress was making noise about asserting control over a war that was not going well lincoln s challenge was the same that has confronted all presidents before and since how to report honestly , while avoiding gloom and finding kernels of inspiration here and there but what is the state of the union when the union barely exists \? setting out to answer that question , lincoln began solemnly , using the language of a preacher , expressing great gratitude to god for unusual good health , and most abundant harvests then he stated the case plainly a disloyal portion of the american people have , during the whole year , been engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the union from there , he surveyed the horizon , beginning with foreign policy he expressed relief that other nations had not openly supported the confederacy \( which he never called by that name \) witheringly , he condemned the south s assumption that its economic strength would bring alliances , as if nations have no higher principles than making money then he went into a long list of recommendations and announcements for congress he asked for help protecting america s borders from foreign dangers he asked that railroads be quickly built connecting sympathetic sections of middle states east tennessee and western north carolina to the rest of the union he took advantage of the relative absence of southerners to propose a modestsounding change that was revolutionary sending us diplomats to haiti and liberia , where they would presumably have to enter into normal social relations with their counterparts , and by so doing , acknowledge people of african descent as their equals with veiled sarcasm , lincoln wrote , if any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recognition of the independence and sovereignty of hayti and liberia , i am unable to discern it for over 50 years , the united states had refused to recognize haiti he reported on a balanced budget revenues \( 86 , 835 , 90027 \) exceeded expenditures \( 84 , 578 , 83447 \) for the previous fiscal year he proposed some improvements in the system of circuit courts , which varied widely from one state to another he proposed that a department of agriculture be created , to represent the largest interest of the nation he announced the successful organization of the territories of colorado , dakota and nevada he voiced sympathy for a plan by which recently freed slaves would form a colony , perhaps in a newly acquired territory he neither embraced nor rejected recent murmurs in congress that the slaves should be quickly emancipated , but retained his right to do so in the fullness of time specifically , lincoln wrote , the union must be preserved , and hence , all indispensable means must be employed we should not be in haste to determine that radical and extreme measures , which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal , are indispensable that was classic lincoln too slow for some , but on his way to the emancipation proclamation when circumstances were favorable having worked through his litany of good governance , lincoln changed his tone in the voice of a historian , he remembered his entry into the presidency , and the extraordinary events since then , recounting the story of a year that had changed everything what was painfully uncertain then , is much better defined and more distinct now , he began , and told of setbacks , and the slow stirring of unionism in crucial places like noble little delaware , maryland , missouri , kentucky and western virginia , where winter closes in on the union people , leaving them masters of their own country discussing his generals , lincoln thanked winfield scott for his long service , and ominously praised his new commander in chief , george mcclellan , by saying , it has been said that one bad general is better than two good ones \( thanks for the recommendation ! \) a normal president would have ended the annual message with a few platitudes but lincoln was stirred to higher reflection , and in so doing , he was almost certainly answering jefferson davis , who had written a president s message of his own on nov 18 davis had taken a hysterical tone , accusing the union forces of rape , arson and plunder , and turned the contest into something of a personal struggle between him and lincoln our people now look with contemptible astonishment on those with whom they had been so recently associated they shrink with aversion from the very idea of renewing such a connection when they see a president making war without the assent of congress when they behold judges threatened because they maintain the writ of habeas corpus so sacred to freemen when they see justice and law trampled under the armed heel of military authority , and upright men and innocent women dragged to distant dungeons upon the mere edict of a despot they believe that there must be some radical incompatibility between such a people and themselves there were inconsistencies in the davis message at one point , he insisted that the south would develop a steadily increasing capacity to provide its own needs , at another , he disdained the industrial system of the world , which may carry suffering to other lands as well as to our own of course , the greatest inconsistency was that he claimed to be fighting for liberty , selfgovernment and the unconquerable will to be free lincoln could not let that challenge go unheeded in response , he concluded his message with a few paragraphs on the dignity of labor if his earlier comments on the balanced budget held out inspiration for today s tea party , here was some red meat for occupy wall street labor is prior to , and independent of , capital capital is only the fruit of labor , and could never have existed if labor had not first existed labor is the superior of capital , and deserves much the higher consideration capital has its rights , which are as worthy of protection as any other rights nor is it denied that there is , and probably always will be , a relation between labor and capital , producing mutual benefits the error is in assuming that the whole labor of community exists within that relation davis had made the contest personal now lincoln answered in a deeply personal way not by attacking davis , but by remembering his own poverty if we can wonder why this southernborn politician developed such a powerful hostility to slavery , we need only listen to him on the value of working for oneself many independent men everywhere in these states , a few years back in their lives , were hired laborers the prudent , penniless beginner in the world , labors for wages awhile , saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself then labors on his own account another while , and at length hires another new beginner to help him this is the just , and generous , and prosperous system , which opens the way to all gives hope to all , and consequent energy , and progress , and improvement of condition to all no men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty none less inclined to take , or touch , aught which they have not honestly earned having finished his labor , lincoln closed , remembering that they were fighting not only for the united states of 1861 , but for a vast future when the population would be 250 million in other words , for the america of roughly 1992 eight days later , he would shore up his relationship with congress by visiting the senate chamber in person one congressman estimated that it had been 25 years since the last presidential visit that , too , hinted at the future , and the day when presidents would travel down pennsylvania avenue to bring their news to the american people historians haven t paid too much attention to this long and often tedious speech \( david donald called it perfunctory \) but once again , lincoln had found something worth fighting for by reporting honestly on a bad year , and restating that nations do indeed have higher principles , he planted a few seeds of hope before winter set in sources roy p basler \( ed \) , the collected works of abraham lincoln michael burlingame , abraham lincoln a life david donald , lincoln fred kaplan , lincoln the biography of a writer herbert mitgang \( ed \) , lincoln as they saw him

jerry j borg was a bitpart actor and a smalltime inventor , but his day job was as an accountant for new york state on sept 11 , 2001 , he was working in an office a block or two from the world trade center when the towers were attacked , mr borg and his colleagues were evacuated , and he walked home to his apartment on west 51st street a couple of months later , he began having trouble breathing and sought treatment at the world trade center environmental health center at bellevue hospital center in manhattan , one of several programs to treat people sickened by the attacks mr borg died last dec 15 of complications of pulmonary sarcoidosis , an inflammatory disease of the lungs the new york city medical examiner ruled that he had died from inhaling toxic substances in the dust cloud thrown up by the collapsing twin towers , and on friday , mr borg , who was 63 , became the 2 , 753rd official victim of the sept 11 attack on the trade center he was only the third person whose death had been ruled by the medical examiner s office to have been caused by exposure to the toxic dust cloud , although at least a dozen families have asked the medical examiner to review cases the two other deaths were of felicia dunnjones , 42 , a civil rights lawyer who ran through the dust cloud to escape her office a block away and also died of sarcoidosis , and leon heyward , 45 , a city office worker who helped evacuate colleagues , who died of sarcoidosis complicated by lymphoma the relationship between the dust cloud and various diseases is still being studied many doctors believe that exposure to the cloud , which contained lead , asbestos and other toxic substances , could cause respiratory illnesses , but whether it could cause cancer remains in dispute in march , the medical examiner collected the body of george wong , a retired police officer , from a chinatown funeral home after mr wong s doctor wrote on his death certificate that toxic particles from the trade center collapse had contributed to his death from gastric cancer mr wong s family refused an autopsy , so the medical examiner s office performed an external examination and returned the body but mr borg did not need an official ruling to tell him how he got sick , his brother , charles borg , an insurance executive living in florida , said on friday he was always healthy till that , charles borg said jerry joseph borg was born in brooklyn on march 23 , 1947 , and grew up in williamsburg , the youngest of three children of a refrigeration engineer and a homemaker he was something of a loner he never married or had children , and he died alone , his brother said in 2007 , he was granted us patent no 7 , 308 , 868 for a metal cage with spikes on the outside that campers could sleep in to prevent attacks by bears , lions and the like he was not an outdoorsman , but got the idea from the shark cage in the movie jaws , his brother said charles borg said he did not think his brother sold any of the cages mr borg also loved acting , and had a number of walkon roles , none of them speaking , in television and the movies , his brother said michael frazier , a spokesman for the national september 11 memorial and museum , said mr borg s name would be added to the memorial in time for the 10th anniversary of the attack this september charles borg said that would have been small comfort to his brother , who was not political and would not have cared about being an accidental figure of history he was in the wrong place at the wrong time , that s what he was , charles borg said this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo jerry j borg died dec 15
miami gardens , fla like many athletes , says he does not concern himself with individual accolades still , he is well aware that he has the opportunity this season to earn a singular place in history after the mets' 74 victory tuesday night at sun life stadium , reyes s batting average stood at 334 , leading the national league , just ahead of ryan braun of milwaukee brewers at 333 matt kemp of the los angeles dodgers , at 319 , is well behind in third place if reyes , who was 3 for 6 tuesday but who has been of late , can stay ahead of braun , he could become the first met to win a batting title in the club s fivedecade history for a team that has battled hard this season but is still under 500 , it would add some distinction to a long , challenging and often frustrating campaign if it happens , i mean , it s great , because not too many people have the opportunity to win a batting title in the big leagues , reyes said before tuesday s game reyes said his troublesome left hamstring had given him more than enough to occupy his mind this season on top of that , he said , he has come to realize as he has grown older that allowing himself to think about his individual statistics he is always among the leaders in triples and stolen bases had usually hampered his performance on the field still , reyes , 28 , said he did know that no met before him had won a national league batting title for that matter , no met has been proclaimed the league s most valuable player in contrast , the team has won four cy young awards , three by tom seaver , which reflects the fact that historically , the good mets teams have been better known for their pitching than for their hitting and although three mets dave kingman , darryl strawberry and howard johnson won national league home run titles , none did it emphatically each finished with fewer than 40 home runs going into this season , reyes s highest fullseason average as a met was the 300 he put together in 2006 , when the mets nearly reached the world series he has 155 hits in 464 atbats , including 27 doubles , 5 home runs and a majorleagueleading 16 triples more than anything , though , a cluster of september singles would probably give him the best chance to beat out braun i know it would mean a lot for him , third baseman david wright said of reyes and i think it would mean a lot to us as an organization wright , who was named the national league s player of the week tuesday , added you never want to be in a position this time of year where you 're rooting for individual awards but obviously , when you have a guy going for the batting title , you root for him and you want to see him get it the mets have had distinguished batting averages in their history the highest was john olerud s 354 in 1998 but the colorado rockies' larry walker bested him by 9 points that season then there was cleon jones , who hit 340 in 1969 as the mets won a championship but he was surpassed by pete rose of the cincinnati reds , who hit 348 , and roberto clemente of the pittsburgh pirates , who hit 345 more recently , wright hit 325 in 2007 , falling 15 points short of matt holiday s winning mark for the rockies although wright was clearly enthusiastic about reyes s quest , manager terry collins said he saw it differently i only care about his health , collins said of reyes that s all i care about right now reyes has twice been sidelined with hamstring injuries since the beginning of july , and collins said the fact that he was now back in the lineup was more significant than where he stood in relation to braun in the batting race he picks our guys up just by being in the lineup , collins said if he wins the batting title , i think it would be absolutely tremendous but we ca n't worry about it reyes s average peaked at 355 on july 19 , after his first game back from his initial stint on the disabled list but it has fallen slowly since then as he endured a second hamstring injury and another trip to the disabled list he has hit 272 in 26 games since july 19 , an indication that the dl stints have disrupted his hitting i'm a little bit jumpy at home plate right now , reyes said i do n't want to say i'm feeling great , but it s coming almost with that in mind , wright predicted that reyes , his fulltime partner on the left side of the infield since 2005 , would move past braun if he could regain the rhythm he had at the plate earlier in the season if jose goes out there and just does what he s capable of , he s going to win it , wright said reyes versus braun for mets fans , and players , it s something to watch in a season in which little else is at stake
chad knaus was sitting in his small , meticulous office one day last month , preparing for the sprint cup season and pondering the absurd we have the ability to win every single race , said knaus , the crew chief for the driver jimmie johnson , as if it were merely a matter of probabilities of course , it would require a level of superiority that has never been seen in nascar for one team to win all 36 races that is why knaus might be the only crew chief who would even fathom it maybe that s what separates knaus from the rest in nascar he is already the mastermind behind johnson s unprecedented five consecutive cup championships only one driver , cale yarborough , had managed as many as three titles in a row before knaus and johnson began their run in 2006 as they prepare for sunday s seasonopening daytona 500 , johnson s no 48 is favored to win it all once again six in a row \? more \? not so absurd they have the potential and the ability to keep winning until they do n't feel like it , said ray evernham , a former crew chief who won three titles with jeff gordon in the 1990s and was considered the best of his day someday , evernham may be better known as the crew chief who hired knaus , a hungry , young wannabe , to work on that famous no 24 team i think chad is far and away the best crew chief ever , and he has the credentials to prove it , evernham said knaus , 39 , is the only crew chief in the nascar garage who consistently receives as much or more credit than his driver for the success of his race team if only that were enough achieving greatness has not seemed to lessen knaus s desire to be even greater i do n't know that i 'll ever be completely satisfied , knaus said in january 2010 , before winning title no 5 it s not like you 're sitting down in front of a plate of pasta and you 're eating it until you 're full that s not the way it is we race because we enjoy it i race because i enjoy it it s fun so it s not like i'm ever going to get full knaus s father , john , a former racecar driver from rockford , ill , won his first championship at rockford speedway in the 1980s with 14yearold chad as his crew chief john knaus said he did not keep driving his son johnson said simply , i think it s just the way he s wired or fixated he went years without taking a vacation because he blamed a midseason slump early in their careers on a trip he took with johnson to mexico even now , knaus rarely stops working long enough to build a full life outside of the no 48 race team he has so far eschewed marriage and children that is also what separates him from many in the cup garage maybe he takes it to the next step , said darian grubb , the crew chief for tony stewart , who worked as an engineer under knaus for years maybe our outside distractions and stuff maybe pull us away from that myself , i have a wife and a child that travel with me i ca n't say i go back and spend 24 hours looking back at my notes knaus s dedication to the task might be unquestioned , but the means to his end have raised eyebrows he has been suspended by nascar three times , although a tworace suspension for a racecar that failed postrace inspection after winning at las vegas in 2005 was rescinded on appeal knaus was booted out of the garage before the daytona 500 in 2006 for an illegal modification on his team s racecar and suspended for four races in 2007 , he received a sixrace suspension and 100 , 000 fine for unapproved modifications knaus apologizes for none of it he is forever pushing the envelope and the rule book , looking for areas to exploit for an advantage asked how many rules had been written because of him , knaus laughed quite a few , i bet , he said , brushing off the criticism that has come with it when asked about knaus last month , the driver ryan newman said i respected the things he s accomplished i have n't always respected how he has accomplished them i do n't like being beaten by somebody that cheats or has been caught cheating that usually puts a bad taste in your mouth although his racecars are still scrutinized , knaus has not been suspended since 2007 despite the criticism , he is also respected by many when you go by the 48 , you always stare at it a little bit longer , and i think chad deserves a lot of credit for what he s done , said kevin manion , who once worked with knaus and is now the crew chief for jamie mcmurray manion has been around knaus enough to know he demands a level of perfection from his team and himself that is why he has a regimen of diet and exercise and the drug propecia because baldness just will not do for a perfectionist he probably irons his boxers , manion joked knaus s obsession with controlling every last detail of his race team nearly burned him out in 2005 and almost led to a breakup with johnson that was before their now famous meeting with the team owner rick hendrick , who served cookies on a mickey mouse plate to knaus and johnson because he thought they were behaving like children knaus toned himself down and learned to delegate , and the team began its run of five straight titles i do n't know if many drivers could handle him , johnson said i think my personality works very well with his i just let his craziness run its course knaus and johnson still have their moments , and the team struggled at times last year when a fifth title seemed in question with johnson in a tight battle with denny hamlin for the championship , knaus fired his pit crew in the middle of the race at texas , the thirdtolast race of the season it s like changing a spring or changing a shock , he said at the time with the new crew , taken from jeff gordon s pit , johnson overcame hamlin in the final race to win the title as a reward , knaus treated himself to a relatively long vacation , spending a few weeks snowboarding in colorado in the offseason he even grew a beard , even though he has bristled over johnson s facial hair for years if knaus still lives for his job , he at least now allows himself to live without it for short stretches , getting away from the shop if only for a little while i like the solitude , for sure , knaus said of his scuba diving expeditions i do n't get a lot of quiet in my life and when you get down 30 , 60 feet , it s quiet all you 've got is yourself it s nice i enjoy getting down there and all you hear is your breathing there will be little quiet in knaus s future he signed a contract extension last year and committed to being the crew chief for the no 48 through 2015 that gives him five more seasons to pull off the impossible , like winning five more titles or maybe even 36 races in a season with knaus , you never know
49ers \( 41 \) at lions \( 50 \) sunday , 1 pm line lions by 4 as surprise contenders go , the lions are hardly surprising they won their final four games last year they lost many close games in unusual ways , like when calvin johnson had a gamewinning touchdown against the bears taken away essentially because he was too blas about it last year s top draft pick , ndamukong suh , quickly developed into one of the best defenders in the league , and three long years have passed since matt millen gave one of his toughnessandattitude speeches the lions were a popular offseason sleeper pick for a wildcard berth , though it is still jarring to see them at 50 after a decade of paperbag jokes the niners are much more surprising they made few roster changes , but the new coach , jim harbaugh , is getting more from his players by asking for less , or more precisely , by asking less contentiously alex smith has become an efficient game manager after five long seasons of having to justify his existence with every throw tight end vernon davis is playing to his potential without anyone harping on him about playing to his potential cornerback carlos rogers , who had hands like elbows when he was with the redskins , has three interceptions , and the niners have eight over all it took a west coast offenseminded coach like harbaugh to finally turn the 49ers into a defenseandball control team the lions have the edge in talent , but the 49ers are more rested , less penalty prone , better on special teams and less reliant on one player \( johnson \) to provide most of their offense they also have a clearer path to the postseason , thanks to the easiest conference this side of the football championship subdivision we may be talking about a rematch in january if that happens , no one should be surprised pick niners texans \( 32 \) at ravens \( 31 \) sunday , 4 05 pm line ravens by 7 the former ravens receiver derrick mason was traded to the texans this week , meaning that he gets to play his second ravens revenge game in under a month mason is 37 , has slowed considerably in recent years , and did not do anything to endear himself to the jets , a team that asks for little in the way of endearment we would suspect that the texans signed mason to learn the secrets of the ravens offense , but the ravens offense \( run , run , long pass , run , run , long pass \) has no secrets the poor texans can never manage to get any traction as contenders just when things are going well , receiver andre johnson injures his hamstring , then pass rusher mario williams is lost for the year with a pectoral injury these are problems a short , aging , discontented wide receiver cannot solve , but if the texans can get through this week without losing one of their few remaining stars , they can look forward to a titansjaguarsbrowns run that can give them firm command of the afc south pick ravens browns \( 22 \) at raiders \( 32 \) sunday , 4 05 pm line raiders by 6 browns running back peyton hillis was criticized this week for admitting that he sought the advice of his agent before sitting out cleveland s week 4 loss to the titans with strep throat hillis is seeking a contract extension , and despite reports of a high fever before kickoff , some believe that his agent s priorities may not have been 100 percent in line with the needs of the browns , or with center for disease control guidelines to help hillis make future health decisions , here are the responses he can expect when seeking sore throat advice from several typical sources mom aw , sweetie , you get right under the covers while i fix you some chicken soup grandpa in my day , we crawled to work in the asbestos mines with two broken legs get on the field ! ethel from human resources this day counts against your 10day sick bank , which does not roll over to the next calendar year agent you are sick \? sorry to commission that make sure you take two commissions and get some commission colt mccoy no , i understand i ll just sheesh throw passes to brian robiskie , or something doctor it sounds over the phone like it s viral i cannot do anything please , no , don t schedule a visit i am too busy to deal with sick people hillis will play this week next year , he will be on the cover of the rerelease of the video game spore pick raiders eagles \( 14 \) at redskins \( 31 \) sunday , 1 pm line eagles by 1 last year , when the eagles were much more likely to humiliate than be humiliated , they delivered an epic 5928 beating to the redskins on monday night football , exposing the folly of washington s neverending quest to quickfix its roster by spending outrageous sums of money on overrated free agents who do not fit the team s system if this were a 1980s action movie , the villain \( played by alan rickman \) would arch his eyebrow and intone it seems the predator has now become the prey and you would roll your eyes , because even the sugaredup 12yearolds in the audience spotted the obvious irony pick redskins cowboys \( 22 \) at patriots \( 41 \) sunday , 4 15 pm line patriots by 7 in an effort to teach tony romo and others to make better decisions in clutch situations at the end of close games , the cowboys installed working scoreboards at their valley ranch practice facilities all teams simulate downanddistance conditions during practices \( training quarterbacks to throw past the firstdown marker on thirdandlong or avoid the middle of the field when out of timeouts in the final minute , for example \) , but the cowboys feel romo and company need more tangible visual cues we think it s valuable in recreating and simulating a game when you have that scoreboard , coach jason garrett said you have the time that everybody can see , and you understand what the situation is as concretely as possible the scoreboard replaces the poky little puppy football facts flashcards from which romo previously learned game management pick patriots panthers \( 14 \) at falcons \( 23 \) sunday , 1 pm line falcons by 4 matt ryan is just 2 of 18 , with three interceptions , on passes that travel over 20 yards in the air only three of those passes , none of them completions , were thrown to his top receiver , roddy white twelve were thrown to the rookie julio jones , an exciting young player who is not ready to assume the role of sole deep receiving threat , and should not have to the falcons get hung up on these narrowly defined roles white as possession receiver , michael turner as workhorse back , left tackle sam baker as perennial disappointment , punter matt bosher as the mistake they quietly refuse to acknowledge the falcons beat the panthers by a 3110 score in both meetings last year , but the panthers have broken their mold , and the falcons must now break theirs pick falcons colts \( 05 \) at bengals \( 32 \) sunday , 1 pm line bengals by 7 this game represents the seventh consecutive home blackout for the bengals , so local fans may not even know what the current , rebuilt roster looks like to help our friends in cincinnati visualize the action while listening to the radio , allow us to paint a picture with words 1 \) the promising rookie quarterback andy dalton looks a lot like speedy the alka seltzer tablet 2 \) the rookie receiver a j green is a dead ringer for the former bengals receiver eddie brown if you are too young to remember eddie brown , drop us an email we are really reaching out to your demographic 3 \) colts quarterback curtis painter looks like the young gregg allman and throws like the current dickey betts 4 \) colts running back joseph addai is not expected to play , so feel free to imagine the hamburglar in the backfield behind painter pick bengals rams \( 04 \) at packers \( 50 \) sunday , 1 pm line packers by 15 the rams have been outscored , 11346 , this season , and they face the packers without three of their top cornerbacks bradley fletcher joined ron bartell and jerome murphy on injured reserve when he tore his anterior cruciate ligament during a bye week practice game 6 of baseball s national league championship series between the cardinals and the brewers is scheduled for 4 05 eastern fans in wisconsin will enjoy a riveting doubleheader fans in st louis are advised to sleep late pick packers bills \( 41 \) at giants \( 32 \) sunday , 1 pm line giants by 3 the olympic gold medalwinning softball pitcher jennie finch worked out with the giants this week finch , who was at the team s practice facility to prepare for the new york city marathon , wore a brandon jacobs jersey , attempted three field goals \( making one \) and caught some passes with the tight ends she became the first person this year to make it through an entire giants practice without being injured the firstround pick prince amukamara also practiced for the first time since august , running some special teams drills but , you know , jennie finch was there pick bills jaguars \( 14 \) at steelers \( 32 \) sunday , 1 pm line steelers by 12 if you have waited a football lifetime to read the phrase disgruntled punter , you are in luck the jaguars released the disgruntled punter matt turk on wednesday after turk averaged just 377 yards per punt , including 22 and 23yarders , in their 3020 loss to the bengals i want to be where i am wanted , said turk , who was replaced by nick harris turk , a 13year veteran , felt the team was trying to make him a directional punter , even though his specialty is hang time this is what passes for an interesting jacksonville jaguars story pick steelers saints \( 41 \) at buccaneers \( 32 \) sunday , 4 15 pm line saints by 4 the saints have so many offensive threats that we can exhaust our word count just listing them all mark ingram darren sproles pierre thomas marques colston lance moore devery henderson robert meacham jimmy graham the arrival emergence of ingram , sproles and graham have made the saints both more exciting and more complicated when a player like henderson has one catch in two games , you are tempted to think something is wrong with him , when actually the saints would have to control the clock for about 80 minutes to get everyone the playing time he deserves and then there is jed collins , the littleknown fullback who has scored two touchdowns despite being surrounded by more likely goalline options you want to hate collins for hurting your fantasy team , but it is impossible to hate anyone named jed pick saints vikings \( 14 \) at bears \( 23 \) sunday , 8 20 pm line bears by 3 bears penalties , a field guide 1 \) false start , offensive tackle occurs at least every other drive caused by j marcus webb and frank omiyale s not being good players 2 \) false start , tight end occurs once per game caused by the tight end trying to get a jump on helping webb and omiyale , who are not good players 3 \) roughing the passer , opponent occurs twice per game the bears most consistently successful offensive play caused at times by jay cutler s acting skills \( he is the philip seymour hoffman of clutching his head after being hit in the forearm \) , but also by the tight ends inability to successfully help webb and omiyale , who are not good players 4 \) holding , offensive tackle occurs twice per game often declined because the defense got the sack anyway pick

directionless dolphins every time a quarterback of moore s caliber or worse takes over a team this year , a loud contingent of fans begins rooting for that team to start losing games so it can draft the stanford superstar andrew luck with the first overall pick in a few weeks , luck will graduate from being the next john elway to being the next winston churchill , and fans in miami , indianapolis

the supreme court ruled three decades ago in that a federal prisoner could sue for money damages from prison employees who abused his constitutional rights on tuesday , in , the court heard the government and others contend that a prisoner held in a facility operated by a private contractor cannot bring this kind of action the court should reject this argument if not , it will allow the government to contract away prisoners' constitutional rights and contract away its own responsibility to protect individuals imprisoned under the law while incarcerated for 20 months in a privately run facility , richard lee pollard fell and broke his elbows , a serious injury when he sought medical treatment , he was refused a splint to help repair his arms and forced to wear a handcufflike device that caused him tremendous pain if he had been in a governmentrun prison , he clearly could have sued those who mistreated him for damages the private facility where mr pollard was imprisoned was different only in ownership it operated under federal authority and functioned as a government facility those who worked there or provided services for it were operating under the color of federal law , a critical test the government and others also contend that such actions are reserved for extraordinary circumstances where the person alleging injury has no other basis for suing because , for example , state law provides no remedy and that mr pollard could have brought a civil action under tort law in state court but after the court held that is no substitute because of the vagaries of state laws , congress twice affirmed the right to sue officials for redress in federal court matters so much because one of every six federal prisoners is now held in a privately run facility , compared with none two decades ago private facilities also house half the federal immigration detainees bad as many governmentrun prisons are , some privately run prisons may well be worse there is mounting evidence that private prisons pay guards less , have smaller staffs and give limited training , reducing the level of care and oversight and exposing prisoners to greater threats to health and safety the prisons and the people who work there must be held accountable when they badly perform this role of government
if you have a child entering grade school this fall , file away just one number with all those backtoschool forms 65 percent chances are just that good that , in spite of anything you do , little oliver or abigail won t end up a doctor or lawyer or , indeed , anything else you ve ever heard of according to cathy n davidson , codirector of the annual macarthur foundation digital media and learning competitions , fully 65 percent of today s gradeschool kids may end up doing work that hasn t been invented yet so abigail won t be doing genetic counseling oliver won t be developing android apps for currency traders or cochairing google s philanthropic division even those digitalage careers will be old hat maybe the grownup oliver and abigail will program webenabled barrettes or quilt with scraps of berber tents or maybe they ll be plying a trade none of us oldtimers will even recognize as work for those twothirds of gradeschool kids , if for no one else , it s high time we redesigned american education as ms davidson puts it pundits may be asking if the internet is bad for our children s mental development , but the better question is whether the form of learning and knowledgemaking we are instilling in our children is useful to their future in her galvanic new book , now you see it , ms davidson asks , and ingeniously answers , that question one of the nation s great digital minds , she has written an immensely enjoyable omnimanifesto that s officially about the brain science of attention but the book also challenges nearly every assumption about american education don t worry she doesn t conclude that students should study photoshop instead of geometry , or linux instead of pax romana what she recommends , in fact , looks much more like a classical education than it does the industrialera holdover system that still informs our unrenovated classrooms simply put , we can t keep preparing students for a world that doesn t exist we can t keep ignoring the formidable cognitive skills they re developing on their own and above all , we must stop disparaging digital prowess just because some of us over 40 don t happen to possess it an institutional grudge match with the young can sabotage an entire culture when we criticize students for making digital videos instead of reading gravity s rainbow , or squabbling on politicocom instead of watching the candidate , we are blinding ourselves to the world as it is and then we re punishing students for our blindness those hallowed artifacts the thomas pynchon novel and the michael ritchie film had a place in earlier social environments while they may one day resurface as relevant , they are now chiefly of interest to cultural historians but digital video and web politics are intellectually robust and stimulating , profitable and even pleasurable the contemporary american classroom , with its grades and deference to the clock , is an inheritance from the late 19 th century during that period of titanic change , machines suddenly needed to run on time individual workers needed to willingly perform discrete operations as opposed to whole jobs the industrialera classroom , as a training ground for future factory workers , was retooled to teach tasks , obedience , hierarchy and schedules that curriculum represented a dramatic departure from earlier approaches to education in now you see it , ms davidson cites the elite socratic system of questions and answers , the agrarian method of problemsolving and the apprenticeship program of imitating a master it s possible that any of these educational approaches would be more appropriate to the digital era than the one we have now to take an example of just one classroom convention that might be inhibiting today s students teachers and professors regularly ask students to write papers semester after semester , year after year , papers are styled as the highest form of writing and semester after semester , teachers and professors are freshly appalled when they turn up terrible ms davidson herself was appalled not long ago when her students at duke , who produced witty and incisive blogs for their peers , turned in disgraceful , unpublishable term papers but instead of simply carping about students with colleagues in the great facultylounge tradition , ms davidson questioned the whole form of the research paper what if bad writing is a product of the form of writing required in school the term paper and not necessarily intrinsic to a student s natural writing style or thought process \? she adds what if research paper is a category that invites , even requires , linguistic and syntactic gobbledygook \? what if , indeed after studying the matter , ms davidson concluded , online blogs directed at peers exhibit fewer typographical and factual errors , less plagiarism , and generally better , more elegant and persuasive prose than classroom assignments by the same writers in response to this and other research and classroom discoveries , ms davidson has proposed various ways to overhaul schoolwork , grading and testing her recommendations center on one of the most astounding revelations of the digital age even academically reticent students publish work prolifically , subject it to critique and improve it on the internet this goes for everything from political commentary to still photography to satirical videos all the stuff that parents and teachers habitually read as distraction a classroom suited to today s students should deemphasize solitary piecework it should facilitate the kind of collaboration that helps individuals compensate for their blindnesses , instead of cultivating them that classroom needs new ways of measuring progress , tailored to digital times rather than to the industrial age or to some artsy utopia where everyone gets an awesome for effort the new classroom should teach the huge array of complex skills that come under the heading of digital literacy and it should make students accountable on the web , where they should regularly be aiming , from gradeschool on , to contribute to a wide range of wiki projects as scholarly as now you see it is as rooted in field experience , as well as rigorous history , philosophy and science this book about education happens to double as an optimistic , even thrilling , summer read it supplies reasons for hope about the future take it to the beach that much hope , plus that much scholarship , amounts to a distinctly unguilty pleasure
in the nov 13 issue of the book review , the documentarian stephen king s new novel , 11 22 63 the book , like the film morris is currently completing , is about the assassination of john f kennedy because of their overlapping interests , and because mr morris s technique as a filmmaker is to chase down every clue , he requested an interview with mr king after finishing his review the resulting q and a is below , with mr morris s introduction the editors stephen king s new novel inhabits a gray area between fact and fiction it tells the story of lee and marina oswald in the years leading up to the kennedy assassination but this isn t just historical fiction it s a fictional vision of a historical event that has never been satisfactorily explained to write the true history of the kennedy assassination , we need to know it but how much do we know of what really happened \? king believes that oswald is guilty , and argues in terms of the stories we tell about that day early in the novel , he writes in an afterword , jake epping s friend al puts the probability that oswald was the lone gunman at 95 percent after reading a stack of books and articles on the subject almost as tall as i am , i d put the probability at 98 percent , maybe even 99 because all of the accounts , including those written by conspiracy theorists , tell the same simple american story here was a dangerous little fame junkie who found himself in the right place to get lucky errol morris aren t you going to have to deal with that whole lone gunman versus conspiracy thing \? the endless debates about what really happened \? stephen king well , i ll tell you what i m prepared for trouble when the book comes out conspiracy people guard themselves pretty jealously they have their theories and some of them are pretty complex , and some of them are pretty simple some of them have been disproved but one of the things that sticks in my mind is that none of them has been proved none of them so it s like ufos if they re really ufos , how come one has never landed , or we ve never been given definitive proof \? but , do you have to resolve these questions \? is it even possible \? nearly 50 years later , people are still arguing about it in the afterword , you caution people that this is not history no it is a novel but resolved or unresolved , the mystery of what happened stands behind everything it is perhaps unavoidable there are cases where you have the feeling of puzzle pieces coming together where the evidence leads to a conclusion but there are other cases that devolve into chaos , confusion the kennedy assassination , i would argue , is one of them the question is , why \? what happened \? why did it become an investigative morass \? well , the reason is , i would say , because ruby shot oswald and when ruby shot oswald , he shut his mouth he permanently silenced him so there was never any light cast from that standpoint as a result , you have all these witnesses who stepped forward who saw this and saw that and saw guys on the grassy knoll and this and that and the other thing it s a little bit like the blind man describing the elephant one s got the trunk and says it s a snake and one s got a leg and says it s a tree one s got an ear and says it s a banana plant they all say different things because none of them can see the whole thing the only one who could really tell us what happened is dead i m not saying he would have , but i think he would have , i believe he would have , if he did it and i do think he did it you mention in your afterword thomas mallon s novel mrs paine s garage mallon chronicles the relationship between the oswalds and the paines , quakers who befriended them they are of particular historical interest because oswald s mannlichercarcano rifle was stored in the paines garage yes he has a good take on conspiracy people and norman mailer , who provides an epigram at the beginning of the book , says people find it very difficult to believe it could have happened the way it happened because it suggests an absurd universe but there it is the line is pretty conclusive to me the mailorder gun that he bought he used that gun to try to shoot gen edwin walker and that s the gun that was found at the depository with his fingerprints on it and then he ran , he shot the police officer j d tippit , and they caught him to me , that s it the chain of events seems outrageous , but let me tell you a story this happened a couple of weeks ago in the midwest this guy won the lottery , he won a million dollars or something on the lottery maybe it was multimillions but you know how it is , it s a great human interest story so the press comes and this film crew from one of the local stations says to him , we want to recreate you winning the lottery you know where this is going , right \? i m not sure the book that i wrote is a timetravel story stephen king bear with me so they went to the store where he had bought the scratch ticket and won the million dollars and they filmed , and he scratched the ticket and he said , holy i just won another 100 , 000 now , that s the sort of thing where if you re not there , if you re not part of it , you just say to yourself , this is just absurd but it happens all the time oswald just happened to be at the right place at the right time he and his wife were effectively done , and she was living with mrs paine out in irving he used to come on the weekends , but that week , he came on thursday the night before the assassination and it seems pretty clear from his actions and from the things he said that he had decided to do this , but that he could be persuaded to change his mind he and marina went to bed that night and in bed , he asked her , is there a chance that we can get back together \? and she was very cold to him she said , no , i don t think that s ever going to happen , lee and in the morning , he left his wedding ring and he left all the money in his pockets in a teacup in the kitchen for her and that was it there is this chain of ifs , but really , it s as simple as that he wanted to shoot somebody he wanted to be somebody famous it s all there the pieces all click together pretty nicely and yet you don t really believe in coincidences , do you \? yes , i do the book that i wrote is a timetravel story the coincidences are minimized by this idea that the past tries to echo itself over and over again but it s not fate when somebody wins the lottery some guy picks numbers , or the computer picks numbers , and those numbers come up you know \? it s a coincidental world you have created a rabbit hole into the past but the kennedy assassination has always struck me as the mother of all rabbit holes you disappear into it and never emerge again the books get longer and longer as people write them they started out at a couple of hundred pages and now , the books have metastasized vincent bugliosi s book , reclaiming history , is , i don t know , more than a thousand pages with a cdrom that adds a couple of thousand more yes that s one i didn t read the mailer book , oswald s tale , is 800 pages long that s a pretty long one he goes way back to marina s antecedents in russia and all the rest but when people bring it up , i m just going to say , you believe what you believe my wife believes it s a conspiracy you mentioned that in the afterword , that you and your wife disagreed she loved john kennedy in a way that i never did i grew up in a republican household , though my mother cried her eyes out when kennedy got shot little johnjohn salutes the casket when it goes by you couldn t help it , whether you were republican or democrat i don t know what would happen now , but i do know one of the reasons to write the book was because there s so much hate in the air now , so much hate a lot of it s directed at obama i think i decided i wanted to write this book when obama was giving the state of the union speech and that guy shouted , you lie ! you know \? it s a real change in american politics , and it goes back to kennedy , because people hated that guy , too , until he died one of the things that i liked about the book is what i keep thinking of as twin mysteries there s the mystery of whether one man can change the world by going back in time will it be for the better or for the worse \? right , the consequences yes , the consequences of changing the world , if one could do so the other thing , which i really , really like , is that even if we go back into the past , history remains a mystery is lee harvey oswald guilty \? your protagonist still has to investigate , because he s a good man he doesn t want to kill somebody just for the sake of killing somebody it would be immoral , it would be wrong it would be wrong before he can act , he has to give himself some assurance that he s acting correctly , that he s acting responsibly so all of that stuff , placing the surveillance equipment in the oswald apartment oh god , that was hard the guy and his wife spoke russian the whole time that was the worst part of writing the book i hope it s not too boring i loved that part what was so hard about it \? well , there was certain information i wanted to put across about how they got along and about lee harvey oswald s mother , who was just a harridan and his feelings about socialism , how they changed , how he felt about cuba and i thought , the guy lives across the street i don t want a lot of technological huggermugger i don t really want to get bogged down in a lot of detail , you know \? there are these forces of malefaction , and then there s one scene that i wanted to ask you about , where you make your argument for why kennedy is a good man it s this moment with a gentleman in an alpine hat and lederhosen where the guy s playing hail to the chief on the accordion for the president it s one of my favorite things in the whole book you can watch it online it s one of the places where you see kennedy as a real guy i think it s tampa and it s the same car , and kennedy does the same thing where he gets out of the car and he walks into the crowd you can see the secret service people are just going absolutely nuts about this and there s not a thing they can do about it , because that s the way he was he really wanted to be with people and touch people i don t want a lot of technological huggermugger i don t really want to get bogged down in a lot of detail , you know \? stephen king and you liked it so much because \? because it was human you know , it was just a human moment it humanizes him , and changes him it s a firstperson narrative , and the best i could do is to try to humanize people from afar see oswald a little bit , and show that he s not completely a monster he did apparently love his kids he didn t beat them he only beat his wife i didn t want them to be figures on a chessboard , ok \? best i can do it s a sentimental book in a lot of ways , but sentiment s a part of life i tried not to wallow in it but there s also evil well , i try to shy away from the word evil because it s so simple to say , well , these things happen because there s evil in the world and as you say , most of it s just little evil but if it s all connected maybe it is big evil and maybe we don t need to say that right out loud i also wanted to ask you about the difficulty of actually writing something that is connected with real history well , i never tried anything like that before , and i m not sure that i would ever want to try again , because , man , it was too much like work i mean , i ve done stuff that s used reality as a base before in this case , that s why i stopped the first time i tried it i was teaching school , and it was 1971 and i was in the teachers room and people were talking about the kennedy assassination the 22nd would roll around and people would talk and write about the assassination and stuff i guess somebody must have said , what would it have been like if kennedy had lived \? and i thought to myself , i d love to write a story about that but there are so many real people , and there s the whole idea of trying to integrate the past and make it real and it just seemed too big to me at that time , and it was big i ve still got a roomful of research materials then once you start , the other trick is to not make it into something that s boring , that s all history look what i read , and here are these interesting facts i didn t want to do a james michener thing well , your romance intersects with history it s not historical per se it s a love story , and the fact that you re off in a small town and not in the middle of everything allows you to write something that goes well beyond a collection of facts yes , a real novel but most of the stuff about oswald and marina that i thought is interesting is true , and a lot of the stuff about marguerite oswald is true i just tried not to overwhelm the reader with it and the idea of making the future worse \? well , that was always going to be the kicker for the book when i actually sat down to write the book , i started to ask people my wife was a history major and i asked her , well , what would have happened if kennedy had lived \? and i asked some other people finally , i went to doris kearns goodwin , who was an aide for johnson in those days , and her husband , dick goodwin , who was part of the kennedy team and i asked them to sort of spitball about things that might have happened if kennedy had lived and one of the things they pointed out it s a weakness with obama , too kennedy was inexperienced enough to have a real difficult time dealing with the senate and the house of representatives johnson was much better at it he was able to push a lot of stuff through he was very canny about it johnson said , well , we ought to do this , this and this to help memorialize our dead jack kennedy and so we got the civil rights thing and a bunch of other stuff as well , including medicare , i think and the chances that kennedy would have done this or have been able to do this a lot smaller it was doris who said i thought of this , but it just seemed so wild wallace might really have gotten elected in 1968 it s fascinating , though , isn t it \? that one minute less than a minute in dallas , and everything s up for grabs i believe in those watershed moments in 1999 , i got hit by a van and almost killed i was out taking a walk in the afternoon i ve thought back on that many times and i m thinking if i d left a minute earlier or if i d left a minute later , if i d stayed another 15 minutes at lunch , if somebody had dropped by if , if , if but those things didn t happen , so i happened to be at that one particular place at that one particular time and something happened that changed my life today , it probably doesn t matter if we talk until 10 minutes of 1 or 10 minutes past 1 , things are going to go pretty much as planned most days , they do but not always did you change your view of the past at all in writing this \? i don t think so i think that it clarified a little bit when you write about the past , the more you write , the clearer the past becomes it s like being regressed under hypnosis my view of the past is that attitudes change , but they change very slowly underneath , they stay pretty much the same the fundamental things apply as time goes by indeed your protagonist is sort of guilttripped into the past he wasn t even alive when kennedy was shot but he has nothing to lose his life is a shambles my view of the past is that attitudes change , but they change very slowly underneath , they stay pretty much the same stephen king well , it s true that he doesn t have much of a life in 2011 he goes back into the past and finds a life , which is probably another kind of romantic , sentimental idea , but i like it i like the idea that he finds somewhere that he would like to stay , and i like it at the end he realizes that he cannot if he learns anything , he learns that you have to leave things alone things are better left the way that they are do you think that s true \? no , i don t think it s true for us , because we can t see the future we don t know the influence that our actions have it s something that s unique to the timetraveler s story he s screwing with the cogs and wheels of the universe but for most of us , we go along and we do the best that we can and we try not to hurt other people most of us do , anyway i guess there are always , you know , the ted bundys of the world if you could go back and stop hitler or something like that , you would , wouldn t you \? would i stop hitler \? yes yes , sure you would my mother s dead , but i think my mother would be proud of me but , of course , she wouldn t know who hitler was because he would have been totally whisked off the stage this book is , in a way , like a photo negative of my novel the dead zone in that book , johnny smith is the guy in the high place with the rifle who feels like he s seen the future he s seen this guy , greg stillson , and he sees what he s going to do when he becomes president , because he has this precognitive talent and he feels like he has to kill him at the last moment , fate intervenes i got really uncomfortable with the idea of saying , well , under certain circumstances , assassination is a good thing and this book is a chance to do it the other way and to take the assassination back philosophers have endlessly speculated about the nature of evil why there has to be evil well , it does seem to me that , without evil , there is no good , because we wouldn t have anything to compare it to but in your novel , history seems to involve a kind of balancing act between good and evil we don t know the interrelationship of things what you call the butterfly effect change one thing in the hope of making the world a better place , and something s going to happen to make the world even worse well , ray bradbury called it the butterfly effect before me it s also been called the rube goldberg effect where you see the world as an infernal machine when you pull lever a , spring b hits cog c the next thing you know , the models are all over the floor i m not saying it s the way things are , but it s certainly plausible i tried as much as i could when i wrote the book not to get caught up in any of the paradoxes and things that go along with time travel well , the book is really not about time travel per se not at all not at all it s just a device it s a device to allow us to examine fate , love , memory , history and as such , it s truly compelling you know what \? it s like gulliver s travels swift never goes into this big long thing about well , there was a genetic mutation and therefore these people became small , and all the rest we don t really care about that it s just the idea they re there then we can use it to examine real life
medicaid is under assault these days from nearly every direction governors complain that they cannot afford to put up their share of the money congressional republicans led by paul ryan want to reduce the federal contribution by 771 billion over the next decade and shift more costs to the states and lowincome americans president obama has expressed willingness to cut washington s contribution by 100 billion over that period to help reduce the deficit meanwhile , conservative critics of medicaid and of health care reform s requirement to expand it have made the outlandish claim that it provides such poor care that enrollees would be better off having no coverage they cite a few studies that seemed to show that , in some cases , patients on medicaid had worse outcomes than those without any insurance they claim this is because medicaid pays so poorly that many doctors refuse to treat the patients , who are then unable to get care or go to the leastskilled doctors those claims have now been refuted by a new study of oregon s program , conducted under the leadership of katherine baicker , a harvard health economics professor who was an adviser to president george w bush , and amy finkelstein , an economics professor at mit it found that medicaid patients reported both better health and more financial stability than uninsured poor people the research was made possible by unusual circumstances in oregon , where officials had only enough money to expand medicaid enrollments by about 10 , 000 people in 2008 they used a lottery to decide who got coverage among the almost 90 , 000 people who applied that made it possible to conduct a gold standard clinical trial in which two randomly selected groups with the same demographic characteristics could be compared those who won the lottery and those who did not none of the studies cited by the critics had randomly selected control groups the oregon study provides striking results for its first year the group that gained medicaid coverage was significantly more likely to have received care from a hospital or a doctor , or to use prescription drugs , belying the notion that enrollees could not find providers the insured group was far more likely to get preventive care , like mammograms , and to have a regular doctor those people were also more likely to report being in better physical and mental health and they were better off financially less likely to pay out of pocket , have unpaid medical bills sent to collection agencies , or need to borrow money or ignore other bills to pay for medical care the critics rightly point out that just because the medicaid enrollees reported that their health was better does not mean that it actually was better in the second year , researchers are measuring actual blood pressure , cholesterol levels , blood sugar and other physical data the study estimated that the additional care the new enrollees got drove up spending \( from all sources \) on the average individual by about 775 , roughly 25 percent , above the 3 , 200 average for the uninsured control group any politicians eager to find savings by denying poor people access to medicaid should recognize that they will be harming the health and financial wellbeing of highly vulnerable americans expanding medicaid will increase spending in the short run but the nation will benefit from a healthier , more productive population that , in the long run , may have less need for costly medical services
steven cohen is the new secretary to gov andrew m cuomo , among his most powerful aides so please do n't confuse him with steve cohen , the memphis congressman , or steven a cohen the billionaire hedge fund manager or the two steve cohens who are experts on israel often quoted in the new york times and other newspapers steven m cohen at hebrew union college in new york and stephen p cohen at the institute for middle east peace and development , also in new york and though they have the same middle initial , the latter should not be mistaken for the stephen p cohen who is an expert on south asian politics at the brookings institution and he should not be confused with columbia university s steven a cohen , who is director of its environmentally focused earth institute or new york university s stephen f cohen , who is a professor of russian studies and history none of the above is the steve cohn who was a democratic district leader in brooklyn for many years , until he decided not to seek reelection in 2010 \( his son sought his seat and lost \) the world is filled with accomplished steven cohens or so it might seem when entering the realms of academia or public policy , which seem to be populated by a profusion of quotable steven cohens a search of wikipedia has articles on no less than 12 steven or stephen cohens , including a wrestler , a magician and a soccer player , and not including stephen cohn , a composer of concert and film music to be one of these steve cohens , however , can mean wrestling with the muddles growing out of their identical or nearly identical names i believe i'm the third one my wife went out with , said the environmental steven cohen , who also blogs for the huffington post he also had the misfortune of ending up in the same building on morningside heights where the russian studies stephen cohen had once lived , so he spent a good deal of time forwarding mail and google has only made it worse , he said i get emails from people asking me about jewish social policy or russian politics and i refer them to the other steve cohens this mr cohen met mr cuomo s steven m cohen a former federal prosecutor during the campaign for governor because he was asked to write position papers on energy and the environment he was a very nice guy , he said of the governor s steve cohen there was , of course , confusion stephen cohen , the russian expert , recalls receiving an enveloping bear hug from bill clinton at a fundraiser about six years ago because the former president wanted to consult about middle eastern policy and thought he was buttonholing that stephen cohen more than coincidence may explain this plethora of namesakes , and there are several steven cohens with the credentials to provide an analysis steven m cohen , the professor of jewish social policy at hebrew union college in greenwich village , pointed out that cohen is the most common jewish name and steven or stephen was a popular name for baby boomers , adds the environmental steven cohen , particularly among jewish parents wanting to brand their children with an americanized moniker those boomer steven cohens have now reached their 50s and 60s , an age where their reputations have been burnished so it is no surprise that there are so many steven cohens at the peak of their careers , said the jewish social policy steven cohen that steven cohen also thinks that it should not be surprising that many professors have the name cohen because a high proportion of jews work in academia the abundance of namesakes explains why so many steven cohens are insistent about using their middle initials some might speculate that the prominence of steven cohens has to do with the fact that almost all cohens are descendants of the esteemed priests the cohanim that tended the jewish temple however , the environmental mr cohen said that he is not such a descendant his last name was given to his grandfather by an ellis island immigration official looking to simplify a nowobscure eastern european name not all steven cohens have distinguished themselves in a way that promotes pride among their doppelgangers indeed , wikipedia shows that a stephen m cohen was accused by a federal court in california of fraudulently acquiring control of the domain name sexcom in 1995 not long after he spent time in prison for bankruptcy fraud and other names are common enough to have generated numerous wikipedia entries mark levine , say , or steve ross , or john williams , a name that includes an awardwinning composer and two authors , one black and one white , who were often confused with each other charles m newman , a professor at the courant institute of mathematical sciences at new york university and a probability expert , said , these kinds of coincidences are not as unusual as they sometimes sound if steven cohen is a common name , then a certain percentage of them would be well known , depending on what threshold one uses for fame his own name , he pointed out , is relatively common four years ago , he found himself somewhat unnerved by opening the times and seeing an obituary of a namesake , the editor of a literary magazine he was relieved when he read that the literary charles newman had been married five times the mathematical charles newman has only been married once do you have a name that seems to have you coming and going \? and , if so , does it bring you pride or is it unsettling \? let us know in the comments box below this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo the steven cohen who works for gov andrew m cuomo , not to be confused with \( photograph by chang w lee the new york times \)
joe korziuk has spent 23 years working for washing trucks , delivering packages and driving tractor trailers though he loves the job , it has a downside at 45 , he has had surgery on both knees and a shoulder , developed bulging disks in his back and sustained a concussion when boxes fell on him it s a direct result of the job , mr korziuk said they 're always harping on you and pushing you to go faster and faster mr korziuk was among about 1 , 200 members of teamsters local 705 representing several hubs in the chicago area who began a campaign last week demanding that ups reduce workloads and change what the union calls a blame the worker approach to health and safety on april 28 , teamsters nationwide wore stickers reading unfair production standards , a play on the name ups employees said they were pressured to increase productivity while at the same time they were pushed to reduce injuries , a combination that workers claim leads many of them to avoid reporting injuries workers and union officials said the health and safety issues at ups affected tens of thousands of employees they also said the issues symbolized larger trends in many workplaces where people were pressured to work longer and harder , resulting in more physical effects , even as longterm job security and health care access had become more precarious ups officials say safety is a top priority and note that their latest statistics on reported injuries are lower than national averages for the courier and messenger industry 16 injuries per 200 , 000 work hours for employees at the addison hub and 36 for ups workers nationwide the industry average is 47 injuries per 200 , 000 hours ups workers are required to memorize and frequently recite a list of more than 20 safety standards , and they can be fired if they fail the recitation multiple times , according to workers and to a disciplinary report reviewed by the chicago news cooperative supervisors regularly observe workers and document safety lapses after employees report injuries , they are required to meet with company health and safety specialists and get extra training workers said that the company called people who had been injured multiple times repeaters and that those people were more frequently monitored by supervisors some employees said they felt as though the safety programs were based on the premise that workers would not get hurt if they followed proper procedures they said workers frequently did not report injuries to avoid angering supervisors or to avoid extra training and scrutiny ups officials said additional monitoring and other procedures were important to make sure workers understood safety protocol if you have a strain , sprain or rupture to your knee , back or shoulder , no matter how minor it is , we 're going to do a few things with that person , said steve vaughn , manager for the corporate comprehensive health and safety process at the addison facility we have online assessments to reeducate them on safe work methods if i strain my shoulder , there will be occupational health education on how your shoulder works , on how to eliminate the risk from being injured again the company s delivery drivers usually pick up or deliver about 500 packages a day and make up to 20 stops an hour , workers said they are supposed to handle packages , often several at a time , of up to 70 pounds without assistance workers who drive tractor trailers from one ups facility to another are expected to take 3657 minutes to perform a list of more than 100 tasks , including inspecting and testing brakes and lights and checking connections between the tractors and their trailers it s not only doable , but it s doable with ease , mr vaughn said many tractor trailer drivers disagree they said they found it nearly impossible to complete the checklist in the allotted time , and they added that their bosses often looked the other way as the safety checklists were ignored sometimes the supervisor just slaps your door closed and says go you do n't even get to eyeball your load to make sure the weight is distributed safely , said bernie jayne , a 57yearold driver so you 're driving down the road with a mud flap dangling or a lug nut loose they turn a blind eye until something happens mr korziuk said that in march he was ordered to drive a tractor trailer 20 miles from the suburban willow springs sorting facility to the addison hub , even though the rig had a red tag on it that meant it was not to be driven one of the untended problems was loose rollers on the rear sliding door with the rollers missing , the back door was swinging and more rollers could have come flying off on the road , he said it was dangerous workers said they were afraid of being disciplined or fired if they disobeyed supervisors' orders last spring , the ordered u p s to pay more than 100 , 000 to a missouri driver who had been fired for refusing orders to drive a vehicle without working lights ups workers in the chicago area said they also dealt with hazards like falling packages and dangerous machinery in november 2009 , osha cited the company s palatine facility for safety violations including missing guardrails , unsafe ladders and the lack of emergency shutoff mechanisms for conveyor belts a company spokesman said ups was negotiating with osha over those citations and had contested some of them many drivers say they enjoy relatively good wages and benefits , and do not want to risk being fired for disobeying orders , complaining about company procedures or getting injured but dan mcmackin , a company spokesman and former driver , said he found it ludicrous that workers would fear retaliation for reporting injuries our whole system is set up to report injuries , mr mcmackin said we do it better than anyone the company s approach is an example of behaviorbased safety programs that have become increasingly popular among employers since the 1980s it s the idea that danger does not exist structurally in the work itself , that danger is a choice generated by individual behavior , said robert bruno , a university of illinois at chicago professor who spent time in the willow springs ups hub while researching a 2003 book on the teamsters it s an attempt to persuade workers that regardless of how your body is physically distorted , how many times you bend over or unpack a truck , that none of that really has any kind of a detrimental effect on the body it s all in their mind and attitude , mr bruno said it s like saying a mine is safe if you are just attentive to the risk mr mcmackin said the company programs were intended to improve employees' attitudes toward safety and used frequent observation to see if workers were following safety rules several workers at facilities around chicago said that they found the safety programs humiliating and punitive , and that group rewards for low injury rates meant workers were under peer pressure not to report injuries it s fear and shame it s like third grade , said anthony prince , a lawyer for local 705 gary coveny , a retired driver , said that in his 28 years with the company he was often in trouble because of injuries he had surgery on a shoulder and a wrist and twice on an ankle i was a bad example for other people , mr coveny said i was getting so torn up , but i just kept hanging in there i had so much invested there are a lot of injuries because they push you so hard if they gave you the right amount of time , people would n't have to get hurt
hamburg , germany it is a worrisome time in this wealthy port city , known for its 19thcentury churches and busy canals , where more than 100 people have fallen ill since the outbreak of a potentially lethal form of e coli , putting 20 patients in intensive care , including five pregnant women adding to the anxiety is the failure , so far , to identify the source of the infection very mysterious , said dr j rg f debatin , medical director at the university medical center , hamburgeppendorf hamburg is a proud and diverse city that has found itself at the center of global crises before it struggled to counter its reputation as a breeding ground for islamic extremism after it was revealed that some of the men who carried out the terrorist attacks on sept 11 , 2001 , lived , studied , worshiped and plotted here it has inched its way back , attracting tourists and young people who regularly fill its bars and restaurants and stroll its sprawling red light district , the largest in europe this time , the scare is over a health crisis that appears to have emerged in or around the city since the outbreak four weeks ago , 18 people have died and 1 , 730 have fallen ill , including 520 who have developed the most serious complications , known as hemolytic uremic syndrome , or hus the robert koch institute , germany s disease control agency , said the majority of the most serious infections have been reported within a short driving distance from the city 97 here , 143 in schleswigholstein , 82 in north rhinewestphalia and 51 in lower saxony in the united states , health officials said that the strain of e coli involved in the outbreak was rare but not unknown an unusual aspect of the outbreak is that the bacteria has incubated for as long as 12 days in the intestines of those infected before they became sick typically , e coli infections take three days to turn into fullblown illness the long incubation period makes it even more difficult for investigators to track the source of the outbreak on friday , as panic continued to grip the streets here and across europe , officials cautiously said the peak of the crisis might have passed the situation seems to have calmed somewhat , as far as the number of new infections is concerned , said dr reinhard brunkhorst , the president of the german nephrology society but experts said it was too soon to say if that was the case , adding that while they believed tomatoes , cucumbers and lettuce were the source of the bacteria , they were not sure researchers believe that because a high number of infections spread across a single region of one country , the bacteria probably entered the food chain after leaving farms , but before the produce was sold directly to consumers , said jonathan fletcher , a senior lecturer in microbiology at the university of bradford in england the distribution suggests this was n't at the point of origin because given the way food chains work these days that means it would have already spread more widely across europe and possibly the world , he said at the same time , this has already traveled far enough to suggest that not just one stall or supermarket was responsible none of this speculation , though , did anything to calm a jittery public , especially in a nation where people are generally risk averse i stopped eating salads as soon as i heard about the outbreak , said holger schettler , a 68yearold sailor visiting hamburg i will not eat another bit of salad until they find the causes his wife nodded in agreement tuti fernanco , a waiter at vesuvio restaurant , which is near hamburg s main railway station , said i have n't sold a green salad for days customers just ask for broccoli , or chips no more salads none i am really surprised by the public reaction hlakan dogan , manager of a d ner kebab takeaway stand close to the central shopping mall , said he was experiencing the same thing customers are very , very cautious now , he said you can no longer automatically serve a salad with the kebab not surprisingly , vegetable vendors said their businesses were suffering at hamburg s fruit , vegetable and flower market , one of europe s largest , there were few customers and lots of angry and bewildered merchants watching their inventories spoil the market was built in 1962 , and , until recently , annual sales were running close to 3 billion torsen berens , the market manager , said he could not say precisely how much sales had fallen all i can say is that it s bad , very bad , he said let s hope they find the source
i see some commenters reacting to the failure of major inflation to break out by insisting that inflation is defined as an increase in the monetary base that is , the bank reserves plus currency that are what increases when the fed prints money as it happens , that s wrong very old dictionaries defined inflation as a rise in money and or credit , but the modern usage is , of course , a rise in prices but that s really a side issue nobody would care about the size of the monetary base except for the belief that increasing the base leads to a rise in prices that s not a question of definitions , it s a question of your model of the economy the underlying belief of all the people accusing ben bernanke of doing something dastardly is that printing money has caused or will cause high inflation in the ordinary sense the thing is , of course , that the past three years the postlehman era during which the fed presided over a tripling of the monetary base have been an excellent test of that model , which has failed with flying colors here are the data i ve included commodity prices \( imf index \) as well as consumer prices for the people who believe that the bls is hiding true inflation \( which it isn t \) a couple of notes for the commodity prices it matters which month you start , because they dropped sharply between august and september 2008 i use the imf index for convenience easy to download \( thomson reuters i use when i just want to snatch a picture from bloomberg \) but none of this should matter when you triple the monetary base , the resulting inflation shouldn t be something that depends on the fine details unless the model is completely wrong and the model is completely wrong you don t get more conclusive tests than this in economics by contrast , the model of an economy in a liquidity trap , in which big increases in the monetary base don t matter , comes through just fine and this in turn tells you something about the people pushing this stuff they had a model it made predictions the predictions were utterly , totally wrong and they have just dug in further

paris this is a grumpy french presidential campaign , with only a few voters passionate about their choices it could be called the election of d \? mour , one of those nearly untranslatable words , meaning a falling out of love , a disenchantment mixed with disillusion opinion polls currently show that the incumbent president , nicolas sarkozy , would lose to either of the two remaining socialist party candidates , fran \? s hollande and martine aubry , who will face each other in a runoff primary vote on sunday but there is not much excitement around either of them , especially with the putative favorite , dominique strausskahn , out of the race as a consequence of his encounter with a housekeeper in a new york hotel room ms aubry , 61 , succeeded mr hollande , 57 , as general secretary of the socialist party , and they actively dislike each other they both speak in bureaucratic language , and their last debate , televised nationally wednesday night on a set that made them look like contestants on a game show , sounded like a colloquy at an elite university mr hollande is considered likely to win the runoff on sunday and face mr sarkozy next spring , but in a new primary format , results are hard to predict ms aubry , a more doctrinaire socialist , has the party levers under her control , and those who voted in the first round showed a clear affection for positions farther to the left than mr hollande finds comfortable among the six candidates in the first round last sunday , mr hollande won 39 percent of the votes and ms aubry 30 percent the primary itself is a new venture , open to any french citizen who pays at least one euro and signs a pledge supporting the values of the left and of the republic , otherwise left undefined while the socialists praised the democratic participation of the first round about 26 million people voted the figures are small compared to a regular election more than 367 million voted in the first round of the 2007 presidential race , and the socialist party candidate alone got more than 95 million votes but the socialists are a little desperate while they have done progressively well in local elections , they have not elected a president since fran \? s mitterrand , who left office more than 15 years ago even worse , in 2002 , a socialist candidate , lionel jospin , lost in the first round to jeanmarie le pen , then the leader of the far right national front , handing the election to jacques chirac in 2007 , the socialist candidate , s \? l \? royal , lost badly to mr sarkozy in the second round ms royal , mr hollande s former partner , ran again this year , traveling all over france but this time , socialist voters rejected her thoroughly , even cruelly , giving her less than 7 percent of the vote despite her split with mr hollande , she endorsed him this year the main surprise of the first round was the strong showing of arnaud montebourg , 48 , an articulate advocate of protectionism and deglobalization , calling for the imposition of social and environmental taxes on imports to protect french jobs his advocacy of a return to an imaginary france in fact , french exports have been falling as a percentage of global exports nearly every year for the last 40 years annoyed political experts , but it won the support of 17 percent of those who voted last sunday mr montebourg also won praise from the national front candidate , marine le pen , who favors nearly the same policies , another indication of how the criticism of globalization in france brings the far left and far right together on friday , playing his last card for attention , mr montebourg endorsed mr hollande , but only in a personal capacity laurent joffrin , the chief editor of the weekly le nouvel observateur , said with some despair that the results show that the french left wants an alternative , not only to sarkozyism , but also to the liberal course followed for the last 30 years by the great democracies as for deglobalization , mr joffrin said , it is archaic , unrealistic , utopian , even reactionary but he said the themes of criticizing the unbridled free market , fear of cruel globalization , rejection of an irresponsible financial system have become popular in a time of economic uncertainty so mr hollande , who believes that his best chance of winning the presidential election is to be a normal president tacking toward the center , is being pushed to the left , which is where mr sarkozy prefers the socialists to stay in wednesday s debate and in interviews on thursday , mr hollande toughened his stance toward the financial sector , saying that europe s banks , rather than the taxpayer , should pay for losses stemming from investment in greece those banks that lent to greece must take the losses , as they were not careful , mr hollande said banks that made a profit will have to fund banks that make a loss , he said ms aubry was more combative and tried to be folksy , calling mr hollande vague and citing a rhyming proverb from her grandmother , to the effect that when it s vague , there s a wolf , or a danger and she said on thursday that it always disturbs me when a man of the left uses the words of the right mr hollande tried to avoid controversy and avoid further division on the left i do n't want to be devaluing people , i do n't need to denigrate , devalue and denounce , he said afterward he said he was opposed to a sectarian left his relations with ms aubry are difficult she considers him soft and conflict adverse he considers her nasty and difficult , too openly critical of his period as party leader she is said to resent him for having been a political favorite of her famous father , jacques delors , who picked mr hollande to run a research foundation devoted to mr delors , the club t \? in mr sarkozy and his political aides favored mr hollande as the best chance to avoid facing mr strausskahn , but now that mr strausskahn has left the race , it is mr hollande they fear the most ms aubry , who is known as the lady of the 35 hours , for her responsibility in government for passing the 35hour work week , is much more easily caricatured as a hidebound leftist out of touch with the new realities of a fiscal and financial crisis and the need to reduce government deficits already , the newspaper le figaro , which actively supports mr sarkozy , is asking how the socialists think they can afford their promises 60 , 000 new teaching posts , 300 , 000 jobs for the young , a restoration of retirement at age 60 and an end to the current policy of replacing only one of every two departing civil servants only by soaking corporations , banks and the rich , the newspaper said mr sarkozy has reportedly told aides , according to le nouvel observateur , that mr hollande is like a man made of sugar , who will dissolve in water but the d \? mour of the french , for now , is deepest with mr sarkozy while a good campaigner , he is deeply unpopular , and opinion polls show that for now , at least , he has a very steep hill to climb to beat either mr hollande or ms aubry this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photos the socialist party candidates martine aubry , top , and fran ois hollande , above , will face each other in a runoff primary vote on sunday \( photographs by pascal rossignol reuters patrick kovarik agence francepresse getty images \)

24 hours and not lose his mind \? the answer sort of mike tanier rented out the bats blog on saturday and documented his experience after tanier attended five more area events today the new york mini 10k , the yankeesindians game , the adidas grand prix , the belmont stakes and the libertyfever game he did make it to all six events whether or not his mind is still intact has yet to be determined recap tanier s entire journey here and on twitter using the hashtag at about 5 00 pm , photographer todd heisler and i were still climbing the rfk bridge span over the east kills on foot , wind buffeting us , traffic rumbling below , path beneath us perceptibly swaying the manhattan skyline was shrouded in fog , so there were no vistas to admire i looked down onto the fields below teenagers played soccer a few hundred feet below me a little league field , temporarily vacant , sat at the ready when going from sport to sport , you must pass over a few other sports in between this 24 hour experiment reminded me that the sports experience is best when the line between participant and fan is not razor sharp , and when the walls that separate them are thin and permeable major league soccer thrives on young fans who slap highfive to players before the game and feel a familial kinship with the teams , players , and sport itself the mini marathon 10k places amateurs on the same track with olympians , bringing them all together in central park and giving medals to many , not just champions junior track stars compete just before olympians at the adidas grand prix , with the same crowd urging them on and participants sometimes finding their way into the stands the belmont is part picnic , part horse race , and your attention does not have to be centered on your betting slip to have a good time the wnba is not the most popular of leagues , but sit in an arena full of teenage girls chanting and screaming for something other than some teen idol singer , and you can feel the sport s allure and understand its potential importance and then there is yankee stadium , where every effort is made to keep players and fans as far away as possible , where every rule seems designed to make everything more expensive and impersonal we love baseball , but it doesn t always put a great effort into loving us back none of the big sports do anymore yankee fans still come together i had great conversations with fans at yankee stadium , especially in the hot sausage line , which never moved but the team and sport is at arm s length we do not even think of how far away from the players we are anymore until we go to a smaller event and stand next to them , or even compete with them it was funny how people i spoke to or who commented on the blogs insisted that of the six sports on my itinerary , only one or two were worth covering soccer fans turned their noses up at baseball baseball fans shrugged at track and field no one really stood up for the wnba , perhaps because tweenage girls do not read sports blogs one fan s main event is another fan s nonevent who needs olympians when you have game 62 of an 162 game schedule \? who cares about horse racing , except for hundreds of thousands of fans nationwide \? every sport has it s fanatics , who see a level of beauty and detail others cannot appreciate , as well as casual fans , who attend the games to soak up atmosphere or follow the biggest storylines preferring one sport to another does not make anyone smarter , or more openminded , or more macho , though we often couch our preferences that way they are just preferences , and the sports that inspire them have merits independent of our tastes , as acts of human achievement , will , agility , endurance , grace , or strength the sports do not need all of us to like all of them they just need to be this journey opened my eyes to sports i never noticed , made me sit among fans i was never sure existed it was grueling , frustrating at times , and damp , but absolutely unforgettable any one of these events would be worth the effort or two , or three or all six , if someone would invent a transporter beam that shortens the trip from queens to jersey i am tired i am hungry i am not sure where i am parked but i now know who grete waitz was and know why the new york red bulls are a playoffcaliber soccer team , what women s steeplechase looks like and who spends saturday night watching wnba college baseball is on television at the bar vanderbiltoregon state i think i will watch a little after a trip like this , what s a little more sports \? they said it could not be done it probably should not be done but we did it i am behind the new york liberty basket they are winning by two they just scored on a break to make it four this is the final event of my six sports in 24 hours odyssey i do not know what is going on i know that the crowd , though sparse , is rocking , and there are dancers in rainbow wigs at center court or maybe that is a hallucination getting from belmont park on the fringe of queens to newark is not easy our cab driver , a long island native , told us that we had to go northwest to go southeast , and other zen insights we reached prudential arena to find the ticket box office closed and security disinterested in tales of sports road trips gone mad luckily , a patron had two extra tickets , and i had a few extra bucks there was a near brawl when we left belmont park police broke up two drunks about to spar , and one of the drunks walked behind us for the rest of our trip out of the track and in search of a cab he s an old guy they get bored , his girlfriend said , trying to calm him bored \? well i just wanted to make his day , he replied before telling her about all the nearby women he found attractive neither will remember this tomorrow , but i will by contrast , liberty games are family events \( there were plenty of families out in the picnic area of the belmont , but even there things were getting wild \) the young girls in front of me have thundersticks they woof to who let the dogs out i am past the 24 hour mark on this journey , and i have a headache , but the cheers and cries of defense still sound heavenly liberty up by three time to post six events twentyfour hours almost done ! i am the last sober american at the world s largest picnic i am blogging from a park bench beside a beer vendor at belmont park the fellow next to me is eating peanuts as if it is his life s vocation , throwing shells to the ground with grim determination i smell beer , cigar smoke , beer , the distant horses trotting on a nearby display track , stale sportswriter , and beer most patrons are dressed for the weather , but many girls are wearing a new york version of the elaborate kentucky derby hat or at least they are channeling their inner pippa many are staggering under the weight of their hats , or for some other reason walking across the rfk bridge was a onceinalifetime act i plan to make certain of that it is deceptively long , and it sways a livery cab took us on the grand central expressway to the track gaper delay from a serious westbound accident slowed our progress i am blogging under the gun to get this to you before race time here are my prewritten notes on the race coming on the tail end of horse racing s triple crown , the belmont stakes is like the fourth quarter of a football game , only the rest of the game took place two weeks ago the belmont is a gambler who bets everything on the triple crown winner at the preakness , then watches the final furlong with crossed fingers , waiting for shackleford to fade as expected , realizing he won t , and accepting that fan interest and television ratings will once again be down this year with no triple crown at stake , the consolation prize is a rubber match between derby winner animal kingdom and preakness upstart shackleford this time it s personal or equine , at least the triple crown is not a best of three series , thank heavens , but animal kingdom versus shackleford provides a hook for nonhorse racing fans , as well as a neat pneumonic for those of us who rarely cover this sport whenever i am at risk of forgetting the names of the top contenders , i picture marlon perkins in a footrace against a terrible 76ers forward from the late 1980s perkins always wins , then tries to sell me flood insurance there are other horses in the field there s nehro , who finished second in the derby but took the preakness off to rest , the slacker there s brilliant speed , whom to whenham of doc s sports service says isn t particularly a fast horse , but rather one with a lot of staying power i can relate to a horse like that , and staying power is a must on a race track which circles the equator brilliant speed s great uncle touch the gold won the belmont in 1997 , though i am told that the two never speak to each other anymore with their flowing manes and complicated bloodlines , racehorses remind me a little of the matthews family in the nfl i knew little about the belmont heading into the race , except that it is run on sand and is longer than the other two triple crown races my horse racing experience extends only to a few bloody mary fueled afternoons at philadelphia park and a typical flirtation with death at the preakness which may have been a hallucination i know the belmont has an official cocktail , just like the other races the kentucky derby has the mint julep \( bourbon , syrup , mint sprig , dash of antebellum despair \) and the preakness has the black eyed susan \( wheelbarrow full of canned light beer , consumed through a funnel \) the belmont breeze mixes bourbon , sherry , lemon juice , syrup , cranberry juice , orange juice , mint leaves , orange zest , bacon bits , lawn clippings , enfamil , and dishwasher soap and serves it an old jelly jar really , it s the spilled remains of a mint julep and a black eyed susan , plus anything that was lying on the bar at the end of the shift i cannot wait to try one the times authorized me to place one 5 bet , which is further evidence that this assignment is just an elaborate effort to humiliate me not only must i look like a harried lunatic , but a pennyante player as well to make matters worse , many friends asked me to place bets for them , as if my schedule is not tight enough a friend from baltimore asked me to bet on animal kingdom he was at the preakness , and therefore has no idea how it turned out \( i get paid by the drunken preakness joke \) the worst thing i discovered while researching the belmont stakes is that an effort to update the music selections by adding empire state of mind to the mix failed because race fans found the selection too edgy does this surprise anyone \? racetracks , like bowling alleys , are time capsules head to the track as a 22year old in a yankees cap , and you walk out with a fedora , a cigar , kidney stones , and a pocketful of torn betting slips i love jayz , but i don t want to hear him at the track , or the church picnic songs like new york , new york , bring entire communities together , because we can all agree that it is a lame selection i am all for anything that helps build a consensus it is time for me to seek that bet and that drink follow the twitter feed for more observations photographer todd heisler and i will be under the gun to get to the new york liberty game after the race unless i win big , in which case you may never hear from me again you are one of the world s greatest athletes but how fast are you when your feet are soaked \? the women s 3 , 000 meter steeplechase answers that question , one you may have never thought to ask women run three kilometers , leap intermittent hurdles , and deal with one water hazard they clear the hurdle , then plop soundly into the water , sometimes with both feet , splashing everyone around them you probably don t like walking with soggy feet these women run a few thousand meters and leap a few more hurdles i expected the men s 400 meter run to be dramatic , and it was , with jeremy warner edging two competitors in the final seconds the 400 meter hurdles were also compelling , with bershawn jackson losing steam after the last hurdle and finishing second to javier culson , who lunged and rolled to the ground as he broke the tape the steeplechase caught me off guard long , odd , wet , and fascinating , with an amazing finish milcah chemos of kenya and sofia assefa of ethiopia ran sidebyside for the final 100 meters or so , with chemos finishing 08 seconds ahead the crowd at icahn stadium is indifferent to the weather most seats are under a long awning , but even spectators exposed to the elements are riveted i see this all the time in football , of course frozen diehards shivering through fourth quarters in december every sport has its diehards , even sports some of us overlook when focusing on baseball and football the adidas prix continues i will soon be crossing the rfk bridge , on foot , in the rain , to go to belmont park for now , there are more races , more jumps the athletes stretch and jog on a nearby field traffic zooms on the bridge overpasses overhead more olympians await a rainy afternoon in the company of exemplary athletes is better than a sunny day nearly anyplace else in news from past events on my adventure , i just learned bartolo colon came up limping after covering first he is a great pitcher but he should not attempt the steeplechase randalls island is manhattan s playground , a tranquil paradise in the shadow of interstate overpasses today , it is dreary , soggy , and cold , though not as cold as yankee stadium , where you could hang meat by the third inning in another concession to electronic safety , i am in the press tent , though i will soon leave to cover the major events of the adidas grand prix leaving yankee stadium during a scoreless tie in the third inning felt unnatural , and i did not even get my darn cap , but duty calls photographer todd heisler and i took the no 4 train to 125th street , where the puerto rican festival was in full swing we took one look at the overcrowded bus , and hailed a cab a javelin thrower leaving icahn stadium hailed the cab as we arrived if you see a cab with a javelin bag sticking out both windows , wave to her the big event , coming dangerously soon , is the men s 400 meter dash blade runner oscar pistorius needs a time of 45 25 in the 400 qualify for the world championships in september pistorius s goal today is to push harder on the first 200 meters than he has in past races pistorius was born without fibula bones and had his lower legs amputated before he was a year old he runs using cheetah prosthetic blades judging from a recent interview with the guardian , being a doubleamputee track star is one of the least interesting things about being pistorius he owns two white tigers , as well as a racehorse perhaps he can share a cab with me over to belmont park he loves to cook , telling the guardian that he would make homemade bread with jalapenos , then we d have a lasagne and then molten pudding with chocolate truffles for dessert , if hosting a meal he once sang layla in a karoke bar , though he could not place the name of the song \( it was the one that goes you got me on my knees , baby doo doo do doo \) covering athletes of this caliber , particularly ones who overcame severe limitations to achieve greatness , makes me feel like an alltime slacker it s encouraging to know that i could lick globetrotting , tigertaming sprinters in a derek and the dominoes soundalike competition , if nothing else the white tigers make me wonder who takes care of them when pistorius is traveling \? kennels are probably out of the question does a neighbor stop by and toss them some meat , plus some molten pudding \? if they travel with him , i hope they are not allowed in press tents sprinter tyson gay is the biggest star on the bill today , but his 100m dash is scheduled for 4 50 , and the belmont stakes post time is 6 40 what s insane about my itinerary is that the longer the day gets , the closer together events are scheduled , the further away from each other they are , and the shorter they are it forces me to make difficult journalistic choices miss animal kingdom versus shackleford to catch a few seconds of tyson gay \? that is not a good trade unless usain bolt shows up unannounced to challenge gay instead , i will settle for olympic bronze medalwinning hurdler bershawn jackson , who earned the nickname batman because childhood friends thought he had big ears does batman have big ears \? does bruce wayne tuck them into his cowl \? it never comes up in the comics or movies there s also triple jumper christian olsson of sweden , who has won not just olympic gold but two waterford crystal european athlete of the year trophies , which are probably very fragile olsson is also rather fragile , having missed several meet seasons with foot injuries , and today he battles phillips idowu , an english silver medalist with dennis rodman s fashion sense many fitness magazines have published detailed accounts of idowu s triple jump technique and triplejump specific workouts the sport is incredibly stressful on the body \( triple jumpers absorb a force greater than 10 times their body weight when landing before their final jump \) but the skills involved don t translate into everyday life when was the last time you had a water cooler conversation with someone training explicitly to improve his or her triple jump length \? when not describing workouts , idowu talks about his pet an akida with a pink leash she s got her little diamante collar and lead that was her one year birthday present she s definitely spoilt , idowu told askmencom she s a good guard dog and she s very wary of people she doesn t know coming round to the house which makes me feel more comfortable when i go away idowu should talk to pistorius those white tigers provide home security and would probably look fetching with a diamante collar off to the stands i think the rain is letting up i hope the rain is letting up please , oh rain , please let up yankee stadium does not allow laptop bags in the stands there are bagchecks nearby \( reputable ones , not uncle vinny s stop n steal checkorama \) , but they do not offer laptop charging services this is a niche market that someone with ambition , a long extension cord , and a lot of splitters should fill yankee stadium security guards are incredibly polite and professional they shepherded me through a tangle of gates and help booths , and one took maternal pity on me as i filed my last post crosslegged outside of gate two she stopped just short of offering me a saucerful of milk the weather remains overcast and cool , but the rain appears to be holding off i will not be here long , but derek jeter leads off the bottom of the first , and i must see him pursue history before i head to randall s island now it is time to leave the press box , after i use the facilities , have a soda wait , is that caesar salad \? no , no , i am here as a fan , i took the d train with fans , and i have a ticket the laptop stays here i need a ballpark hotdog , an hour on the heels of my previous meal let s play ball ! or at least an inning of ball and i want my cap yankee stadium is a truly american destination , a plot of real estate so monumental and mythological , so steeped in cultural importance and vital to our national selfperception , that there is no way in heck that you can afford to go there the price of four tickets , four pretzels , four sodas and two children s souvenirs is one kidney season ticket plans come with 20 and 30year adjustable rates yankees fans tell me it is cheaper to purchase tickets , hotel rooms , and train fare to road games against the orioles than to watch the team at yankees stadium soon , it will be cheaper to build a time machine and travel back to see urban shocker pitch more convenient , too my editors , channeling ricky gervais while stifling their perverse snickers , denied me press credentials for this trip , suggesting that i simply buy tickets from a scalper if the game was sold out i pictured myself asking the scalper for a reimbursement receipt , thought the better of their plan , and went straight to the yankees website to get a ticket minutes after receiving my assignment the interactive map showed that all of the affordable seats were gone , though i could sit behind home plate if i were willing to line up a cosigner after surveying ticket prices and doing a few classic danny thomas spittakes at the prices , i decided that section 205 , seat 19 , row 1 was close enough to the action to tell derek jeter from , say , a statue of joe gordon , and wouldn t leave my family on an allramen diet until the reimbursements arrive even a simple online purchase is fraught with peril when performed yankees style i selected my seat , and a clock appeared telling me i had just a few minutes to enter my personal and credit card information suddenly , i was jack bauer , racing the clock to enter the 16digit number that disarms the warheads and rescues his daughter from terrorists complete one section of the form , and the clock resets with additional time i feared i would have to leap across mushrooms , dodge rotating swords , and defeat bowser to complete my purchase it is the kind of rigmarole i expect when buying rolling stones tickets , knowing they will sell out six seconds after they go on sale \( the tickets , that is the stones sold out in 1985 \) i actually wiped my brow in relief when the confirmation email told me i would not have to negotiate with petty criminals to sustain my journalistic career never have i felt more of a sense of accomplishment after paying 6645 for an event i have only cursory interest in and no chance of seeing to its conclusion from the outside , yankee stadium is monolithic , imposing , and impersonal it lacks the livedin charm of camden yards , the dilapidated norma desmond grandeur of fenway , the warehousewithstreamers blue collar exuberance of citizen s bank park on the other hand , it s in no danger of being turned into a cracker barrel restaurant , like the mets citi field it s a closefisted death punch of a building that doesn t so much blend with the surrounding architecture as pummel it into submission it looks like a vault constructed for a powermad roman emperor , designed to project might and omnipotence , not a pleasant spring afternoon with the kids these are the yankees , of course , so all of these metaphors are appropriate it may be shocking to read this from a new york journalist , but i have not set foot in yankee stadium in 20 years the last time i was here , i was a college guy on a road trip , and new jersey state troopers stopped my friend and i on i95 after the game simply because we were young dudes with pennsylvania license plates \( and also possibly because we were doing 85 miles per hour \) where were you guys , one officer asked , shining his flashlight in my eyes yankee stadium , sir , i responded , squinting oh really \? he asked , a hint of playful doubt in his eyes who won \? suddenly , i was in a world war ii movie who won the 1938 world series \? nien ! nien ! ich weib nicht ! but i did know yankees won , 65 kelly won it with a single in the ninth mattingly had two hits the officer believed us and let us go with a warning , perhaps fearing \( rightfully \) that i was the kind of person who offered unwanted pitchbypitch recounts of sporting events a lot has changed since the grand stump merrill era , but one thing hasn t yankees stadium is still a road trip mecca , one that beckons sports fans from around the world to come and breathe the air once breathed by babe ruth , lou gehrig , joe dimaggio , mickey mantle , jim leyritz , and now derek jeter and alex rodriguez i must now find somewhere to check this laptop a pizza delivery guy named mookie said he can store it at sal s pizza behind his buddy s boom box i have no worries that this will work out check the twitter feed for updates from inside the stadium ! when crossing the finish line of a 10k run , make sure you are smiling , not looking at your watch that was the advice the public address announcer gave to exhausted women completing the road runners mini marathon at about the 45 minute mark , nearly 15 minutes after winner linet masai but still at an impeccable time few women were smiling , and none were looking at their watches most were grimacing , puffing , and panting a few ran the last 50 meters with their arms raised in triumph one collapsed just after the finish she was quickly revived and hyrdrated , and looked far more embarrassed than ill as she watched other finishers from a wheelchair after the awards ceremony , a band of junior high girls called still sapphire performed their original name was sapphire , but some other band invoked its rights to the name i can only assume that if sapphire were any good , they would not lose a gig to a band of tweeners , but that is another matter racers scattered after the awards ceremony , but many turned up here at lansky s deli , a fine place to replenish calories the woman across from me is a woman with a finisher s medal and a large plate of onion rings the postrace mimosa is not recommended by most running associations , but it appears to be a popular choice it is raining as i prepare to head to yankee stadium i may be watching a rain delay instead of a ball game for an hour some will argue there is little difference we call those people pirates fans it is cap day i think i am gonna need one from a rock outcropping in central park near the sixmile marker of the roadrunners mini marathon , i wait for olympians while watching little league june saturday mornings belong to little league in parks all over america , and central park is no exception kids field grounders and whiz by on razor scooters poorly thrown balls bounce onto the footpaths my own son s game starts soon down in the philly suburbs , and i am thinking of him as i watch these kids , who have better uniforms a sheepdog is playing fetch in front of me , and he is not very good at it cyclists pass sports belong to all of us on cool mornings , international superstars , nineyear olds who cannot field grounders , dogs who cannot catch frisbees what we all need in our lives is the mini marathon public address announcer , a woman who embodies the tough love approach to sports persuasion move it or lose it , ladies ! she shouted as the sweepers at the end of the 6 , 000 runner field straggled past thanks for getting out of bed and joining us this morning ! i need this woman following me and exhorting me as i type part life coach , part trash talk specialist the leaders will pass soon , but it is drizzling , and this laptop is not waterproof i will check in again soon the best time to experience manhattan is in the hours just after dawn , before the throttle butterflies open and everyone starts careening through the day at 120 miles per hour manhattan at 6 45 am is a borough still stretching , gargling , and waiting for the coffee to percolate , a city with its guard down you know that clarinet solo at the beginning of rhapsody in blue \? it still warbles at 6 45 am , not yet drowned out by the mashup of hiphop , flimi , and cookie monster death metal that keeps the borough moving by day skies are overcast this morning the dense grove of trees at central park west looks like a foreboding forest to my right as i report from beneath a fountain near columbus circle i am surrounded by hundreds of distance runners , young and old , ready to compete in the new york roadrunners minimarathon the loneliness of the long distance runner intersected with the loneliness of the new jersey commuter this morning as i shared a path train with several harriers , all as eager to speak with a 40something male stranger with no press credentials as you might expect one decided to walk the 30 blocks from penn station to the starting line along the same route i took , so i decided to try to beat her here she had fitness and determination on her side i had a very effective puddle jumping technique i held a halfblock lead until 40th street , when i paused for a moment to consider stopping by times headquarters and she flew past me by 52nd street , she had a comfortable block lead , but then she turned into a health food store i win ! now , she gets to run 10 kilometers , and i get to sit and type we are all winners sharing the train with participants reminds me of the beauty of distance running world class competitors share the event with weekend warriors it would be like letting commuters onto the nascar track , though not quite as dangerous the announcers just introduced a 79year participant there are girls in their teens nearby , and runners of dubious fitness , who will share the event with olympians what a wonderful way to start the day best of all , it is not 95 degrees or raining yet note runners will be timed using the chrono track btag system , which accurately track individual times and movements soon , all citizens will be equipped with them noteworthy competitors linet masai winner of the 2009 world championships in the 10k and olympic competitor who finished fourth in 2008 in the 10 , 000 meters , which is an event of roughly similar length \( kidding ! \) masai s personal best time in the one million centimeter event is 30 minutes and 48 seconds , which can cause blogging problems write too long a paragraph about masai s amazing start , and i may be spellchecking as she crosses the finish line liliya shobukhova , who has won marathons in london and chicago and competed in the 5 , 000meter event in the 2004 and 2008 olympics shobukhova is famous for her ability to sprint at the end of a marathon in chicago in 2009 , she ran the final 22 kilometers in six minutes and 23 seconds in a less genteel sport , such a gift would be accompanied by excessive trash talking what , you are tired \? it s only been 24 miles ! gosh , i wonder what s around that next bend i will run ahead , take a look , come back , and let you know before you drop from exhaustion harriers are nicer people than this deena kastor , winner of the 2004 event kastor also won a bronze medal in the 2004 olympics and holds us women s records in the marathon and half marathon she is also a new mother , competing in her first race since the birth of her daughter in february i wonder what kind of jogging strollers distance runners use hopefully something with good suspension , and a dvd player on board so the little one can enjoy some blues clues over the final few miles i believe strollers are forbidden in this event they always are in philadelphia , where mothers might affix ben hur greek chariot wheels to the strollers , then boo the toddlers who topple onto the sidewalk kastor also has a degree in journalism , making her not only far more qualified than me to compete in distance runs , but also far more qualified to write about them alas , search engines always assume i am looking for realitytelevision vixen deena cortese when i research kastor place third in the olympics and achieve worldrecord times in grueling sports , and and you are still doomed to play second fiddle to a person who calls herself the blast race will start soon check the twitter feed for updates ! there s a fine line between edgy journalistic experiment and elaborate practical joke i believe that line runs through the east river under the rfk bridge , and i will be crossing it , on foot , in the late afternoon on saturday , possibly in the rain when my editors contacted me about covering six different sporting events in 24 hours , i wondered if they were really plotting a complicated hoax at my expense the more they described the project , the more i wondered no press credentials \? right tweets , photos and video \? sure i kept waiting for the instructions that proved they were kidding oh , wear this 25pound satellite dish on your head , and make sure it is always pointed in the direction of 40th street so we can pick up your signal walk sideways if you have to it never reached the point at which no one on the conference call could keep from snickering not quite my wife was even more skeptical what makes you so sure this is not a joke \? she asked well , they want me to start and end the trip in newark joke ! she said and i am supposed to cover a track meet at icarly stadium out on riker s island double joke ! she said i soon clarified that the track meet was to take place at icahn stadium on randall s island , but my confusion only underlined the absurdity of the task for which i too eagerly signed up i have never covered track and field , and i don t know randall s island from brigadoon i would only be slightly further out of my element if the times sent me to jupiter i am spectacularly unqualified for this but then , that s the point i will cover events with a fresh voice and examine the new york sports scene with the wonder , confusion and enthusiasm of someone encountering the belmont stakes or a central park minimarathon for the first time of course , that s exactly what you would tell a freelance writer if you wanted to trick him into doing something foolish , right \? heedless of my own skepticism , let alone my wife s , i accepted the assignment and began mapping a route that would take me from red bull arena to central park to yankee stadium to randall s island to belmont park and back to the prudential center in newark as cheaply and efficiently as possible so i logged onto an mta transit map , or possibly a diagram of the circuit board of a microchip , or a chart of the circulatory system of a wombat it did not matter i barely made sense of the map it looked like my 4yearold s scribbles , or the random pathways of the old atari game maze craze the mta people could have put a minotaur in forest hills , and i would have accepted it as fact new yorkers have no trouble keeping this tangle of letters , numbers and colors straight , just as children of the rainforest can canoe around the amazon tributaries without getting lost i am from philadelphia , with one main subway line and a few spurs i am an algebra commuter in a calculus city google maps , which have clearly marked transit stops , were a little more helpful i learned that my trip will take me through a parade of neighborhoods i thought only existed on rap albums and in martin scorsese films like any good outoftowner , i immediately feared that hoodlums of every era and nationality would menace me at every stop i was reviewing a google map , listening to reasonable doubt , watching goodfellas , and trembling silently when an editor suggested the best way to get from the adidas grand prix on randall s island to the belmont stakes was to leave the island on foot , then find a cab in astoria , queens somehow , this actually assuaged my fears i excitedly told my wife of the plan all i have to do is take a train from yankee stadium to harlem , pick up a bus to the island , walk across the east river on i287 , then take a cab through queens to belmont park , which is just east of hollis and jamaica ! joke ! she said the easy leg of this odyssey is already complete i successfully navigated the new jersey turnpike on a summer friday , no small feat with shoregoers clogging many exits major league soccer did its best to work its charms on a gorgeous friday evening , treating me to a tight 21 red bulls victory that featured three more goals than i anticipated seeing red bull arena had everything i could ask for in a venue wide concourses , great sight lines and ranch dressing dispensers on the condiment tables the red bulls fans were passionate and intense , and a vocal busload of boosters from new england brought pageantry in the form of a drumandflag miniparade through the concourses i did not bother with the chanting , stomping superfans behind the goalie because they appeared more into being soccer fans than into soccer , carefully mimicking the behavior they saw in world cup matches to each their own the fans in my corner section , schoolboys with their fathers and fetching collegiate couples , rooted without making a show of rooting i did not fall in love with the sport , but i saw the attraction , and if i were in charge of a sport that makes a fetish of its deliberate , kidunfriendly pace \( baseball \) , i would be worried about soccer s ability to slowly erode the fan base the trip to red bull arena reminded me why this assignment appealed so much to me , besides my masochistic streak sports fandom is becoming increasingly private and personal highdef television beams pristine images into our homes , and computers place instantaneous analysis and impersonal chat at our fingertips even the act of going to games has been sanitized in recent years the new arenas look and feel like shopping malls , and tailgate parties often come with vegetarian menu alternatives and airconditioned , commodeequipped trailers none of these are bad things , but they take some of the most powerful , visceral experiences away from fans we start to ask too much of the sports themselves , entertainment and fulfillmentwise , when we remove them from their atmosphere the best fan experiences are usually communal , and they are often journeys whole books have been written about road trips following college football teams or european tours with futb l hooligans to date , no one has written eloquently about watching a ballgame alone in a suburban living room our childhood sports memories are usually of trips to the ballpark or arena , even if the pretzels were cold , the parking lots were endless , and von hayes was batting cleanup that night my goal this weekend is to create some new sports memories , then shape them and share them , to try things i have never tried and find things i would never think to look for this is not just a new york story , but a story of sports discovery maybe an afternoon on randall s island will open my eyes to the beauty of the triple jump maybe i will win big at the belmont maybe the views from the rfk bridge are so breathtaking that they are worth the tight schedule , unpredictable weather , and possibility that i will be hopelessly lost the moment i set foot in queens this journey will be funny at times , but it will never be a joke i may not find all of my venues , but i am sure i will find something start following tanier on twitter fo mtanier
atlanta a republican leader in a bipartisan senate group negotiating a debtreduction package said on monday that president obama threw us a little bit of a curveball with the weekend announcement that he plans to deliver a speech on the subject later this week the republican , senator saxby chambliss of georgia , and his democratic negotiating partner , senator mark warner of virginia , both said they were surprised when david plouffe , mr obama s senior white house strategist , disclosed on several sunday talk shows that mr obama would call on congress to join him in writing a multiyear plan of domestic and military spending cuts and higher taxes for the wealthy we just didn t know , none of us did until yesterday , mr chambliss said , referring to himself , two other republicans and the three democrats who make up the socalled gang of six administration officials over the weekend had indicated that they expected the senate group to announce an agreement this week , and the agreement s timing was a consideration in scheduling mr obama s speech on wednesday but several people familiar with the group s discussions said that , depending on what mr obama says , his speech could threaten the fragile bipartisan unity just as the halfdozen senators are nearing agreement the senators are discussing a broad mix of savings , including in medicare , medicaid and social security spending , as well as an overhaul of the tax code that would eliminate many tax breaks to lower tax rates and also raise more revenues their framework is based on the recommendations offered in december by a bipartisan majority on mr obama s fiscal commission , which included four of the six senators while mr obama will call for a balanced package of spending reductions and revenue increases , according to the white house , some senators and supporters say they fear that if the effort becomes too closely associated with the president , it will draw such opposition from conservatives that other republicans will be dissuaded from agreeing to the deal but mr chambliss told reporters in an appearance here that irrespective of that , we re going to continue working with our group if the president wants to come on board with us at some moment , we certainly would welcome that , he said
back in 2004 , eric e schmidt , then google s chief executive , proclaimed , we 're not going into the phone business , but we 're going to make sure google is on those phones less than a year later , however , google did the opposite as steven levy described in his book in the plex , google soon acquired android , the mobile phone operating system , and began building a phone business that it has since developed into a juggernaut even after google acquired android in 2005 , it continued to play down plans to enter the phone business for several more years it was n't until the summer of 2008 that steven p jobs at apple actually took notice and went to google s headquarters to inspect one of its prototype handsets google s diversionary tactics made sense by 2006 , mr schmidt , now google s chairman , was an apple board member and google was considered an important partner to apple but when mr jobs finally saw google s phone he was furious and concluded he was a victim of deceit , according to mr levy s account \( mr schmidt has said he never misguided mr jobs \) that history may be instructive to consider when judging google s 125 billion deal for motorola mobility , which makes android phone handsets and tv settop boxes google is actively positioning the deal not as a means to buy its way into the handset market , but as an opportunity to buy motorola s portfolio of patents some 17 , 000 of them during the company s conference call with analysts and the news media , google executives peppered the call with talk about the enormous value of motorola s patents \( it mentioned this 24 times \) yet they talked about its handset business almost as an afterthought google s focus on the patents rather than the handset business makes almost too much sense google s android operating system has long been open and is used by a large ecosystem of handset makers , including samsung and htc these companies have invested billions of dollars in its androidbased operations and helped make android more popular than apple s mobile operating system those handset makers will now have to compete against google google ca n't admit in public that what they intend to do is eventually make android proprietary , said tavis mccourt , an analyst at morgan keegan equity research despite google s protestations , mr mccourt says he believes that in two to three years after motorola increases its distribution channels in europe , where it is weak compared to samsung and others google will seek to start closing android s platform or begin building special features on its own phones that are not available to its partners and even though google could keep android as an open platform , a special phone with bells and whistles could still infuriate its current manufacturing partners for consumers , however , a proprietary phone would finally make google s android system vertically integrated , creating an endtoend system that may allow it to better compete against the iphone , which has long been heralded because apple has been able to control all aspects of the phone , from software to hardware indeed , google s main pr message in its takeover of motorola mobility may follow that playbook of research in motion , the maker of blackberry , when it acquired qnx software systems , a software unit of harmon international , a little more than a year ago at the time of the deal , rim said it was buying qnx to enter the automobile and infotainment business , which was a strength of qnx rim played down any talk that qnx might be used as rim s nextgeneration operating system of course , the messaging was a bit disingenuous qnx is now building rim s operating system they could n't say it because rim s developers would have stopped developing for blackberry s current operating system , mr mccourt said google s message may also be needed to win approval from regulators who could seek to block the acquisition if any number of handset makers came out against the deal on monday , all of android s handset makers came out in support of the deal on the basis that it would protect android from potential patent litigation none of this is meant to suggest that google s stated desire to own motorola mobility , in part , for its patents is untrue google clearly has been involved in an effort to buy mobile phonerelated patents for the last year it lost a bidding war last month to buy about 6 , 000 patents from the bankrupt telecommunications maker nortel networks \( apple and microsoft led a group that outbid it \) but it is undeniable that google s new chief executive , larry page , has long had a hankering for the mobile phone business , and this acquisition may be the culmination of his ambitions mr page , after all , was the executive who personally pursued the acquisition of android and has been its biggest proponent and he pressed google to compete in federal auctions for wireless spectrum in recent years at a time when others were more hesitant and in some cases was willing to overpay for spectrum he was the guy behind android , mr levy said in an interview larry is a big ambitious guy he will roll big dice if there s any question about google s motivation to own a handset maker rather than just a portfolio of patents , consider this interdigital , a licensing company that owns some 8 , 000 wireless patents and has another 10 , 000 patent applications being processed , has been up for auction many industry insiders were sure that if google were serious about acquiring a portfolio of patents , interdigital would be its target the company s market value is only about 3 billion and it does n't come with all the baggage of motorola s handset business if this deal was just about patents , google would have bought idcc , mr mccourt said , referring to interdigital s stock ticker guess what happened to shares of interdigital on monday \? they fell 14 percent now that google is unlikely to be a buyer this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo larry page , a google cofounder , left , and eric e schmidt , the company s chairman , in 2009 \( photograph by

perhaps nothing symbolizes the ' successful first half better than a quip made by their general manager , brian cashman , on the morning of june 16 they got cliff lee , we got brian gordon the phillies , who added lee to their stable of aces , own the best record in baseball the yankees , who went bargainhunting to fill out their rotation , have the secondbest record in the american league consider their injuryravaged bullpen and substitute freddy garcia or for gordon in cashman s quotation , and the answer to what seems like a fanciful and patently ridiculous question becomes rather obvious yes , a team whose payroll exceeds the gross domestic product of some caribbean nations can overachieve , and without shame after defeating the tampa bay rays , 10 , sunday , the yankees entered the allstar break at 5335 , in strong contention for the al east title , though their longterm prospects would improve if they could , you know , beat boston they are powerful but flawed , exciting but aging , and the surprises that buoyed them in the first half could undermine them in the second if the amazing kreskin , miss cleo and the ghost of carnac the magnificent were put in a room with a magic 8 ball in january , none would have predicted that bartolo colon would be the yankees' de facto no 2 starter behind c c sabathia , the indispensable ace all good sense suggested that they would be starved for pitching , desperate for help at the july 31 trade deadline , but the 38yearold colon \( 64 , 320 earned run average \) and freddy garcia , 34 \( 76 , 313 \) , have added heft and reliability , fending off the skeptics for now , at least a lateseason physical breakdown by either would elicit a chorus of itoldyousos , and increase the pressure on , the yankees' great secondhalf unknown his shoulder woes solved , will he regain his form of last spring , when he started out 50 with a 138 era , or revisit his subsequent struggles , a 498 era over his final 25 appearances \? a popping fastball that generates swings and misses , a pitch that was absent in his return to the starting rotation wednesday , is essential if it comes back , so will hughes he would serve as the team s july acquisition the yankees need him in their rotation , not in their lockdown bullpen , which has been rebuilt roughly every month since december two stalwarts , luis ayala and cory wade , did not even pitch in the majors last season ayala rediscovered his sinker in winter ball in mexico , working with his old pitching coach wade , after opting out of his deal with the rays last month , quickly earned s trust dave robertson began the season as the fourth righthanded option and developed into an allstar would the yankees rather have joba chamberlain , pedro feliciano and rafael soriano \? of course but without them , the yankees' relievers entered sunday with a 311 earned run average , the second best in the al they owe some degree of thanks to russell martin , who has offset his meager offensive contributions 220 average , 323 onbase percentage with a steely toughness behind the plate if you drew a venn diagram charting the yankees' freeagent signings and injured players , the circles would almost overlap feliciano , eric chavez , soriano , even colon then there is martin , whose adjustment to a new league , a new staff , a new city , a new pitching coach , has not befuddled him girardi , a former catcher , raves about martin s blocking abilities , and pitchers adore working with him even mariano rivera , who really just needs someone to hold up a glove behind the plate at 41 , rivera is averaging fewer walks and more strikeouts than last season , but for how much longer \? the yankees hope that his recent soreness in his triceps does not develop into a recurring problem , as damaging as the meniscus tear that has compro mised alex rodriguez s right knee his power production diminished , rodriguez is unlikely to record a 14th straight season with at least 30 homers and 100 runs batted in the tear has also impaired his running , highlighting the perils of relying on an aging roster surgery on monday that will sideline him for four to six weeks will create a void at third base and once again thrust into the spotlight eduardo nunez , who has lifted the yankees to victory and dropped them to defeat when derek jeter was on the disabled list , nunez played with energy and verve and flair , which the yankees needed , but was prone to making mental mistakes and baserunning blunders , which they did not he could be their shortstop of the future , but for now he is the utility player of the present , a role that will surely take on greater resonance with rodriguez s absence but when rodriguez returns nunez could also spell derek jeter , provided he has not surpassed 4 , 000 hits by august on saturday , jeter proved that he still has a sense of occasion , going 5 for 5 and collecting his 3 , 000th hit on a home run once the afterglow fades , the attention will shift back to his viability as a leadoff hitter , a genuine issue as the yankees pursue a 28th championship until last week , his 270 average had been devoid of extrabase power , and his onbase percentage \( 330 \) crucial for the runproducers batting behind him is worse than last season , when he set a career low \( 340 \) when brett gardner , speedy and patient , led off in jeter s absence , the yankees glimpsed how dangerous their offense could be it would have been poor timing for girardi to consider dropping jeter down the lineup as he chased a milestone but if jeter s struggles resume , girardi could have an uncomfortable decision to make even more uncomfortable than losing a ninth straight game to the red sox , who have dominated the yankees , winning all six games in the bronx if the yankees , who are 18 against boston and 5227 against everyone else , finish with more victories , it will mean little but if they do not and if boston s supremacy continues their failures could loom large in the postseason , when , of course , they could meet boston again with the red sox pummeling righthanded pitching , the yankees could benefit from acquiring another effective lefthanded reliever to neutralize jacoby ellsbury and adrian gonzalez , carl crawford and david ortiz such a move could even prove the difference in a return trip to the world series and a possible date with philadelphia and cliff lee brian gordon would not be there the yankees released him friday
athens , ga students here at the university of georgia have a name for some of the fancy cars parked in the lots around campus they call them hopemobiles but there may soon be fewer of them the cars are gifts from parents who find themselves with extra cash because their children decided to take advantage of a cherished state perk the hope scholarship the largest meritbased college scholarship program in the united states it offers any georgia high school student with a baverage four years of free college tuition but the hope scholarship program is about to be cut by a new governor and legislature facing staggering financial troubles the lingering effects of the recession and the end of federal stimulus funds have sunk many states into a fiscal quagmire the seriousness of the problem , and a growing concern over how much worse it might become , have many states struggling to find ways to trim services or raise revenues in georgia , that means taking a slice out of the hope scholarship when it was begun in 1993 , the program was covered easily by georgia s state lottery politicians enjoyed how happy it made middleclass constituents educators praised the way it improved sat scores and lifted georgia from the backwaters of higher education it was considered so innovative that 15 states copied it and while the lotterybased scholarship programs in states like tennessee are dipping into reserves to cover the costs , none have fiscal woes as big as georgia s part of it is the program s popularity a majority of freshmen in georgia have grades good enough to qualify for hope , which covers tuition , some books and fees but not housing costs at any georgia university or technical school and even though as many as twothirds of hope students let their college grades slip so much that they no longer qualify i 've lost hope , they joke when it happens georgia still gives away more financial aid per student than any other state since the program started , 13 million georgia students have received a total of 56 billion in educational support the program offers as much as 6 , 000 a year for some students but the program has become so popular it cannot sustain itself lottery sales , which by law can pay for only the hope scholarship and a free prekindergarten program , will be short 243 million this fiscal year and as much as 317 million the next , according to state budget estimates last year , lawmakers had to pull millions of dollars from the state s reserve fund just to cover the cost but this year , there is nowhere to turn like the other states that are facing the worst fiscal crisis in recent memory , georgia heads into its legislative session next week staring at a budget deficit of as much as 2 billion and that is after billions of dollars in cuts over the past two years that have reduced the state s spending power to 179 billion for fiscal year 2011 but trim the program that for years has paid to educate the children of the most reliable voters in the state \? undoubtedly , this is , in every sense of the word , a very strongly ingrained entitlement for a certain segment of voters , and politicians are indeed reluctant to touch it , said christopher cornwell , a professor of economics at the university of georgia , who has studied the effect of the hope scholarship on the state , including an analysis of the positive impact the scholarship has had on car sales politicians are hoping for mercy as they begin this month to make decisions that will surely have the parents of collegebound students scrambling to find new ways to pay for tuition we trust and we hope the people in the state of georgia understand the position we 're in , said state representative len walker , a republican who leads the house higher education committee they do and they do n't cathy ottley , a parttime office manager , and her husband , a management consultant , are raising three children in marietta , north of atlanta one is a sophomore at the university of georgia , courtesy of the hope scholarship a daughter who is a high school senior had her heart set on the university of north carolina but has come to see an instate college as the practical way to go and then there is the youngest , a high school freshman with a promising future in athletics without the scholarship , ms ottley said , college for her children would be a stretch at best this just gives you options , she said i do n't have peace about kids just starting out at 22 with 200 , 000 in debt for their education mr walker said no one was talking about cutting the program completely it appears at this point that it will not be a 100 percent scholarship it might be 90 percent it might 80 percent , he said but the cost of books and fees will most certainly be eliminated other options include raising the required gradepoint average , which would cut the number of students who qualify , or giving more to exceptional students and less to merely aboveaverage performers that would make it so much harder , said myisha price , a junior at clayton state university in atlanta , who relies on the scholarship and also works i do n't go to clubs i do n't drink i do n't smoke and i do n't party and it s already hard another idea is to work economic need into the equation , though that idea does not have much support , both lawmakers and educators said the most likely plan , and one that governorelect nathan deal , a republican , has indicated he supports , would be to create a flat rate for each student , regardless of the tuition bill at a cafeteria table here this week , a group of hope recipients defended the program and debated a range of ideas to keep hope alive , including raising taxes allie mccullen , who is majoring in english and women s studies , is in her fourth year at georgia she is the only child of a single mother who in 2006 lost her job in the mortgage industry ms mccullen pieces together her living expenses and extra book costs through a small grant and two jobs if i did n't have it , i might not be able to attend at all , she said or i would just be in such severe debt that i might not ever be able to get out of it if the scholarship ends or gets cut drastically , it could send the most promising students out of state and even end the era of new cars for incoming freshman lauren rice drives a hopemobile \( though , she concedes , it is only a honda civic \) her parents told her she could go to college anywhere she was considering auburn in alabama but her parents offered her what she called the car incentive that , plus the daunting outofstate tuition helped her select the university of georgia but without hope , ms rice s decision might have been different if you 're going to have a bill instate anyway , she said , then what does it matter \?
tokyo appeared to make moderate progress in stabilizing some of the nuclear reactors at the stricken fukushima daiichi power plant on sunday , but at the same time it disclosed new signs of radioactive contamination in agricultural produce and livestock the government said it was barring all shipments of milk from fukushima prefecture and shipments of spinach from ibaraki prefecture , after finding new cases of abovenormal levels of radioactive elements in milk and several vegetables relatively high levels were also found in spinach from tochigi and gunma prefectures to the west , canola from gunma prefecture and chrysanthemum greens from chiba prefecture , south of ibaraki the emergency efforts to mitigate damage at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station , meanwhile , brought some notes of relief in the face of persistently dire conditions the authorities said they had restored water pumps to two damaged reactors , nos 5 and 6 , that were not of central concern , putting them under control in a state known as cold shutdown but another reactor that has proved more worrisome , no 3 , continued to bedevil engineers the , which runs the plant , appeared to have experienced a serious setback as officials said that pressure buildup at the ravaged no 3 reactor would require the venting of more radioactive gases but at a news conference a few hours later , officials from the power company said that the pressure had stabilized and that they had decided they did not need to release the gases immediately , which would have heightened worries about wider contamination among the population they said they were unsure what had caused the pressure to rise , highlighting the uncertainty engineers must still grapple with at fukushima the power company also said that on sunday workers injected 40 tons of water into the storage pool containing spent fuel rods at unit no 2 , and that firefighters began spraying water into the pool at unit no 4 on saturday , firefighters sprayed water at the storage pool of unit no 3 for more than 13 hours the reactors placed in cold shutdown were already shut down before the earthquake and the tsunami struck on march 11 , posing less of a risk than the other reactors at the plant but their cooling systems were knocked out , and the fuel rods left inside the reactors started to heat up , together with spent fuel rods in a separate storage pool we are getting closer to bringing the situation under control , tetsuro fukuyama , the deputy chief cabinet secretary of the japanese government , said of the entire plant late sunday after connecting a milelong electrical transmission line on saturday , workers made progress in starting to restore power to the plant , which may allow the operator to restart its cooling systems the government said that power was returned to reactor no 2 at 3 46 pm sunday , and that other reactors were also expected to gain power early in the week even with electrical power extended to the reactors , there was no immediate indication from officials that the damaged pumping systems could be quickly restored in general , our utmost efforts are producing definite results in preventing a worsening of the situation , said , the government s chief cabinet secretary , who confirmed for the first time that the nuclear complex with heavy damage to reactors and buildings and with radioactive contamination throughout would be closed once the crisis was over steven chu , the united states secretary of energy , also conveyed optimism in an interview on fox news sunday , saying that with each passing hour , each passing day , things are more under control japanese technicians who are trying to limit the spread of radiation are making very good progress , he said despite the positive tone from officials , steep challenges persist workers were trying to avoid further damage to fuel rods in the reactor cores of nos 1 , 2 , and 3 , and to prevent rods in the storage pools of nos 2 , 3 and 4 from overheating some experts project that the longer it takes to resolve the crisis fully , the greater the chances that one or more reactors or fuel storage pools will have to be abandoned , increasing the risk of a catastrophic release of radiation the plant remains a hazardous place for the emergency crews trying to stave off further damage at least 25 workers and five members of the japanese selfdefense force have been exposed to unsafe amounts of radiation , according to the power company at least 20 workers and four selfdefense soldiers have been injured , and two workers remain missing radiation contamination , meanwhile , appears to be spreading rapidly the substances detected in the food products were iodine 131 and cesium 137 , two of the more dangerous byproducts of reactor operations that are feared to have been released from the plants in fukushima if absorbed through milk and milk products , can accumulate in the thyroid and cause cancer can damage cells and lead to an increased risk of cancer mr fukuyama , the deputy chief cabinet secretary , stressed that although the readings were above levels deemed normal , they posed no immediate health risks at current levels , i would let my children eat the spinach and drink the water from fukushima , he said his children did not drink much milk , he added none of the produce found to be contaminated has been shipped to market , he said , while acknowledging that contaminated produce that had not been tested could have slipped through spinach from a farm in hitachi , about 45 miles from the plant , contained 27 times the amount of iodine that is generally considered safe , while cesium levels were about four times higher than is deemed safe by japan meanwhile , raw milk from a dairy farm in iitate , about 18 miles from the plant , contained iodine levels that were 17 times higher than those considered safe , and milk had cesium levels that were slightly above amounts considered safe while challenges with the nuclear facility and radiation contamination persist , stories of individual dramas continued to emerge in the wake of the earthquake and the tsunami that slammed into the country s northeastern coast on march 11 on sunday , two people were reported to have been found alive , nine days after the disaster an 80yearold woman and her 16yearold grandson were found under the debris of their home in ishinomaki , about 30 miles northeast of the city of sendai , according to miyagi prefecture police officials and the public broadcaster nhk the boy , identified as jin abe , crawled out of the debris of the family home and was found by local police officers , who called rescuers to free his grandmother , sumi abe , nhk reported both were hospitalized , but details of their condition were not immediately available meanwhile , the national police agency raised the official death toll to more than 8 , 400 from the and ensuing tsunami the final toll is now expected to reach nearly 20 , 000 at a news conference , police officials in miyagi , the prefecture hit hardest by the tsunami , said they expected the toll there alone to exceed 15 , 000
semey , kazakhstan this spring s hasty campaign season in has sometimes felt like a pep rally for nursultan a nazarbayev , the steelworkerturnedcommunistpartyboss who has ruled the country since 1989 that impression was heightened on sunday when one of the president s three challengers acknowledged that he , too , had voted for mr nazarbayev i am sure that the current president will be the victor , so i am giving him my vote as well , the challenger , mels yeleusizov , an environmental activist , told the interfax news service as he emerged from a polling station in the city of almaty he said his family was voting for mr nazarbayev as well the president , who called snap elections two years ahead of schedule , won by 948 percent , according to an exit poll by the association of sociologists and political scientists of kazakhstan meanwhile , early results from the central election committee suggested that turnout was an extraordinarily high 899 percent , despite opposition leaders who denounced the election as a farce and encouraged voters to stay home mr nazarbayev , 70 , is credited with making oilrich kazakhstan into central asia s island of stability , but he has drawn criticism from the west for stifling dissent in february , seeking to shore up his reputation as an international statesman , mr nazarbayev abruptly rejected the idea of a referendum that would have granted him the presidency until 2020 the election provided an even playing field , he told reporters on sunday all candidates had equal opportunities to visit regions and had access to mass media , mr nazarbayev said on sunday , as he emerged from the country s national academic library , a grandiose new structure that is shaped like a m bius strip they expressed their ideas and unveiled their messages to the people of kazakhstan there are some valuable thoughts that we have to keep in mind we are open to our society in , a university city near the border with siberia , students showed up in large numbers in a snowstorm on sunday morning , and poll workers said there were already lines when they opened the doors at 7 am tolebay k rakhypbekov , rector of the semey state medical university , said political competition would come to kazakhstan but only gradually there is none now , he said but what competition can there be against our president \? we all love him lyudmila a lyapunova , 60 , said voters were there because they risked losing their jobs or university spots if they did not show up as a retiree , she said , she could afford to openly denounce the process , and planned to cross out every name on the ballot an improvised version of against all , a traditional option that was omitted from this year s poll but virtually all voters said they were casting ballots for the president ada g komanova , 76 , raved over the services provided to the elderly through the nazarbayev fund a health clinic , concerts , a senior center so cozy , it s like a fairy tale kanat , a construction worker who would not give his last name , said he had voted for mr nazarbayev , even though he thought the president and his family had enriched themselves fabulously over the last two decades they already have everything they need , he said they can afford to think about the public
it was the last time a challenger defeated an incumbent to take the white house the campaign was dominated by unemployment and the budget deficit the party out of power coalesced around a nominee and drove him to victory only after a tumultuous primary season and complaints that the best potential candidates were sitting it out republicans are hopeful , even confident , that 1992 is a template \( albeit with party roles reversed \) for 2012 it s their version of the historical analogy approach to campaigns that also has president obama and his team mimicking key elements of george w bush s successful 2004 reelection race  these types of comparisons can be simplistic , and misleading if taken too far but they can be a useful framework for examining the conditions working for and against the candidates back then and the lessons they might hold for their counterparts now so here s a matchup of 1992 versus 2012 and a look at where the parallels could benefit one party or the other the economy as the campaign heated up in early 1992 , the unemployment rate stood at 73 percent , and it ticked up to a peak of 78 percent in june 1992 , before edging down slightly over the rest of the year too late and too little to help the republican incumbent , the first president bush the government announced friday that the unemployment rate fell in november to 86 percent from 9 percent a month earlier , putting it at its lowest level since march 2009 and well down from its peak of 101 percent two years ago job creation is ticking up modestly joblessness remains in a higher range than at any other period since the early 1980s , and if it stays around its current level into the middle of next year , it would be the highest unemployment rate since the 1930s during a generalelection season if it was about the economy , stupid in 1992 , now it s the economy , stupid on steroids , said russ schriefer , a top aide to mitt romney , who has based his entire campaign strategy around the economy but the unemployment trend is generally downward , and democrats are now looking hopefully at another historical analogy 1984 , when president reagan won reelection after the rate peaked at 108 in late 1982 , fell to 85 percent a year from election day and drifted down to 74 percent by the time voters went to the polls two cautions for the white house its own forecast shows little improvement in unemployment next year and if the financial crisis in europe deepens , the improving trend could easily reverse populist uprising perhaps the most distinctive feature of the 1992 race was the thirdparty candidacy of h ross perot , whose platform was deficit reduction in many ways he embodied a proto tea party movement , running as an antiestablishment , antielite candidate who captured the early stirrings of the frustration with washington so much more evident among voters today although there is some debate on this score , the general consensus is that mr perot s candidacy hurt mr bush more than it hurt the democratic nominee , bill clinton , and may have cost mr bush a second term one reason that mr clinton was able to deflect the populist power of mr perot s candidacy was that he had a knack for speaking to middle class stresses about the rapidly changing rules of economic life in america in 1992 , we were in the 20th year of real pressure on the middle class , said former senator bob kerrey of nebraska , who ran against mr clinton for the democratic nomination that year there was a lot of talk about whether this would be the first generation whose prospects would not be as good as their parents mr clinton , he added , had really figured out the deep anxiety in the middle class no credible thirdparty bid has gotten off the ground this time around but the tea party movement is energizing republicans against mr obama , forcing the president to address fiscal issues more aggressively than he might have otherwise and mr obama has always had trouble with some middleclass constituencies , especially white , workingclass voters mr kerrey said the president was engaged on the issue but that doesn t mean he s persuading people , mr kerrey said that s one of his biggest challenges persuading people he understands what they are going through the challengers early in the 1992 cycle , mr bush s chances seemed helped by the disarray among the democrats the most formidable potential candidates , starting with gov mario cuomo of new york , chose not to run in a fractious primary field , none of the candidates could establish clear supremacy mr clinton was dogged by scandal , making his character a central issue not until after he locked up the nomination was mr clinton able to rally the party around him the republicans are now going through a similar process a range of establishment figures , from jeb bush to haley barbour and mitch daniels , passed on the race mr romney has not been able to seal the deal yet , newt gingrich carries substantial personal and professional baggage and no one in the rest of the field has been able to sustain a challenge for long but both parties usually manage to generate enthusiasm for their nominees senator john kerry of massachusetts may not have been a dream candidate for democrats in 2004 , but he won 9 million more generalelection votes than al gore had four years earlier whoever emerges from the messy republican nominating contest will no doubt benefit from the intense desire of the party to oust mr obama from office the incumbents president bush ended 1991 with his job approval rating headed down but still above 50 percent his favorable ratings were 14 points higher than his unfavorable ratings but the glow of the victory over iraq in the first gulf war was fading fast by the summer of 1992 , mr bush s jobapproval numbers were in the high 30s , and they stayed around there until election day mr obama is heading into his reelection campaign with jobapproval numbers 46 percent in the most recent new york times cbs news poll lower than those of mr bush at the same point in his term threequarters of voters think the country is on the wrong track , and only 38 percent think mr obama has a clear plan for creating jobs if mr obama has an advantage over mr bush 20 years ago , it is that he has clearly identified the economy as the issue that will determine his fate bush never seriously understood the problem he had , said bob shrum , the veteran democratic strategist by contrast , he said , mr obama over the last few months has settled on a message of , if the republicans

turnover among musicians in longstanding ensembles is inevitable some , like the , simply disband the esteemed founded at the juilliard school in 1969 by four japanese musicians who studied together in tokyo will soon have none of its original members the violist , kazuhide isomura , a founding member , and the second violinist , kikuei ikeda , who joined in 1974 , recently announced that they would retire from the quartet in june 2013 the first violinist , martin beaver , and the cellist , clive greensmith , are auditioning new members to replace their colleagues among the ensemble s final projects in its current incarnation is a twoseason series at the 92nd street y , where it has been in residence since 2003 it in recent concerts there , offering the complete string quartets paired with piano sonatas bartok is now in the spotlight , with each of his six quartets paired with one by haydn , a pivotal figure in the development of the genre on saturday evening , in the first concert of the new series , the program opened with bartok s poignant string quartet no 1 , which blends late romantic harmonies with the terse rhythms and hungarian folk melodies that would shape his ensuing works in the genre the opening theme , described by the 27yearold bartok as his funeral dirge , reflected his suffering over an unrequited love it was conveyed with plaintive intensity here the rest of the work unfolded in an equally vivid palette , with the musicians etching sharp contrasts between moments of introspection and those of rhythmic exuberance haydn also evoked hungarian folk music in works like his string quartet in d \( op 20 , no 4 \) , which came next in the concert the vibrant , energetic interpretation revealed myriad details throughout , particularly in the inventive presto scherzando , which ends in witty fashion as the tokyo quartet nears the end of a major chapter in its history , it shows no sign of weariness it played here with a commitment and a passion that rendered the third work , schumann s string quartet in a \( op 41 , no 3 \) , a treat
the settled into the allstar break on wednesday at nearly the same point where they started the season only now they have two more wins than losses for the knicks , any progress is significant toward ending a sixyear playoff absence after a 10290 victory over the atlanta hawks at madison square garden , the knicks \( 2826 \) squeezed into the sixthseed position in the eastern conference last season , they finished with 29 wins we made a huge jump since last year , amar'e stoudemire said but again , we feel we could have done better before the break and now we understand what it takes to win stoudemire , who returned from a onegame absence because of a sprained right toe and had 23 points and 7 rebounds , departed for the allstar game in los angeles landry fields will play in the freshmansophomore game the other knicks will seek rest and updates potentially , the roster could be changed by the time the knicks reconvene many team executives are also traveling to los angeles , and trade conversations will percolate with the trade deadline next thursday the knicks' next game is wednesday against milwaukee we 're still building our team , coach mike d'antoni said until we get it set , you 're always in this period when you hear rumors and things come out , true or untrue , and you just deal with it according to a knicks official , denver wants raymond felton , landry fields , wilson chandler and danilo gallinari four of their top six players for carmelo anthony and an aging chauncey billups the nuggets have also asked about timofey mozgov the price is too high for the knicks it would damage the roster , leaving anthony and stoudemire without a supporting cast donnie walsh , the knicks' president , has been willing to part with one top rotation player chandler or gallinari in addition to eddy curry s expiring contract and a draft pick the knicks believe they are dealing from a position of strength , armed with the knowledge that anthony wants to play in new york and could by signed as a free agent this summer walsh is adamant about being uninterested in trading the bulk of a young core he would like to see develop right now , denver is making it easy for the knicks to say no , said a person who was briefed on the negotiations if it s a good trade , i would do it , walsh said before the game that s just the way it is but i have to look at the end of the trade and say we 're a good basketball team we did n't just make a good trade' asked if he had a deal he could consummate now , walsh did not hesitate none of your business , he said in the latest merrygoround in the protracted anthony deliberations , the nets and the nuggets are also speaking again about anthony after the nets' majority owner , mikhail d prokhorov , abruptly ended earlier discussions , several media outlets reported the knicks are a wellrounded scoring team five players scored in double figures against atlanta in a game in which the knicks led by double digits nearly the entire night scoring is anthony s most redeemable trait even fans are conflicted a brief we want melo chant was quickly drowned out by boos the game did not carry the same fireworks as the previous matchup in atlanta , when shawne williams and marvin williams exchanged quick punches that resulted in suspensions when the season resumes , the knicks could have a different look to ward off the surging philadelphia 76ers and indiana pacers , who are nipping at the knicks for playoff seeding stoudemire will also have to be mindful of his technicals he is three shy of an automatic onegame suspension the knicks have freed themselves of the lakers and the spurs and of nearly all their long road trips the knicks hope kelenna azubuike will be ready to make his debut soon , and regardless of the anthony saga , anthony randolph and curry will probably be traded or bought out soon the knicks have a game remaining against miami and two against boston , including a formidable conclusion of the season with backtoback games against the bulls and the celtics if they are able to tread water through it all with or without anthony , they will have indeed made progress
dynegy , the embattled power company , said late on monday that its top management team , including its chief executive , plan to resign , as the company failed in its second attempt to sell itself amid strong shareholder opposition bruce a williamson will step down as the company s chairman immediately , and will resign as chief executive on march 11 holli c nichols will also resign as chief financial officer then dynegy named interim replacements for the two , drawn from the company s board dynegy also said that its agreement to sell itself to the billionaire investor carl c icahn , one of the company s biggest shareholders , for 550 a share has expired , after having been extended several times a relatively small number of shareholders had accepted mr icahn s bid , which valued dynegy at about 6649 million at one point , only 44 percent of investors had taken up the offer the surprising decision by dynegy s management team leaves a big leadership vacuum at the company , as it struggles for a new direction amid considerable business pressures dynegy s board has indicated that it does not intend to stay on past the company s annual shareholder meeting , which may be held on june 11 earlier this month , j kevin blodgett resigned as dynegy s general counsel , and was replaced by kent r stephenson dynegy said that it plans to solicit suggestions for new board members from its shareholders while all current directors intend to remain fully engaged in their duties through the 2011 dynegy annual meeting , we expect the new members of the board to take the lead in defining the future composition of the board and in selecting a new chief executive officer , patricia a hammick , the company s incoming chairwoman , said in a statement the resignations follow a campaign by seneca capital , one of dynegy s biggest shareholders , to oppose two takeover offers that the hedge fund deemed insufficient , leading to a heated battle between the two sides seneca has roundly criticized several aspects of dynegy s efforts to sell itself , including what the firm called roadblocks to other potential bidders dynegy said that it has offered board seats to both seneca and to mr icahn neither was immediately available for comment on monday evening before fighting against mr icahn s offer , seneca and mr icahn had teamed up to defeat what eventually became a 5ashare offer by the blackstone group , which included an agreement to sell four power plants to a dynegy rival , nrg energy dynegy described mr icahn s 550ashare offer as a stalkinghorse bid aimed at flushing out higher takeover proposals but none has emerged after two goshop periods to find new suitors still , seneca has proclaimed repeatedly that the takeover proposal was the wrong price at the wrong time for the wrong reasons the firm added that it would not accept even a 6ashare bid for the company much of the impetus behind dynegy s efforts to sell itself is an effort to relieve its roughly 4 billion debt load dynegy expects to become cashflow negative this year , partly because of low natural gas prices but seneca has argued vociferously that dynegy would be selling at a low point in natural gas prices , and that any deal would likely be too hasty to take advantage of a pending rebound much of seneca s ire was trained on mr williamson , who has been dynegy s chief executive since 2002 and its chairman since 2004 the hedge fund has sought to replace mr williamson as chairman with e hunter harrison , a railroad executive , and another director with jeff d hunter , the chief financial officer of the us power generating company bruce has guided dynegy through numerous challenges over his eight year tenure , including stabilizing the company at a time of great uncertainty , ms hammick said separately , dynegy said that it would amend its shareholder rights plan a deal tool often known as a poison pill , aimed at preventing an unwanted takeover to let investors accumulate up to a 20 percent stake in the company raising the bar from 10 percent is meant to help prod investors to buy a bigger position in the company s shares , and potentially help dynegy s stock price shares in dynegy closed on friday at 601 they have risen about 66 percent over the past month , as investors appeared to bet that a higher offer could materialize this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo bruce williamson will leave his chief executive and chairman posts at dynegy \( photograph by richard carson reuters \)
in one of the lockout s signature moments , commissioner the testy exchange offered a convenient prism for viewing the labor crisis management vs employee authority vs subordinate but also , power vs power the 149day lockout was mostly about money and partly about competitive balance , but with a subtext of control the owners saw theirs slipping , and they resolved to seize it back they wanted a hard salary cap to prevent superstars from conspiring they wanted a ban on optout clauses and signandtrade deals to curtail player leverage they wanted a deal packed with financial land mines to discourage the best players from changing teams the owners won some items and lost others , but they ultimately failed to regain control the nba s superstars appear to be just as powerful as ever just days after the lockout ended , to the amid the , putting him in play , too all are looking for big markets and superstar teammates sound familiar \? a year ago , owners squirmed at the sight of lebron james , chris bosh and wade teaming up in miami , at the expense of franchises in cleveland and toronto in february , the denver nuggets bowed to carmelo anthony s request and dealt him to the knicks , who had previously lured amar'e stoudemire from phoenix the utah jazz , fearful of losing williams , preemptively traded him to the nets in a matter of months , five teams three in small markets had lost their franchise players now three more teams , including the smallmarket magic and hornets , are coping with that anxiety the superstars are still flexing their leverage despite a raft of new restrictions and the owners' competitivebalance concerns may soon be exacerbated if paul forces his way to new york and howard ends up with the brooklynbound nets who are pursuing him it would leave eight of the nba s top 20 players concentrated among just three teams \( knicks , nets , heat \) add the los angeles lakers \( kobe bryant , pau gasol \) , the oklahoma city thunder \( kevin durant , russell westbrook \) and the boston celtics \( paul pierce , kevin garnett , rajon rondo \) , and 15 of the league s top 25 players would be spread among just six teams in a league where superstars rule , that is depressing news for the other 24 franchises superteams may boost ratings in may and june , but they do nothing to help ticket sales for a detroitcharlotte game in january the lockout that ended last weekend was not , as some have asserted , a mere power play by the owners their first goal was to slash player costs , which they achieved with a 300 million reduction in salaries they also won concessions to boost competitive balance , with higher taxes and other restraints on the topspending teams but the owners lost their bid to ban extendandtrade deals \( which anthony used \) and contract options , which allow players to terminate their contracts a year early as paul , howard and williams can do next summer nor did the owners get the hard cap they so badly wanted i think that set the league back , the general manager of a smallmarket team said , referring to the hard cap that was the only true way to get parity and they let it go he added , i think the players won this time the pay cuts notwithstanding the new labor deal does give teams some help if howard leaves as a free agent , it would cost him 26 million the difference between a fiveyear , 100 million contract with orlando versus a fouryear , 74 million deal with another team the same goes for williams and paul also , under the new rules , players can no longer get longer , richer contracts in a signandtrade deal , as james did so there are strong incentives to stay put but also , oddly enough , stronger incentives to push for an immediate trade , to avoid the pay cut also , with signandtrade deals now devalued , the players have less incentive to work with their teams that , in turn , could push general managers to trade the players earlier , before free agency none of this means that paul is destined to land in new york the obstacles are huge the knicks have no worthy assets to trade , outside of stoudemire and anthony several teams , including the lakers and the clippers , will make better offers paul does not have a notrade clause , which are rare in the nba he could try to scare off suitors \( as anthony did \) by threatening to opt out next summer , but would he really turn down a partnership with bryant or blake griffin in los angeles \? there are also teams that would acquire paul without assurances , on the belief that they can sell him on staying the knicks obviously recognize their trade handicap they have been offering only oneyear deals to free agents , to preserve their 2012 salarycap room , in case paul , williams or howard hit the market the problem is , the knicks may have as little as 13 million available 4 million less than the maximum salary the most they could give paul would be 55 million over four years the knicks could make room for paul by purging everyone but stoudemire and anthony but they would be left with a threeman roster and a payroll of 568 million , just below the salary cap given the nba s new restrictions , it would be nearly impossible to add any worthwhile players so the knicks may be stymied in their attempt to build an empire but a chorus of smallmarket owners will cheer their failure
worcester , mass cutting through the offensive zone , jonathan cheechoo , who once scored 56 goals in a season for the san jose sharks , appeared ready to score again but this was not the nhl , and when deftly drew the goalie out only to slide the puck to a teammate , the teammate was not ready for it he just has a lot of poise when he gets the puck , said roy sommer , who coaches cheechoo with the worcester sharks of the american hockey league the ahl is not where , a right wing , was supposed to be but meeting the high expectations that came with winning the maurice richard trophy as the nhl s top goal scorer in 20056 proved daunting he led san jose in goals the next season , but his production sank the next two seasons injuries mounted , including a double sports hernia , and his streak of 140 games played ended i lost a little confidence in myself , cheechoo , 30 , said one or two stop going in , you start trying to get a little closer to the net , you 're easier to check and you take less shots i think i tried to get too fine cheechoo is trying to resurrect his career here after failing to catch on with the dallas stars in training camp before this season word of his availability spread quickly , and sommer , who had coached cheechoo at the start of his professional career with the kentucky thoroughblades of the , took a chance on him with his talent , at this level , he should be able to get things done here , sommer said we got ahold of him he was in here the next day he added , i just thought this would be a good opportunity for him to get back in nhl san jose drafted cheechoo 29th over all in 1998 from the ontario hockey league two years later , he and sommer united with kentucky i always respect what he did , cheechoo said of sommer he got me playing and helped me make the transition to pro hockey cheechoo skated in 66 games for san jose in 2002 the next season , he scored 28 goals he and sommer kept in touch and visited occasionally as their careers progressed he s a special kid , sommer said when you look where he s come from and the long road that he s taken to get to the nhl , then he kind of fell out of favor cheechoo leads the sharks , a san jose affiliate in massachusetts , in points \( 18 goals , 29 assists \) despite missing time to an upper body injury the sharks trail the connecticut whale by 2 points for the third and final guaranteed playoff spot in the atlantic division with 12 games left in the regular season preserving cheechoo , whose body is more frail than his optimism , is a priority the last couple of years were n't very fun , cheechoo said the game is still the game of hockey i always want to play at a high level cheechoo s route to the minors began last year , after san jose traded him , milan michalek and a draft pick to the ottawa senators for the unhappy wing dany heatley i hit a lot of posts , cheechoo said goalies made some nice saves on me , too it s one of those things where you 're gripping your stick a lot tighter i was n't really relaxed and playing my type of game at first , cheechoo , a cree indian , welcomed the move to ottawa , which he called probably the closest place you 're going to get to my hometown , , 450 miles away at the southern end of hudson bay there were people at every game , he said it was nice to have that kind of support but he was unable to replicate his stellar season with san jose , appearing in 61 games with 5 goals , 9 assists and a minus13 rating he was demoted to the senators' ahl affiliate in binghamton , ny , then was released in the offseason as nhl training camps neared , cheechoo had few options he said he could have gone to russia or played for a european team , which he did during the 20045 lockout , but he declined being in the nhl was a goal of mine when i was a young kid and that has n't changed , he said when you 're overseas , you 're more out of sight , cheechoo added it s harder for anyone to see you and pick you up i wanted to take a chance here cheechoo is playing to be seen i know when i get the puck i can score , he said and he has focused on improving his speed , a conspicuous weakness he s been working on foot explosiveness using ladders and hoops , said matt white , worcester s trainer quick stop runs , with cones , for 10 yards his work ethic is second to none off the ice , cheechoo provides valued experience to a team on the ahl playoff bubble he comes to the rink and if anything s bothering him , you 'd never know it , sommer said for now , cheechoo must settle for more sentimental honors he was to be inducted into the little native hockey league s hall of fame on saturday , but would miss the induction ceremony to chase the playoffs and , he hopes , another shot at the nhl i would not count jonathan cheechoo out from playing in the league again , doug wilson , san jose s general manager , said sommer agreed you do n't score 56 goals in the nhl and not know what you 're doing , he said
sherwood schwartz , who created gilligan s island and the brady bunch , two of the most affectionately ridiculed and enduring television sitcoms of the 1960s and '70s , died on tuesday in los angeles he was 94 his death was confirmed by his daughter , hope juber mr schwartz weathered painfully dismissive reviews to see his shows prosper and live on for decades in syndication many critics suggested that they were successful because they ran counter to the tumultuous times in which they appeared the era of the vietnam war and sweeping social change give or take a month or so , the original network run of the brady bunch coincided with two major upheavals in american society the show , about a squeakyclean blended family in california , began in 1969 , shortly after woodstock , and ended in 1974 , soon after president richard m nixon s resignation following the watergate scandal mr schwartz s work may have been seen as lighthearted entertainment , but some scholars of popular culture took it very seriously david marc and robert j thompson , authors of prime time , prime movers , in which they advance an auteur theory of television , considered mr schwartz an innovator who made a surgical strike into the national psyche describing the advent of gilligan s island , which told the story of seven very different castaways stranded on a desert island , they wrote , schwartz was pioneering a dramatic matrix built upon the emerging cultural concept of the support group' a collection of demographically diverse characters thrown together by circumstance and forced to become an ersatz family' in order to survive mr schwartz , in a 1996 interview , said that he had always planned the series as a social statement , the message being , it s one world , and we all have to learn to live with each other once or twice a year , he added , he received word of an academic paper whose author claimed to have uncovered the real meaning of the series , also stating that its creator probably had no idea what he was really saying not so mr schwartz remembered describing the idea of gilligan s island to william s paley , then chairman of cbs , as a microcosm mr paley , he recalled , blanched and said , oh , god , i thought it was a comedy show , to which mr schwartz quickly responded , but it s a funny microcosm ! mr schwartz was also largely responsible for his shows' , which spelled out the premises in detail the ballad of gilligan s island , which mr schwartz wrote with george wyle , told the story of those castaways and how they ended up on that island it began the brady bunch theme , which mr schwartz wrote by himself , told the story of a woman with three daughters and a man with three sons who met and married viewers who swore they had never been fans of either show somehow knew the lyrics , or at least could n't help associating phrases like a threehour tour or with the two series sherwood charles schwartz was born in passaic , nj , on nov 4 , 1916 he grew up in brooklyn and was a premed student at new york university after receiving his bachelor s degree , he moved to los angeles to attend graduate school at the university of southern california , but the master s he earned in biological sciences was never put to use in 1938 , while waiting for acceptance to medical school , he asked his brother albert , who worked on bob hope s radio show , if he could try writing a few jokes soon there were two schwartzes on hope s payroll after world war ii , during which sherwood schwartz wrote for armed forces radio , he became a writer for the adventures of ozzie and harriet , which was then on the radio he made the transition to television in the 1950s with the sitcom i married joan and the red skelton show , for which he became head writer in 1961 he shared an emmy award with his brother , skelton and two other writers for the show in addition to his daughter , mr schwartz is survived by his wife , mildred three sons , lloyd , a television producer , donald and ross eight grandchildren and four greatgrandchildren gilligan s island began broadcasting in september 1964 , with a cast that included bob denver as gilligan , a bumbling first mate alan hale jr as the skipper of the shipwrecked boat and jim backus as thurston howell iii , a millionaire , who managed to practice elitism while living in a hut guest stars turned up as british butterfly collectors , misguided aviators or headhunters in grass skirts , sometimes raising hope for the castaways' rescue but they were always left behind , even when the series ended in 1967 the castaways finally did leave the island in a 1978 reunion special , rescue from gilligan s island there were other specials then , in 2004 , the show was the inspiration for a reality series , the real gilligan s island , starring contestants whose reallife identities \( millionaire , skipper and so on \) matched those of the characters as early as 1995 and as recently as this year , there was talk of a gilligan s island feature film the brady bunch had its premiere in september 1969 it starred florence henderson and robert reed as cleancut newlyweds with children whose most serious problems were usually on the level of sibling rivalry or a student council election the show lasted five seasons and , in a way , refused to die after reruns proved enormously popular , there were three attempts at spinoff series \( none lasted longer than half a season \) a stage show , the real live brady bunch , in which original episodes of the series were reenacted and the brady bunch movie , which had two sequels in interviews mr schwartz talked about having intercepted a script for the first movie in which the brady children used fourletter words he told paramount that he would personally campaign against the film if the language remained so when the first film , set in the 1990s , opened , the obliviously wholesome bradys appeared to be living in a time warp , still dressing , talking and behaving as if it were the early '70s apparently mr schwartz had his way

mark hertsgaard has posted a piece defending his push against climate cranks , including an apology for his errant description of his relationship with politico  mark hertsgaard , a journalist and author long focused on the environment , has a new book and a related environmental campaign the book , hot , focuses on building resilience to climatic and related challenges looming in the next 50 years i ve just started reading it this weekend this post is not focused on the book this week , hertsgaard took his generation hot campaign to washington to confront lawmakers fighting restrictions on emissions of greenhouse gases he calls such politicians climate cranks you might also call them generation coal  there are now dueling youtube videos \( do you remember the dueling videos of a clash between whalers and environmentalists \? \) portraying one resulting capitol hill confrontation , between hertsgaard and his team and senator james m inhofe , the oklahoma republican who is the minority leader on the environment and public works committee and has long described catastrophic humandriven global warming as a hoax hertsgaard s video is above , inhofe s below  the videos likely will entertain and energize the audiences each man is cultivating in hertsgaard s case communitarian activists hoping to build momentum for restrictions on greenhouse gases and in inhofe s case a mix of ideological conservatives and freemarketeers \( the yale project on climate change communication has done a lot of work revealing how powerfully such cultural and ideological predispositions shape views of the phenomenon too loosely called global warming \) for whatever reason , inhofe s video has attracted close to 20 times the views of the nearly identical depiction of the capitol hill encounter from hertsgaard it doesn t help hertsgaard s case that he told inhofe he was from politico , apparently aiming to imply that his recent oped piece for the site was the same as having an affiliation with it politico s energy editor denied this  regardless of video viewership , i don t see this approach to activism being a productive way forward on climate and energy , particularly for young people seeking a meaningful role in fostering progress that can fit on a finite planet in a 2008 piece on what i call generation e , i articulated a form of activism that might work \( also see young activists seek roles on energy , climate \) below you can read hertsgaard s replies to a couple of questions i sent during his washington tour , followed by a very different approach to the denialist crank realist skeptic community \( choose your label as you would your favorite physics nobel laureate \) articulated by randy olson , the marine biologist turned filmmaker who is also the author of don t be such a scientist  do you think it makes sense to keep focusing kids on the woe is me , shame on you approach to climate action given the entrenched nature of both the alarmed and dismissive elements in society \? \( as delineated by the six americas study \? \) as someone who has closely followed the climate change issue over the last twenty years and has seen how the disinformation campaign of the carbon lobby and other deniers has undermined strong us government action to confront this threat , i think it is important and , yes , effective to to call out the deniers for what they have done that the us has done so little against climate change is due in no small part to the fact that our government and , crucially , the mainstream media have spent almost as much time over the last twenty years listening to antiscientific climate cranks as they have to genuine , peerreviewed scientists all of us will suffer as a result , but if i were under the age of 25 i would be especially angry about this indeed , as the father of a five year old daughter , i find myself very angry as well i therefore find it entirely appropriate for young people in particular \( and all of us who love them \) to give voice to that anger and to demand better this is an emotional truth , and emotional truth is critical to effective messaging that said , my message in hot and the message of the generation hot campaign to confront the climate cranks is by no means solely a negative one \( as in your reference to woe is me , shame on you \) on the contrary , roughly 80 percent of hot is devoted to ontheground reporting that focuses on solutions not just the relatively well known options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and otherwise limiting global warming , but especially the related but much less recognized imperative of preparing our societies for the many significant climate impacts \( eg , stronger storms , deeper droughts , harsher heat waves , etc , \) that , alas , are now unavoidable over the years ahead the fact is , there are cuttingedge leaders throughout the world in government , in civil society and even some businesses that are already implementing effective measures to both avoid the unmanageable and manage the unavoidable , as the specialists urge in sum , i think we need both a strong moral message that pulls no punches about how we got into this mess and a strong pragmatic message that emphasizes that there are many things we can do to cope with our dilemma in that sense , hot \( which , i understand , you ve not been able to read yet \) is a good news story about a bad news predicament and we will be emphasizing both of these messages as our generation hot campaign goes forward \( the 3 minute video you saw of course could not do justice to this \) i speak to college and high school kids all the time , and i know one cannot simply be negative in discussing the climate crisis or they will turn off and become paralyzed by despair \( as many grownups already have \) one must offer hope as well fortunately , there are ample , concrete reasons for hope not just in the form of the solutions i report in hot but also in the lessons we are getting these days from a country where i have reported in the past egypt , where a tyrannical regime that seemed impregnable as recently as two months ago has now fallen to a popular , largely peaceful and entirely unexpected revolution you also seem , by using republicans as a uniform term , to close out the option of highlighting republicans \( however few they may be \) who are engaged on this issue , like sherwood boehlert  i would be delighted if more republicans accepted mainstream climate science and took the climate crisis seriously , but it appears that is no longer acceptable behavior within the gop during the 2010 congressional elections , denial of manmade climate change became a litmus test issue not a single new republican member of congress will say \( at least publicly \) they accept that human activities are dangerously overheating the planet as i wrote in my opinion piece yesterday in politico , which you should read if you haven t \( and which criticizes the media quite strongly for its de facto enabling of the climate cranks \) , the us republican party is the only major political party in the world that still rejects mainstream climate science look at the rightofcenter parties currently heading the governments of our closest european allies britain , germany , france none of them have questioned the science behind climate change for more than a decade they may argue about which policies are the best way to address the problem , what mix of government regulations and private sector actions is best , but not one challenges the science for that matter , these parties climate policies are far more aggressive than those of us democrats , much less republicans so it s the current republican party that is the outlier here it is telling that the one republican you cite by name in your question , sherry boehlert , is retired he would surely not survive the republican primaries were he running for congress today more s the pity randy olson posted a piece on his blog this week rejecting the usversusthem approach on climate , alluding to a famous duet at the grammy awards by elton john and eminem , who found common cause in fighting hiv despite huge differences on homosexuality here s a snippet from a rather brutal olson email review of the generation hot video keep in mind that part of his career these days is running workshops on making small punchy films \( also keep in mind that the video is just a small part of what hertsgaard and his collaborators are doing \) what do these guys think they are doing with this video ambush \? they have no clue about the superficiality of video it s about what malcolm gladwell talks about in blink it only takes a few seconds of video to make up most of your mind about someone and what they have to say in the same way that the guy at the end says , the science doesn t matter , similarly , for the most part , the words don t matter in a video like this this is not a written article where readers will carefully digest the words it s a video where the viewer quickly passes judgment on the characters on screen what you see here is a selfrighteous guy with a pack of associated whiners ambushing a soft spoken grandfatherly senator in the mold of ronald reagan in the pack is a terse young woman with an accusatory tone who cares what the issue is , her whole presence is overbearing and irritating who cares what they re saying i don t in any way support the grandfather , but i feel bad that he has to put up with this it s like when michael moore , whom i generally support , ambushed charlton heston in bowling for columbine you ended up feeling bad for the old guy , when you shouldn t i agree with hertsgaard , utterly , that the republican party has utterly failed to articulate any kind of energy policy despite clear signals that business as usual produces building risks of instability \( climatic , economic , strategic \) in this century review this piece for more  stop energy poverty great slogan how \?  the republicans are little different on science and innovation , despite transitory nods to the need for a sustained push in this arena , including a recent column from george will , as discussed here  rev the scientific engine great how \? to my mind , president obama , despite dodging the issue in his state of the union message , still has a chance this year to marginalize polarizing voices and build a new route forward on energy and climate let s hope he takes the chance
gerry rafferty , a scottish singer and songwriter who combined a gift for melody , a distinctive voice and a fatalistic worldview to produce 1970s hits like stuck in the middle with you and baker street , died tuesday in dorset , england he was 63 his death was confirmed by michael gray , his former manager , in an obituary he wrote for the london newspaper the guardian , and later by his agent , paul charles , in a report by the associated press various news reports said mr rafferty had been hospitalized for severe liver and kidney problems mr rafferty s 1978 album , city to city , reached no 1 in the united states one track , made the top 10 in both britain and the united states so did a song mr rafferty and joe egan recorded with their group stealers wheel in 1972 that song reached a new generation of listeners when quentin tarantino used it in the notorious earslicing scene in his 1992 movie in all , mr rafferty sold more than 10 million albums over three decades but mr gray , writing in the guardian , said mr rafferty s success was a shadow of what it might have been at the peak of his popularity , mr rafferty declined to tour the united states and turned down chances to play with eric clapton and paul mccartney in his later years his output declined , then stopped altogether as he spiraled into alcoholism , mr gray said mr rafferty himself said in a rare interview in 2009 with the sunday express that he suffered from depression but at his peak mr rafferty drew rave reviews for his synthesis of country , folk and rock music reviewing city to city in rolling stone , ken emerson said mr rafferty writes with the sweet melodiousness of paul mccartney and sings with john lennon s weary huskiness mr emerson discerned a prayerful quality in mr rafferty s voice , reminiscent of the dim dawn after a dark night of the soul almost from his birth in paisley , scotland , on april 16 , 1947 , gerald rafferty knew plenty about life s dark side he and his mother would hide from his father to avoid being beaten when he stumbled home drunk , mr gray wrote but music pervaded the family s life , as young gerry assimilated roman catholic hymns , traditional folk music , 1950s pop and even the irish rebel tunes his deaf father bellowed mr rafferty dropped out of school at 15 and went to work in a butcher shop on weekends he and a friend , mr egan , played in a local group , the mavericks after bouncing about a bit , mr rafferty and mr egan reunited in stealers wheel , whose debut album included stuck in the middle stuck in the middle , written as a parody of many of bob dylan s songs , ridiculed a music industry cocktail party , complaining , clowns to the left of me , jokers to the right , here i am , stuck in the middle with you by 1975 , stealers wheel had broken up after recording three albums , and mr rafferty spent the next three years in legal disputes over contracts finally , in 1978 , he was free to record again and signed with united artists city to city , a solo effort , was his first album for the label its centerpiece song , baker street , featured a saxophone solo by raphael ravenscroft that became so popular it was said to spark a global increase in saxophone sales mr rafferty went on to record several more albums , including night owl , which made it to the top five in england and the top 20 in the united states in 1979 other albums followed , some of which garnered good reviews but none of which approached mr rafferty s earlier success he contributed a vocal to the soundtrack of the 1983 film local hero , and produced mr rafferty s marriage to carla ventilla ended in divorce he is survived by his daughter , martha , a brother and a granddaughter in the 2009 interview , mr rafferty called the music industry something i loathe and detest nevertheless , he earned nearly 125 , 000 a year in royalties for baker street alone
peter lieberson , who wrote music of such visceral intensity that it seemed to startle even him , at 64 if he dealt with his final illness the way he handled previous misfortunes , i suspect he saw it as an opportunity for growth peter never let a crisis go to waste he took a tortuous road toward maturity , and every difficulty enriched his imagination , bringing him closer to the music he was meant to write as a man born into privilege , who idolized his family s unsentimental friend igor stravinsky and studied with the cerebral milton babbitt , peter might have rejected the notion that suffering improves art but he once told me that an emotional breakdown in college had led to his decision to be a composer and that when his vocation could n't give him the succor he needed , he had turned to the buddhist faith that infused all his work i met him in 1984 , as he headed into another desert of the soul he arrived at harvard as a 41yearold assistant professor , fresh from the world premiere of his first piano concerto by the boston symphony orchestra and his childhood friend peter serkin his day job involved explaining the arcane workings of secondinversion dominants and neapolitan sixths to a class of puzzled undergraduates that included me he presented music as an intricate but manageable system for organizing pitches and rhythms a sort of harmonic sudoku i was planning to conduct his early concerto for four groups of instruments in a student concert , and he helped me navigate the tightly wound , irregular rhythms and constant changes of meter he marveled at the cramped hand in which he had written out the score , and recalled that the rhythms juddered so powerfully through his body while he was working on it that they made his stomach muscles ache that expertly wrought but astringent little piece harmonized with my picture of peter , a thin man with a deliberate manner and a perfectly knotted tie yet when i joined students and faculty members around a table to hear a live recording of his piano concerto , an hourlong monster of a piece , i was stunned by its shaggy wildness it opens with a primal rumble of piano , timpani and brass , then plunges into mighty supernovas of dissonance , jaunty bernstein brass riffs , sweaty violin crescendos , quiet conversations among solo strings , and a relentlessly virtuosic piano part even this sprawling score ca n't contain all the ideas that proliferate and then flare out the new yorker critic andrew porter wrote approvingly that the concerto invoked the great romantics of the past , including rachmaninoff , a comment that flattered peter but embarrassed him , too stravinsky or schoenberg i could understand , he said , searching for influences considered more respectable in academic circles , but rachmaninoff \? it was almost as if he could feel his bid for tenure slipping away i was a budding composer , and for three years he was my patient , generous and zealous teacher his influence was positive and profound but he wrestled with the problem of how to guide students when his own artistic convictions were in flux his religious practice was central to his life , but he rarely talked about it or he tried , and sensed his audience s impatience chafing within the confines of academe , he soon bowed out and moved his family to halifax , nova scotia , where he ran a buddhist organization , the shambhala training institute that decision struck me as a model of pristine selfknowledge , yet as a composer he struggled for years to achieve that kind of clarity in piece after piece , he tried to dominate his own inspiration , rejecting his most elemental ideas as too obvious and disguising his natural lyricism in thickets of modernist complexity a few years ago , he recalled the intense discomfort of that period for me and for many of our generation , the '70s and '80s were a strange and transitional period , he wrote in an email most of the successful composers of the previous generation had complete conviction in 12tone music , the one after mine had none , and our own was struggling to reconcile the intellectual strength of the approach with the difficulty of finding expressivity in it i only hope that this conflict did n't pass on to my students too much when i was teaching i remember being most concerned about the effect of what i might have said to you about your music , he added i took that as a tactful inquiry as to whether my education had traumatized me and forced me to stop composing he had been worrying about this for nearly 20 years ! i reassured him that i had made the switch from notes to words gladly and freely my answer , he wrote back , provided him with a real sense of relief though he abandoned his ivy league perch , moved abroad and organized his life around buddhism , peter was a member in good standing of new york s musical aristocracy his father , goddard lieberson , had been the president of cbs records his mother , vera zorina , had been married to george balanchine and was a principal dancer in the ballets russe de monte carlo in the fall of 1996 , i attended a workshop performance of his , ashoka s dream , in leonard bernstein s apartment in the dakota bernstein had been dead for seven years , but his presence still permeated the room those were his books on the shelf , and it was his piano that the singers clustered around stephen wadsworth , the director of the first \( and so far only \) production of ashoka s dream , at the santa fe opera , had written the libretto for bernstein s opera a quiet place bernstein had also given peter one of his first jobs , as an assistant on the televised young people s concerts the workshop felt less like a runthrough than an anointing the opera is based on the life of ashoka , the ancient indian king who slaughtered thousands before embracing gentleness and nonviolence peter admired the warrior s capacity for transformation , especially since he understood how wrenching change could be he had rarely written for the voice and never for the stage , and he produced an alternately inert and furious opera , with vocal lines that kept leaping around and then reverting to the safety of chants yet there were moments when he swept away the clotted textures and found clearings of loveliness begins with plush , magenta chords that glisten darkly like a bill evans solo , and the voice snakes through the mezzosoprano s peaty low register until it magically lifts off for the plangent question my son , where shall my son find his life \? i wonder how many of the people sitting in bernstein s study , listening to lorraine hunt sing that piercing song , suspected where peter s emotional life was heading that opera about a man who takes charge of his destiny certainly altered the composer s shortly after the premiere , he left his wife and three daughters , moved to santa fe and married the star , who became lorraine hunt lieberson their nineyear partnership gave his music the glow of earthly romance she taught him how to write music for her to sing , and he turned to the sonnets of the chilean poet pablo neruda , where he found a treasury of mournful passions y t no mueres , no demos al dolor m s territorio , begins one poem he chose my love , if i die and you do n't , let s not give grief an even greater field in neruda songs , his most heartbreakingly sensuous work , peter shed the angular reticence of a lifetime and mined the florid intensity of handel , the violent grace of flamenco and the elemental eloquence he learned from lorraine the fact that she sang the premiere in 2005 and a year later gives neruda songs the quality of an epitaph two years ago , peter copied out a page of the score and sent it to me , a valedictory , generous and slightly vainglorious gesture peter remarried and continued to write music he set more of neruda s poetry in songs of love and sorrow and finished remembering jfk at his death , he was working on a percussion concerto i suppose , in a sense , he was right to worry that his example nipped my composing career , because from him i absorbed a belief in composing as a means of survival he continued working even when illness and grief sapped his energy or blackened his future , because he expressed himself first and best in music his broad grin , gentle reserve and air of appreciative good fortune always made it look easy to be peter lieberson , but his scores reveal the tectonic tensions and roiling core beneath his courtly exterior
forward operating base sharana , afghanistan american and afghan soldiers near the border with have faced a sharply increased volume of rocket fire from pakistani territory in the past six months , putting them at greater risk even as worries over the disintegrating relationship between the united states and pakistan constrain how they can strike back groundtoground rockets fired within pakistan have landed on or near american military outposts in one afghan border province at least 55 times since may , according to interviews with multiple american officers and data released in the past week last year , during the same period , there were two such attacks may is also when members of a navy seals team killed osama bin laden in the house where he lived near a pakistani military academy , plunging americanpakistani relations to a new low since then , the escalation in crossborder barrages has fueled frustration among officers and anger among soldiers at frontline positions who suspect , but cannot prove , a pakistani government role the government s relations with the united states frayed further after senior american officials publicly accused pakistan of harboring and helping guerrillas and terrorists last month , adm mike mullen , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff at the time , called the insurgents who attacked the american embassy in the afghan capital of the isi , pakistan s military intelligence service pakistani officials have repeatedly denied aiding fighters for the and the , who operate on both sides of the border they insist they try to prevent crossborder incursions or violence in this climate , american officers were in a difficult position when describing the attacks many , especially those who might be identified , painstakingly tried not to blame pakistan directly i do n't have the smoking gun , said col edward t bohnemann , who commands the 172nd infantry brigade , which has hundreds of american soldiers in outposts near the border do i have my thoughts , just because it happens so often \? yes , i have my thoughts but there is n't a smoking gun but other officers viscerally rejected pakistan s official position , and said elements of the pakistani military or intelligence service were most likely involved the level of command and control , and the level of sophistication of the idf , is showing that there is some type of expertise being employed , said one american officer , using the acronym for indirect fire , the term the military uses for mortar , artillery and rocket attacks the officer spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic tensions the precise reasons for the increase in rocket fire are unclear whether the surge in attacks indicates pakistani military retaliation , an emboldened insurgency , some degree of both or some other factors cannot be determined from the data alone the attacks covered by the military s data included those on three americanafghan outposts forward operating base tillman , combat outpost boris and combat outpost margah and usually involved two to four rockets each , officers said the incoming fire has continued through recent days , including an attack last friday that set buildings ablaze at forward operating base tillman the data release does not include attacks against american military positions in provinces other than paktika or against forward operating base lilley , in the same province , which is used by the cia but it does include attacks from several insurgent positions just inside afghanistan , some within 200 yards of the border , from where rocket crews fire and then rush to pakistan there were at least 102 of these socalled closeborder attacks against the same outposts since may , including that the american military called the largest and most coordinated insurgent operation in the province since 2009 last year , during the same period in the same places , there were 13 closeborder attacks most of the indirectfire attacks , officers said , have been with 107millimeter rockets , which have a range of about five miles they were designed in china in the 1960s but have been reproduced by several nations the exact source of the rockets was not immediately clear chunks of expended munitions examined by the new york times had minimal markings , preventing a ready identification the perils and sensitivities surrounding the rocket fire starkly underscored the longstanding difficulties faced by the latest rotation of soldiers in the afghan war , who are in frontline positions built by previous units , under fire , but with restrictions on firing back or when planning operations to deter more attacks another officer , who analyzed each incident , said attacks often come from positions next to pakistani military or frontier corps border posts he said there has been no sign of pakistani units trying to stop the firing , or of willingness to help american units identify who is shooting at them he offered a commonly held assessment they are getting help , the officer said of the insurgents it s pakmil , he added , using the acronym for pakistani military asked what evidence supported this claim , he said contact with the pakmil when these incidents are going on is often nonexistent we usually ca n't get a hold of these guys when we do get a hold of these guys , they say they are not aware or ca n't see it looking at the terrain , it is very hard to believe the officer pointed on a map to several frequently used firing sites then he pointed to pakistani military positions some pakistani military positions were less than a mile from insurgent firing positions and had clear line of sight the officer asked not to be identified other officers added that the americans have been lucky so far none of the rockets have wounded an american soldier since july 1 , roughly when the current unit began to arrive in the province a 107millimeter rocket that struck forward operating base tillman on july 27 , however , wounded 18 afghan guards , three of them fatally the rocket was fired from pakistan , officers said several officers said that a rocket could strike an american building any day , to similar effect eventually we 're going to get hit , and we 're going to lose soldiers , one said this officer was especially frustrated , he said , because an operation planned for early october , in which soldiers intended to sweep on foot through a firing position on afghan soil beside the border , was canceled by senior officers in , where the regional american command is located the general who soldiers said had canceled that mission did not reply to a written request to be interviewed the day after the cancellation , journalists at forward operating base tillman observed rockets fired from that position onto the base enlisted soldiers there seethed the soldiers explained the usual practices when taking fire from afghanistan , they said , they return fire with barrages of highexplosive and artillery rounds \( the burning effects of white phosphorus , they said , can detonate rockets waiting on launchers for this reason , white phosphorus falls within rules guiding the soldiers' use of force \) when receiving fire from pakistan , they said , they do not return fire with white phosphorus and fire far fewer highexplosive rounds attack helicopters and aircraft are also less likely to fire ordnance the closer the firing position is to the border , they said , even if it is on the afghan side several soldiers complained of what they called the politics limiting their choices we 're just sitting out here taking fire , one soldier said if they want us to do our jobs , let us do our jobs senior officers described a tactical and strategic puzzle on one hand , soldiers said a principle of any modern military defense is that they patrol to and beyond the range of weapons systems that can menace them , and , in this case , at least to the border of the nation that the united states , in essence , has underwritten on the other , heavy return fire against the firing positions inside afghanistan has not prevented the attacks from continuing , so it is not clear that more fire into pakistan would stop the crossborder firing , either and colonel bohnemann noted a complicated history afghan units have patrolled to the border , he said , and then been fired on by pakistani military units who claimed they mistook the afghans for insurgents that fighting included pakistani artillery fire the risk of having an american patrol face similar fire has been reasonable grounds for caution when planning sweeps near the border , and when returning fire over it , he said am i frustrated \? he asked yes would i like to fire more \? yes but do i want to be sure not to escalate out of frustration \? absolutely one recent attack which both marked an escalation from pakistan and hinted at the coordination and expertise behind it occurred on oct 3 , when four 122millimeter rockets were fired at one of the outposts these rockets , known as grads , are larger , more lethal and have a greater range than 107millimeter rockets they had not been fired at the american outposts here in recent memory , officers said , and perhaps had not been fired before each round struck closer than the previous one , which indicated , four military officers said , that whoever fired them from pakistan was communicating with a forward observer near the outpost , and adjusting the fire the americans' counterbattery radar indicated that the firing position was less than 100 feet from a pakistani frontier corps border post , several officers said the americans contacted a pakistani military officer who lives on forward operating base tillman and serves as a liaison between the two militaries his answer cast the episode into gray he called me back a few minutes later and said that border position is unoccupied and empty , and has been for years , colonel bohnemann said that may be an absolutely true statement , he added i do n't know
tyler hansbrough must have the alarm on his biological clock set for midmarch the fourtime associated press allamerican is no stranger to the month s basketball festivities he won an ncaa tournament championship as a member of the 2009 north carolina tar heels but this year s occasion provides contrast through caliber of competition rather than roll over lowerseeded teams on a deep tournament run , hansbrough has risen and dominated prolevel opposition still , the epithets and descriptors that so commonly accompany hansbrough s name are very telling even in nba circles , hansbrough is more often regarded as a former north carolina star than a legitimate pro basketball commodity , a figure so thoroughly draped in his past successes that his future prospects might have been obscured over the last few weeks though , he has proven his worth as an nba player the indiana pacers may be doing their best as a collective to destroy their playoff chances , but hansbrough has averaged 224 points and 78 rebounds over the last eight games , rewarding pacers coach frank vogel for his vote of confidence in the secondyear forward there s no question that this has been the most productive stretch of hansbrough s young career , as he scored 20 points in six of his last eight contests and still managed a doubledouble against the boston celtics in one of the two lesser games hansbrough has dominated weak and strong defensive teams alike squads from the wolves to the bulls have struggled to thwart hansbrough s midrange jumpers , unorthodox drives and highenergy style on a team that lacks a legitimate offensive focal point \( danny granger is a fine player , but let s not delude ourselves into thinking of him as a centerpiece \) , hansbrough has become something of a makeshift star there are shots and touches to be had in indiana , and though hansbrough isn t using them by design , he has nonetheless become an efficient outlet for the pacers possessions unfortunately , what hansbrough has done thus far is the easy part producing at a high level over a small sample size against opponents expecting to counter the likes of granger , roy hibbert and darren collison is nice , but it s not exactly indicative of a legitimate climb into stardom sustained performance would be a start on that path , but the even greater challenge as i noted earlier this season in regard to hibbert s rocky ascent , coincidentally is for an nba player to maintain a high level of play against teams prepared to stop him specifically those gaudy scoring and rebounding averages hansbrough has posted over the last few weeks \? they aren t meant to last hansbrough has capitalized on a terrific opportunity , but myriad factors have also worked in his favor opposing defenses were not ready for his explosion hansbrough s pacers teammates were not playing well enough to command more shots he finally had a coach who was willing to give him minutes , and had shed the injuries that had long kept his nba potential a secret yet once opposing teams begin to make hansbrough a point of emphasis , his limited athleticism , lack of size and onandoff jumper the very factors that made him a late lottery selection in the nba draft rather than a top pick will sting there is a reason basketball scouts at all levels are not just identifying the next great player , but the next great athlete it s the quickest guy on the court with a handle who can bust a press it s the highest leaper who can fire a jumper over the arms of a shotblocker it s the biggest , strongest guy around who can push opponents from the low block all of those abilities require raw athleticism and skill , but each inch of height and each millisecond on a sprint mean something it s those factors that in the absence of truly extraordinary skill allow basketball players to thrive even if he is an underrated athlete , hansbrough simply cannot claim strength , speed or size as an advantage on this level that lack of athleticism alone is not necessarily limiting , but hansbrough also does not yet have a surefire jumper or a reliable backtothebasket game none of those things have stopped him from thriving recently , but they create a disconnect between what the pacers currently need hansbrough to be an impromptu source of points and rebounds and a more hopeful future as a genuine and undeniable star hansbrough is perfectly capable , but the better he plays , the harder it will be for him to maintain his performance it s the game s own internal check and balance against overperformers , and hansbrough is certainly outdoing himself it does not seem fair to say that hansbrough will eventually regress , but his oncourt production seems likely to slip once opposing teams better understand what it is that makes him effective he will eventually settle in as the above average but subelite player that he is and has been the frenetic , productive , lowturnover big man who , while lacking in star power or amazing potential , is nonetheless an important part of the pacers young core
miami gardens , fla with huge swaths of seats unfilled , sun life stadium was eerily quiet monday night so were the ' bats the mets had 10 hits , but three of them came in the final inning , as they were  for the second time in a week , the mets were subdued by marlins starter , who , at citi field on aug 30 vazquez was almost as good monday he allowed six hits and one run , struck out seven and walked none in seven innings he easily outshined his counterpart , chris capuano , who was pulled after four innings , having given up six runs and eight hits the ball was up , and it was flat , capuano said of his pitches it was another one of those nights i could not make the adjustment the mets scored their first run in the fourth inning , when david wright hit a triple and scored on angel pagan s groundout to left in the ninth it s great for jason , manager terry collins said of bay , who had two hits and raised his average to 233 i hope he does finish strong capuano threw a wild pitch in the first that allowed emilio bonifacio to score and gave up a runscoring single to logan morrison later in the inning jose lopez homered in the third , making it 30 , and the marlins ended capuano s night with a threerun fourth , highlighted by a tworun single by bonifacio d j carrasco , who replaced capuano , did not fare much better , allowing three runs and seven hits in two innings carrasco gave up a run in the fifth and two more in the sixth , when gaby sanchez hit a tworun single to left
in 1955 , a political scientist named v o key published an essay entitled he argued that realignments in american politics are usually punctuated by transformative elections , in which the old order suddenly gives way and a new majority emerges in its place this realignment theory was embraced by many scholars because it fit the historical record so well every 30 to 40 years , it seemed , the american political order had decisively turned over in 1800 , when thomas jefferson s democraticrepublicans trounced john adams s federalists in 1828 , when the democraticrepublicans split into the democrats and the whigs and then on down through abraham lincoln s 1860 victory , william mckinley s 1896 consolidation of a republican majority , and the emergence of franklin roosevelt s new deal coalition but what made sense to the political scientists of the past has become a trap for the politicians of the present one reason american policymaking has become less stable , less effective , and less predictable in the words of the downgrade that standard poor s handed to the united states on friday night is the enduring influence of v o key s theory , and the seductive dream of realignment that it conjured up this dream has hovered over national leaders from richard nixon and ronald reagan to bill clinton and newt gingrich but it has loomed larger in the last decade , as our politics have grown more polarized and our country has suffered through a series of dislocations and disasters events like 9 11 and the great recession have persuaded partisans on both sides that a dramatic realignment is imminent the breadth of the ideological divide has convinced them that it s necessary thus the conservative hope that the war on terror would decisively tilt american politics to the right , and the liberal assumption that the 2008 financial crisis had unmade the reagan coalition forever thus karl rove s famous goal of a permanent \( or at least durable \) republican majority and rahm emanuel s promise that the obama white house would n't let a crisis go to waste thus the assumption , on the left and right alike , that every presidential election is the most important in our lifetime except for the next one , which will be more important still like most commentators , i 've indulged in these kinds of sentiments myself american politics really is riven by fundamental divisions our recent elections have had dramatic consequences it will make a tremendous difference whether the next enduring majority owes more to barack obama s liberalism , tea party conservatism , or some other worldview still but there s no guarantee that such a majority will be established in time to walk the country backward from the fiscal cliff and in the meantime , our leaders have a responsibility that transcends their ideological differences the responsibility to work with one another to keep the country solvent the dream of realignment has become the enemy of such compromises it inspires politicians to claim sweeping mandates from highly contingent victories think of dick cheney insisting on another round of deficitfinanced tax cuts in 2003 because we won the midterm elections and this is our due , or the nearidentical rebukes that president obama delivered to eric cantor \( elections have consequences and eric , i won \) and to john mccain \( the election s over \) during the debates over the stimulus and health care the losers , meanwhile , wax intransigent , while hoping for a realignment of their own after all , why cut a deal today if tomorrow you might overthrow your rivals permanently \? better to just say no flat out , as the bushera democrats did with social security reform and the republicans did with health care , and hope that the next election will deliver you the onceinageneration victory this is how some republicans are thinking today , as they crow about the and imagine all they can accomplish in a mitt romney administration or a paul ryan administration , for that matter many conservatives are eager to see their party s leading champion of entitlement reform enter the race , the better to make 2012 feel like a true hingeofhistory moment , a decisive choice between social democracy and freemarket capitalism in reality , the next election may be no more transformative than 2008 turned out to be the next republican president may find himself as hemmed in and frustrated as president obama has become meanwhile , america will still have a credit rating to fix , and a deficit to close none of this means that our parties need to give up their deep convictions , their grand plans , or their hopes of winning an enduring mandate but in the wake of the weekend s downgrade , we need them to govern as though that final victory might never quite arrive

chris capuano is officially an exmet although it became clear in recent weeks that the mets were not in the running to resign capuano , a veteran lefthander , he remained without a new team until friday , when he signed a twoyear , 10 million deal with the los angeles dodgers capuano said in a telephone interview friday afternoon that several teams had approached him with twoyear contact offers after the 2011 season ended the mets , meanwhile , were reluctant to offer more than one year , a reflection of the team s financial limitations capuano said the dodgers offer particularly appealed to him in part because it would allow him to be near his offseason home in scottsdale , ariz the list of positives is really too long , capuano said of the dodgers i don t think i could have picked a better landing spot capuano , 33 , joined the mets on an incentiveheavy , oneyear deal last winter , adding depth to their pitching staff with a minimal commitment for capuano , it was an opportunity to revitalize his career after elbow operations forced him to miss the 2008 and 2009 seasons capuano stayed healthy and finished with 168 strikeouts , a 455 earned run average and a respectable 1112 record for a team that wasn t all that good he was also reliable , making 31 starts my goal was to win a spot and make every start , and from that standpoint , as well as just learning to take care of my body and honing my routine to the point where i felt good day in , day out , the season was a big plus for me , capuano said he spoke highly of his time in new york and of the mets organization , reserving special praise for brad andress , the team s strength coach , who he said was instrumental in keeping him healthy capuano added , it was my favorite year in baseball and bar none the most fun i ve had in a big league uniform with capuano out of the picture , the mets starting staff appears in need of reinforcements , particularly as johan santana , who missed all of 2011 after shoulder surgery , attempts to return to the rotation for the start of next season for me , the mets year rests squarely on the left shoulder of johan santana , capuano said if he is the healthy , allstar johan we know , that will be huge
the fate of the bloomberg administration s plan to enable livery drivers to pick up street hails outside manhattan was unclear on monday , as versions of the bill were being weighed in assembly and senate committees in albany meanwhile , a crowd of drivers of yellow taxis gathered at city hall to denounce the plan the plan proposed in albany would create as many as 30 , 000 permits allowing livery drivers to pick up street hails in the boroughs outside manhattan and in parts of upper manhattan north of central park the permits would cost 1 , 500 mark hansen , a spokesman for the senate majority leader , dean g skelos , a long island republican , said legislative leaders were still in talks with the city and the industry it s still being discussed , mr hansen said so far , the plan has elicited criticism from yellow taxi medallion representatives as well as some livery car drivers it has also raised the ire of city council members who contend that the mayor improperly excluded the council from shaping the bill councilman lewis a fidler , a brooklyn democrat , said he did not believe that mayor michael r bloomberg , an independent , had the authority to have his proposal enacted without the approval of the council going to albany to make a midnight deal so that none of us get a say in it just is n't right , mr fidler told more than 100 drivers assembled on the steps of city hall we 'll stand with you here , we 'll stand with you in albany , and we 'll stand with you in court if we need to earlier in the day , some council members said they supported the idea because they thought it would make transportation easier for people in areas with less taxi traffic yellow cabs do n't cruise in upper manhattan , said councilman robert jackson , a manhattan democrat , as he stood outside city hall just before the taxi drivers arrived he added that the city s growing population made it logical to allow additional vehicles to pick up passengers on the street among the livery drivers who agreed was jose velez , from riverdale , in the bronx it s going to allow us to make a little more money , he said it s very difficult for us right now the taxi drivers who staged a rally minutes later vocally opposed the bill , chanting , we are yellow , and holding placards with messages like do n't kill my job we are taxpayers , and we have been giving the city the best cab service in the world for 75 years , said ethan gerber , the executive director of the greater new york taxi association , addressing them mayor mike and his cronies are taking your jobs and throwing them out fernando mateo , the president of the new york state federation of taxi drivers , also spoke , telling the crowd , the fact of the matter is the city s going to destroy two industries mr mateo said that he feared that if livery cars began picking up passengers on the streets , fewer of those cars would be available to respond to radio calls and pick up people who do not live near major thoroughfares for months , plans similar to the one proposed over the weekend had been delayed by negotiations with the taxi industry many drivers and medallion owners strongly oppose any measure that they think would allow livery drivers to expand into their territory many say the proposal would devalue their medallions , which sell for hundreds of thousands of dollarsamong those opposing the measure was john aston , 60 , of forest hills , queens , who said that he had been driving a taxi since 1969 and that he had his own medallion you have people who invested a lot of money in these medallions , he said it s like a piece of real estate christine haughney contributed reporting this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
damascus , syria as protests broke out across a restive syria on a recent sunday , and crowds were dispersed yet again by gunfire that left many dead , the conversation in the capital dwelled not on the uprising but rather on nails , along with the choice of polish and hair color and the latest in makeup trends i want either fuchsia or orange to match my dress , a woman in her 50s said as she rummaged through a box of nail polish in an upscale beauty salon in damascus either one it does not take long to realize that there is a disconnect between damascus and the rest of syria with a mix of denial and fear , and occasionally even satisfaction at the government s determination to stanch dissent , many damascenes insist on another reality sometimes jarring , sometimes reassuring , the detachment appears to have only deepened as the country plunges into some of its starkest international isolation since the assad family took power in 1970 and as cities fall victim , one by one , to a ferocious crackdown by a government seemingly without direction syria s uprising has entered its sixth month , and protesters continue to defy the heavyhanded security forces that have , by the united nations' count , killed more than 2 , 200 people since midmarch sanctions have mounted , and oncefriendly nations have criticized president , urging him to reform and declaring that they have lost patience with his government s attacks on its own people others have called on him to step down but damascus , be it at the beauty salon , in its somnolent neighborhoods or in its fearstricken mosques , remains the linchpin , a reality that even activists acknowledge until protests reach this capital , their thinking goes , syria s leadership will avoid the fate of its ossified equivalents in places like egypt and tunisia and so far , damascus along with aleppo , the nation s secondlargest city has stayed firmly on the margins , as anger builds toward both cities from syrians bearing the brunt of the uprising trust me , everything is normal , insisted a manicurist at the salon the salon , whose clientele includes the wives of the rich and famous , as one hairdresser described them , is just one of many examples that indicate how well damascus has managed to shield itself during months of violence across the country at the beginning , there were some guys demonstrating for freedoms and rights , but it later turned out they were only trying to create a sectarian war , the manicurist said the security forces are hunting them down , one by one and they are almost done with them her version of events is one that is repeated daily by syrian state news media and television channels close to the government that the country is facing a foreign conspiracy to divide it and that security forces are battling armed islamist extremists who are terrorizing residents and have killed 500 police officers and soldiers so far even in neighborhoods where activists and protesters have reported demonstrations , life quickly returns to normal , as the government tries to rewrite what just happened , residents say as early as dawn , they say , city employees clear the scenes , cleaning up bloodstains on the ground and painting over antigovernment graffiti so it went in kfar susseh , a wealthy neighborhood in damascus where security forces wounded several protesters last week according to residents , peaceful worshipers emerging from the rifai mosque came under fire as they chanted a slogan calling for the fall of the government , a slogan uttered from tunisia to bahrain they were chased through the neighborhood , caught and severely beaten as residents standing on their balconies pleaded with security forces to show them mercy the protesters were later taken in military buses to detention centers during a visit two days after the unrest , the neighborhood was buzzing save for a sign declaring that the mosque was closed , there was no evidence of trouble unlike homs and hama , where the uprising has managed to knock down the wall of fear and allowed people to say what they want to say , no one here seemed to broach politics in the streets pedestrians walked by , rarely glancing at the mosque , as if a long look would draw the kind of attention so long feared in a country notorious for its security apparatus a woman leaned against the mosque s iron fence across the street from her a sign read , i am with syria it , too , seemed too sensitive to stare at the poster was one of many on the streets here that are part of a campaign aimed at raising loyalty to the government not far away , another sign warned , be aware of those who are trying to instigate strife and attack them at the salon , curiosity is subversive the entrance of any new customer jolts the conversation back to orthodoxy the choice of nail polish returns as a topic but in lessguarded moments , even here in a bastion of unreality , the reverberations of the uprising are felt terms once taboo in public in syria come up in casual backandforth opposition , sectarianism , demonstrations and the very word uprising behind closed doors , the idea that nothing is different gives way to fears that something has changed one manicurist said she was shocked when she accidentally learned that one of her closest friends opposed president assad , who inherited power from his father in 2000 the manicurist and her friend are christians , and , like other minority groups , they fear that a change of leadership would usher in a more conservative administration , perhaps delivering the country to islamists bent on enforcing a tyranny of the sunni muslim majority christians often point to iraq where their very existence as a community is imperiled to offer a notion of what can happen in times of violence and chaos as the rest of the country has become more conservative , damascus , with its veneer of modernity and consumerism of the past decade , has become less so , they said ten years , 20 years ago , we never dared walk on streets wearing sleeveless shirts without being harassed , the manicurist said now , no one dares look at us though she declared herself to be one of mr assad s biggest fans , she acknowledged that reform has come too slowly and corruption has become too common her complaint was directed at no one in particular , least of all mr assad , whose intentions she refused to question across from her , a bridetobe in her mid20s said that she had not turned on the television for days she did not want to stress herself out with the news of the uprising , she said , as activists here and elsewhere tried to spread the unrest to damascus on the day before her wedding , several relatives called to ask about the situation in her neighborhood everything was quiet , she kept repeating to them curious , she finally relented and turned on the news to find out that arabiclanguage satellite channels were reporting demonstrations in her street there were none , she insisted everything is normal , just do n't watch al jazeera and al arabiya , one of the manicurists said they are spreading lies watch only syrian channels to learn the truth and off she went to discuss nail polish
at midnight on thursday , the nba locked out its players in what could be the start of a long labor dispute some observers , like espn s michael wilbon , believe the entire 201112 season could be threatened  such a move would not be without precedent the nhl canceled its 20045 season but the nba s current financial condition is different than the nhl s in one important respect whereas there was almost no doubt that the nhl was in fact losing money in advance of its lockout player salaries had mushroomed by more than 400 percent from 1994 to 2004 , according to independent estimates the nba s claims of financial hardship should be viewed more skeptically instead , independent estimates of the nba financial condition reflect a league that has grown at a somewhat tepid rate compared to other sports , and which has an uneven distribution of revenues between teams but which is fundamentally a healthy and profitable business in addition , it is not clear that growth in player salaries , which has been modest compared to other sports and which is strictly pegged to league revenue , is responsible for the league s difficulties the table below reflects the nba s financial condition from its 198990 through 200910 seasons , as according to estimates prepared by forbes and financial world magazines \( all figures are adjusted for inflation some data was not published by forbes in some years and is therefore left blank \) the first column is league s gate receipts or ticket revenues the forbes data suggest this is one area of legitimate concern adjusted for inflation , ticket revenues are down 6 percent compared to five years ago , although they are up 22 percent compared to the 19992000 season other revenues , like licensing and media rights , have increased at a healthier clip , because the nba is locked into long and lucrative television contracts they have grown by 11 percent over five years , adjusted for inflation , or by 30 percent over 10 years the league s primary expense is player salaries they have followed a nearly identical trajectory to league revenues , having grown at a 24 percent rate over 10 years , but with growth having flattened out since the recession this is not a coincidence under the league s current collective bargaining agreement , player salaries are strictly tied to league revenues in fact , because of a littleknown provision in the labor agreement , players must return a portion of their salaries if they exceed 57 percent of league revenues , as has happened in several recent seasons as i will discuss at more length later , the portion of revenues earned by nba players is similar to that of the other major sports leagues and has been stable over the past decade growth in nonplayer expenses has outpaced that of salaries , having increased by 13 percent over five years and 43 percent over 10 years although some of this undoubtedly reflects sound business ventures , like the league s investments in digital media or efforts to expand the game internationally , they have nevertheless had a reasonably large effect on the league s bottom line had nonplayer expenses been the same in 200910 as they were in 19992000 \( adjusted for inflation \) , the league would have made a record profit that year even as it stands , however , the forbes data suggests that the league is still profitable its operating income revenues less expenses \( but before interest payments and taxes \) is estimated to have been 183 million in 200910 , or about 6 million per team the nba s operating margin \( operating income divided by revenues \) was about 5 percent in 200910 and has been about 7 percent during the life of the current labor deal a 5 percent or 7 percent profit is not dissimilar to what other businesses have experienced recently fortune 500 companies , for instance , collectively turned a 40 percent profit in 2009 and a 66 percent profit in 2010 \( both figures after taxes \) profit margins in the entertainment industry , in which the nba should probably be classified , have generally been a bit lower than that so why are nba owners seeking such significant reductions in player salaries , reportedly to about 45 percent of league revenues \? the simple reason is that they think they can and this reflects an awful lot of money if salaries were reduced to 45 percent of revenues , this would save the owners roughly 500 million per year , or about 3 billion over the course of a sixyear labor contract it is hard to estimate either the near or the longterm cost of cancelling a season , but the potential gain from a more favorable contract is large enough that it is something the owners might be willing to risk what the owners may be thinking about is their position compared to that of the other sports leagues baseball and football are cash cows , with the nfl having brought in more than a billion in profits \( before taxes \) in 2009 , and major league baseball about 500 million in its most recent season by contrast , the nba s position is more comparable to that of the nhl several nba owners also own nhl teams , and they may be looking to that league s lockout as having been successful , because it recovered from 228 million in operating losses in the three seasons preceding its lockout \( according to the forbes data \) to a state of profitability comparable to the nba s it is not clear , however , how much player salaries are to blame for the nba s having failed to achieve an nfllike level of profit between 2000 and 2009 , player salaries in the nfl represented an average of 56 percent of league revenues , and that total averaged 58 percent in major league baseball both close to the 57 percent target enshrined under the nba s current deal by contrast , when the nhl locked out its players and was losing money , player salaries made up 66 of league revenue \( they have since fallen to about 54 percent \) the other factor is the distribution of revenue from team to team 17 of the 30 nba teams lost money in 200910 , according to the forbes data most of the losses were small , and the league was still profitable as a whole because of profits made by successful franchises like the new york knicks , chicago bulls and los angeles lakers , who together netted about 150 million by themselves but there are a sizable number of owners who have reason to be unhappy in some ways , the nba s present condition closely resembles that of major league baseball before its 199495 strike baseball was still profitable as a whole in advance of the strike , but about onethird of its teams had lost money in 1993 , according to forbes , while just four teams accounted for almost half of all league profits the solution that baseball has since adopted greater revenue sharing in lieu of a salary cap could also be a natural one for the nba the profits made by the knicks , bulls and lakers alone would be enough to cover the losses of all 17 unprofitable teams \( players might have some reason to object to revenue sharing some versions of it are the economic equivalent of a tax on player salaries but they would probably prefer it to the more draconian measures that the league will try to impose \) another way in which the nba resembles baseball , unfortunately , is by having circulated financial data that doesn t necessarily hold up to scrutiny in 2001 , major league baseball issued figures suggesting that it had incurred losses of 232 million before interest and taxes forbes s independent estimates instead suggested that the league had made a profit of 127 million but that year s labor dispute , and the next in 2006 , were resolved amiably and with few changes to baseball s economic structure , and years of profits have followed since a similar discrepancy exists today between forbes s estimates a 183 million profit for the nba in 200910 , and those issued by the league , which claim a 340 million loss the difference between the two numbers is roughly of the same size on an annual basis as the salary concessions the nba is seeking there are several reasons to be skeptical of the nba s figures first , many of the purported losses perhaps about 250 million result from an unusual accounting treatment related to depreciation and amortization when a team is sold while the accounting treatment is legal , these paper losses would have no impact on a team s cash flow another potential \( and usually withinthelaw \) trick moving income from the basketball team s balance sheet to that of a related business like a cable network , or losses in the opposite direction second , the leaked financial statements for one team , the new orleans hornets , closely matched the forbes data and the sale prices for some teams have exceeded their figures the golden state warriors were purchased for 450 million in 2010 more than the 363 million that forbes estimates they are worth the detroit pistons were recently sold for a price reported to be about 420 million , more than forbes s estimated value of 360 million the washington wizards were bought for 551 million last year , a 70 percent premium over forbes s estimated price of 322 million comparing actual to theoretical sale prices is not always safe because other assets are sometimes packaged with the teams , but the market for nba franchises is clearly quite healthy and inconsistent with what the league claims to be a failing business model the third reason for skepticism the nba s data has not been made public , although it has been shared with the players union if the league expects their figures to be viewed credibly , they should open up their books to journalists , economists and fans fourth , the current labor deal which was signed in 1999 and renewed with relatively few changes in 2005 was initially considered favorable to the league although revenue growth may have been more tepid than the league might like , especially in the past few recessionary years , player salaries are tied to revenues and have grown at no faster a rate the claims made by sports owners on the occasion of a labor dispute smart and successful capitalists who suddenly become enamored of restrictions on the free market and their own wherewithal to make decisions often stretch credulity but to hear the nba owners complain about the current deal now , when none of the fundamentals have changed , reminds one of the old woody allen joke about two women kvetching at a restaurant boy , the food at this place is really terrible , one says i know and such small portions , the other replies put another way , there is no reason to assume that the nba s actual financial condition falls somewhere in between the two figures it may be just as likely that forbes is underestimating rather overestimating the league s profits for instance , the times reports the league s revenues \( not profits \) to have been 43 billion in 201011 , more than the 38 billion estimated by forbes for 200910 \( one reason that the forbes estimates could be too low it has become more difficult to measure ticket revenue since teams are now designating some of their most expensive tickets as premium seating , and these seats are not reflected in publiclyavailable estimates of ticket prices \) none of this means that the nba is without problems for instance , the sluggish growth in ticket revenues may suggest that the league s fans , who are younger than those for other sports and more likely to be africanamerican , are being priced out of the stadium experience in addition , the fact that a significant number of teams are failing to turn a profit , even by the forbes estimates , reflects a potential lack of competitive balance in the league since 1990 , a total of eight distinct nba teams have won a championship , compared to 13 teams in each of the other major sports leagues although some of this has to do with factors intrinsic to the structure of basketball , the current salary cap rules may worsen matters by limiting player movement , making it difficult for teams to rebuild fans in many cities have little realistic hope of seeing a championship any time soon nor does this mean that we aren t in for a long lockout rather , the fact that the nba has released financial data that is so at odds with estimates provided by credible and unbiased organizations like forbes suggests that the league s owners are armed to win the public relations battle a key part of what could be a yearlong war of words with their players an earlier version misstated the loss claimed by the nba as 370 million
today s lesson , gleaned from baseball history , is that if you are going to be bad at something , be spectacularly bad and if you are spectacularly bad enough , people might be talking about you 100 years after you retire this lesson comes courtesy of bill bergen , a catcher for the brooklyn superbas in the early 1900s the record books will tell you that bergen is the worst hitter in major league baseball history , holding records for the lowest season batting average for a regular position player \( 139 , a mark making news as adam dunn of the threatens it \) and lowest career batting average \( 170 \) , as well as the longest streak of atbats without a hit \( 46 , a mark making news because milwaukee s craig counsell is threatening it at 0 for 45 \) bergen s , from 190111 , although he could n't hit the side of a barn he did not have one slump year surrounded by many productive ones \( like dunn \) or one epic bad streak \( like counsell \) he was consistently and dependably , well , subpar in 3 , 028 career atbats , he hit two home runs in only one season did his average top 200 his career 194 onbase percentage means he did n't walk much his career 201 slugging percentage means he rarely hit for extra bases perhaps his quirkiest statistic he was never hit by a pitch he is about as bad a hitter as you can possibly imagine , said david jones , a baseball historian who edited two books on baseball s deadball era but if he 'd been a little bit better hitter , no one would ever talk about him instead , his name crops up whenever a baseline of offensive futility is needed he does not have a line named after him like mario mendoza , whose paltry batting average made him synonymous with hitting 200 but bergen is firmly installed in the history of futility bergen s secret was playing at a time that dreaded deadball era when good defensive catchers were worth their weight in teddy roosevelt autographs bergen was a great defensive catcher by some statistical measures , in national league history it was an era when catchers were even more important than they are today because bunting and stealing bases were the main way teams would score runs , said tom simon , who along with jones edited the books on the stars of the deadball era so teams would carry a guy hitting 139 if he could keep the other team from scoring bergen caught a relatively modest 941 games but ranks in the top 20 in career assists by a catcher with 1 , 444 he threw out 473 percent of runners attempting to steal he once threw out six in one game , against st louis in 1909 an article in the sporting news in 1908 described bergen he is one of the few backstops who can throw on a line to second while standing flatfooted and he gets a ball away from him so quickly and with so little apparent exertion that the runner on first , second or third does not dare to take liberties when billie is on the job an article in the bridgeport evening post in 1904 read his long suit is his wonderful throwing while playing in the interstate league with fort wayne , ind , bergen saved the game for his team one day when the bases were full and no one out by catching three men napping , one after the other , allowing his team to win bergen began his career on a rather ignominious note with the cincinnati reds in 1901 a year earlier , his older brother marty , a talented catcher for the boston beaneaters from 189699 , had with an ax and killed himself with a razor blade marty bergen was considered far more talented than bill , but his mental instability had been apparent his entire career he often walked out on his team , berated his teammates and described paranoid visions of plots to kill him we do n't know enough about bill bergen s life to know how he dealt with that , jones said but it must have been something bill bergen , by all accounts , had none of his brother s demons and was a pleasant teammate his ignominy was strictly of the baseball variety he entered the league just as the american league became a major league , so teams were scrambling for players to fill rosters offensive numbers were down across the board all of that worked to bergen s advantage after he played three seasons with the reds , bergen s contract was sold to brooklyn , one of the national league s truly dreadful teams team nicknames back then were coined by sportswriters , who dubbed the team the superbas because manager ned hanlon shared a moniker with , the hanlon superba \( they did n't officially become the dodgers until 1932 \) despite the highflying name , the team never finished above fifth in the league during bergen s career perhaps that led to even decreased expectations for bergen , who , as , was the only catcher in history whose value came 100 percent on defense in that era , catcher was not considered an offensive position at all the job was grueling , with little in the way of today s protective equipment according to jones , catchers did not wear shin guards , and their mitts were small , requiring two hands to catch most pitches they were injured often and installed deep in a team s batting order but they were called on to field a lot of bunts and to prevent stolen bases with bill bergen , you had someone who could shut down the other team s running game , jones said he had a cannon for an arm the way to think of him was as a second pitcher simon wonders whether bergen was ever put ninth in the batting order , because pitchers were probably better hitters than him joe dittmar , who was vice chairman of the records committee for the society for american baseball research for 18 years , researched bergen s career in the 1990s and wrote during that research , he stumbled on bergen s 46atbat hitless streak until then , luis aparicio and tony bernazard were considered to have the record at 44 dittmar thoroughly scoured the deadball era records and determined that bergen s was the longest that streak came to an end in 1909 during the second game of a doubleheader against the cubs , when bergen beat out an infield hit ahead of a throw by johnny evers of tinkertoeverstochance fame bergen s career ended in 1911 when brooklyn found its young catcher of the future in otto miller bergen was released he died in 1943 of heart disease at age 65 , according to his death certificate but bergen s career was just bad enough that , in a way , he lives forever
washington plenty of lawmakers are against tax breaks and socalled loopholes unless , of course , they personally helped create them the senate republican leader , mitch mcconnell , for instance , says he is open to ending tax breaks for special interests but when it comes to a tax break he secured in 2008 for the owners of thoroughbred racehorses , he argues that the measure is essential for the protection of jobs in his home state of kentucky senator john kerry , democrat of massachusetts , says he too wants to eliminate such breaks , except when it comes to beer he is one of the main supporters of a proposal that would cut taxes for small beer makers like the samuel adams brewery in boston and representative paul d ryan , the wisconsin republican who leads the house budget committee , has privately assured one beer industry group that he would support a second proposed tax break for brewers , even as he has distanced himself publicly from the measure , the beer group s chief operating officer said in an interview the disconnect between the lawmakers' words and deeds reflects the political hurdles that congress and the white house face as they look to cut at least 12 trillion from the  talk of cutting tax breaks to raise money and reduce the debt has become a mantra in washington , but it threatens sacred ground such breaks are a favorite tool among both republicans and democrats to reward supporters and economic interests in their home states the 71 , 000page tax code has become loaded with dozens of obscure but economically valuable tax breaks nascar racetrack operators can speed up their writeoffs for improvements to their facilities makers of toy wooden arrows pay no excise tax and eskimo whaling captains get a charitable deduction of up to 10 , 000 for hunting blubber multibilliondollar operations like oil refineries , hollywood productions and hedge funds have all profited and there is little sign that the lawmakers who helped write the breaks into the tax code are willing to back away from them whether any of them are scrubbed from the books may ultimately prove how serious congress is about reducing the debt , and how adept powerful lobbies are at guarding their benefits , political analysts and tax experts say these special interests are getting carveouts from congress , and both sides republicans and democrats are guilty of picking their favorite interests to support , said r , an economist who studies tax policy at george mason university tax breaks for industries both large and small add up to an estimated 123 billion a year money that opponents see as lost revenue in austere times one of the few members of congress willing to talk about specific breaks that could be abolished is senator tom coburn , republican of oklahoma he released a in june that included a section on what he considered to be dozens of needless tax breaks that were little more than corporate welfare , like vacation home deductions and special deals for the makers of fishing tackle boxes he also ridiculed a bevy of loose guidelines that have allowed business deductions for cat food , toupees and breast implants for exotic dancers in contrast , president obama has focused on a handful of tax breaks that are considered symbolically powerful , including credits for oil production and an accelerated depreciation for corporate jets do we keep tax loopholes for oil companies , or do we put teachers back to work \? mr obama asked in a speech in the white house rose garden in september but members of mr obama s own party have backed many of the breaks senator charles e schumer of new york was a leading proponent of the nascar benefit , which helped a track in upstate new york senator ron wyden of oregon helped push through the break for toy wooden arrow makers , which also benefited a manufacturer back home and mr kerry , who serves on the special congressional committee that is trying to reduce the debt , has been a main driver behind the beer bill republicans , who have taken a hard line against raising taxes , say that eliminating a tax break is the same as a tax increase , and they do not want to risk putting people out of work or slowing economic growth by ending benefits that they believe are helping certain industries get by this month , house speaker john a boehner of ohio said that tax reform should include closing loopholes not for purposes of bringing more money to the government , but because it s the right thing to do but he did not offer any specifics , and he stressed that answers to the nation s debt problems lie in cutting spending , not raising tax revenues tax increases destroy jobs , he said still , in the face of political pressure , mr boehner and other republican leaders have tempered their support , at least publicly , for some tax breaks that they once supported mr boehner , along with fellow house leaders like representative eric cantor of virginia , representative kevin mccarthy of california and mr ryan , who is the party s leading crusader for spending cuts , were cosponsors of a 2009 version of the beer tax break bill , which has never passed known as the , or beer act , it would halve the excise taxes on the first 60 , 000 barrels of beer for small brewers steve hindy , owner of , said his company stood to save about 400 , 000 a year if the tax break was approved the tax break would boost our financial situation and allow us to further expand our business , he said we would be able to create more jobs but the bill has stalled , and none of the four republican leaders are now sponsoring it but bob pease , chief operating officer of the beer industry group , the , in boulder , colo , said that mr ryan s staff had assured the organization in a private meeting that he would continue to support the bill mr ryan s spokesman , kevin seifert , said that the congressman had no plans to sponsor the beer tax break , but he did not address the brewers association s assertion about mr ryan s private support mr ryan supports letting individuals and entrepreneurs keep more of their hardearned money , mr seifert said the maneuvering over the beer tax highlights the difficulties for lawmakers who have supported tax breaks while also calling for their end this summer , senator mcconnell objected to discussing tax breaks unless it was as part of a debate to overhaul of the tax code at the same time , he continues to defend the 2008 break he wrangled for the owners of thoroughbred racehorses that measure allows the owners to accelerate the depreciation of their horses something mr mcconnell says he considers vital to an industry that employs about 50 , 000 people in kentucky and contributes billions to the state s economy mr mcconnell s spokesman , don stewart , said the senator continued to support the benefit as a matter of fairness , saying that it brings horses in line with all other depreciation rather than creating a new loophole horse owners also benefited from another a tax provision that had the support of mr mcconnell the national thoroughbred racing association that the 2010 break would allow them to write off not only the cost of newly purchased horses , but other farm equipment used to raise them clearly , joe bacigalupo , an executive with the horseracing group said in the video , 2011 is a great year to invest

moving beyond the binary and false options of abner doubleday and alexander cartwright jr as the father of baseball , three better candidates emerge , william rufus wheaton and louis fenn wadsworth cartwright s plaque in the baseball hall of fame declares he set the bases 90 feet apart and established nine innings as a game and nine players as a team he did none of these things , and every other word of substance on his plaque is false adams , known as doc , set the base paths at 90 feet , among other notable innovations , including creating the position of shortstop eight years after cartwright left new york in the california gold rush of 1849 wheaton created the by copying a set he had drawn up for an earlier ball club , the gothams , in 1837 as to nine men and nine innings and perhaps even more these may be credited to wadsworth a first baseman for the gothams and the knickerbockers from about 1850 to 1862 , the mysterious wadsworth may provide the most compelling story of all no one credited him as an innovator until 1907 , when the mills commission neared the end of its threeyear mandate to determine the origins of baseball on dec 30 , abraham g mills hurriedly dictated his conclusions to his stenographer and anointed doubleday , as per the wishes of albert g spalding , whose brainstorm the commission had been yet mills took care in his final report to note a statement made by mr curry , of the pioneer knickerbocker club that a diagram , showing the ball field laid out substantially as it is today , was brought to the field one day by a mr wadsworth despite having officially crowned doubleday , mills followed with queries about the identity and whereabouts of wadsworth for nearly three months , fruitlessly on march 20 , 1908 , the commission s conclusions were published in spalding s official base ball guide no more was heard about wadsworth until 1973 , when harold peterson wrote a biography of alexander cartwright called the man who invented baseball in it , he observed , mr wadsworth , whose christian name , occupation , residence and pedigree remained secreted in mills s bosom , was never heard of again mills and peterson believed that if wadsworth presented a diagram , it must have been in 1845 herein lay a crucial misunderstanding wadsworth was a gotham until april 1 , 1854 , when he inexplicably switched allegiances \( perhaps in exchange for considerations that would have made him the game s first professional \) did he bring a diagram to the knick field in 185455 , when the baselines were not yet established at 90 feet and the pitcher s distance was unspecified \? maybe yes , maybe no but he certainly gave us a game of nine innings and nine men , at a critical time when sentiment leaned to seven before the first convention of new york area ball clubs on feb 25 , 1857 , a knickerbockerdominated rules committee adopted section 26 , making the game seven innings and setting the minimum number of players to a side at seven in the convention , however , on wadsworth s rebel motion , the assembled delegates changed the recommendation to nine bu his victory spelled the end of his tenure with the knickerbockers wadsworth failed to appear for a game on june 8 , 1857 , though he had been named to play six days later , he resigned by the next month , he was again manning first base with his accustomed panache , but for the gothams wadsworth left a trail that historians and genealogical experts had been unable to pick up wadsworth family histories offered no clue but by 2004 , the search tools of the internet and some proprietary databases opened a new world and , little by little , his story began to unfold wadsworth was born in connecticut in 1825 and graduated from washington college in hartford \( now \) in 1844 then he went to michigan , where his welltodo parents had bought land , and he began a legal career in manhattan in 1848 a tempestuous character who made enemies easily , wadsworth was little recalled in new york once his playing days were done he later became a judge in new jersey was widowed began to act erratically in his official duties , owing to drink and lost an estimated 300 , 000 \( perhaps 8 million when adjusted for inflation \) wadsworth was reduced to selling newspapers on the streets until 1898 , when he committed himself to plainfield s poorhouse for the next 10 years , no one connected him with baseball wadsworth died on march 28 , 1908 , eight days after publication of the spalding guide containing mills s decision an obituary in the hartford daily times said , a veritable bookworm , day after day , he would sit reading in the summer , it continued , he was particularly interested in following the scores of the ballgames of the big leagues , and of late years , the game was the one great object of interest to him
every year foreign orchestras with exotic or impressivesounding names crisscross the country they follow grueling routes and play in arts centers , small theaters and school auditoriums in places like pembroke , nc , and modesto , calif but they are not always what they seem the that played two years ago in nearly 50 towns \? mostly bulgarians the moscow state radio symphony orchestra that toured the united states last year \? largely freelancers the tschaikowski st petersburg state orchestra , which is scheduled for a major american tour next year \? even the man advertised as its principal guest conductor said he had never heard of it a close look at these groups shows a pattern of creative marketing even truth shading concerning credentials and identities at the least , audiences often do not know what they are getting , even though visa regulations require the groups to be recognized internationally as outstanding and to have had threequarters of the same players for at least a year many of these groups are in fact pickup ensembles or have little reputation , even in their home countries a major force in bringing in these orchestras is columbia artists management inc , one of the oldest and most prestigious classical music agencies its clients have included vladimir horowitz , jascha heifetz and herbert von karajan the columbia artists executive behind many such tours is a senior vice president , andrew s grossman , who acts as the tour producer mr grossman , 62 , is an influential figure in the classical music business , as well as a lightning rod for strong emotions former colleagues , competitors and contractors call him a shrewd businessman , both brilliant and capable of great charm , who can ride his employees hard these people also pointed to what appears to be a pattern of misleading publicity photos , altered program biographies and lastminute substitutions mr grossman did not respond to requests for comment in a telephone interview , ronald a wilford , columbia s chairman , denied that misrepresentations had occurred , saying that the agency relied on the orchestras it brings in for information about their musicians he defended mr grossman , calling him a tough man in a hard business he knows how to do it better than everyone , mr wilford said we have n't been dishonest that i'm aware of , he said orchestras typically have shifting personnel in a world of musicians who easily cross borders , he added it s a little bit of a na ve position to take that there could n't be international players in an orchestra , he said all of this is quite silly we bring institutions that are fully formed but more important , the agency argued , the orchestras provide live classical music at affordable cost to small cities and towns spurned by the major orchestras we go to these communities that very much want this and are also struggling with the economic realities , said tim fox , the president of columbia artists management it should be a celebration the local concert presenters like the cachet of foreign names and the small price tags , which are on average less than half of the fees of major international orchestras , like the vienna philharmonic or the london symphony those fees can top 100 , 000 a concert and it is true that an orchestra s makeup is not necessarily a comment on quality the dubliners received good reviews from critics and presenters two years ago , although the moscow orchestra , as heard last year at a performance in the bronx , would have had trouble matching up to a midlevel conservatory orchestra eric amada , a former columbia employee who now runs arts management associates , a booking agency and sometime rival , said , most of these presenters are completely fooled , and so , by extension , are their audiences it s just like , teflon andrew' while smaller , lesserknown foreign orchestras can make important contributions to local cultural life , they also bring surprises for jane schumacher , the surprise came on jan 23 , 2009 , when the dublin philharmonic played a concert at the etherredge center for the performing arts , where she is executive director , at the university of south carolina , aiken going backstage before the concert to meet the musicians , she said , she heard them speaking several languages none had an irish lilt i remember going back there , joking , and saying , is there actually anybody from ireland \? , ' she said i got stares , because they did n't know what i was saying only two of the orchestra members came from ireland , orchestra officials later acknowledged the rest were mainly from bulgaria and a smattering of other countries ms schumacher said she was troubled by the unexpected roster you know you 're taking a chance on misrepresenting to an audience , ms schumacher said this town is small but very educated , very cosmopolitan the tour received endorsements from the president of ireland , mary mcaleese , and from american and irish ambassadors the orchestra brought three classical programs and an irish spectacular of traditional music to gain visas , columbia artists had to give its application first to the for approval with the ok in hand , it submitted the paperwork to the united states citizenship and immigration services , which says it relies on such union signoffs regarding an orchestra s bona fides in approving performance visas in practice , the union said , its objections have little force the state department has the final say in issuing visas columbia s supporting evidence to the federation included a roster of 75 musicians , nearly all said to be irish citizens , except for three bulgarians and four people from britain it also listed their length of service , to fulfill the oneyear minimum for 75 percent of the members but a very different group was approved for visas , according to a list issued by the immigration service most of those musicians were bulgarians , and only 19 people out of 75 came from the original orchestra roster given to the union in the end , after lastminute substitutions , only two irish people ended up touring as members of the dublin philharmonic , according to orchestra officials the contractor for the tour , gavin o sullivan , a 20year veteran of the irish music scene , said he had never heard of most of the irish names on the orchestra list given to the musicians' union and had no idea where it came from mr wilford , the chairman of columbia , said that whatever list the agency had submitted came from the dublin philharmonic we do n't make it up , he added besides , he said we do n't say in our contract , you 've got to have predominantly irish players' we do n't get into this nationality stuff mr fox , the agency s president , said that the roster sent to the musicians' union was the same one approved by immigration officials what they sent to us was false information , said george fiddler , a federation contract administrator this is done to mislead the immigration service said it could not comment on an individual case we are always concerned about ways that people could potentially take advantage of the system , said a spokesman , christopher bentley applicants are legally bound to be truthful in the information they present , he said the player makeup of the dublin philharmonic which was first disclosed by the irish times ultimately does not matter , said derek gleeson , the orchestra s music director , who lives in culver city , calif , and has worked often in bulgaria he pointed out that his tour had featured all irish soloists , composers and conductors the difficult economy in 2008 made it too expensive to hire irish musicians , he said , so he turned to the bulgarians a tour of china last summer was nearly all irish , he said \( yet only five of the same names appeared on the roster given to the federation for the 2009 united states tour \) he acknowledged that despite the dublin philharmonic s name , it has played only a halfdozen or so concerts in ireland since its founding in 1997 the orchestra is the organization who hires the musicians , mr gleeson said musicians come and go industry figures critical of the onenightstand tours say that columbia artists management reaps big profits a contract to bring the opole , philharmonic of poland , a lowertier polish orchestra , this winter listed an average fee from presenters of 41 , 543 per concert paid to columbia artists , or 19 million in total for 46 concerts columbia artists was listed as paying the 90 musicians including the more highly paid conductors and soloists and other personnel a total of 8 , 500 per concert , or a total of about 390 , 000 for the tour the orchestra paid its own air fare out of the remaining 15 million paid to columbia , the agency covered domestic travel , lodging and promotion , taking in the rest the contract , a copy of which was provided by the american federation of musicians , allowed the orchestra to play up to 15 performances on consecutive days and travel 350 miles by bus on the day of a performance the audiences are being deceived , said ray hair , the musician federation president they believe they 're buying a ticket to some ensemble that has a legitimate pedigree but the ensemble does not have that it s a pickup orchestra of unemployed east european musicians that is willing to work for substandard wages mr wilford called the tours a marginal business with high risk and rejected the idea that the musicians were being exploited indeed , in interviews some have said they were happy for the work and the chance to see the united states the pay scale is what allows the tours to happen , mr wilford said the af of m , they are for higher prices , higher fees and less work , he added , referring to the federation he declined to release financial figures presenters have also complained about what they called misleading claims about several dance companies mr grossman has brought in , a charge the agency disputed the complaints extend at least as far back as 1996 , when bolshoi theater officials charged in a federal lawsuit that a group sponsored by columbia artists , the stars of the bolshoi ballet , had no bolshoi dancers a judge ruled against the bolshoi , and the agency says the case ended with no judgment against it some presenters praise mr grossman for providing good performances dependably i'm very satisfied with what they represent , said thomas g reynolds , director of arts programming at george mason university in fairfax , va mr reynolds has booked the tschaikowski st petersburg state orchestra on its tour next year and said he would be unhappy to learn that the agency s materials were misleading yet that is what at least three russian conductors have charged , including yuri temirkanov , one of russia s most respected maestros and the music director of the st petersburg philharmonic , an orchestra with a venerable history mr temirkanov said that photographs and video of the tschaikowski orchestra on the columbia artists' web site showed other orchestras , including his own in fact , he said , there is no tschaikowski orchestra a spokesman for st petersburg s city culture committee said , such a collective does not exist one photograph was dropped after calls were made to mr grossman s office about mr temirkanov s complaint \( mr wilford denied that the photograph was inaccurate , saying he had dropped it to avoid further upset \) the page also listed alexandre pirojenko , who has a budding international career , as piano soloist for the tour , and stanislav kochanovsky , who leads the orchestra of kislovodsk , in the caucasus , as principal guest conductor mr pirojenko confirmed that he planned to tour the united states with roman leontiev , who is described as the music director of the tschaikowski orchestra , but said he did not remember the ensemble s name mr kochanovsky said he received a call about touring the united states from yelena kostychenko , a st petersburg music impresario he assumed it would be with his regular ensemble he sent in his biography , but nothing came of the invitation then he found his name and biography altered to say that he had conducted the orchestra he had never heard of on columbia s web site \( they were later dropped \) in addition , he pointed out that a photograph purporting to show the tschaikowski orchestra was of his kislovodsk group , with its image , taken from a publicity picture , imposed on the background of a more opulentlooking hall mr leontiev identified his orchestra manager as ms kostychenko they have both asserted that the orchestra exists and referred questions about publicity materials to the agency members of the moscow radio symphony that toured last year said most were students or freelancers hired for the occasion , a claim orchestra officials denied
milwaukee to certain members of the st louis cardinals , the exuberant milwaukee brewers and their enigmatic center fielder , nyjer morgan , embody all that is wrong with the newest generation of baseball players too much lookatme showmanship , and not enough decorum and some of the brewers dislike the cardinals just because they are the cardinals , a storied franchise managed by a legendary competitor who wears sunglasses at night according to milwaukee pitcher zack greinke , one particular cardinal annoys them all ace chris carpenter , who jawed with morgan in august and september i think no one really likes carpenter , greinke said but besides that , i think they respect mostly everyone on their team the emotions bubbled up between these national league central division rivals in the regular season resurfaced again saturday , the day before the teams open the nl championship series at miller park the teams split 18 regular season games , and almost every series featured drama from pitchers plunking albert pujols and ryan braun to morgan throwing chewing tobacco at carpenter , these teams have a knack of irritating each other i think within a division , it s kind of common , cardinals manager tony la russa said they play hard we play hard we re both interested in the outcome , and sometimes sparks fly grienke , who faces jaime garcia in game 1 , offered the latest jab by criticizing carpenter , whose game 5 shutout of the phillies on friday night created this matchup they think his presence , his attitude out there sometimes is like a phony attitude , greinke said then he yells at people he just stares people down and stuff and most pitchers just don t do that and when guys do , i guess some hitters get mad there s other pitchers that do that , but i don t know a lot of guys on our team don t like carpenter the cardinals players finished their media availability before greinke spoke , leaving la russa to react very disappointed that greinke would say that , la russa said i don t know him a lot , but i thought he was a highcharacter , classy guy that s a bad comment to make unless you know chris carpenter if you knew him , none of that stuff is true morgan , a lefthanded batter , may not start game 1 against the lefthanded garcia carpenter is not scheduled to pitch until game 3 but it is hard to imagine morgan sitting still with the cardinals in the other dugout over the last two years morgan has had at least four runins with st louis players last season , while with washington , morgan flattened catcher bryan anderson , even though there was no play at the plate in a spring training game against st louis before his trade to milwaukee , morgan had to be restrained when the benches emptied on aug 11 in st louis , morgan taunted carpenter from the dugout until the umpire gerry davis told brewers manager ron roenicke to quiet him down less than a month later , on sept 7 , morgan was ejected for throwing his tobacco toward carpenter after striking out morgan claimed carpenter swore at him albert pujols stepped between them after the game , on twitter , morgan referred to pujols as alberta and she he also tweeted , where still n 1st and i hope those crying birds injoy watching tha crew in tha playoffs ! ! ! aaaaahhhhh ! ! ! on saturday , morgan professed no regrets he even suggested his twitter posts inspired the cardinals to make up 10 1 2 games and overtake atlanta for the wild card i m not going to hide behind what i said , he said at the time , the moment was heated of course maybe i shouldn t have said it , but it is what it is at that time , i thought everybody thought they weren t going to do it i m glad i was able to fuel their fire they played a heck of a september , and now this going to be great for baseball , seeing the brew crew and the cardinals get out there carpenter said i don t concern myself with nyjer or what he s doing our team is not going to allow that stuff to bother us he has his own personality he does what he has to do to play this game and play it the way he wants to play it he s a great talent he does a lot of good things on the field that shouldn t be taken away from him
washington for the first 20 days of march , india is to be found in many parts of the john f kennedy center for the performing arts here cuisine , fabric , visual art , music , film , literature and theater , as well as dance , are all part of its the foyers of the building have been unusually full audiences have included american women in saris and indian men wearing sports jackets i'm sorry that i was able to catch only four companies in three evening performances these presented only a small range of what indian dance can cover three of them though widely divergent in style offered examples of the multidimensional performance form deriving from the southeastern province of tamil nadu the fourth , the daksha sheth s company sarpagati way of the serpent \( on tuesday \) , was an example of fusion , combining so the program notes say elements from kathak \( the complex classical dance from north india \) , mayurbhanj chhau \( the martial tribal dance from east india \) , kalaripayattu \( the martial art from kerala in the deep south \) and mallakhamb \( aerial techniques from western india \) some of these notably sarpagati were audience hits that bore little interest for me others , however , showed how indian forms can provide some of the most transcendent experiences that dance has to offer on thursday i took a washington friend with little experience of any dance theater and none of indian forms to see malavika sarukkai in sakthi sakthimaan after her final dance , his immediate response was that it had brought him as near to being out of body and out of mind as he could imagine from live performance i felt much the same one important difference was the use of live music by ms sarukkai and , in the second half of the previous evening , by ragamala dance the closeness of the liaison between music and dance was often bewitching but that ca n't explain all the differences there was live music for sarpagati , too , without there being any intimate connection between sight and sound so i 'll just say briefly that most of sarpagati and much of the three dances shown by dakshina in the first half of wednesday evening seemed to amalgamate aspects of east , west , traditional and modern in ways that felt like tepid compromises by contrast , no sooner had either ragamala dance \( an american company of the indian diaspora \) or ms sarukkai \( an internationally renowned soloist from india \) begun , than every moment seemed precise , specific , focused from those sharply defined beginnings arose complexities both rapturous and profound the ragamala musical instruments were actually an excellent example of fusion for gangashtakam , the instruments included the mrindangam and nattuvangam and violin though producing sounds that most westerners seldom associate with the violin gangashtakam concerning the flow and worship of the river ganga \( ganges \) is a solo for aparna ramaswamy quickly she demonstrates just how many parts of the body are used in bharatanatyam \( individual fingers , different parts of the sole of the foot , the spine tipped in many ways , eyes , head , arms and legs \) , the volumetric fullness with which a single dancer can become thrillingly threedimensional , and the wide supply of rhythms and dynamic contrasts that enrich this form every change of focus registers keenly the swaying pliancy of the torso becomes deeply sensuous \( no dance form flatters the curves of the female torso more than that of india \) a simple , bouncing walk toward the audience and back is delivered with a subtlety that made it far from simple in its effect gestures ranging from small to large indicate the growth of the river , and their fluency its current but it is when it comes to meaning that we see differences between indian and western dance theater yet greater than those between indian and western music in this solo about the ganges , ms ramaswamy seems now to embody the river , now to indicate it , now to worship it and the forms of expression alternated between detailed mime gestures to the kinds of pure dance that seem as abstract and as impersonal as a human being can ever achieve the dancer seems continually to move between different kinds of being and of thought , and the western observer is aware of many layers of mystery in the second ragamala dance , yathra \( journey \) , five women dance to music for sitar and indian cello the work traces the course of a day and , by implication , a life dance themes are iterated by successive performers with different inflections when , in the autumnal twilightoflife solo near the end , we recognize some of the same material that had been shown in the brighter earlier section , the effect is movingly meditative this is an excellent company ms ramaswamy is an enchantingly beautiful dancer at first , the beauties of ms sarukkai s dancing on thursday seemed less remarkable in particular , her torso does not tip with the freedom of ms ramaswamy s but her spell kept changing and growing her three solos were mahesa tandavam \( the dance of shiva \) , eka lakhshyaha margaha \( the many paths to the one \) and mahishasuramardini \( the fall of the demon \) it s tempting to dwell on the mythological , religious and philosophical intentions of these works both the program notes and a spoken introduction helped with these and yet it may be better to observe that the meanings of ms sarukkai s dancing seem to arise primarily out of the intense contrasts she makes between different facets of dance itself stillness or motion gesture or rhythm legato or staccato left or right open or closed aggressive or benign these and other oppositions became thrilling in ms sarukkai s extraordinarily long solos \( the program lasted almost 90 minutes she was seldom offstage for long \) after a complex series of phrases around the stage , she will suddenly hold a pose on one leg that becomes a statement of heroic tranquillity her hands and fingers frequently flutter in close response to a drum or other instrument now they hover or travel in flight , then they change to declarative gestures of quite another kind her very face , with its rich cheekbones and calm mouth \( often in a halfsmile \) , keeps altering you have no clue who she is but , as with other great indian dancers , you feel that far larger things are passing through her , and that you are in communion with them , too as with ms ramaswamy , some of the most transporting instances are ones of nearstillness , when the dancer seems to be inhaling the moment as if it were incense
rome one story holds that it was only when they cosigned the canvas they had just painted together on a fall day in 1966 that franco angeli discovered the identity of his fellow artist jack kerouac another has the men collaborating on their depiction of the deposition , the moment when jesus is taken from the cross , after visiting the church of santa maria del popolo and admiring paintings by the baroque bad boy caravaggio and while details are fuzzy on the circumstances of their first meeting some versions say angeli found a bloodied kerouac lying on the street outside a bar and took him home all accounts seem to agree that kerouac was drunk beyond that , not much is known about the creation of this painting , which has been in a private collection for four decades and will go on public view this week for the first time in years , at an here at the museum of the imperial forums certainly its creators ca n't provide much information kerouac died from cirrhosis in 1969 and angeli died of aids , after decades of drug abuse , in 1988 franco and kerouac had something together , said marina ripa di meana , a former fashion designer who is married to the show s curator , carlo ripa di meana , and who was angeli s lover in the late 1960s and early '70s \( she is the principal subject of the photos , which come from her private collection \) they were certainly potential partners in crime , and they were both attuned to the same things mr ripa di meana , an environmentalist and former politician , knew of the painting and decided to include it in the show after a revival of italian interest in kerouac s work in recent months , translations have been published in italy of on the road the original scroll , mexico city blues and and the hippos were boiled in their tanks , a 1945 novel by kerouac and william s burroughs , along with ebook versions of nearly 20 kerouac novels kerouac , it seems , saw the making of the painting as a high point of his 1966 trip to italy according to paul maher jr in his 2004 biography of the writer , kerouac wrote to his agent , sterling lord , that apart from visiting the vatican , singing poorly in a rome nightclub and painting a piet with the italian artist franco angeli in his studio , he did not see the sense in having gone to italy at all angeli too seemed to think highly of the collaboration , holding onto the painting a composition of roughly sketched haloed figures congregating around a cross until 1970 or so he did n't want to sell it , he was very attached to it , but franco always needed money , said armenia balducci , the actress and screenwriter who bought the painting with her husband , gian maria volont , the movie actor and leftist , and kept it after they separated \( mr volont died in 1994 \) it now hangs in the dining room of her home near piazza navona it s certainly something special , a glimpse onto their sense of spirituality , perhaps although both angeli and kerouac are known as antiestablishment figures , there is none of that in the deposition painting , which is a traditional , if modern , representation of a wellknown theme but most people familiar with the men agree that its subject matter was likely chosen by kerouac my father was an atheist , he came from a family of atheists , they were definitely not religious , said angeli s daughter , maria , who runs the in rome and said it was unusual for her father to paint such a spiritual scene he was very political and against symbols of any kind on the other hand kerouac , who was born into a family of observant catholics of french canadian heritage , frequently turned to religious themes in his own paintings , of which there are hundreds , said edward j adler , a former professor of painting at new york university and the author of departed angels the lost paintings , which catalogs the works al aronowitz , a reporter for the new york post in the 1950s , said that he 'd interviewed kerouac , who told him that if he had n't been a writer , he would have been a painter , mr adler said in a telephone interview kerouac s notebooks at the new york public library are thick with little sketches , he added douglas brinkley , a rice university professor and the editor of kerouac s journals , said in a phone interview that when he rediscovered his catholic heritage , he embraced the iconography , drawing crucifixes and rosaries in his notebooks , and painting popes kerouac embraced the pageantry of catholicism , he said , adding that he also painted many buddhas for kerouac , who sought comfort in god from a life riven by alcoholism and depression , religious themes like the crucifixion and the resurrection were not a joke , mr brinkley said there is no blasphemy in kerouac angeli and kerouac s deposition has captured the favorable attention of the vatican , which last week in its house newspaper , l'osservatore romano , trumpeting the fervent catholicism that also pervades much of kerouac s literary work sandro barbagallo , the paper s art critic , wrote that the painting helps to further demonstrate the profound religious sensibility of the american writer who spent his life on an endless search
nuuk , greenland the eight nations pledged thursday to create international protocols to prevent and clean up offshore in areas of the region that are becoming increasingly accessible to exploration because of a changing climate the united states , russia , canada , iceland , denmark , norway , finland and sweden said the protocols would be modeled on a separate agreement signed here in nuuk on thursday to coordinate searchandrescue operations over 13 million square miles of ocean the searchandrescue pact is the first legally binding agreement adopted by the council , which was created in 1996 to address challenges and opportunities in the arctic spurred by the retreat of sea ice like growing and gas exploration or increasing traffic of cargo and cruise ships , which have doubled the number of tourists in the arctic in recent years the council s actions , officials said , reflected a maturation of a regional group that has been criticized for not acting more aggressively to address the myriad issues of a the pursuit of natural resources has sharpened regional competition and raised the possibilities of pollution and environmental catastrophes a senior diplomat from one of the member nations , speaking on the condition of anonymity , acknowledged that the council s governments were running behind events like increasing shipping and new exploration licenses across the arctic became the first united states secretary of state to attend the council s biennial meeting of ministers , held this year in the capital of , the largely autonomous region of denmark , where warming trends have been felt acutely she was accompanied by the secretary of the interior , , and senator lisa murkowski , republican of alaska we are going to raise the visibility of arctic issues back in the united states so that we can begin to take the steps that are necessary for us , mrs clinton said in a news conference aboard a boat in godthab fjord , north of nuuk she reiterated the administration s call to ratify the law of the sea treaty the treaty , stalled in the senate for decades , provides the international basis for settling territorial claims in the arctic , and the failure to ratify it has left the united states at a disadvantage as the other arctic nations stake out vast regions as exclusive economic zones ratification , she said , was way overdue domestic politics in the united states have often undercut american diplomacy , especially when it comes to reducing emissions blamed for , something mrs clinton herself acknowledged later in remarks with denmark s foreign minister it s been challenging in our political system to take the kinds of actions that we know are dictated by the science and by what we see in front of our eyes , she said having failed to win approval for legislation to reduce emissions , she said , the obama administration would continue to pursue executive and regulatory steps to address climate change the agreement governing searchandrescue efforts though a treaty was signed by the united states under executive authority and thus does not require senate ratification it divides the vast arctic region into eight zones and puts each nation in charge of coordinating any rescue efforts that might be required in some of the planet s most remote and formidable conditions none of the arctic nations today have adequate resources for search and rescue in the arctic in light of the increasing activity that is already happening , david a balton , a deputy assistant secretary who negotiated the agreement for the american side , said before thursday s meeting the same is true for the prospect of a catastrophic oil spill united states officials said that the push for negotiated protocols for oil exploration in the arctic stemmed from the searing experience of the deepwater horizon disaster last year the administration is considering requests for exploration off alaska how expansive and binding the protocols for preventing a similar disaster in the arctic are remains to be seen as the arctic council begins negotiations at a minimum , mr salazar said , what i think we can probably do is aim at getting to a set of best practices that can be used in oil and gas exploration and production in the arctic region
washington butler center andrew smith sat on a stool in the locker room with a butterfly bandage covering a gash above his right eye it was a reminder of how bruising and physical the no 8seeded bulldogs 6058 win over no 9 old dominion had been , and that style of play was just fine with butler even though old dominion entered the game leading the nation in rebounding margin , butler scraped and clawed and held a 3229 edge on the glass the bulldogs gathered 18 offensive rebounds , none bigger than forward matt howard s lastsecond putback that sent his team to the next round that just doesn t happen against us , old dominion forward keyon carter said but in this game , it did the butler players said they were able to gather so many missed shots on offense because old dominion struggled to box out while playing a zone defense we were just keeping plays alive , and when you re playing a zone , that kills the zone , butler guard ronald nored said they force you into a tough shot , and you get a rebound , and they have to play more zone that s tough carter said the monarchs had been playing zone extensively since their feb 9 win at william mary , and that it had not caused any issues over the past month butler coach brad stevens said his team was successful because it moved the ball around the perimeter so quickly that the monarchs were unable to react quickly enough to get a body on a rebounder you move it , move it , move it , and they shift the zone , and sometimes that gives you inside position , stevens said old dominion guard kent bazemore said the bulldogs seemed to know exactly how the ball would come off the rim when a teammate s shot soared toward the basket when the bulldogs face no 1 pittsburgh in the next round , they will be tested around the rim once more the panthers are second in the nation in rebounding margin , but the bulldogs would not be fazed that s our identity , nored said , just tough , hardnosed basketball
victoria azarenka never publicly complained about her draw at the , which aligned her to meet the threetime champion in only the third round williams s inactivity because of illness and injury over the past 12 months meant she entered the open as the 28th seed , abnormally low for one of the most dominant players in tennis history it also produced an early meeting with the fourthseeded azarenka , who otherwise might have had designs on a deep run i'm not going to sit here and cry about i had a tough draw , azarenka said it s part of the game williams emerged the winner during the day session at arthur ashe stadium , but she needed every bit of her mettle to overcome azarenka , 61 , 76 \( 5 \) azarenka fended off four match points in the 82minute second to set up a tense tie breaker williams was not the only american to sweat out a lengthy and challenging straightsets victory mardy fish required 3 hours 20 minutes to put away kevin anderson of south africa , 64 , 76 \( 4 \) , 76 \( 3 \) , and advance to the fourth round fish remained on track for a quarterfinal matchup against no 3 roger federer , the fivetime champion , who brushed aside no 27 marin cilic of croatia , 63 , 46 , 64 , 62 fish first will play no 11 seed jowilfried tsonga of france , who defeated no 19 fernando verdasco of spain , 63 , 75 , 64 , in an evening match in another evening match , topseeded novak djokovic of serbia eliminated the russian nikolay davydenko , 63 , 64 , 62 , in 2 hours 7 minutes for a thirdround , straightsets match , the battle between williams and azarenka generated the electricity and daring shotmaking of a tough semifinal but because of williams s almost comical seeding , it took place even before the first week was over definitely , i think the whole match was a semifinal , williams said at the end of the day , it was a third round i'm only in the round of 16 now williams was out of competition almost a year after foot surgery in 2010 and a pulmonary embolism she suffered in february , and she did not return until june now she has more than just a shot to win the women s draw with no 3 maria sharapova having fallen victim to italy s flavia pennetta , williams stands as the prohibitive favorite none of the remaining players , especially on the other side of the draw , possess her skill , power , mental strength and championship attitude not even the no 1 seed , caroline wozniacki , whom williams could face in the semifinals , has the r sum a united states open finalist in 2009 , wozniacki dismissed the american vania king , 62 , 64 , on saturday and will face a difficult test in the fourth round against the stout russian svetlana kuznetsova , who dispatched of uzbekistan , 64 , 62 but neither wozniacki nor the 15thseeded kuznetsova is playing as well as williams , who is fresh , healthy and determined she s playing at a higher level than i 've seen her play , azarenka said indeed , azarenka had to withstand a withering and relentless attack as williams opened the match by going up by 50 after only 17 minutes it was like a body blow to azarenka , a 22yearold from belarus what s it like \? azarenka said it s painful to have somebody going at you like that , it s a little bit painful you try to do your best , but somebody s on fire federer s victory over cilic turned out to be pedestrian , but there was a dicey moment it seemed to turn on a long baseline rally in the third game of the second set , which federer held on to win as he took control of the match federer had broken cilic in the first game of the second set , but cilic broke right back for a moment , federer had a look of despair as he awaited cilic s serve in the third game , even though he had won 29 consecutive third round matches in grand slams coming into the day it was a tricky match , especially at one set all , federer said in the third set , especially at the beginning , i thought it was a key moment because he had momentum on his side federer advanced to his 30th consecutive grand slam fourth round after he cleaned up a few loose ends to win the final two sets without much difficulty cilic , who two years ago beat no 2 andy murray in the fourth round before losing to the eventual champion juan mart n del potro , was a worthy opponent but as usual , federer found his game as long as i'm in the tournament , i know i have a shot , federer said
washington did brutal produce the crucial intelligence that led to the killing of \? as intelligence officials disclosed the trail of evidence that led to the compound in pakistan where bin laden was hiding , a chorus of bush administration officials claimed vindication for their policy of enhanced interrogation techniques like  among them was john yoo , a former justice department official who wrote secret legal memorandums justifying brutal interrogations president obama can take credit , rightfully , for the success today , mr yoo in national review , but he owes it to the tough decisions taken by the bush administration but a closer look at prisoner interrogations suggests that the harsh techniques played a small role at most in identifying bin laden s trusted courier and exposing his hideout one detainee who apparently was subjected to some tough treatment provided a crucial description of the courier , according to current and former officials briefed on the interrogations but two prisoners who underwent some of the harshest treatment including , who was waterboarded 183 times repeatedly misled their interrogators about the courier s identity the discussion of what led to bin laden s demise has revived a national debate about torture that raged during the bush years the former president and many conservatives argued for years that force was necessary to persuade qaeda operatives to talk human rights advocates , and mr obama as he campaigned for office , said the tactics were torture , betraying american principles for little or nothing of value glenn l carle , a retired officer who oversaw the interrogation of a highlevel detainee in 2002 , said in a phone interview tuesday , that coercive techniques did n't provide useful , meaningful , trustworthy information he said that while some of his colleagues defended the measures , everyone was deeply concerned and most felt it was unamerican and did not work obama administration officials , intent on celebrating monday s successful raid , have tried to avoid reigniting a partisan battle over torture the bottom line is this if we had some kind of smokinggun intelligence from waterboarding in 2003 , we would have taken out osama bin laden in 2003 , said tommy vietor , spokesman for the national security council it took years of collection and analysis from many different sources to develop the case that enabled us to identify this compound , and reach a judgment that bin laden was likely to be living there from the moment the first qaeda suspects were captured , interrogators at both the military s prison at guant namo bay , cuba , and the cia s secret prisons were focused on identifying qaeda members who served as couriers we knew that it was likely that if we were ever to get osama bin laden , it would be because we somehow came upon somebody closely associated with him that he trusted , said charles d stimson , the top pentagon official on detainee affairs from 2004 to 2007 in 2002 and 2003 , interrogators first heard about a qaeda courier who used the nom de guerre , but his name was just one tidbit in heaps of uncorroborated claims after the capture in march 2003 of mr mohammed , the chief planner of the sept 11 , 2001 , attacks , he was subjected to the most harrowing set of the socalled enhanced measures , which included slamming prisoners into walls , shackling them in stress positions and keeping them awake for as long as 180 hours like two other prisoners , he was subjected to waterboarding according to an american official familiar with his interrogation , mr mohammed was first asked about mr kuwaiti in the fall of 2003 , months after the waterboarding he acknowledged having known him but said the courier was retired and of little significance in 2004 , however , a qaeda operative named hassan ghul , captured in iraq , gave a different account of mr kuwaiti , according to the american official mr ghul told interrogators that mr kuwaiti was a trusted courier who was close to bin laden , as well as to mr mohammed and to , who had become the operational chief of al qaeda after mr mohammed s capture mr kuwaiti , mr ghul added , had not been seen in some time which analysts thought was a possible indication that the courier was hiding out with bin laden the details of mr ghul s treatment are unclear , though the cia says he was not waterboarded the cia asked the justice department to authorize other harsh methods for use on him , but it is unclear which were used one official recalled that mr ghul was quite cooperative , saying that rough treatment , if any , would have been brief armed with mr ghul s account of the courier s significance , interrogators asked mr mohammed again about mr kuwaiti he stuck to his story , according to the official after mr libbi was captured in may 2005 and turned over to the cia , he too was asked he denied knowing mr kuwaiti and gave a different name for bin laden s courier , whom he called maulawi jan cia analysts would never find such a person and eventually concluded that the name was mr libbi s invention , the official recalled again , the cia has said mr libbi was not waterboarded , and details of his treatment are not known but anticipating his interrogation , the agency pressured the justice department days after his capture for a new set of legal memorandums justifying the most brutal methods because mr mohammed and mr libbi had both steered interrogators away from mr kuwaiti , cia officials concluded that they must be protecting him for an important reason think about circles of information there s an inner circle they would protect with their lives , said an american official who was briefed on the cia analysis the crown jewels of al qaeda were the whereabouts of bin laden and his operational security the accumulating intelligence about mr kuwaiti persuaded cia officials to stay on his trail , leading to the discovery of his real name which american officials have not disclosed and whereabouts he in turn unwittingly led the agency to bin laden s lair , where mr kuwaiti and his brother were among those who died in monday s raid before a day had passed , the torture debate had flared the chairman of the house homeland security committee , representative peter t king , republican of new york , told fox news that the success of the hunt

the republican presidential contenders regard global warming as a hoax or , at best , underplay its importance the most vocal denier is rick perry , the texas governor and longtime friend of the oil industry , created by a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling into their projects never mind that nearly all the world s scientists regard global warming as a serious threat to the planet , with human activities like the burning of fossil fuels a major cause never mind that multiple investigations have found no evidence of scientific manipulation never mind that america needs a national policy mr perry has a big soapbox , and what he says , however fallacious , reaches a bigger audience than any scientist can command with one exception make that oneandonehalf the rest of the republican presidential field also rejects the scientific consensus the exception is jon huntsman jr , a former ambassador to china and former governor of utah , who recently wrote i believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming call me crazy the onehalf exception is mitt romney , who accepted the science when he was governor of massachusetts and argued for reducing emissions lately , he s retreated into mush do i think the world s getting hotter \? yeah , i do n't know that , but i think that it is as for the human contribution it could be a little it could be a lot the others flatly repudiate the science calls global warming the greatest hoax i think that has been around for many , many years once said that carbon dioxide was nothing to fear because it is a natural byproduct of nature and has complained of manufactured science rick santorum , a former senator from pennsylvania , has called climate change a beautifully concocted scheme that is just an excuse for more government control of your life newt gingrich s full record on climate change has been a series of epic flipflops in 2008 , he appeared on television with nancy pelosi , the former house speaker , to say that our country must take action to address climate change he now says the appearance was a mistake none of the candidates endorse a mandatory limit on emissions or , for that matter , a truly robust clean energy program this includes mr huntsman in 2007 , as utah governor , he joined with arnold schwarzenegger , then the governor of california , in creating the , a marketbased capandtrade program aimed at reducing emissions in western states capandtrade has since acquired a toxic political reputation , especially among republicans , and mr huntsman has backed away the economic downturn has made addressing climate change less urgent for voters but the issue is not going away the nation badly needs a candidate with a coherent , disciplined national strategy so far , there is no republican who fits that description
gasps went up last week when a digital edition of ts eliot s 1922 poem the waste land knocked marvel comics out of the top spot on the list of topgrossing book apps for the ipad reports from the world of books but wait ! now here comes jack kerouac tailgating right behind , looking for a similarly exalted place to park a sleek new ipad app based on his classic 1957 novel on the road the amplified edition of on the road , released today by penguin classics , certainly comes tricked out with more fancy bells and whistles than a bmw m5 it includes the full text of the novel , of course , with expandable marginal notes giving historical and biographical background an interactive map traces kerouac s three reallife crosscountry road trips , with links to relevant passages from the novel there are neverbeforeseen photos , rare audio clips of kerouac reading from an early draft , previously unreleased documents from his publisher s archive , and a slide show of international covers showing how the book has been marketed from argentina to ukraine to china pretty much the only thing missing is the chance to hear the novel read aloud by that sexyvoiced woman from your gps it would be tempting to see this as the dawn of a golden age of the serious literary app , though all classics may not benefit equally from lavish multimedia amplification as laura miller wrote recently in salon , the waste land has the advantage of being both familiar and difficult , appealing to the kind of older readers who feel they could have gotten a lot more out of the poem in college if they d only been a little less distracted by the temptations that assail freshman english majors and who are willing to shell out 14 , about 14 times the price of angry birds , for a second chance by contrast , pretty much the only real impediment to any ordinary teenager s enjoyment of on the road is unfamiliarity with the terms jalopy and tea \( though a note on 1950s drug slang helps with that last one \) the on the road app priced at 1299 , the same as the regular ebook edition \( it rises to 1699 on july 2 \) was prepared with help from the beat scholars bill morgan and howard cunnell , though it has a populist , unscholarly feel some of the notes embedded in the text give a helpful rundown of the reallife people and places behind the novel , sometimes with photographs that deepen the period flavor but often they merely explain the obvious or the dubiously relevant , as in notes defining the gi bill or giving the plot of fidelio \( which sal paradise sees in denver \) , or confiding that a minor character named denver b doll was based on a teacher who befriended the young neal cassady , the inspiration for dean moriarty \( you ll have to look in the section dealing with the novel s publishing history to learn that kerouac thought the man would be tickled by the tribute , though he still took basic precautions to prevent a libel suit \) it would be easy enough to ignore endnotes of this sort in your average classroomready critical edition \( though none in fact exists for on the road \) but on the ipad , it s hard to resist tapping on the blue bars in the margin and pulling yourself out of the story kerouac meant to unfurl as seamlessly as the 120foot scroll of japanese art paper he first typed it on it s also hard to resist the cool interactive map comparing the routes of kerouac s own three crosscountry road trips , garlanded with corresponding passages from the novel \( though i personally would have loved a feature that would help readers plan their own reenactment , perhaps with some advice from jane and michael stern on where to find the best buttermilk biscuits in dubuque and other legal moodenhancing substances along the route \) the app s collection of documents from the archives of viking , which published the original hardcover , gives insight into the intense corporate efforts to market this most freewheeling of american novels which surely holds lessons for those selling soupedup ebooks today here , you find an exchange of letters between kerouac and his editor , malcolm cowley , about how to deal with obscenity issues , as well as a facsimile of a previously unreleased internal memorandum saying the book had great fascination and sales potential despite not being a great or even a likeable book \( that last part was penciled out \) there s also kerouac s own sketch for an appealing commercial cover , showing all the cities visited in the novel cheek by jowl along a single straight road , under the heading a modern prose novel by john kerouac still , despite early enthusiasm at viking , no one saw on the road as the endlessly shapeshifting juggernaut it remains 54 years after sal paradise and dean moriarty first hit the highway in a letter about the marketing plan , viking s publicity director , patrician mcmanus , told kerouac , i forewarn you that it will require active work on your part , and maybe nothing to show for it
if you follow congress \( and who could blame you if you gave up on that years ago \) it s important to look out for normalseeming bills that are , in fact , filled with poisonous little bits of legislative mischief making there s been a lot written already about congressional republicans attaching fasttrack approval of the keystone xl pipeline to the payroll tax bill if you can t see the connection , don t worry , there is none it s all about pushing a terrible idea through congress under the cover of a needed bill and speaking of , there s the national defense authorization act , which includes a bunch of really dangerous changes to the legal system , like taking the fbi and federal prosecutors and courts largely out of the antiterrorism business i ve already vented about that one today , so i ll leave it alone for now here s another good one last friday , the house republican leadership published their version of a law to extend unemployment benefits which congress must do or risk making the recovery even slower for ordinary americans than it already is think progress , a liberal political site , pointed out an interesting passage on page 39 it seems the authors of this legislation thought it might be a good moment to amend the social security act not to make the program more effective , or to ensure benefits for future generations of americans , mind you , but to enable states to require drugtesting for anyone seeking unemployment benefits sadly , it s not really a new idea governors have tried it before in a few states , and the courts so far have resisted because , among other things , it s unconstitutional florida s law requiring drug testing for welfare recipients has been put on hold by a federal judge not to be outdone , representative jack kingston , republican of georgia , has introduced an even more extreme bill that would make drug testing mandatory to receive unemployment benefits \( instead of enabling states to make the decision on their own \) representative george miller of california rightly called the bill just another attempt to demonize the unemployed , most of whom have no job for no fault of their own he added why doesn t he propose to drug test executives at wall street banks \? it was their actions that have been documented to have directly contributed to the recession and high unemployment rate in the first place i m not calling for that , but it s fun to think about read a
on the final day of march , it felt like just another afternoon of an endless winter thursday at yankee stadium , raw and wet and frigid , with a wind that howled and swirled in the dugout , parkas concealed pinstripes in the stands , teeth clattered the few brave players who wore short sleeves regretted it later conditions for the ' season opener were far from ideal , but the outcome warmed the crowd of 48 , 226 the yankees rolled past the , , a victory defined by a command performance by curtis granderson , who played exceptional defense in center field and slugged the in the seventh inning an encouraging earlyseason display of power by mark teixeira , who hit a and the lateinning lockdown by their revamped bullpen , which in relief of c c sabathia retired all nine hitters as pitchers are acquired and roles change , one reliever stays the same mariano rivera , who praised the dominance of joba chamberlain , who got the victory , and his new setup man , rafael soriano that s how it was designed , rivera said we do n't have the strong rotation that we used to have before i mean , the names i think we have a tremendous rotation but the bullpen was designed for that improving the rotation was the yankees' priority this offseason strengthening the bullpen happened out of desperation , when cliff lee s decision to sign with philadelphia left the yankees with money to spend , and lots of it so they added soriano against the wishes of general manager brian cashman , whose vocal stance at the introductory news conference reached soriano s friends and family back home in the dominican republic early in spring training soriano sought cashman out for an explanation satisfied , he said he was comfortable so far with his new job after closing last season for tampa bay , and on thursday he came in for a superb chamberlain and retired two of the tigers' lethal hitters , miguel cabrera and victor martinez , as part of his handiwork we 're going to need that , manager joe girardi said the ending , as overpowering as it was orderly , fulfilled a prediction offered before the game by derek jeter , who quipped , do n't expect too much from the hitters today they combined for 11 hits , as sabathia and the tigers' ace righthander , justin verlander , each worked six innings , departing with the score tied at 33 opening days had not been kind to sabathia , at least not with the yankees a 1024 earned run average in two starts but he said he had a better feel for his pitches thursday , especially of his twoseam fastball and slider , which he threw early to get ahead sabathia bemoaned his failure to put away hitters , allowing four of his six hits with two strikes including brandon inge s twoout , runscoring single in the fourth but he could have escaped with a lead had it not been for an fifthinning error by robinson cano , which led to an unearned run sabathia s last five starts against detroit have come opposite verlander , whose dominant spring training 096 earned run average in 28 innings prepared him for a lineup that approached him with a definite strategy facing him in miserable weather a windchill of 31 degrees is unappealing , and so the yankees focused on driving up his pitch count none of the five players who batted in the first inning took a swing before the fourth pitch of the atbat , forcing verlander to throw 31 over all in drawing a walk , teixeira saw seven pitches , and he came up in the third with a more aggressive plan he drilled a 11 fastball deep into the second deck in right field , only his second hit in 18 atbats against verlander a notoriously slow starter , teixeira did not his first homer last year until his 12th game but he addressed those struggles in a january tutorial with the hitting coach kevin long , who focused on improving his mechanics while batting from the left side teixeira could often be found hitting alone in the batting cages beneath steinbrenner field in spring training , taking swing after swing , and on thursday he saw results i 've been petitioning the league to start in march for years now , teixeira said , laughing finally they let us start in march because everyone knows about my aprils people who pay close attention to april statistics may also know about granderson s unusual success , a streak that was jeopardized by an injury march 22 to his right oblique muscle when he left tampa , fla , on wednesday night after playing in a minor league game , granderson was hopeful , though unsure , that he would play thursday in the first inning , he made in the seventh , after the lefthander phil coke replaced verlander , granderson , a lefthanded hitter , mashed a ball into the second deck in right field , his third consecutive opening day with a home run his homer last april 4 in boston could not offset what became a challenging season , marked by injury and ineffectiveness , but granderson said he was much more comfortable in his second year with the yankees all of the firsts are out of the way , you know , granderson said , adding i knew of the city and the fans , and now i know how it is so all those question marks are gone , versus looking forward to it , like i am now his final highlight came in the ninth , when , playing shallow to account for the wind , to deep center as the replay was shown on the highdefinition video screen , fans roared and clapped \( their gloved hands \) , and rivera gawked in appreciation one out later , the crowd applauded rivera and the blueprint victory and the chance to go home happy and warm it was , jeter said , as scripted
joe drape and zach hillesland will be liveblogging all day on saturday , with onsite feeds from pete thamel at oklahoma statetexas and pete bigelow at michiganmichigan state check back throughout the day for updates and analysis , to ask questions or to give us your observations , whether from your couch or from the bleachers we re wrapping it for the day night thanks for following along for late night coverage of oregonarizona state , follow the link below gamecast watching a 1010 oklahomakansas game , and it may have the worst broadcast team ever carter blackburn brock huard i guess there is a reason they are doing the kansasoklahoma game joe drape mirror , mirror for auburn s cody parkey at the end of the first half , he had a chance to extend the lead and missed with just over thirty seconds left in this one , he s decided it with a 42yard fg that pushes this game out of reach for the gators it s been a rough three weeks for the gators , and they ll drop to 43 \( 23 sec \) for the second time this game , florida has dropped a crucial punt , this latest one could be the kiss of death for the gators i m not saying it s easy i could never catch one of those things with fifteen beasts running at me but there has to be a coach for that right \? florida forced auburn into a three and out , and did exactly the job it needed to do to give the offense enough of a chance to tie this one up the gators will get the ball back with over three and a half minutes to go on fourth and third , florida offensive lineman kyle kohne racked up a falsestart call , forcing his team to punt luckily for him , the punt was incredible , downed inside the three yard line florida still has an outside shot in this one i could really go for a touchdown2 point conversionforced overtime combo right now the best thing to do with teams that are struggling to score is make them play overtime , where they ll be forced to do it florida went for the bomb , trying to jump start this offense , an offering that was picked off until the ball collided with the ground the dropped interception is one of the biggest aaaahhhh ! ! ! moments in sports i just yelled at my tv i have no witnesses it happened though , i promise charlie weis is not sustainable neither is florida s offense at the moment after a scoreless third quarter , auburn opens up the fourth with an eight yard touchdown run florida , not having score a touchdown all day , might have some trouble coming back in this one one play one touchdown auburn leads 146 with 14 53 to play how do you lose two yards on third and inches \? get your playbook right , charlie florida drive stalls for no good reason still down 1 , 7 minutes to go gator punter kyle christy just pulled off one of the weird sports plays i ve ever seen he caught the longsnap , dropped the ball over his foot , and soon realized that he dropped it too far away , and let it hit the ground at this point i m thinking he s going to get absolutely equalized , but much to my dismay chagrin , he picked up the ball and got the punt away in time one of the wildest plays i ve seen today auburn still leads , still the same score , 76 auburn has gone with a qb change , going with backup clint moseley over starter barrett trotter we ll see how auburn s offense responds to the change after both teams combined for under a 100 yards passing in the first half , changing qbs doesn t sound like a bad idea auburn closes the half with a missed chipshot field goal , and in a game where points are coming at a premium , that could definitely prove to be costly in the second half a game that was predicted to be pretty evenly played , has been evenly plaid auburn 7 florida 6 at the half bama is pretty much crushing ole miss and , again this is a boring game but let s be real where would you rather go to college game tuscaloosa or oxford \? roll tiders don t answer that we know i covered colleges and hit pretty much every stadium and college town in the nation going to an ole miss game is the granddaddy of the college experience oxford is a wonderful town , steeped in literary tradition as well as more recent civil rights history it is a serious place but it also has great food and music and a really deep appreciation of college football the grove is the single best place to tailgate it s like drinking and dining in a 5star forest with bartenders and waiters instead of deer and rabbits it s about white tablecloths and crystal and grits alongside gruyere love the fact the speed limit on campus remains 18 , the jersey number of archie manning maybe the greatest college player ever \? not for numbers or his pro career , but how much he meant to a team and a state and a collective national psyche and , how can you not like a university that offers this tag line ole miss where they redshirt miss americas joe drape the gators drive stalled again and had to settle for another field goal the low scoring affair continues , but in no way does it mean this game is boring the speed of some of these athletes is so fun to watch auburn still leads , 76 , with a minute to go in the third quarter this is quite the low scoring sec game watched these teams for the past couple of weeks and they ve usually been involved in more high scoring contests it s only 73 partway through the third , auburn trailing with the ball in their own half of the field the southern methodist university mustangs are back in a big way they defeated central florida , 3817 to go to 51 for the year and pretty much prove that june jones is the most successful turnaround artist in big time college football he inherited a hawaii team that was 012 and took them to 94 in year one he s taken the mustangs , a program decimated by the death penalty in 1986 , to two bowl games something i thought i d never see i have a niece there now and , as i wrote in december of 2009 , i can once more be true to my school http www nytimes com 2009 12 24 sports ncaafootball 24smu html joe drape ole miss is hanging right in there with no 2 alabama just switched over in time to see an ole miss player tune up the alabama kicker with five to go in the first half , alabama leads 147 just one play after starting with great field position and a chance to make a move , illinois qb nathan scheelhaase throws his second interception of the day , this one made by ohio st s travis howard there s just not enough time left for illinois to get two scores calling this one now , ohio st 17 illinois 7 best quote i didn t use in the story michigan state safety isaiah lewis , who had the decisive interception return for a td that sealed the win for the spartans on denard robinson we knew already that he wasn t really a good passer he continued , we already knew we were dominating them they were only getting yards because of the penalties we had to stop getting the penalties and start dominating more from lewis , \( that i did use in the story \) the spartans still feel disrespected by the wolverines , which led to some of the chippy play saturday they just think we re always the lower team , like they re going to dominate , this and that , lewis said no matter how many times we beat them , it s probably going to be like that even though we have this fourth win , they re probably still going to act like they re better than us he continued you see how they didn t shake our hands after the game \? they walked off the field on us it s a lack of respect pete bigelow it took all of 16 plays , 80 yards , and just under seven minutes , but with their last drive the illini have their first points of the day , a three yard touchdown pass from nathan scheelhaase to evan wilson time is becoming a factor in this one illinois is going to have to stop ohio st on this drive the irish filly together ran away with the queen elizabeth ii at keeneland it s significant because the irishbred daughter of gallileo had just come to this country last week , and won the first lady stakes at keeneland just seven days ago now what s this have to do with college football \? not much , but after watching six hours of football it was a nice distraction to watch it on nbc joe drape edit we re at our own personal halftime congratulations zach hillesland and they complete it for a touchdown great time for the first completion of the game it s weird to think that ohio st only has one pass completion yet is still up three scores , 170 , over illinois big drive coming up here for illinois joe , i already ordered thai finished two and a half entrees i really love joy s noodles haven t closed it off with anything sweet yet i might just wait till a little bit later as far as this season goes , i d tend to agree with both badger bob and your reasons for why it s been so dull there s something with all the offcourt issues \( nfl lockout , nba lockout , conference realignment \) that pulls back the curtains a little bit on the the mystique or hype around sports sports are supposed to be fun escapes , but when they start to look like the rest of the world , they lose a little bit of their luster so it s either that , or i just haven t bought ncaa college football 2012 yet the nba lockout is fascinating , how long do you think it ll last \? zach , is it time to crack one \? i haven t zeroed in on dinner yet , but i m thinking barbecue in fact , a maiden voyage to neelys the memphis landmark that s moved into the neighborhood either the rib sampler , or maybe just the dry rubbed baby backs in the meantime , let s ponder this college football season badger bob told me earlier today that he thought it had been a very dull season so far when i see that pete and the rest of the college press is writing so much about conference realignment i tend to agree no team has ignited the public s imagination of late a la oregon of the last couple boise is no longer a little guys the sec without scandal isn t much fun and with apologies to all stanford cardinal fans \( glenn \) andrew luck hasn t entered the cultural concious like the mannings , tim tebow or even cam newton have in the past thoughts , anyone \? on third and fifteen , ohio st opted for a dive play , a gain of a yard , and is now left to punt i went from watching a videogame \( bayloram \) to watching a senior pga event on third and seven , ohio st s braxton miller took off on a quarterback draw for a massive \( especially considering this game \) 35yard run big offensive plays will be magnified in this one , as yardage and points are at a premium right now rutgers 21 , navy 20 the midshipmen are a solid team and perhaps so are the scarlet knights they are now 51 , and off to the best start since their 2006 glory year rutgers has cincy , west virginia , uconn , south florida army left very good chance to win the big east and the automatic bowl bid joe drape ohio st opens up the second half with an interception by bradley roby , an interception he returned to the illini 12 from there , it took the buckeyes only one play to score , that touchdown coming on a 12yard rush from dan herron all ohio st in this one , 100 over the illini still a lot of time left lots of punting , or as they would say in germany , they made lots of puntings still 30 i hate when big ten football does this to me every week about texas vs oklahoma state in fact , if you are serious about this college football stuff , you need to visit his blog www presnapread com frequently not sure who oklahoma played on saturday texas or texas state \? sooners went to town in red river rivalry , beating ut by 5517 thanks to an offensive explosion and three defensive touchdowns clear that the gap between the two rivals is as wide as it s been in a generation longhorns have another mccoy playing qb case , colt s younger brother , replaced garrett gilbert \( since injured and about to transfer \) against byu and has started last three games didn t look good against sooners ut even has another shipley , jaxson , who s having a similar impact to his own older brother , jordan oklahoma state looks to hold serve cowboys offense is even better than oklahoma s , if that s possible have a former minor league pitcher , brandon weeden , playing quarterback wr justin blackmon is one of the best in the country , though his numbers are slightly down in 2011 offensive line is deep and experienced and the backfield has two promising sophomore backs new oc is todd monken , formerly of the jacksonville jaguars he was hired to replaced dana holgorsen , now the hc at west virginia if it ain t broke don t fix it instead of having monken do his own thing , osu coach mike gundy gave him holgorsen s play book cowboys haven t changed a thing paul myerberg via joe drape ohio st and illinois are stuck in an endless field position battle , or so that s what commentators call it when both teams can t do anything offensively less than three minutes to go , it s still 30 ohio st in this one i miss baylor am austin typical of this distracted 2011 football season that s seen far more action off the field than on it , the biggest question in the press box on saturday had nothing to do with the texasoklahoma state game reporters and officials were all discussing what missouri is going to do , as the tigers are still waffling between staying in the big 12 and leaving for the southeastern conference the oklahoma state president burns hargis , who would be the person with the most insight into missouri s future , said that he s gotten no clear indication i don t know , he said i really don t know i hope they stay hargis said that he personally prefers a 12team league , but acknowledged that may not matter if missouri stays , the league will discuss either growing to 12 teams or remaining at 10 pete thamel edit how are the jerseys \? zach watching rutgers vs navy on espn3 s livestream , and the scarlet knights are driving , but are down 1714 with about 5 minutes left in the third i , and probably most of the rutgers faithful , are waiting for the scarlet to turn the corner and become a perennial power they got the right coach in greg schiano , who was offered the michigan job as well as several others he recruits solid citizens and graduates them they have talent , and that s a nice little stadium out there i do have a fond memory of heading out there one saturday night in 1999 to watch them play virginia tech the hokies had a freshman quarterback no one knew much about guy by the name of vick check out the story http www nytimes com 1999 10 10 sports collegefootballrutgershasnoanswerforvick html joe drape very bummed i can t find smu vs central florida here on television dial i had intended to go to lincoln park gril on 52nd and 9th to watch the game with the smu new york alumni chapter the mustangs have already reclaimed the iron skillet from cross north texas rival tcu , and are en route to their third cosecutive bowl game and perhaps even a conference usa title but this will never happen again our man pete thamel reported today that smu , central florida , navy , air force and boise state will be invited into the big east so maybe i ll get to see them more but really they fit in the big 12 i m all for super conferences , but make them make sense geographically joe drape i m actually reasonably excited for this game ohio st looks glad to have braxton miller back in the lineup , and the buckeye s have drawn first blood with a fg probably not going to be as much scoring in this one as in bayloram , so i m tempering my excitement expectations i suggest you do the same osu 3 illini 0 no contest that offense looked fantastic rg3 was still impressive in the loss am 55 baylor 28 the spartans have won four straight in the rivalry for first time since 196567 , when the program won the last two of its four national titles michigan hired bo schembechler in 1968 , rest is history the wolverines were excited about 60 but still keeping everything in perspective they had started 50 under rich rodriguez in 2010 and 40 under rodriguez in 2009 paul , actually , did say the above in an email to me as part of our gameday production meets msu 28 , michigan 14 i ll add this sorry baltimore bob , and michigan mike and all the big blue faithful up at baileys at 85th and york yes , the paul bunyan trophy stays in east lansing joe drape like i just said , the spartans have totally intimidated robinson and because of it they are going to win still , 13 penalties , and late hits in the waning minutes are not the stuff of title teams joe drape lots of talk here about whether michigan state s isaiah lewis should have been called for taunting on his interception return for a touchdown he held the ball out in denard robinson s face as he scampered past the 5yard line , a nanosecond before going in for the touchdown that gave msu a 14point lead pete bigelow everything but my heart says this one is over with that last score , am has pushed their lead to 5528 , and it doesn t look like there s going to be enough time left for rg3 and baylor to stage a comeback we ll see the heart wants what it wants am not only had a key defensive play , but it was a big , loud one intercepting baylor s robert griffin iii isn t an easy task , but that s what am s dustin harris just did this one s starting to look over from my couch vantage point on two crucial fourthquarter 4 th and 1 plays , the wolverines looked shaky on the first , michigan survived a broken exchange between robinson and tailback vincent smith the junior qb opted to keep the ball and darted ahead for a twoyard gain three plays later , robinson looked equally unsettled on a 4 th and 1 from the msu 9yard line , robinson instantly faced three spartan defenders in the backfield they pummeled him for a 10yard loss , and michigan state took over on downs the wolverines have another shot here , taking over at their own 35 with 4 40 remaining , but they may have just frittered away their lategame momentum pete bigelow michigan state has just harrassed robinson all day the third sack of the day just got them the ball back but better , they have rattled the talented quarterback into making some bad decisions he s missed running lanes and forced passes still , he s going to get one more drive at least joe drape i don t even know what to say anymore am just scored on a 97yard drive , capped by a 47yard touchdown pass from ryan tannehill to uzoma nwachukwu doesn t look like baylor s defense is going to get that key defensive stop any time soon could spell defeat for baylor , down twenty points with under ten minutes to go so far michigan state s cousins has been more consistent and productive than robinson who the spartans have swarmed and held to half of his 303yard total offense average michigan state needs to hold on to the football , though spartans need to clamp down once more joe drape am just forced baylor to turn the ball over on downs inside the ten yard line this game is a minute into the fourth quarter , and there s already a crazy sense of urgency hopefully baylor s defense can respond with their own key defensive play they ll need to to keep this one interested this game really makes for a fantastic watch big play after big play , score after score if only every game were this jampacked with action over 900 yards of offense in this game through three quarters two 68yard touchdowns in one game from the same team \? from the same player \? ryan swope is putting up videogame stats and currently hooked up to an oxygen machine good for you , buddy you ve earned it am rips the energy and momentum away from butler butler defense really needs to do something more substantial if they want a chance to win am 40 baylor 28 insult to injury with the bad food here i succumbed and bought a pretzel they don t have any mustard for it pete bigelow , jilted gigolo edit you should always have mustard packets in your wallet i do and it s a thin wallet not a lot of room for unnecessary items not only is denard and the big blue faithful having a tough time in lansing , but this is the current best selling sports book on amazon three and out rich rodriguez and the michigan wolverines in the crucible of college football by john u bacon this landed on my desk the other day , and i dipped in very good behind the scenes stuff , and pretty much demonstrates that rich r didn t have a chance joe drape baylor s the third is one calm customer , ladies and gentlemen big third down throws throughout that last drive , and he has baylor within one score he s already thrown for 333 yards and 3 touchdowns he s very impressive to watch seems mature texas am still leads , 3428 this just in from one of our liveblog followers and not a single mention of luttrell s tailgate recipes \? sigh so , yes , doggone it , i m going to have some sausage cheddar chowder http thequadblogsnytimescom 2011 10 13 tailgatingrecipessausageandcheesechowder joe drape sushi terriyaki was going to be the choice at a tremendous place in the neighborhood , shabushabu , we called an audible and that s tomorrow s dinner nothing is calling to me yet joe drape edit give it time you ll get the call and it ll be perfect well , that was quick rg3 and baylor scored in fortyone seconds literally i love videogame football looks like this game has the keep it close rule turned on am still has a two score lead , however , and baylor s defense is going to have to come up with some more of those key defensive plays that we talked about earlier am 31 baylor 21 partway through the third quarter texas am doesn t need food , because they re eating baylor alive right now twentyone unanswered points has them up 3114 early in the second half early on , it looked like it was going to be a backandforth gunslinging affair , but am looks poised to put this one away early let s see if rg3 can get baylor back moving in a positive direction paul , i laughed throughout the reading your food description can you make paella on a hotplate \? because i m in as part of my pregame research last night , i had a burger , three brats , some sevenlayer \( who s counting \? \) dip , and a heath bar someone said heath was only still around because it pairs so well with ice cream if the shelf placement at walmart was any idication \( all the way at the bottom \) , i d say that maybe someone was right bought it ate it it was delicious people turn away because the toffee sticks to their teeth and mouth that s kind of rude of them if you ask me that food was delicious , but as soon as you eat it you re done with it \? you just throw it out on the streets because it wanted to hang out in your bicuspids for a little while longer \? not me let s make a heath comeback zach , i m embarrassed to admit that on the first saturday of the season , joyous occasion that it was , i had paella as my midday lunch no excuse for that , outside of the fact that paella is delicious and , due to the previous night s dinner , readily available in my fridge the ideal lineup blends warm food with a cold beverage i wouldn t touch the dogs in east lansing , pete unless they were free , in which case i d take a halfdozen , please today \? i think a burger and a cold one work fine can i say cold one on a new york times blog \? not sure if that ll slip past the censors for ben jerry s , i d like to try the schweddy balls http www benjerry com flavors feature schweddy paul

thoughts \? when it comes to ben jerry s , it s phish food for me their keyboard player , paige mcconnel was a friend at smu with me i really haven t settled on a menu yet for the rest of the day definitely going to order in suggestions \? joe drape halftime food offerings here at spartan stadium might be the worst i ve seen in more than a decade of covering college football sinisterlooking dogs and brats charge is 5 pretzels 350 i think i ll go with the granola bar i stashed in my bag on the way out the door this morning pete bigelow , blog gigolo joe , paul , pete what is your ideal halftime food lineup \? joe , you just mentioned cherry garcia , and i m thinking that would make for a lovely topper at the end of the meal i have a pint a day habit , and cherry g definitely works its way in there on occasion i grew up big eight country and matriculated , sort of , in the old southwest conference it pains me to see the kansas jayhawks along way from the glory days of john and junior riggins and nolan cromwell but i got to believe turner gill , a big eight great , has the jayhawks on the right track and yes , paul , the smith center redmen do play better defense than kansas in fact , the redmen won their district playoff last night , 338 , over beloit i m also conflicted checking in on this texas am and baylor game i m an smugrad and i ll expound more on that later but the southwest conference was the best football money could buy the aggies did , and the bears didn t bend the rules i m rooting for baylor here it just doesn t seem right that the aggies are going to the sec joe drape am is really rolling now , scoring right before the end of the first half eleven plays , 80yards , and the aggies now have 10point lead heading into the half errant throws have been a sore spot for denard robinson this season , with nine interceptions in his first six games save for a dropped interception , he s been spared the big mistake so far today that s the nicest thing that can be said about his performance robinson s 3for11 for 39 yards throwing the ball against the spartans today , and has carried 7 times for 42 yards and the team s lone touchdown no dazzling plays no big mistakes it s a stalemate so far paul myerberg south carolina is tied 77 with stephen garcia look the longhaired , free spirited quarterback left school this week garcia started 34 games , and racked up five suspensions since arriving at sc in 2007 he had lost the starting job to connor shaw who led the gamecocks to a 543 blowout of kentucky last saturday shaw already has run for a touchdown as they head to halftime joe drape scary thought at this point in last year s game , wisconsin had scored 24 points on indiana the badgers have dropped 28 thus far , all via the running backs running back montee ball is a touchdown machine , not just running but also throwing he and russell wilson switched roles on wisconsin s first touchdown of the first quarter it was ball throwing , wilson receiving , not vice versa ball found his quarterback for a 26yard touchdown to give wisconsin a 210 lead could the badgers top last year s 83point outburst against indiana \? forget 83 what about 90 \? ralph russo of the associated press predicted the badgers to score 90 points on the hapless hoosiers , which would be something what if wisconsin didn t call off the dogs \? what if wisconsin tried to score every time it had the ball , running the firstteam offense and its full arsenal of offensive tricks \? could the badgers crack the century mark \? what about oklahoma , which takes on kansas later today \? joe , do the smith center redman play better defense than the jayhawks \? ku gave up 70 points to oklahoma state last weekend here s guessing that the sooners will score 71 to trump their instate rival paul myerberg you remember bob ross from the joy of painting , yes \? i m still trying to find the set on dvd ok , so baylor s rg3 doesn t actually paint , or at least not that i know of , but when he s sitting in the pocket , he s poised and relaxed , much like the late bob ross and when griffin throws , it looks like an artist s brushstroke all that s missing is a beautiful vista of nature and an afro miss you , bob keep it going , robert three touchdowns in two minutes \? love that ratio these teams don t mess around and certainly don t waste any time a 5play , 73yard drive from the aggies has am back on top in a hurry , 1714 if you like action , try and find the fx channel anyone else think it would be a better idea to have the gang from it s always sunny in philadelphia to do the commentary \? that s what they call a million dollar idea give me my bank notes in backt0back drives , am scored on a 68yard touchdown pass to take both the lead and the momentum the very next drive , this one from baylor , featured a 77yard td strike from rgt i m far from a football purist , and closer to a videogame moron with that in mind , this is the kind of football i love to watch it feels like i m watching a sportscenter highlight package , and i like it baylor back on top , 1410 , midway through the second quarter do you remember what happened in east lansing 10 years ago \? what if i gave you some names jeff smoker , tj duckett bj askew , bob stehlin does that ring any bells \? how about john navarre , jermaine gonzales , bobby williams \? almost there \? how about michigan state 26 , michigan 24 \? it was a game that still provokes anger for one side of the michiganmichigan state rivalry on the other side \? glee a brief picture michigan leads , 2420 , with seconds left smoker , michigan state s quarterback , spikes the ball to stop the clock at the michigan twoyard line after his scramble for the end zone fell short michigan thinks the game is over the clock operator , stehlin who went by the nickname spartan bob thinks otherwise , leaving a second on the clock smoker finds duckett for a twoyard score for the win that s michigan s side of the story michigan state tells a different tale , of course the last time michigan won in east lansing \? that would be 2007 , when the wolverines stormed back from a 10point fourth quarter deficit to notch a 2824 win it was after the game that the former um running back mike hart uttered this famous quote sometimes , you get your little brother excited when you re playing basketball let them get the lead and then you come back well , little brother s won three straight in the series , a programfirst for michigan state since winning three in a row from 196567 i think that matters more to both teams than a decade ago , or the little brother comments not that those are completely forgotten , mind you paul myerberg the aflac trivia question just popped up and jack drape said what most of america was thinking i love that duck he by the way is rooting for the spartans sorry , baltimore bob michigan mike joe drape baylor s robert griffin iii has been sacked twice today on third down , this last time on third and goal that led to a missed field goal again , key defensive plays are going to be huge in this game baylor was able to march all the way down the field , but if you can keep them out of the endzone , you re doing as much as you need to do drive stalls , field goal missed , baylor still up 73 am with some momentum now joe , do you have any tats \? say , yourself standing atop a pj clarke s hamburger \? or visa versa i wonder how the history of that player s tat will play out in relation to the rest of his life path only time will tell i d heard of trash talk , but tat talk \? apparently , a spartan defensive tackle has bicep tattoo of a spartan standing atop a wolverine the goblue faithful aren t happy joe drape the fourth down conversion is one of the biggest momentum swingers in football if the defense holds , the crowd goes nuts and so do the players if the defense gives , everybody cries well , maybe cries is too strong , but it has to be demoralizing to force a fourth down , and then have to remain on the field after a short conversion baylor just converted a fourth and one , and has really quieted this home am crowd joe , that very off the rack line has me dying over here great stuff let s get pete s attention just checked in with bob in baltimore who , next to michigan mike up at bailey s , is the biggest wolverine fan i know he didn t like the way the spartans pushed the blue around on their scoring drive but he is completely mystified why spartans don t continue to run northsouth on them he s nervous and now is is off to watch daughter pilar s soccer game he s a good dad , and is pretty sure he ll be back for at least the fourth quarter joe drape zach , you asked the right guy i am known for my highly personalized style i m siding with michigan state here the black , green and gold works and does shout look at me , like michigan s bumble bee love to hear thamel s thoughts here , though i m certain they are very off the rack joe drape lots of passing , lots of completions , lots of energy should be a decently high scoring affair in this one both offenses are moving the ball , and moving it quickly it s going to come down to which defense can make the key stops baylor just made the first key stop on third down in the red zone , holding am to a field goal baylor 7 am 3 it s the fourth consecutive game michigan has scored on its opening drive entering the game , michigan state had allowed an average of 64 rushing yards per game on the opening drive , the wolverines ran for 65 pete bigelow robert griffin iii already has two incompletions , which based on his previous performances so far this year is a lot for him and who cares , because he has nine completions , his last one for a short touchdown that gives baylor a 70 lead on the road the third and baylor strike first big momentum drive coming up for am they have to keep their crowd engaged joe , which uniform do you like best \? i think i m going with michigan st i m really excited about the oregonization of college football jerseys , and i guarantee the players are excited , too the only ones not excited are the oldtimers and pete thamel admittedly it s been a while since i ve watched the spartans and wolverines , but i really like both team s uniforms msu has deepened thre greeen and gone abstract on the trojan helmet logo against the golden dome helmet like the bumblebee accents on the wolverines shoulders joe drape michigan s first drive , which resulted in a denard robinson touchdown , almost went awry when the wolverines got a little too cute on a 3 rd and 1 play at the msu 25 and used a threeback formation instead of confusing the spartans , the wolverines confused themselves , got penalized five yards for delay of game , burned a timeout to regroup and and later needed a threeyard run on a fake field goal to sustain the drive nonetheless , michigan leads 70 pete bigelow casual fans \( and maybe even serious fans \) might think that player numbers are just something random and unimportant you get assigned your number , you wear your jersey , and if you re good enough , the bookstore might just sell thousands of your jerseys and you ll get none of the money but i digress \( i hate saying that more than i hate doing that \) numbers are important to players i m sure there were a couple fights over certain numbers single digit numbers seem to be the most popular , especially for football you see all sorts of positions wearing no 7 these days , not just qbs most coveted list 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 8 \( or just 110 \) i guess 18 is big at lsu denard robinson scrambles in for six ninth rushing touchdown last year , he had 14 joe drape baylor s first drive stalled near the half field , the drive ending with a sack on heisman candidate robert griffin the third that name is begging to be nicked i ll be referring to robert griffin iii as either rgt , or simply the third the third took one deep shot down the field during that drive that would have certainly led to a touchdown , but overthrew his receiver ever so slightly am has taken over and is marching directly down the field , big gain after big gain some good energy to this game early should be a good test for the third and company just how fired up are these guys \? i have to imagine that 0ne of the last things a player hears before taking the field for the first drive is no penalties let s start clean but game after game , you see offsides and falsestarts if you happened to watch monday night football this week , you unfortunately know what i m talking about if that game is still on your dvr , i suggest you smash it with a baseball bat deleting it won t be enough of an effort as i settle in for this day of college football and occupy my couch , i m struggling over the decision of which pregame show to watch espn obviously has their signature gameday program rolling prior to the michiganmichigan st game fx , however , has the movie black hawk down \( edited for tv , of course \) in the pregame slot i went with black hawk down it sets the \( un \) necessary battle tone
backstage can be something of an inner sanctum at a even though they are appearing on live television before millions of americans , the candidates are used to having their clubhouse hermetically sealed from the public before and after they take the stage that was not the case for the six major republican candidates who participated in on saturday night , when the network invited this reporter to roam behind the scenes as they took turns before a panel of conservative state attorneys general and the fox news host how each reacted offered an interesting reflex test of the candidates and their campaign organizations s campaign stood out by going into defensive mode immediately , insisting that the reporter stay far away the other candidates engaged to a varying degree in a little conversation as they left the stage none more than , the former house speaker , who is now ahead of mr romney in some polls mr romney , a former massachusetts governor , was the last to arrive at the fox news offices in midtown manhattan he came in with his wife , ann , and a smattering of aides and travel staff , and they quickly settled into a small conference room near the 12thfloor studio spotting the reporter , mr romney s aides sprang into action , asking where he worked and what he was doing there , and then insisting that he not physically approach mr romney before or after he was questioned on television by the attorneys general and mr huckabee the request was reiterated to executives at fox news mr romney s campaign has sought to carefully control his interactions with the news media this year as it has tried to keep a grip on frontrunner status earlier last week , it faced days of criticism over , during which he grew testy as mr baier pressed him on policy shifts he had made over the years but aides pushed back against the notion that their reaction on saturday night was related to that criticism , saying mr romney had not planned to talk to the press after spending a day with reporters in new hampshire , where he also held a questionandanswer session and gave two interviews mr gingrich , coming out of the studio after a tough round of questioning from the attorneys general , had an opposite reaction upbeat and welcoming on a day , he stopped on his way out of the studio to discuss his performance i thought it was good because you can tell that the people who become attorneys general think differently , said mr gingrich , who had also mingled with reporters and took questions from them earlier in the day they were very professional , he said of the attorneys general they were very competent , and they were willing to be pretty darn aggressive the panel was made up of pam bondi of florida , kenneth t cuccinelli ii of virginia and scott pruitt of oklahoma mr cuccinelli went so far as to ask mr gingrich , why should limitedgovernment conservatives like me trust that a president gingrich will not advance these sorts of biggovernment approaches when you are president \? was mr gingrich surprised at the questioning of his ideological bona fides \? no , he said i have a 90 percent voting record , and i'm happy to put my credentials up against the others \( an aide ended the interview when the talk turned to \) earlier , upon entering the building and walking to his holding room with his wife , callista , mr gingrich offered a handshake right behind was gov of texas , who gave a hearty hello mr perry was traveling with a number of bodyguards and aides he emerged from the studio at a fast clip , leaving little time for a question good it felt good , was all mr perry said as a bodyguard grabbed the reporter by the shoulder and pushed him back traveling with a relatively light contingent , former senator of pennsylvania engaged in a little postsession banter newt got his share of tough questions we did too , he said in an apparent shot at mr romney , he added , you did n't see a lot of questions saying , what you 're saying on the campaign is different from what your record was' i think that s the real difference representative of texas was his usual mix of affability and pep with a side of curmudgeon during his turn before the attorneys general afterward , he was far less chatty , replying with oneword answers and shrugs that made it clear he was not in the mood for a postgame interview , though he was not going to say no outright it was ok , he said , before walking back to his holding room one disclaimer representative s holding room was on another side of the studio , and she never came through the main door a spokeswoman , alice stewart , said , she enjoyed participating in the forum and would have been happy to talk about it
in the latest advance for health care accountability , the country s leading hospital accreditation board , the joint commission , released a on tuesday of 405 medical centers that have been the most diligent in following protocols to treat conditions like and almost without exception , most highly regarded hospitals in the united states , from johns hopkins in baltimore to the mayo clinic in rochester , minn , did not make the list the found that hospital performance nationwide continued to improve steadily in 2010 on a variety of measures and is now at high levels assessing more than 12 million treatment actions , like whether heart attack patients are given aspirin upon admission or surgical patients receive within an hour , the commission found that hospitals followed standards 97 percent of the time that is up from 82 percent in 2002 in addition , more than nine in 10 hospitals had composite compliance scores of at least 90 percent , more than four times the figure of nine years ago but with evidencebased ratings gaining prevalence , and a strengthening link between quality and payment , the joint commission report raised questions about how consumers should best use the data newly available to them increasingly , one component of that inquiry may be whether hospital reputations are deserved or mythologized reputation and performance on important measures of quality do not always correlate , said dr mark r chassin , the joint commission s president as an example , none of the 17 medical centers listed by us news world report on its this year are on the joint commission s list of 405 hospitals that received at least a 95 percent composite score for compliance with treatment standards about onethird of a hospital s score in the us news methodology is based on its reputation as gauged by a survey of physicians the joint commission list , at , omitted the cleveland clinic massachusetts general hospital in boston duke university medical center in durham , nc ronald reagan ucla medical center and the university of california san francisco medical center , among others it did not include a single hospital in new york city , or the most prominent centers in chicago and houston it s pretty glaring that they 're not there , said dr peter j pronovost , the senior vice president for patient safety and quality for johns hopkins medicine rather , the joint commission list of top performers included a disproportionate share of small and rural hospitals , as well as 20 veterans affairs medical centers about 14 percent of roughly 3 , 000 eligible hospitals made the cut hospital quality experts , including at large academic centers that did not make the list , did not diminish the joint commission measurements they acknowledged that because the commission focused on measures of process rather than outcomes , they could not explain away a hospital s failure to surpass the 95 percent threshold simply by pointing to a complicated mix of patients with acute conditions dr chassin pointed out in a call with reporters on wednesday that compliance should be close to 100 percent with standard procedures like vaccinating pneumonia patients for and properly removing hair before surgeries for these particular measures , said nancy e foster , vice president for quality and patient safety at the , i would not say that the difference in case mix is very relevant but hospital officials did point out that a number of wellknown medical centers did not miss the 95 percent threshold by much , and that small numbers of patients may have made a statistical difference they also said the volume of cases at busy hospitals makes complete compliance more difficult than at less busy ones and at times , they said , teaching hospitals may not follow standard procedure because they are ahead of the curve , using new therapies that are not widely accepted many advised consumers to review not only the joint commission assessments available on its , but also ratings on the federal government s , which includes outcome measurements like mortality and readmission rates to suggest that one set of ratings should undercut a hospital s reputation would be wrong , said kenneth e raske , president of the , which represents centers in the new york city region the provision of care is a very complicated business ranging over a whole host of maladies and to suggest that any one list is definitive would be a mistake but dr chassin said the criteria used by his group were the best available for gauging performance it is certainly true that larger hospitals , particularly if they are reporting on more measures than smaller hospitals , have a lot more work to do , he said , in order to make sure that every patient is treated with standard care but on the other hand , they have more resources than small hospitals to do that it may be a question of priority setting as it is , both private and government health insurers are beginning to tie hospital reimbursements to quality measures like infection rates and readmissions next year , compliance with procedural standards will become even more consequential , as the joint commission plans to withhold accreditation from any hospital that posts a composite score below 85 percent dr chassin said there were 121 hospitals that would not pass that mark based on their 2010 scores they know who they are , he said we 'll see if they have heeded the warning the point of wednesday s report , he said , is not to embarrass the laggards but to honor high achievement and encourage improvement but lisa mcgiffert , director of consumer union s safe patient project , said the commission s report carried one fundamental flaw it s only highlighting the best performers and they should be highlighting the poorest performers , ms mcgiffert said , because evidence shows that when you publicly report , it s the poorest performers that improve the most and the public wants to know which are the poorest performing hospitals so they can avoid them
istanbul thousands of people protested in two turkish cities on friday in response to the detention this week of seven journalists , a development that has prompted new expressions of concern from europe and the united states about the state of press freedom in turkey protesters in ankara and istanbul , many of them media workers , called for an end to what they called repression of turkish journalists and chanted in support of nedim sener of the newspaper milliyet , a frequent critic of the government , and ahmet sik , who is known for his reporting on human rights abuses and on what he says are illegal islamic networks operating within the turkish state pressure on journalists has reached an intolerable limit , ercan ipekci , head of the turkish journalists syndicate , said during the demonstration in central istanbul we expect democratic steps to be taken and substantial changes made to the penal code to lift away this environment of fear and pressure imposed upon journalists an umbrella group called the freedom for journalists platform organized the protests in both cities mr sener and mr sik were among seven journalists detained thursday on suspicion of belonging to a shadowy network known as ergenekon , which turkish prosecutors say has plotted to overthrow the proislamic justice and development party s government as of friday , none of the seven were known to have been charged with any crime critics argue that the socalled ergenekon investigations , which have been continuing for years , are a pretext to neutralize opponents of the government a number of other journalists have been detained in connection with ergenekon , as have politicians and current and former military personnel prime minister tayyip erdogan and other government officials have denied that the investigations are politically motivated stefan fule , the commissioner responsible for enlargement of the european union , which turkey aspires to join , issued a sharply worded statement on thursday about the detentions , which came just a few weeks after the turkish police arrested the owner of an antigovernment web site and two of his employees turkey urgently needs to amend its legal framework to improve the exercise of freedom of the press in practice and in a significant manner , mr fule said he said the european union expected turkey , as a candidate for membership , to put in place core democratic principles and enable varied , pluralistic debate in public space philip j crowley , a spokesman for the state department , also expressed concern thursday we urge that any investigations or prosecutions proceed in a transparent manner , and we will continue to engage turkey and encourage an independent , pluralistic media , mr crowley said it s critical to a healthy democracy the turkish journalists association says 61 journalists are in detention in turkey the organization reporters without borders , based in paris , ranks turkey 138th out of 178 countries on its world press freedom index
anyone who s stared long enough at a map knows the experience eventually , your eyes settle on a feature so strange that you immediately rush to the history books for the back story and nothing gets a borderwatcher going quite like a salient defined \( rather unscientifically \) as a narrow strip of territory poking out of a broader area , there are about half a dozen examples of subnational salients solely within the united states , where they re usually called panhandles 1 the purest example surely is oklahoma s long straight stick of a panhandle because it really makes the otherwise boxshaped state look like a pan examples of international salients abound , from india s eastern seven sister states , tenuously connected to the main national territory by the socalled chicken s neck 2 , to netherlandslimburg , projecting south from the dutch mainland all the way to the gates of li ge \( belgium \) and aachen \( germany \) 3 but surely the two most striking international panhandles are the wakhan corridor in central asia and the caprivi strip , in southern africa 4  both were 19thcentury british attempts to modulate the ambitions of other colonial powers \( the russian and german empires , respectively \) these great games 5 were played out in the smokefilled salons and conference rooms of europe hardly a thought was given to the locals yet these constricting borders , separating them from their surroundings on three sides , would prove very detrimental to their health and safety even if you ve never heard of it , you ve seen the wakhan corridor thousands of times \( or else you ve missed every newscast or news article in the last decade containing a map of afghanistan \) the corridor is that little funnel sticking out of the country s northeast , connecting afghanistan to china , if only slightly 6 the corridor also separates pakistan from tajikistan , and that was its original function although the separated parties then were britain and russia the corridor might seem insignificant in geopolitical terms a mere 3 , 500 square miles of stunted trees and brushwood 7 , at some locations barely 10 miles wide , tucked away in an inaccessible part of the pamir mountains , where the average elevation exceeds 17 , 000 feet , and inhabited by just over 10 , 000 subsistence farmers and herders , a mix of local wakhi and immigrant kirghiz tribespeople yet the corridor was the capstone of the british policy of containing russia , of which the creation of an afghan buffer state was an essential , if costly part 8 in the second half of the 19th century , the russian empire had been gobbling up the territories around central asian cities like tashkent , samarkand , bukhara and khoqand , and was scratching at the door of british india afghanistan , nominally independent but in reality a british protectorate , was to keep them out the hole in that strategy was situated in the pamir mountains , where any authority was local and international borders nonexistent by the end of the 19th century , it was one of the last bits of the planet where exploration and conquest could go hand in hand , as they had done so successfully elsewhere this tandem of quest for knowledge and thirst for power explains why zorkul 9 , a lake on the border between the corridor and tajikistan , was once known to the british as lake victoria still the name of africa s largest lake the catalyst for the ultimate shape of wakhan s destiny was a chance meeting in 1891 between the british military explorer francis younghusband and his russian counterpart , a colonel yanov , at the village of bozaigumbaz , inside the presentday corridor cordial enough on a personal level \( they dined and drank vodka together \) , the meeting ended with yanov expelling younghusband from the area , as it was russian territory russia later apologized , as this claim went against an earlier agreement assigning wakhan to afghanistan to the british , though , this was symptomatic of russia s nibbling at afghanistan s northern frontier , which had already cost the local emir the oasis of panjdeh 10  in 1895 , russia and britain set up a pamir boundary commission , which settled the northern and southern borders of the corridor tellingly , neither afghanistan nor china were directly involved 11 the emir of the day even vented his displeasure at being saddled with the kirghiz bandits in the wakhan , having enough trouble with his own people the border was merely meant to separate two superpowers , but ended up having a devastating effect on the local population some kirghiz tribespeople , fleeing first into the wakhan from soviet collectivization and then from the wakhan when communists took over kabul in 1979 , reached pakistan , only to be resettled by turkey in kurdistan 12 today the region remains largely inaccessible from and ungoverned by kabul much less than a corridor , the wakhan is a dead end for its people , who often must migrate to cities and mines far beyond their home on the roof of the world to scrape together a living the inhabitants of namibia s caprivi strip are victims of a similar eccentricity the strip is a vermontsized eastern extension into africa s wet interior of namibia , a country that is basically one giant desert twice the size of california it owes its existence \( and the decidedly unafrican name of the settlement of schuckmannsburg , near its eastern edge \) to the germans it is easy to forget that while the british , french , belgians and italians controlled the bulk of the african colonies , the germans had a sizable claim of their own germany entered the scramble for africa when the party was already in full swing , but still managed to secure some bits , among others in southwestafrica 13 and east africa 14 in the 1890 zanzibarheligoland treaty , germany and britain agreed to swap two islands thousands of miles apart the germans gave up zanzibar , and gained heligoland , a tiny north sea island strategically placed near the major german harbors of bremen and hamburg included in the deal , negotiated during the chancellorship of bismarck s successor , leo von caprivi 15 , was the strip , which would connect southwestafrica to the zambezi river , and thence to the coast , and thus to german east africa where wakhan was meant to interdict russian traffic , caprivi s purpose was to facilitate german commerce unfortunately or was this known to perfidious albion \? the zambezi turned out to be nonnavigable about 40 miles east of the caprivi strip s easternmost point , the river is punctuated by the roar of the victoria falls , the world s largest waterfall germany thereafter had little use for the strip , distant even when not wholly inaccessible during the rainy season , and considered swapping it with the british for some other territory following a disappointing mineralfinding expedition to the territory in 1909 , the fantastically named german captain kurt streitwolf proposed exchanging caprivi for the british colonial exclave of walvis bay , the only deep water port on the southwestafrican coast but those negotiations ended abruptly when britain transferred walvis bay to the cape colony in 1910 henceforth , the strip would remain an afterthought for the german and subsequent south african administrations of namibia the caprivi strip , bounded by no less than four rivers 16 , is namibia s wettest spot , and in the best of all possible worlds , this lush land would literally be the rich and fruitful riviera of an otherwise exceedingly arid land but the close to 100 , 000 caprivians feel they have no cause to congratulate themselves on their peculiar geopolitical situation the narrow borders , imposed by foreign powers over a century ago , together with cultural and geographical distance to the rest of the country , have helped forge a separate caprivian identity starting in 1962 , the caprivi african national union fought alongside the national liberation movement swapo against south african occupation after independence in 1990 , however , a new caprivi liberation army agitated for independence from namibia the secessionists were defeated and its leader went into exile to denmark not that far from heligoland as an aside , the protrusion of the caprivi strip all the way to the confluence of the chobe and zambezi rivers has created a tantalizing conundrum for border spotters is there or isn t there a quadripoint in the river \? a quadripoint is a point where four borders meet though some international and many subnational quadripoints exist , none involve four countries except , maybe , this one if it exists , namibia , zambia , zimbabwe and botswana touch at a single point in the river the other option is the existence of two tripoints , located about 300 feet apart , the western one being where namibia , zambia and botswana touch , the eastern one where zimbabwe , zambia and botswana touch the kazungula ferry , connecting botswana and zambia , operates under this assumption \( and across this 300feet stretch of botswanazambia border \) this may sound like cartographic trivia , but bullets are involved advocates of the quadripartite border arrangement have resorted to violence , including the sinking of a ferry by the rhodesian army 17 the issue , though less volatile , remains unresolved which goes to show that panhandles don t just solve geopolitical problems , they can just as easily become one themselves frank jacobs is a londonbased author and blogger he writes about cartography , but only the interesting bits 1 west virginia has two panhandles , a northern and eastern one the latter borders maryland s panhandle , projecting west florida , idaho and alaska also have easily recognizable panhandles i would suggest that the texas and nebraska panhandles are too broad to be labeled as such an alternative term for a protrusion that is boxy rather than pointy is provided by the missouri bootheel , which juts south , and thus has the added advantage of directional correctness i doubt that texans or nebraskans would like a bootheel to be sticking out of their states north and west , respectively so panhandle it is 2 officially the siliguri corridor , this is india at its narrowest only 14 miles separate nepal to the north from bangladesh to the south it is india s only land route to its seven easternmost states , which have a total population of about 40 million 3 roughly twothirds of the way down between its northern and southern extremities , netherlandslimburg is barely three miles across , almost pinched in half by belgium \( to the west \) and germany \( to the east \) this is germany s westernmost point , marked by a border stone and a plaque 4 much of the information for this article comes from borderlines and borderlands , edited by alexander c diener and joshua hagen , which describes political oddities at the edge of the nationstate , and devotes a chapter each to caprivi and wakhan 5 the term applies first and foremost to the russobritish tugofwar in central asia , which lasted for most of the 19th

more video game than parlor game tournament of shadows 6 the afghanchinese border is only about 50 miles long , across virtually impassable terrain at very high altitude 7 according to sir aurel stein

disastrously for britain of its 16 , 000strong contingent abandoning kabul , only a single briton , dr william brydon , reached jalalabad alive the second angloafghan war , from 1878 to 1880 , saw the establishment of a client regime in kabul , with london dictating the emir s foreign policy 9 marco polo mentions this lake , and indeed the country of vokhan in book 1 , chapter 32 of his travels  10 halfway between merv and herat , conquered by the russians in 1885 11 the afghanchinese border would only be demarcated in 1964 12 an area with its own border issues , of which we will speak later 13

for a coach who has led the to the , claude julien does not get much respect throughout the playoffs , bruins fans have complained about his handling of a power play that has converted only 82 percent of its postseason advantages they have also criticized his seeming reluctance to play the highly regarded rookie forward tyler seguin his insistence on playing the often disappointing defenseman tomas kaberle the timeout he did not use when the tampa bay lightning rallied for three quick goals on the way to a game 4 victory in the eastern conference finals even his phlegmatic tone in news conferences but julien has accomplished some remarkable things during the bruins' run to wednesday s opening game of the finals against the in vancouver his tactical adjustments in turned out to be pivotal in a 10 victory when the guys in the dressing room believe in what we 're doing and they endorse it , you get some of the success we 've been getting lately , julien said before the team left boston on monday and the success we 've been getting lately is making people happy so , at the end of the day , it s all about winning , right \? perhaps , but bruins fans can be a sarcastic lot as they flooded memorial day radio callin shows with jokes like what do tomas kaberle and cape traffic have in common \? they 're both awful ! and they certainly have had reason to question julien , given his checkered coaching past last year his bruins lost in the second round to the philadelphia flyers after holding a threegamestonone series advantage and a 30 lead at home in game 7 the year before , boston was bounced from the second round by the carolina hurricanes with an overtime loss in another game 7 at home was fired from his two previous nhl jobs , starting with a 159game , sub500 stint with the montreal canadiens that ended in 2006 in 20067 , he coached the devils to second place in the east , but on the eve of the playoffs and took over because , he said , i did not feel that we were going in the right direction , both mentally and hockeywise julien may have been on the verge of being fired again this spring , when the bruins surrendered a late goal to montreal and went to overtime at home in game 7 of the opening round of the playoffs but nathan horton s overtime goal in that game put the bruins on the path to the finals and julien s tactics in game 7 against tampa bay was the last big step horton scored the lone goal in the third period of that 10 victory after defenseman andrew ference passed the puck to forward david krejci , who carried it over the tampa bay blue line that was the result of an adjustment by julien , perceived to be conservative and unimaginative , that reflected his ability to adapt in previous games , boston had dumped the puck into the corner on entries or tried to send it hard around the boards rimming , as it is known but in the innovative 131 formation used by tampa bay coach guy boucher , the lightning s deep defenseman would get to the puck first we drove the net , we did what we were supposed to do , julien said it was n't always about rimming the puck in our guys chose a real good time to make that pass and walk it in bruins general manager peter chiarelli said , they made a lot of adjustments to address that 131 , and ultimately it resulted in a goal to win the series also in game 7 , the bruins shut down tampa bay s highpowered forwards with zdeno chara and dennis seidenberg , a defense pairing devised by julien during the first round julien was criticized for continuing to play the highly respected but increasingly unproductive 43yearold forward mark recchi but in game 7 he limited recchi s ice time and increased that of chris kelly and rich peverley , fourthliners who are strong on faceoffs having prevailed this spring in coaching duels with boucher , philadelphia s peter laviolette and montreal s jacques martin , julien enters the finals duel against vancouver s alain vigneault julien and are old friends they are from the ottawa area , spent their early 20s as defensemen in the st louis blues system and were teammates on the 198182 salt lake golden eagles we talk all the time during the season and we see each other often in the summer we 're good friends , julien said i guess all i can say is , may the best man win and despite all the criticism , there is a good chance julien may wind up being that man
tokyo s list of casualties , already long , could soon include two of the country s iconic brands sushi and kobe beef the japanese health ministry said saturday that it had detected elevated levels of radiation in spinach and milk at farms up to 90 miles from japan s crippled nuclear reactors the ministry did not make reference to any contaminated farm animals , seafood or fishing grounds in japan and no food exports from japan have failed quality tests being done by other countries but even the perception of contamination , one japanese agriculture expert said , could cause longlasting brand damage , especially if there was evidence of radiation spreading across japan if the accident becomes bigger , like chernobyl , it will damage all the brands and people wo n't buy any of it , even if it s safe , said hiroshi uchida , a former professor of agricultural science , speaking of kobe , sendai and other brands of highpriced , topquality japanese beef even though the government has n't mentioned the possibility of contamination of beef , we should start testing to convince people the beef is safe trevor corson , a sushi expert and a former commercial fisherman who used to live in japan , said seafood caught in an ocean churning with movement and dispersal might turn out to be less of a concern than agricultural products that are exposed and stationary but mr corson also said the japanese seafood industry could face a long and difficult struggle to establish faith in the safety of their seafood not unlike the challenges faced by gulf fishermen in the us after the bp  the tsukiji fish market in central tokyo , the world s largest clearinghouse for just about anything that fishermen pull from the sea , was not physically damaged by the earthquake its cobblestone aisles and alleyways were as loud , profane and hurlyburly as ever on saturday but something in tsukiji s soul seems to have been lost , or at least badly bruised , in the tsunami before the disaster , the market drew 10 percent of its daily inventory of 2 , 400 tons of seafood from the waters off tohoku , the coastal epicenter of the earthquake the fishery there is renowned for its scallops , seaweed , bonito and shark s fin tohoku , as a place and a brand in japan , was formidable it s not like the brand is just damaged now it s over , said a glum tsutomu kosaka , the general manager at tsukiji at least for now , the brand is finished gone it s hopeless mr kosaka said saturday that neither the health ministry nor city inspectors had tested any seafood in the tsukiji market the last time there were radiation tests of seafood in tokyo , he said , was in 1954 , after a japanese tuna boat was contaminated by fallout from an american atomic test on bikini atoll in the marshall islands mr kosaka s hopelessness , for now , stems more from the outright destruction of fishing facilities in the north than from a possible poisoning of the fishery in towns and ports all along the coast , docks and jetties have vanished into splinters boats and trawlers are smashed or sunk nets and tackle , gone offshore fish farms and onshore processing factories , gone among the victims was ojika , a 100yearold whaling port that had just two boats left from its once mighty fleet a sushi chef at a restaurant near the fish market said the tsunami and its plundering of tohoku had also been disastrous for his business scallops , sardines and oysters from tohoku , none of that is available now , said tomohito narasaki , 27 , a chef at sushizanmai he said millions of dollars' worth of bluefin tuna , red snapper and yellowtail farmed off tohoku was instantly destroyed japanese consumers certainly prize the domestic seafood products that go into their premium sushi dishes , but they also eat plenty of nonjapanese products in their sushi as do consumers around the globe now that sushi is eaten worldwide , it is also sourced worldwide wholesalers , distributors , restaurant owners and chefs search everywhere for quality fish i have started to hear people in the west worrying about radioactive sushi and so on , but perception and reality are quite different , said mr corson , the author of the story of sushi much of the seafood typically used in sushi does n't originate in japan and never passes through the country producers of kobe and other top brands of japanese beef said saturday that they had not yet tested their prized cattle , which can cost upward of 50 , 000 each nor had they tested the special feed they use ranchers with operations far from the damaged reactors scoffed at the notion that their cows might be contaminated distance is in their favor , they said , pointing out that kobe is 360 miles southwest of the damaged reactor complex i do n't need any tests , said kazunori ikeda , director of the wagyu registry association , the oversight body for all wagyu cattle , including black wagyu , the strain from which kobe beef comes we 're not afraid of contamination because kobe is so far from fukushima i'm sure all cattlemen in japan feel the same way i'm confident certified kobe beef produced in japan is not exported , the certification group said , so foreign consumers will not be affected kobe cattle , like the other leading brands here , have strict requirements for certification only 3 , 000 head per year make the kobe grade a fiveounce sirloin at the ekki bar and grill in tokyo currently goes for 12 , 000 yen , about 150 japan s other brands of premium beef include sendai , ohmi , matsuzaka and yonezawa we ca n't feed our cows anymore because of the shortages of feed and water , said masaru takahashi , manager of the ja cooperative in hardhit furukawa , which raises sendai beef we have only 20 percent of the feed we need i ca n't imagine what effect this is going to have on our herd sendai cattlemen had just started to export their beef to hong kong and macao , and had drafted plans to start shipping to the united states that project is now delayed as the ranchers await word on further radiation tests the government said friday that it would test meat for cesium , plutonium and uranium , but gave no timetable mr takahashi said he was worried about the public s perception of beef cattle if tests showed any further spread of radiation if the rumors grow , he said , i'm not confident that anyone will buy our beef , even if it s the highest quality and even if it s safe
wimbledon , england james blake of the united states walked with his head down , deep in thought , or , perhaps , in early despair his serve had been broken in the first game of the match by marcos baghdatis of cyprus was it an omen or an anomaly \? both men hoped for redemption here , and baghdatis got it , winning 64 , 62 , 67 \( 5 \) , 46 , 64 to reach the second round of the 125th wimbledon championships on tuesday reviving his play , refusing to yield , and relying on power shots and dogged retrievals that finally broke baghdatis s edge , blake wore down his opponent over the third and fourth sets and seemed on the verge of a comeback victory a key moment came when blake broke baghdatis in the first game of the final set , only the third time in the match when the american converted a break point as shadows lengthened and made stark pools of darkness on the court , blake kept the pressure on , racing to net and forcing baghdatis into errors on one winning backhand volley by blake , the ball dropped into the pool of darkness and vanished bahgdatis , seeded 32nd , refused to yield , however , breaking back to tie the set , 33 , then holding his serve to go up , 43 suddenly revived , baghdatis won his serve again to lead , 54 when blake sent a backhand long , he opened the door his backhand missed the sideline to give baghdatis three match points he won the first and raised his arms in victory blake , 31 , who lives in tampa , fla , ranked fourth in the world five years ago but injuries , surgery and uncertainty about retirement had sent his results down and his ranking with it , to 102nd baghdatis , 26 , had seen better days , too he ranked eighth in the world five years ago when he reached the final of the australian open now 30th , he injured a shoulder in october , just after beating roger federer at indian wells , and rafael nadal in cincinnati when baghdatis broke blake s serve for a second time , at 11 in the second set , the possibility arose that the match might slide beyond blake s reach by just a point here and a point there he had , after all , lost his serve twice by surrendering just two of three break points but baghdatis took apart blake s serve a third time and forged a 41 lead in the second set blake seemed rooted to his positions , watching baghdatis bend his knees and flip back a deep service return , sending it into the corner blake didn t move until the ball was about to bounce , far too late that set slipped away on an ace by baghdatis that won the final point and gave him a twosetstonone lead at this stage , the difference was baghdatis s ability to return serve he won 27 points while blake was serving blake won only 12 points when baghdatis served the crowd on court 18 , which had numbered nearly 800 , began to thin out when baghdatis broke blake s serve to begin the third set eleven minutes into the set , blake was looking down again , this time at the wrapper of a power bar he was about to bite into baghdatis had broken him a fourth time and blake had still only glimpsed a single break point on baghdatis s serve he got another glimpse at 21 baghdatis saved one with an adroit wrongfooting of the american but that was one too few he lost the next on a flawed backhand that fell into the net after 65 minutes of mounting frustration , blake had finally broken serve and quickly won his own he was leading for the first time in the match , 32 he led , too , at 43 , and 54 and 65 there seemed more fire in blake now , an electricity that he hadn t shown for much of the 82 minutes he d so far spent on court serving at 55 , blake had flubbed a backhand halfvolley , but recovered , aced baghdatis to go up , 4030 , then forced him to hit a backhand service return into the net the match began to feel competitive in the tiebreaker that followed , baghdatis clubbed a forehand long to yield a minibreak serving at 23 , he slammed a twohanded backhand over the line and fell further behind , 24 blake hit an unreturnable serve and led 52 , then 62 , when baghdatis blew a forehand long serving for the set at 65 , blake hit another unreturnable serve and walked to his seat for the changeover looking straight ahead no bowed head now a more positive posture and good results for the american blake broke baghdatis s serve to start the fourth set with a ringing forehand down the line , skipping beyond baghdatis s reach a moment later , however , blake was forced to face down a break point on his serve he won it , but sent a forehand long and found himself in a kind of trench warfare , each man losing and winning and losing blake held on and won , taking a 20 lead now it was competitive blake broke baghdatis and took a 53 lead as the match momentum shifted to the american he won his serve at 4015 and strode quickly to his chair , head up and ready for a fifth and final set the seats were filling back up the show was suddenly sold out again for good reason
cairo arab leaders , meeting for the first time since the public revolt in toppled its autocratic president , heard one of their own , a consummate insider , warn that the arab soul is broken by poverty , unemployment and general recession , the secretary general of the arab league and a former foreign minister in egypt , opened an economic summit meeting in the red sea resort of sharm el sheik with a sobering assessment not just of circumstances in the tumultuous north african nation of tunisia , but across a region that stretches from morocco through the persian gulf the tunisian revolution is not far from us , mr moussa said wednesday in his opening , despite the efforts of egyptian organizers to avoid discussion of tunisia the arab citizen entered an unprecedented state of anger and frustration this is a second economic summit meeting , a followup to and intended to encourage arab leaders to set aside political differences to address the social and economic problems plaguing their societies but like the kuwait summit meeting , held during the israeli invasion of gaza , this gathering was overshadowed by a crisis that also seemed to underscore the impotence of such gatherings , rather than the collective strength of the region , political analysts said arab politics , arab policies , arab administration , arab bureaucracy has been too stagnant , said shafeeq ghabra , a political science professor at kuwait university it will produce some results , but none of the results produced will be enough to deal with the level of desperation engulfing the arab world and the arab peoples it will be too little , too late several participants also noted that none of the initiatives agreed to during the last meeting in kuwait had yet been put in place that is often the case with arab summit meetings , where bold talk is followed up with inaction but this time , in the shadow of the tunisian uprising that forced from office one of their own , president zine elabidine ben ali , there was at least talk of following through on promises the summit members agreed to a 2 billion program to help create jobs and bolster the weakest economies the job creation program was first discussed at the last meeting in kuwait the participants also emphasized the need to help expand and empower the private sector this discussion , of jobs and youth and poverty , appeared to reflect a significant change in the meeting s agenda to reflect the anxiety the leadership felt in the wake of the tunisian revolt before the meeting , the egyptian foreign ministry sent out a statement identifying the three top issues on the agenda which did not include unemployment or poverty eradication instead it focused more on specific projects and regional cooperation hisham kassem , an egyptian newspaper publisher and longtime human rights advocate , said of the arab leaders , they are definitely scared , but it s typical how they always try to use these summits in order to secure their regimes as opposed to develop their countries mr kassem added , it is definitely a wakeup call , and they 're definitely terrified and they 're finally grasping the egyptian foreign minister , ahmed aboul gheit , tried over the days leading up to the summit meeting to steer attention away from tunisia , insisting that the gathering was not about politics , but economics but that effort was complicated in egypt because in the course of two days , three men imitated the selfimmolation that set off the riots in tunisia , forcing comparison between conditions in the two countries a fourth man intent on selfimmolation was stopped by security forces on tuesday yet it seemed clear even before the first participant arrived that it was not possible to hold an economic summit meeting in the shadow of the tunisia affair without noting the connection between politics , economics , and the overthrow of a president secretary of state hillary rodham clinton foreshadowed that theme when she arab leaders a week earlier in doha , qatar , and warned that in too many places , in too many ways , the region s foundations are sinking into the sand mr moussa s opening remarks suggested that the arab leadership or at least some of that leadership concluded that the greatest threat to their ability to retain power was economic development , opportunity and jobs president hosni mubarak of egypt tailored his remarks to address the anger and despair in his nation with flowery prose the arab youth are our most valuable possession from wealth and resources , they represent more than 25 percent of our populations , and through their ideas and dreams we make the future of our nation and make its marks and build its foundations , he said in remarks broadcast around egypt on state television but summit meetings are notorious for exactly those kinds of pronouncements , political analysts said , which tend to spread cynicism rather than calm i think arab leadership is shocked and is trying to come to grips with what has happened , said mr ghabra , from kuwait authoritarianism is the mode by which arab regimes have dealt with the arab people today , as a result of the tunisian rebellion , the wall of fear in the arab populations has been broken and has been penetrated for the first time in decades but while that message appears to have gotten through to the region s leaders , egypt s foreign minister , mr gheit , suggested that he , at least , did not accept the assessment of economic crisis in a curious statement for the egyptian foreign minister , he first told a reporter that he should travel to the persian gulf to see how arab countries are developing but then he added a lot of times we criticize ourselves and say there is failure and there is a lack of opportunities but there is also success , and progress for example in egypt , there are 60 million people who use cellphones i do n't think we can say a society that has 60 out of 80 million people using cellphones can be called a failed and incapable society
long beach , ny in crisp , overhead barrels , the quiksilver pro new york competition concluded friday with a display of performance surfing that highlighted both the past and the immediate future of the sport the 21yearold australian owen wright surfed his way through three heats to claim his first victory and the biggest prize check in pro surfing history 300 , 000 for much of the day , and much of the world tour event , kelly slater looked as if he would pick up his third victory of the season doing some of the best surfing of his life , slater , a 39yearold 10time world champion , had dispatched the most dangerous surfers in round after round , culminating with a perfect 10 points in a semifinal ride in which he landed an improbably large aerial afterward , he threw his hands up to the crowd in a rare show of emotion but before he could fully celebrate , he had to face the lanky upstart wright the crowd of a thousand or so spectators that had gathered by 8 am grew to tens of thousands by the noon final after a week of conjecture , debate and fingercrossing , the last of hurricane katia s waves found their way to long beach s offshore sandbars , producing groomed , headhigh tubes slater and wright had met just two weeks before in the final of the billabong pro teahupoo , with slater winning in 12foot surf but wright got his revenge in the  wright scored a 70 out of 10 on his first wave just a few minutes later , he nabbed one of his highestscoring waves of the contest , a speedy wall on which he bent his sinuous 6foot3 frame into a series of powerful hacks and floaters and an aerial it was good for a 923 but working himself out of a competitive hole is something of a specialty for slater , who is known to unleash his most impressive outbursts in the final minutes of a heat he had won that way in his two previous heats , beating josh kerr and taj burrow riding an experimental fivefin board , he mounted a comeback against wright , uncorking a series of his patently agile maneuvers but in the end slater had only a wavecombination score of 1490 and a broken board to hold up to wright s 1790 kelly s been a huge inspiration to me , wright said i 've learned so much from him and will continue to , so it s an honor to have this experience with him after the champagne had been sprayed and wright had hoisted his statue of libertyinspired trophy , slater stopped to offer a compliment i think the wind better suited his forehand surfing , he said but in the end he just surfed really great he s probably the most wellrounded guy on tour wright , who is from a rural part of new south wales , was fast to praise long beach s waves these are aplus conditions out here , he said the first day , the waves were a little small for someone my size , but today was just perfect this wave reminds me of one of my favorite point waves back home rod brooks , the contest director for quiksilver , the event s main sponsor , said we had a feeling that long beach could deliver we really took a big gamble coming here and it paid off for none more than wright
the 2011 college cup , for many , will be a weekend filled with firsts the women s soccer ncaa semifinal games take place friday evening at the kennesaw state university soccer stadium in kennesaw , ga and though the field is filled with the traditionally successful soccer programs , none of the four remaining teams has yet won a national championship that will change on sunday , when one of the four no 1 seeds in the tournament wins the title the winners of friday s game will play at 1 pm sunday in the national final florida state \( 1861 \) vs stanford \( 2301 \) , 5 pm , friday the weekend s first matchup features two experienced sides that have both endured more than their fair share of heartbreak on college soccer s grandest stage florida state and stanford both have impressive records in the ncaa tournament in years past , with nine trips to the college cup between the two programs , but each has a losing record overall the seminoles last appearance was in 2007 , when florida state made it to the final but fell 20 to southern california stanford , meanwhile , is playing in its fourth consecutive college cup , but lost in each of the last two national championship games florida state s hallmark for years has been its team speed and athleticism , and the 2011 edition of coach mark krikorian s squad is no different stanford s defense will be tested by standout striker tiffany mccarty , the accoffensive player of the year in 2009 who missed the entirety of the 2010 season to a knee injury , and senior midfielder janice cayman the pair has combined to score 25 of florida state s 55 goals this year , and mccarty ranks second in the acc in points \( 42 \) , goals \( 18 \) and goals per game \( 72 \) florida state enters friday s game playing its best stretch of soccer all season long after a midseason lull that saw the seminoles succumb to the rigors of the acc college soccer s most competitive conference with seven nationally ranked teams florida state has reeled off nine wins in its last 10 games , including a victory in the acc tournament final over wake forest stanford comes to kennesaw as the nation s lone undefeated team , with a scoreless draw in an away game against maryland in august as the only blemish on what has thus far been a storybook season the cardinal feature two of the nation s best players in striker lindsey taylor and midfielder teresa noyola , and are anchored by an excellent defense that has allowed just nine goals all season none of this is new to stanford head coach paul ratcliffe , who has guided the cardinal to a 742 winning percentage over the course of his nine seasons in palo alto his players have garnered nearly every award available to them this season the cardinal had eight players selected to the allpac12 first team but ratcliffe s program has yet to end the season with a victory stanford may suffer from playing a softer schedule than any of the other three semifinalists , an unfortunate consequence of playing in the pac12 regardless , stanford plays this weekend as the favorite to win and the cardinal will be expected to win the program s first national championship wake forest \( 1834 \) vs duke \( 2131 \) , 7 30 pm , friday if stanford and florida state represent the nation s old guard , wake forest and duke are the young guns likely the acc s two strongest teams this season , the blue devils and demon deacons are loaded with young , albeit inexperienced , talent wake forest will meet duke for the third time this season friday , having split the two previous matchups in october , the blue devils visited winstonsalem and dismantled the demon deacons , who played without star forward katie stengel , who was out due to injury two weeks later in the acc tournament semifinal , a fullstrength wake forest squad exacted revenge on duke , going up two goals and holding off a furious charge by the blue devils for a 21 win wake forest coach tony da luz described that victory as a final fourtype of game , and he ll be hoping that his team can replicate the performance friday , when the stakes are much higher the demon deacons rely on what may be the best attacking duo left in the ncaa tournament in sophomores katie stengel and rachel nuzzolese , who have scored 19 and 11 goals this season , respectively duke has enjoyed a dominant year in the acc , cruising to the regular season title behind a stifling defense and multifaceted attack the blue devils possess the best offense of any team remaining , and scored more goals than any other team in the ncaa tournament \( 10 \) , except for oklahoma state duke is led by freshman kelly cobb , a sensational center forward who commands double marking by opposing defenses though cobb has only managed to score once in the tournament , her presence on the field allocates space for the rest of duke s attackers , and attacking midfielder kaitlyn kerr has flourished as a result , scoring five goals in the last four games with a team featuring a heavy mix of juniors and sophomores , perhaps the biggest challenge for the blue devils will be to play confident and focused soccer from the opening whistle friday against quarterfinal opponent long beach state , duke played an uncharacteristically nervous brand of soccer for the opening 45 minutes before establishing its dominance over the panthers in the second half that was with a college cup spot on the line , but the pressure will be even greater in kennesaw , and the blue devils cannot afford to start slowly against the opportunistic demon deacons nicholas schwartz is the managing editor of the chronicle , the independent student daily at duke university
moscow a couple of months ago one of russia s elder statesmen set out on a paradoxical mission to rehabilitate one of the most beloved figures in russian history , tolstoy this would have seemed unnecessary in 2010 , a century after the author s death but last year russians wrestled over tolstoy much as they did when he was alive intellectuals accused the russian orthodox church of blacklisting a national hero the church accused tolstoy of helping speed the rise of the bolsheviks the melodrama of his last days , when he fled his family estate to take up the life of an ascetic , was revived in all its pulpy detail , like some kind of earlystage reality television and in a country that rarely passes up a public celebration , the anniversary of his death , on nov 20 , 1910 , was not commemorated by noisy galas or governmentfinanced cinematic blockbusters officially speaking , it was barely noted at all with this in mind sergei v stepashin , a former prime minister here , sat down to write to the head of the russian orthodox church , which has become an arbiter of politics and culture in painstakingly diplomatic language , acknowledging the particular sensitivity of this delicate theme , mr stepashin asked forgiveness on behalf of tolstoy , who was excommunicated 110 years ago the impulse had swelled up during a lonely visit to an unmarked mound of earth where tolstoy is buried mr stepashin described the visit made while he was director of the federal security service , successor to the kgb as an emotional experience that he has never been able to shake off you look at the house where he lived and worked , where he created his works , and then you come to a place where there is nothing but this small hill , said mr stepashin , who has close ties to the church it was puzzling , on a human and a moral plane and then i decided to write this letter ambivalence toward tolstoy is new in russia the soviets planted him at the top of their literary pantheon , largely because of the radical philosophy he preached amid the early rumblings of the october revolution the publication of war and peace and anna karenina made tolstoy so famous that one contemporary described him as russia s second czar he used that position to rail against the church , as well as the police , the army , meat eating , private property and all forms of violence lenin loved tolstoy s pentup hatred he anointed him the mirror of the russian revolution , ignoring his pacifism and belief in god as the 50th anniversary of his death approached , the central committee of the communist party began preparing two years in advance , so a monument would be ready for unveiling for the centennial , in a russia wary of utopian thought , there was nothing of the kind by contrast , chekhov received lavish official tributes in 2010 for his 150th birthday , including a birthplace visit from president dmitri a medvedev though a starstudded tolstoy biopic , the last station , opened in moscow just ahead of the anniversary , it was filmed in germany , acted by britons and directed by an american the russian filmmaker andrei s konchalovsky , a producer of the film , said he petitioned every ministry in the russian government for support in the end , he said , he was forced to invest his own money i represent russia , he said , with a wry smile , while promoting the film none of this came as a surprise to vladimir i tolstoy , tolstoy s greatgreatgrandson , who oversees the museum at yasnaya polyana , the author s estate mr tolstoy , 48 , has the slender , avid look of a professional intellectual , but his last name has called on him to wade into politics he worked on one of prime minister vladimir v putin s presidential campaigns and does favors for area officials when they need the authority or prestige of tolstoy , as he put it ten years ago he asked the church to revisit the 1901 ruling that excommunicated his greatgreatgrandfather he received no answer though his efforts have not ended a visitor to yasnaya polyana recalled a banquet table laid out in the orchard for the local bishop mr tolstoy said he was not hopeful aside from a reception held by the minister of culture , the anniversary transpired with a conscious ignoring of tolstoy , he said any power tries to adapt great people to its needs , he added the current authorities do n't adapt him , or they are not clever enough maybe they are so selfconfident they do n't think they need to it was a relief when mr stepashin joined the effort the men met about 15 years ago , when mr stepashin , then director of the federal security service , presented mr tolstoy with sheaves of family letters pulled out of soviet intelligence files mr stepashin , who recalls staying up two nights as a 10yearold so that he could finish tolstoy s novel resurrection , shared the sense that the writer was getting short shrift i understood that there would not likely be a decision to return him to the church , said mr stepashin , now president of the russian book union but as for the attitude to him as a person , as a person who did a lot for russian culture and for the russian language , i just counted on that , on a change of attitude toward him the church s letter of response , published in a staterun newspaper , rossiyskaya gazeta , suggested not it acknowledged tolstoy s unforgettable , beautiful works , and said russian orthodox readers were allowed to say solitary prayers for him on the anniversary of his death but its tone was mournful , calling tolstoy the most tragic personality in the history of russian literature it said that tolstoy purposely used his great talent to destroy russia s traditional spiritual and social order and that it was no accident that the leader of the bolsheviks extremely valued the aim of leo tolstoy s activity so there could be no candles burned for tolstoy inside orthodox churches and no commemorations read , according to the letter , signed by the cultural council secretary to patriarch kirill i , the church s leader mr stepashin said he expected this response and was glad the letter included some praise but intellectuals did not hide their astonishment it s as if in the 20th century the church did not survive persecution that made tolstoy s criticisms look like childish prattle , wrote the literary critic pavel v basinsky , whose new book examines tolstoy s final days it s as if we have found ourselves in the situation that we were in at the beginning of the last century and , as in the last century , much of the discussion surrounding the tolstoy centennial was akin to gossip mr basinsky s book is part of a wave of new works that , like the film the last station , plunge into tolstoy s flight from the family estate the moment when he seemed finally to choose his radical ideas over the aristocratic comforts of home he died a few days later at a train station , surrounded by throngs of reporters at the time of tolstoy s death , russian pundits cast his decision as a spiritual triumph , but the new works retell it as a family tragedy , said william nickell , author of the death of tolstoy from this perspective , tolstoy s wife is a sympathetic figure , his followers are manipulative parasites and his ideas are hopelessly utopian it is as if he is lumped now with communism , mr nickell said good idea in principle , but a disaster in practice photos leo tolstoy \( 18281910 \) , above , remains excommunicated by the russian orthodox church below , vladimir i tolstoy , his greatgreat grandson , at the author s estate , now a museum \( photographs by hulton archive getty images james hill for the new york times \) \( a3 \)

they had no home runs , just timely singles and sacrifice flies there was no eyepopping defensive wizardry , just crisp plays executed in key situations there was no dominant pitching performance , just a gutsy one and that was just what the needed a day after one of their sloppiest losses of the season , the yankees bounced back saturday afternoon and did all of the little things necessary to produce one of their most satisfying games of the season , over the in front of 42 , 460 fans at yankee stadium i love it when guys play hard and you do n't take anything for granted , manager joe girardi said we did a lot of nice little things today , and that s why we won the yankees , who seemed to forget their fundamentals in a 53 loss friday to the blue jays , could have run a clinic saturday setting the tone for the yankees was their starter , , who persevered through six innings without his best stuff and earned his fourth win he allowed four runs and nine hits , struck out four and walked none burnett said that his curveball in particular was giving him trouble in the past , he said , that would have frustrated him but this season , he has tried to maintain a more positive outlook i did n't feel real good all day , he said i just did n't have a hook today , and my fastball was kind of flat he added , but you still got to figure out a way to go deep in games burnett was aided by a scrappy , smallball performance from an offense best known for its baseclearing blasts seven yankees had a hit , five had a run batted in , and five scored the yankees' only extrabase hit was mark teixeira s double in the first inning i do n't care whether we get them by homers or bunts or whatever , walks , either way , man , we feel good , nick swisher said blue jays starter kyle drabek , a promising 23yearold righthander , could not control his fastball , and the yankees allowed him to unravel , using a patient approach to chase him after two and a third innings i'm sure he had some frustrations out there with his command and also the strike zone , blue jays manager john farrell said but the difference in the game was all the walks drabek allowed five runs , seven hits and four walks of his 78 pitches , only 40 were strikes our guys were patient , girardi said we took our walks when he gave them to us , and we got some big hits when we needed them the yankees' offense began to sputter against the blue jays' bullpen they did not have a hit or score a run after the third inning but as the blue jays looked to mount a comeback , the yankees' defense and bullpen made sure the victory did not slip away the key defensive play came in the bottom of the sixth , after the blue jays had clawed to a run behind as juan rivera tried to steal third , burnett struck out edwin encarnacion and russell martin fired a throw to eric chavez he tagged rivera to complete the double play , end the inning and preserve the yankees' slim lead that s a big play , burnett said russ is pretty quick back there , and i was actually able to make a pitch joba chamberlain , rafael soriano , and mariano rivera pitched the final three innings and allowed just two hits among them a sequence the yankees hope will occur with more regularity though the win lightened the mood in the clubhouse , a number of minor concerns about the yankees' aging lineup nevertheless seem to be bubbling to the surface saturday s game was the eighth in a period in which the yankees will play 32 times in 33 days , a stretch that should test girardi s ability to tweak and tinker with his veteran roster third baseman alex rodriguez was given the day off saturday girardi said he wanted to give rodriguez , who had played seven straight games , a chance to rest his legs after a strong start to the season , rodriguez is 5 for 32 with one home run since april 16 derek jeter , who has had a lukewarm season , was 0 for 3 on saturday and is now hitting 250 and after taking friday night off , jorge posada started as the designated hitter but showed few signs that he might emerge from his seasonlong slump he went 0 for 3 , and his average is now 125 i think his atbats have been better , i do , girardi said jorge s a grinder , and he s always been a grinder , and he 'll continue to grind out atbats
washington you 're new to town , and your dreams and plans are big as the capitol rotunda you will do all you can to repeal the new health care law you will tame the budget deficit you will make your mark , or at least a very large speck , on american life but first , you will do tv at 7 30 am , with reporters from your home state , via the phone because the satellite link malfunctioned then , if you are representative james lankford , republican of oklahoma , you race back to your office , where lobbyists have already begun to leave you little missives about how they hope you will vote on a rule change you memorize the location of the closest elevator no small matter , since you drew a terrible number in the office lottery and have found yourself in the nosebleed section of the cannon house office building after casting your first vote not long after getting your voting card and cool lapel pin and attending a bipartisan prayer service you stare at the glorious speaker s lobby off the house floor , with its crystal chandeliers , cozy fireplaces and swarms of reporters , who canter toward members like deer to a salt lick , eager to get them to say something , anything i hear this is a bit of a shark tank , mr lankford said , looking briefly around the room he headed back to his office , still barely decorated , and glanced up from his schedule at the flatscreen television , where nancy pelosi was talking on cspan he turned the volume down mr lankford , 42 , is one of scores of new republican lawmakers who joined the 112th congress last week , a class tasked with annulling the ambitious policy agenda that came to fruition under democratic rule and powering past the shoals of divided government to put an immediate conservative imprint on washington a former christian camp director who , before he was elected , had last been to the nation s capital in high school , mr lankford is as much a symbol of his class as a member of it a firsttime politician who plans to send his family back home , sleep on his office couch and , he says , spurn special interests in the name of those who put him here my family s theory is that the best way not to become washington is to not live in washington , he said like most other freshmen , it seems , mr lankford is still residing firmly in the pinchme stage of electoral euphoria at this point i am just terribly pleased i can find my way around the capitol without having to pack a lunch , he said as he made the first of what will no doubt be hundreds of brisk walks from his office to the glorious building where lawmakers do their thing this was never supposed to really happen in 2008 , i had a real sense of calling , said mr lankford , who later that year resigned from his job to campaign full time we described it as an unsettling it was almost like god was telling me , get ready get ready' after a prayer journey , he said , he decided , in consultation with his wife , cindy , to run for the seat that opened in the fifth congressional district in oklahoma when representative mary fallin decided to seek the governorship that it actually happened still seems to amaze him i 've been drawn out by the people that live among me , who are just like me , in my district , he said people ask me what are they like there , and i tell them , the house floor looks and feels like america i 've run into car dealers , attorneys , a funeral home owner and a pizza operator i know it s right , but i ca n't believe it s me standing here it s a bit intimidating when i put that card in there and i vote , i am representing 750 , 000 people who sent me here and entrusted me to do the right thing among the many just like him new , cheerful , happy to be on the budget committee mr lankford stands out he is a tall , thin man with a wirebrush shock of cherrysoda colored hair and a look of permanent seriousness he pays attention to rote proceedings rather than tapping at his blackberry or chatting with the guy next to him he sat for the entire reading of the constitution on the house floor not just the few lines he was assigned to read aloud and already knew that call the question was a preliminary procedural vote because , he said , as crazy as it sounds , i picked it up at church business meetings , because lots of churches use parliamentary procedures he was mildly starstruck , he said , when he found himself in an elevator with representative john d dingell of michigan , a democrat who is the senior member of the house he came before me , mr lankford said , and now i am here , and i respect him a great deal the underbelly of partisan warfare , overstuffed schedules and the cold reality , that no , you actually cannot read every bill is beginning to dawn on him we 're already trying to make decisions because you ca n't be at everything at once , he lamented the sting of the camera s glare was made apparent by two republicans , who embarrassed fellow members with their failure to take the oath before casting votes , on the same day that many members took part in the reading of the constitution democratic lawmakers , instead of behaving like slaughtered lambs , are behaving more like hornets whose nest was just whacked , eager to foil each and every one of the other side s plans those are just subplots , mr lankford said none of them are big , none of them are dramatic , none of them will change the country it s like we 're in a car on a wet street and the wheels are squeaking as we take off but we 're moving mr lankford , who brought his wife and two daughters to town for his first week on capitol hill , ricocheted between the festive joys of taking the oath , followed by receptions with his neatly combed out , dressed up , slightly dazed family members , and the klaxon tones of the buzzer calling him and his colleagues to vote he passed other members of the freshman class representative bobby schilling of illinois , who was trying to keep track of the youngest of his 10 children representative cory gardner of colorado , who could rarely seem to figure out where he was going and representative allen west of florida , who began his first day in washington with a 5 am run around the city s monuments representative diane black of tennessee raced from her swearingin ceremony to a meeting , holding a 2yearold grandchild in one arm while pushing her mother in a wheelchair with the other some freshmen , whose lowkey elections back home kept them off the radar screen last fall , have already adopted the posture of marching briskly to

nearly a year after the earthquake in haiti , more than one million people are still living in tents and reconstruction has barely begun and that s a useful reminder of the limitations of charity and foreign aid private and public donations saved lives in haiti , no question but it s also true that wellmeaning bleedinghearts tend to exaggerate the impact aid typically has on a country those nations that have managed to lift themselves out of poverty have done so mostly with trade , not aid with giving people jobs and a ladder , not handouts and an elevator on the other hand , stonyhearts mistakenly surrender hope they see haiti or africa as a bottomless pit , a perennial hell impervious to progress that does n't match reality either so let me guide you to a village in the haitian interior where i recently saw an aid program making a difference by helping people help themselves there are many variants of such programs around the world , but this one is run by , a peasant bank that is one of the most admired aid organizations in haiti it was founded by a local catholic priest , father joseph philippe , who then recruited an american management consultant , anne hastings , to run it ms hastings went to haiti for a temporary visit in 1995 she is still there on a hillside in central haiti , i met odecile jean , a 35yearold woman with five children , ages 5 to 15 when she entered the fonkoze program , none of her children were in school , and she had no farm animals the family lived day to day , surviving on odd jobs yet after 13 months in the 18monthlong program , ms jean beamed as she showed off her brand new cow , discussed her thriving lumber business and boasted that her children were all in school her husband , lionel , hinted of ambitions for them to go to college this transformation began when the couple s caseworker , a stern young haitian named pascale joseph , insisted that the family start three separate businesses so as to have a reliable way of making a living they discussed several possibilities and decided to focus on buying logs and sawing them into lumber it s hard work , but profitable the family also entered the livestock business , with a couple of goats , and the chicken industry , starting with four newborn chicks mr joseph helped them build pens and advised them on caring for the animals he also helped them plant 15 mango trees so they could sell fruit in the market i asked ms jean how her chicken eggs tasted , and she looked scandalized i'm not going to eat these eggs , she said i'm going to use them to raise more chicks ms hastings beamed when she heard that she s getting in the habit of reinvesting , which is good in exchange for the help they receive , participants like ms jean must show that they can save money and invest it wisely to grow their businesses participants also must send children to school and adopt family planning to reduce malnutrition , participants are obliged to feed their children at least two hot meals a day my kids were with me on this trip to haiti , and they looked with interest at ms jean s list of obligations posted on her door dad , my 16yearold son pointed out , i do n't always get two hot meals a day whether in america or haiti , poverty is sometimes linked to selfdestructive behaviors that lock families into unending cycles of penury caseworkers shatter those cycles , partly by ensuring that earnings go to education rather than alcohol mr joseph , the caseworker , explained i say , every day you go out and drink and smoke , that s another day that your child ca n't go to school or eat' granted , things do n't always work smoothly in a different village , i met a 20yearold single mother in the program who had let baby goats die of negligence , and who celebrated her first earnings by buying a makeup kit but after hounding by the caseworker , the young woman has gotten the hang of supporting her children , and is exhilarated by new possibilities what haiti needs above all these days is these kinds of livelihoods for its people , not just shipments of food and clothing it s hard to think of a charitable project that will be as beneficial as the cocacola company s decision to build up the mango juice industry in haiti , supporting 25 , 000 farmers the same is true of the move by south korean garment companies to open factories in haiti i strongly believe that we have a moral obligation to address extreme poverty around the world but sometimes the best way to discharge that obligation is n't charity in the oldfashioned sense of handouts , but rather helping people like ms jean find their own ways to support their families
kabul , afghanistan was conducting business in his normal fashion on tuesday morning , holding court as 60 to 70 people filled the rooms of his large residence that also served as his office in central kandahar , when one of his most faithful commanders asked to speak to him alone and then shot him at pointblank range the head of the elected provincial council , mr karzai wielded power far beyond that office , both because he was a half brother to the president , hamid karzai , and because he had amassed great wealth and power over business , security and administrative affairs in kandahar province and much of southern  every day his office was filled with petitioners , provincial officials , and tribal and family friends who came to seek his advice and support on business matters , political dealings and tribal disputes on tuesday morning he sat for half an hour with mir wali , a former legislator from neighboring helmand province , who is one of those contesting recent parliamentary election results then a fellow provincial councilor , haji agha lalai , entered and requested five minutes of mr karzai s time the two descended to the first floor and sat for a few minutes before an old man from the city requested a hearing mr karzai moved into a room with the old man , and it was then that a commander , sardar muhammad , 40 , asked to see mr karzai alone he was carrying a file and wanted mr karzai to look at the information inside , said haji sayed jan , a close colleague who is considered mr karzai s deputy on the provincial council the commander was well known and so trusted by the karzai family that he would pick up and carry mr karzai s young son into the family quarters for his services , he was awarded a plot of land in an upscale kandahar housing development he also commanded about 100 men and managed the police posts in an area called zakar , adjoining the family neighborhood of karz on the southern side of the city there was no argument between sardar muhammad and ahmed wali , mr jan said the commander had been working with the karzai family for eight years and came from the same populzai tribe , he said yet he came to see mr karzai on tuesday morning with a purpose , opening fire as soon as they went inside the room , mr jan said he came deliberately to kill him he gave him a file and told him he should look at it and as he was looking he took out his pistol and shot him none of those who knew mr muhammad accepted the taliban s claim that he was acting on behalf of insurgents two people who knew him said he was a drug user , and suggested that he became angry over some dispute with mr karzai members of the police often use hashish in afghanistan i would not connect it with the taliban , a relative of mr muhammad said , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was discussing a crime he was very much liked and loved by ahmed wali it is very difficult to say why he did it he was using drugs , he added , declining to be more specific witnesses said security guards burst into the room as soon as they heard the first shot and killed the commander as he fired off a third bullet mr karzai was shot twice in the head and once in the hand , said haji agha lalai , a provincial councilor who was in the room next door when the shooting began he said he helped carry the wounded mr karzai down to a car and accompanied him to the hospital i was holding him and i was not very sure he would survive , he said it was confirmed in the hospital that he was dead mr karzai s bodyguards were angry and continued shooting , and some were in tears , said mr wali , the former legislator we came out and we saw ahmed wali being carried out and sardar muhammad was lying on the floor , he said some of mr karzai s security guards dragged the assailant s body out of the building and strung him up at the crossroads of the central bazaar , said an intelligence official in kandahar it was a grim reminder of the taliban era , when criminals were killed and put on public display supporters gathered at the city hospital , where american and afghan forces quickly set up a security cordon as mr karzai s body was moved to the morgue as word spread in the city , shopkeepers shuttered their stores and went home in fear of further violence security forces set up checkpoints , stopping cars as officials warned that taliban insurgents would use the opportunity to strike another blow at the government residents , tribal elders and politicians warned that the violent death of mr karzai and the subsequent power vacuum would cause greater instability it is a disaster , said mr wali it will have a very negative effect on everything in the south there will be problems ahead for kandahar , said haji karimullah naqibi , a leader of one of kandahar s largest tribes the president will have to administer and watch kandahar very closely from now on
the best moment of death row trip , sunday s episode of the good wife \( season 3 , no 8 \) cary s response when dana assures him that there s nothing going on between her and kalinda i am not a lesbian , dana announces , to which cary replies , i know a lot of people who weren t anything until they met kalinda and you couldn t blame the poor guy for being worried archie panjabi , as kalinda , and monica raymund , as cary s prosecutorial colleague dana , threw off some serious sparks in their first meeting there was certainly more chemistry than the stolid ms raymund and matt czuchry have exhibited in the danacary relationship , but that s what happens around kalinda everyone she talks to suddenly seems sexier if only the same were true for alicia and will there was a brief scene on sunday night in will s office that crystallized the problem that s currently dogging the show it was supposed to be flirtatious and seductive , as will brought up diane s suspicions about the willicia affair and alicia asked whether they needed to pause do you want to pause \? will asked , and alicia replied , provocatively , i m afraid even if we say we will we won t but there was no heat , no steam at that moment , you didn t really care whether these two kept getting it on it wasn t the fault of the writing , and it wasn t exactly the fault of julianna margulies and josh charles they just don t bring much of anything out in each other which is an inconvenient thing to discover in season 3 overall the episode consisted of a lot of incremental developments moving the furniture around grandma jackie , given a few moments alone in alicia s apartment , started pawing through her daughterinlaw s stuff looking for evidence of an affair \? and was last seen trying to figure out how to turn on alicia s laptop \( would a lawyer leave her laptop at home and in the open \? even if she has two \? \) the crazy tutor showed up , in face paint , nearly giving jackie a heart attack eli gold s daughter , marissa , last seen in season 2 , reappeared and started hitting on alicia s son , zach none of those story lines are likely to turn out well the case of the week , more disposable than usual , involved lockhart gardner taking on a deathrow appeal because the condemned man had information that could exonerate one of their clients in a murder case \( it s like a rube goldberg defense , will said , a moment that was probably intentionally selfreferential and still kind of uncomfortable \) it began with a european documentary filmmaker interviewing the inmate , probably a reference to werner herzog s current documentary into the abyss the appeal failed , but alicia waved her magic wand of empathy and got the facts the firm needed the case felt rushed and the handling of the issues superficial it also didn t seem credible that looking at crimescene photos of girls her daughter s age with their throats cut would make the tough cookie alicia choke up and question her feelings about the death penalty on the plus side , leslie uggams made a rare television guest appearance as the inmate s mother eli s work with mickey gunn s candidate was the comicrelief story line , and it allowed alan cumming to repeat the phrase fellating santa several times overall , though , since eli was brought into the firm and started doing work for politicians other than peter florrick , doesn t it feel like those plot lines are just a distraction \? the best moments involved the carydanakalinda triangleornot , in which dana offered kalinda information in exchange for help with the state s case against will kalinda agreed , too quickly , and then confirmed that she s the good soldier by going to will and telling all no actual movement on the case , however the episode ended with cary and kalinda in a clinch mutual , it seemed , but initiated by kalinda grabbing him and starting to undress him and cary pulling away and running what was that about \? she asked we wonder too for kalinda , is it sex , strategy or both \? tell us your thoughts in the comments about death row trip , alicia and will , where jackie s latest meddling will lead and how you would write the tutor out of the show
the brief brad emaus experiment came to an abrupt halt tuesday when the mets decided they have been playing too poorly to have the luxury of watching emaus stumble while they wait for him to develop so 16 games into the season , the mets began the process of sending emaus , a rule 5 pick , back to the toronto blue jays , a move that could mean more playing time for daniel murphy at second base it s ultimately about where we are right now and what we ve got to do to get this thing rolling , manager terry collins said , and that s what we thought a change had to be made at second less than a month into the season , the mets have already given up on two players they brought north from spring training emaus and relief pitcher blaine boyer emaus was selected from the blue jays by the mets in the rule 5 draft in december in spring training , the mets chose him to be the starting second baseman over several other players , including murphy and justin turner , the player the mets brought up to replace emaus on the roster collins said that turner , who was in the starting lineup for tuesday s game against the astros at citi field , would platoon at second with murphy , who came into tuesday hitting 226 the mets decided to abandoned their plan for emaus after he started the season bating 162 \( six singles in 37 atbats \) and at times looked as if he did not belong at the major league level this is a tough league to learn how to play the game , collins said murphy , a lefthanded hitter , has shown more skill at second base than many had expected , despite two baserunning blunders and a couple of awkward plays in the field but general manager sandy alderson indicated that the permanent solution to the secondbase problem has not necessarily been found i d say it s an evolving situation , no question about that , alderson said but i think there have been some positives i think daniel murphy has played better at second than most people would have anticipated justin turner was sent down at the end of spring training largely because he had options this is a kind of a natural progression you d like it to stop at some point with a final answer but this is often what happens in baseball at various positions , and the situation we have at second currently although emaus was originally coveted by the mets for his ability to work counts and draw walks , he was never given a chance to play every day at second base in spring training because the mets wanted to give luis castillo , luis hernandez , murphy and turner time there as well emaus won the job almost by default , but struggled early and never recovered during the mets recent trip to atlanta , collins said he wanted to give emaus a legitimate chance he said he had a certain number of atbats in mind from which to assess his progress , but would not say what the number was it turned out to be seven , and none of those atbats amounted to a hit emaus was designated for assignment , which means the mets have placed him on waivers if he clears waivers , the mets must offer him back to the blue jays if toronto accepts him back , it must give the mets 25 , 000 if the blue jays do not , emaus could possibly end up back in the mets farm system pagan bats sixth angel pagan was back in the sixth spot in the batting order tuesday , but terry collins said he wanted to move him back to the no 2 hole once he regains his swing that s where ultimately i d like him to be , no question about it , collins said but i m going to talk to angel when that time comes to make sure he s comfortable with it pagan went into tuesday s game batting 169 , and collins said that he was putting too much pressure on himself to get back to where he was last year when he hit 290 with 11 home runs and 69 runs batted in he s trying way too hard , collins said he s trying to do all the things he did all last season in the first two weeks i ve been trying to get him to just play and do the little things , slap the ball around , use the godgiven speed he has , and create havoc like he can a lucky move a minor misprint regarding the lineup caused terry collins to regale reporters with an amusing story regarding his last stint as manager with the anaheim angels in the late 1990s collins said he was under the misunderstanding that the white sox , the angels opponent that day , were starting a righthanded pitcher i put five lefties in the lineup , collins said and we beat them , 91 we got lucky
boston on the republican campaign trail , the health care debate has focused on the mandatory coverage that signed into law as governor in 2006 but back in massachusetts the conversation has moved on , and lawmakers are now confronting the problem that mr romney left unaddressed the state s spiraling health care costs after three years of study , the state s legislative leaders appear close to producing bills that would make massachusetts the first state again to radically revamp the way doctors , hospitals and other health providers are paid although important details remain to be negotiated , the legislative leaders and gov , all democrats , are working toward a plan that would encourage flat global payments to networks of providers for keeping patients well , replacing the feeforservice system that creates incentives for excessive care by paying for each visit and procedure we have shown the nation how to extend care to everybody , mr patrick said in an interview , and we 'll be the place to crack the code on costs those who led the 2006 effort to expand coverage readily acknowledge that they deferred the more daunting task of cost control for another day it was assumed then that the politics would pit doctors , hospitals , insurers , employers and consumers against one another , and obliterate the fragile coalition behind the groundbreaking coverage law predictably , the plan did little to slow the growth of health costs that already were among the highest in the nation a state last year found that per capita health spending in massachusetts was 15 percent above the national average and from 2007 to 2009 , private health insurance premiums rose between 5 and 10 percent annually , according to  yet the plan , which generated fresh attacks on mr romney in a recent new hampshire debate and a blistering internet ad by gov rick perry of texas , has largely succeeded in providing nearly universal coverage only 2 percent of residents and a fraction of 1 percent of children in massachusetts are uninsured the law s popularity has given state leaders added incentive to make it financially sustainable but the process has been painstakingly slow it started in 2008 , when the legislature appointed a commission to study changes in the medical payment system a year later , the commission recommended the broad outlines of a global payment plan that essentially calls for teams of providers to be put on a budget for each patient s care the networks would receive an annual fee for the care of each patient , with higher payments for patients deemed to be greater health risks and with bonuses for highquality care in theory , the healthier these socalled accountable care organizations can keep their patients , the more reimbursement they can pocket as profit insurers are already required to accept all applicants in massachusetts , as will be the case nationally , in 2014 , if the new survives its legal and political challenges in february , three months after mr patrick s reelection , he submitted a bill that would impose a global payment system for most state employees , recipients and others with statesubsidized health insurance roughly one in four residents his plan would set parameters to help private insurers and providers follow suit , in the hope that they would gradually gravitate to global payments , without coercive legislation and it would give the state s insurance commissioner broader authority to reject premium increases deemed excessive , with an added goal of holding down hospital costs lawmakers in each chamber have struggled to draft their own proposals , which they hope to bring to a vote by early next year in the house , one idea is to move health care providers to a global payment system within three years , with a goal of keeping health care spending increases to about 39 percent a year after that roughly the typical growth in the state s gross domestic product but state representative steven walsh , house chairman of the joint committee on health care financing , said it would be crucial to move slowly , adding that it could take 15 years to squeeze all the inequities out of the system because medical spending is driven not just by volume but also by pricing , a major question has been whether global payments alone will have much effect it may be equally important , mr patrick and others argue , to rein in the ability of the state s most prestigious teaching hospitals and physicians' groups to negotiate high rates of reimbursement a series of news media and government investigations have revealed that large , highstatus providers , like partners healthcare system , which owns the harvardaffiliated massachusetts general and brigham women s hospitals , command substantially higher reimbursement from insurers than other entities in the last two years , attorney general martha coakley , a democrat , has concluded that differences in payments to hospitals cannot be explained by variations in their quality , the mix of their patients or the costs of academic medicine last month , the house majority leader , representative ronald mariano , introduced a bill that would force insurers to narrow the inequities in payments mr patrick said the state needed to help struggling hospitals by raising medicaid reimbursement rates but he also cited his insurance commissioner s recent denials of premium increases as the kind of pressure needed to keep prices down i think having the authority that we have in respect to the insurers has been a very , very important tool , mr patrick said , and we need similar authority with the hospitals massachusetts has had a model for global payments since 2009 , when blue cross blue shield of massachusetts , the state s biggest health insurer , began experimenting with an alternative quality contract that pays groups of doctors and hospitals a set fee to work as a team in caring for patients the plans cover about 613 , 000 people , or roughly twothirds of blue cross members in health maintenance organizations , but none of those in preferred provider organizations this month , in an important advance , partners healthcare joined the program , with incentives to keep cost growth below the blue cross average it s a big deal , said stuart altman , a health economist at brandeis , because they 're the biggest player in town and it sort of solidifies that this will be one of the major changes in the system and that it s likely to be around for a while under market and political pressure , partners also agreed to renegotiate its contract with blue cross blue shield and accept lower reimbursements , which is expected to save 240 million over three years andrew dreyfus , president of blue cross blue shield of massachusetts , said payments to partners would increase at about 2 percent a year rather than the previously anticipated 5 percent to 6 percent the politically powerful hospitals clearly hope to persuade lawmakers that price controls are not needed this contract is evidence that at partners , we think the market is working to address affordability , said a company spokesman , rich copp mr patrick said such experiments were important , but did not go far enough we still need a bill because we 've got to have scale , he said it ca n't be oneoffs initial resistance is also expected from doctors the most recent annual by the massachusetts medical society found that nearly 60 percent of physicians and higher rates of specialists said they were not likely to join a voluntary global payment system but mr walsh said that doctors and other stakeholders were becoming more comfortable with the idea it s not seen as a foreign approach anymore , he said
carson city , nev officials here offered new details wednesday about a shooting rampage in an ihop restaurant , a seemingly random attack on tuesday morning that left five people including three national guard members dead and several others clinging to life despite the identities of the victims and the proximity to the anniversary of the sept 11 attacks , the carson city sheriff , ken furlong , seemed to back away from early theories that the gunman , identified as eduardo sencion , 32 , had specifically targeted members of the military when he entered the restaurant and began shooting along an aisle leading to the table where five national guard members were eating breakfast along that path , equal members of military and civilians were shot , sheriff furlong said all told , 12 people were killed or injured , including mr sencion , who shot himself in the parking lot after leaving the restaurant he died later at a hospital sheriff furlong identified the three dead guard members as maj heath kelly , 35 , of reno , nev sgt first class christian riege , 38 , of carson city and sgt first class miranda mcelhiney , 31 , of reno the remaining two guard members were still in the hospital , but have nonlife threatening injuries , said maj april conway , a national guard spokeswoman the dead also included a 67yearwoman florence donovangunderson , of south lake tahoe , calif , about 30 miles to the southwest who was dining with her husband , who was also shot but survived the shooting was the first homicide in the state capital in three years , said sheriff furlong , who called it the most devastating attack in carson city s history the question of who mr sencion was and what exactly drove him to murder continued to perplex the authorities , though they said that he had struggled with mental problems reported on wednesday that mr sencion had been committed to a south lake tahoe mental facility in 2000 , something sheriff furlong said his office was investigating the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives , meanwhile , was also trying to determine how mr sencion a naturalized american who was born in mexico had obtained three weapons two assaultstyle rifles and a pistol , all of three of which were found at the scene the bureau was looking into whether the guns had been converted from semiautomatic to fully automatic , sheriff furlong said but only one of the three weapons found by the authorities a rifle was used in the attack , which started just before 9 am at an ihop on the south side of town and ended just minutes later the scene of the shooting was still locked down on wednesday morning , as the police and sheriff s officials continued to look for evidence the restaurant s south window showed two bullet holes small spider webs of shattered glass where bullets had struck sheriff furlong described a chaotic scene as mr sencion appeared in the parking lot of the restaurant apparently chosen at random , as he had no personal or professional ties there and began shooting the bullets hit several nearby businesses including the fandango casino across highway 395 , the city s sixlane central thoroughfare after entering the restaurant from the west in shadow , as the sun rose over hills to the east mr sencion took a sharp right into the seating area , and aimed his weapon ms donovangunderson and her husband a retired military veteran himself were hit by one of the early volleys , which were accompanied by screams by mr sencion , who apparently shouted at victims as he shot the five guard members had started a 10hour shift at 6 30 am , even as carson city a sleepy seat of state government and casinos stuffed with slot machines shook off the labor day weekend it was common for members of the guard which has about 300 fulltime members based here to retreat to places like ihop to escape the tyranny of the inbox , as the base s commander , brig gen bill burks of the nevada national guard , put it mr sencion shot all five guard members at the table , none of whom were armed he killed major kelly and sergeant riege at the scene sergeant mcelhiney died at a hospital tuesday night mr sencion then left the restaurant , even as customers and ihop workers frantically tried to escape , some rushing children out of back doors there were many acts of heroism from many persons , sheriff furlong said released wednesday by the sheriff indicate a frenzied scene outside the restaurant , as well in one call , a woman screams to an operator there s a man with a machine gun at the ihop ! , adding , he s shooting people ! then another call and another and another mr sencion did not have any prior criminal history , nor did he have any involvement with gangs or methamphetamine , issues that carson city s police force has had to confront in the past but he had struggled financially joe laub , a lawyer in reno , said he had represented mr sencion in a 2009 bankruptcy case after he ran up about 45 , 000 in credit card debt mr laub said mr sencion never spoke to him about the military , nor did he display signs of mental illness he was a very kind , friendly person , who did not display irrational behavior and seemed to be very helpful to friends and family , mr laub said on wednesday he would bring different people into the office to get legal advice or guidance , and seemed sincerely concerned about their problems and helping them mr laub said that he had spoken to mr sencion s brother , gilberto , since the attack and that the family was grieving , something sheriff furlong echoed the family did not take part in this , he said the mourning process was also under way at the national guard base here , located in a small compound near the edge of town , where about 300 people work general burks said that two of the three guard victims had survived tours of duty in iraq and afghanistan it hit real hard , said general burks , who had asked national guard members on tuesday not to wear their uniforms in public as a precaution general burks offered a few details about the lives of the victims sergeant riege , for example , was described as a fitness fan with three children who had served with the 221st calvary in afghanistan in 2010 major kelly , who was married with two children , had served with the army in iraq and had been decorated sergeant mcelhiney , who was single , was a fast riser , who worked in various medical and administrative roles and made cupcakes for special national guard events it s pretty quiet on the base , major conway said i think people are still in a reflective mood and just keeping to themselves certainly there is not the normal boisterous joviality that usually goes on in the halls everyone is still a little numb on wednesday , local residents also expressed shock at the attack joycelyn salmon , a 72yearold cab driver , said she had intended to go to ihop that morning but decided on another restaurant nearby i was strictly appalled , she said there were kids in there and the armed corps people and there 're protecting us ms salmon added that carson city which , like the rest of nevada , has doubledigit unemployment had few mental health services available and that guns were common , both for hunting and protection there s a lot of rattlesnakes out there , she said indeed , north of the ihop , a gun shop advertised its opening with a large banner for all that , sheriff furlong said that the town s violent crimes were way down from several years ago and that 60 percent of the calls his office received were small thefts or simple assaults we have violence against people , he said but it s been on a decline since about 2005 all of which made the attack all the more painful for residents here that included sheriff furlong , a straightforward lawman for more than three decades who has deep roots here his father was the undersheriff and he grew up around the police station speaking to reporters on wednesday , he likened the rampage to sept 11 and said his city of 55 , 000 would recover just as new york had we 're a resilient society , he said we rebuild but we do n't forget
arlington , va nobody has to tell the washington capitals that the rangers mean trouble new york won three of the four regularseason games against the capitals two of those were washington s worst defeats of the year , including a 70 shutout on dec 12 when clubs last met on feb 25 the rangers outscored the caps , 60  the capitals , however , insist that they are not the same squad that they were at the start of the season speaking after their practice at the kettler capitals iceplex on monday , capitals players cited three reasons why they expect to do well against the rangers in the upcoming series beginning wednesday in washington first , spurred by their tribulations during the first part of the season , capitals coach bruce boudreau altered washington s playing style the caps have gone from a runandgun offensive powerhouse to a defense first squad that is now fourth in the league in goals against second , general manager george mcphee took some important steps to add experience to the capitals young locker room , picking up the veterans marco sturm and jason arnott , who has played in nine stanley cup playoffs i think it changed the dynamic in the room with a little bit more veteran presence , john carlson , a rookie defenseman , said i think that that s translated on the ice and everyone seems to be buckling down and playing the right style of hockey lastly , there is the bitter memory of last year s collapse having won the presidents trophy in 2010 only to falter in the first round of playoffs against montreal , the capitals have a lot to prove that s a point they have drilled home this season , wearing tshirts bearing the slogan stay angry during training camp it seems like it was just yesterday , left wing jason chimera said if we could use that as a motivating factor that d be great sometimes losing like that gets guys a little more excited on paper , the capitals are one of the nhl s elite teams for the second year in a row they are the top seed in the eastern conference while the rangers barely squeaked into the playoffs but as the capitals see it the two teams match up pretty evenly none of that means anything , what we did , boudreau said wednesday is what means something and both teams will be ready though the capitals play well in their own zone , so do the rangers new york is fourth in the league in blocked shots while boasting the league s highest hits total , something that will certainly make it a tough task for washington and their highly skilled forwards alex ovechkin , nicklas backstrom and alexander semin they are noted for it and they do a great job of it , boudreau said of the rangers shot blocking it s just the way they play we understand what we do as they understand what we do you get that chance you just got to get it by them it s your job to get it by them we re very similar both offensively and defensively , he continued that s what s going to make it really interesting i think the intangibles that we don t know about are going to make the difference one spot where the two teams do differ is at goaltender the rangers henrik lundqvist is having a banner year while the capitals will most likely rely on 23yearold rookie michal neuvirth , at least at the start of the series after getting almost single handily defeated by canadiens jaroslav halak in last season s eastern quarterfinals , a hot and experienced goalie like lundqvist is one of the last things washington would like to face ovechkin , who struggled early on in the season before picking up his play of late , asserts that both himself and the team must wipe the slate clean it s the playoffs , he said it doesn t matter how you play in the regular year , playoffs is all about one game , one little moment right now it s time to show your best hockey of the year the capitals insisted they would not be intimidated by their earlier drubbings at the hand of the rangers there s no hiding from the fact they beat us a couple times pretty good this year , said the veteran winger mike knuble , who signed a oneyear contract extension with washington monday morning that was a long time ago we re looking forward to the chance coming wednesday and getting our playoff run going doesn t matter who it s against arnott added it doesn t matter who we play every team is competitive every team has a chance to win in the playoffs they re a hard working team lot of talent and a phenomenal goaltender you know , it s going to be a tough test they re a great hockey team and they come to play every night it ll be a good one ovechkin , the team s captain , was confident we can t wait for it to start , he said we want the cup and while the capitals postseason play in recent years has been problematic they see one bright spot in the three years under boudreau the caps managed to win only one postseason series the victory a sevengame affair was over the rangers in 2009
phoenix christopher s linder has had many monikers over the years big slim was his gang nickname , 151011 was his inmate number , and he has been mayorelect since voters in pawnee , okla , chose him to lead their small town but mr linder cannot take office until he first wipes clean his felony convictions , according to oklahoma state law , which is what brought him tuesday before the seeking a pardon the appearance made his bruising campaign for pawnee mayor , during which his past was laid bare for voters to consider , seem tame board members asked mr linder , 33 , to recount the crime he committed in phoenix while in his early 20s , a botched drug deal and driveby shooting i live with that every day , mr linder said every single day that i get up , i live with the decision i made 12 years ago i know it was n't a wise decision i know it was atrocious the board delved into his prison history and the fact that he was cited for disobeying orders and disrespecting authority during his five years behind bars under questioning , he acknowledged using cocaine , lsd and while in the army the fivemember board had many questions for mr linder and none involved his plans for , an ailing town where the lone hospital has closed , the population of about 2 , 000 is on a downward trend and residents are in significant financial distress he was asked why he had not removed the heart and pitchforks tattooed to his right shoulder , which symbolize the gangster disciples , his old crew the board asked if he realized that somebody easily could have been killed on aug 11 , 1999 , the day of the crime this is a tough one , said jack lasota , a board member , who said he was impressed with mr linder s apparent transformation as well as by the fact that he persuaded more than 40 percent of the voters in a town to elect him mayor i 've long been a believer when the public speaks at the ballot box , that s an important decision , mr lasota said , calling mr linder s request for a pardon to fulfill the will of oklahoma voters an extraordinary situation after mulling the matter , mr lasota voted to recommend that gov jan brewer , a republican , wipe his record clean but mr lasota s four colleagues voted no , dashing mr linder s hopes they agreed with the chairman , duane belcher , who said mr linder s life of crime was not far enough in the past to merit a pardon mr linder was released from prison in 2005 but his parole ended less than two years ago i think mr linder has come a long way in a short period of time , mr belcher said , urging him to keep on the straight and narrow and come back in three years for another shot mr linder is a relative newcomer to pawnee , which made his electoral victory in april all the more surprising his wife , christine , is a pawnee native and the couple settled there about two years ago after mr linder s release adding to mr linder s challenge in fitting in , he said , is that he is black and a majority of the residents are white the linders bought the pawnee cafe , one of only a few restaurants there , known for its topnotch burgers , chicken fried steak and conversation it is there that many locals first got to know mr linder , as well as through his volunteer work for the chamber of commerce , where he serves on the executive board , and as a baseball coach and member of the first baptist church i 've known him for a couple years , and he s taken a business that was down and built it up , said one of his supporters , ronnie jestes , director of pawnee s annual rodeo , which can draw as many as 10 , 000 people everyone holds the past against somebody in chris linder s case , his past made him know what it takes to overcome the president of the local chamber , clark shouse jr , whose father is the president of first national bank of pawnee , is a linder fan as well i 've met him , and he s a nice , outstanding man , mr shouse said in an interview a few months back , friends encouraged mr linder to run for mayor , and he ended up outpolling the acting mayor , tom briggs , and a longtime former mayor , alford majors his victory came despite the fact that the police chief received an anonymous tip about mr linder s criminal past just after he filed his candidacy the matter came to light too late to remove his name from the ballot mr linder held a forum to address the furor , describing how he had tried to sell 20 pounds of marijuana to two men and had been given counterfeit money in return during a car chase , the men had fired at his vehicle and his friend had fired back using mr linder s gun in a letter to the board , one pawnee resident , penny nicoht , recounted how mr linder once pulled her son aside after the boy was ejected from a baseball game for losing his temper mr linder explained that he had lost his temper in the past and that nothing good comes from it please grant his pardon and know that this time the system did work , ms nicoht wrote but not everybody was in mr linder s corner another resident , judy echenrode , lamented that mr linder s criminal past was dividing the town he received the most votes , embarrassing our wonderful present mayor and putting a black eye on the town , she wrote to the board now everyone is arguing over whether he can be sworn into office mr linder could challenge the matter in court but there is another option his wife may jump into the special election to replace her husband , which would make him , even with his record , pawnee s mayor s spouse
rome some have taken to calling him simply re giorgio , or king george , for his stately defense of italian democratic institutions and the outsize albeit behindthescenes role he played in the rapid shift from the cinematic government of to the technocratic one of  he is president giorgio napolitano , 86 , a former highranking member of s communist party henry a kissinger is said to have who last month capped a distinguished career by orchestrating one of the most complex political transfers in italian postwar history , and who remains a key guarantor of political stability in a rocky time his performance was all the more impressive in that the italian presidency is a largely symbolic office , with no executive power but mr napolitano , who is known for his straight talk and downtoearth style in a floridly baroque culture , pushed that role to its limit to become a quiet power broker he spent months laying the groundwork for the transition consulting with italian political leaders , european leaders , american officials and the bank of italy to shepherd the creation of a viable alternative government for the postberlusconi moment now is the time to show maximum responsibility it is not the time to pay off old scores nor for sterile partisan recriminations , mr napolitano said in a statement when announcing mr monti s nomination it is time to reestablish a climate of calmness and mutual respect napolitano not only dictated the timing of the solution but also the contents , that is the unusual thing , said andrea simoncini , a constitutional law professor at the university of florence he did n't only say , you have to do it soon' he basically chose monti and created the conditions so that people could n't not say yes to monti today , mr monti s government is widely referred to as a government of the president , backed by mr napolitano and the as much as by the italian parliament , which last month but has yet to approve unpopular new austerity measures as often happens in italy , momentum built slowly , but change happened swiftly for months , mr berlusconi had clung to power without solid support , making muchneeded economic reforms impossible as world markets continued to hammer italy the trigger was pulled on nov 8 , when mr berlusconi lost his ruling majority on a vote the same day bond markets drove borrowing rates on italian bonds to the same levels that have required other euro zone countries to seek bailouts that evening , a humbled mr berlusconi went to meet mr napolitano at the quirinal presidential palace for consultations aides said the meeting was cordial , but its outcome was clear the onceteflon prime minister had agreed to step down moving quickly , mr napolitano plucked mr monti from his post as president of milan s bocconi university and anointed him as a senator for life , making him a full member of parliament , not just an academic outsider that was an act of genius , said corrado augias , a veteran italian political commentator and writer he took a professor and redressed him as a politician it helped that mr napolitano , whose sevenyear term began in 2006 , enjoys popular approval ratings of around 80 percent , compared with 20 percent in recent weeks for mr berlusconi this was his life insurance , because if he had n't had it , berlusconi would have eaten him for lunch , mr augias said in the topsyturvy world of mr berlusconi s italy , where the prime minister s personal life came to overshadow the work of governance , mr napolitano had emerged as with his elegant yet feisty wife , clio , by his side , a lawyer whom he married in 1959 , mr napolitano came to be seen as embodying a different italy , one of civic virtue this month , named mr napolitano its man of the year , for displaying a surprising speed in remaining connected to reality in a word wired even after mr berlusconi did step down , the idea of replacing his cabinet with a technocratic government was not at all a given the former prime minister s centerright coalition was dead set on early elections , and some in his former coalition criticize the monti government as an antidemocratic coup but in a new order in which markets trumped traditional democratic processes , president obama , chancellor angela merkel of germany and president nicolas sarkozy of france all called mr napolitano during the delicate transition to express their support for his leadership calls widely seen as tacit support for a monti government over early elections it was a striking indication of how far mr napolitano , to say nothing of the rest of the world , has come in the last years of his career at one time , the idea of an american president thanking mr napolitano who was essentially the foreign minister of the italian communist party or even calling him was unthinkable in his earlier years , mr napolitano did not stray much from the communist party line , once going so far as to say that the soviet invasion of hungary in 1956 had contributed to peace in the world , according to but by 1969 , he was part of a group of italian communists who broke with the kremlin to criticize the crackdown of the prague spring uprising of 1968 like many communists from his native naples , mr napolitano hailed from the more conservative wing of the party , whose members were known as the miglioristi , or the improvers , for their desire to make the world better through government rather than revolution the ambassador to italy under president jimmy carter , richard n gardner , wrote in his memoirs about his secret meetings with mr napolitano , who was respected enough to become one of the first italian communist officials to visit the united states he , just weeks after the dramatic kidnapping of former prime minister aldo moro by a leftist radical group , and delivered wellreceived lectures at leading universities none other than the seventime christian democratic prime minister giulio andreotti , the mastermind of postwar italian politics , said that he had helped secure mr napolitano a visa in the late 1980s , as the communist project was ending and the party reacted by closing ranks , mr napolitano fell out of favor by calling for closer ties with the socialists , whose social democratic views he largely shared he left instead for strasbourg , france , where he was a member of the european parliament from 1989 to 1992 after the collapse of italy s old political order in a bribery scandal , mr napolitano returned to italy in 1992 and became speaker of the lower house , where he commanded broad support in 1996 he was seen as enough above the fray to be named italy s first postcommunist interior minister , a politically sensitive position that involves overseeing the secret service now , italians are looking to mr napolitano to guide the ship of state with quiet skill as mr monti and his team of technocrats take on the treacherous challenge of modernizing italy s creaking economy i appreciate his dynamism and courage , especially remarkable for a man of that age , said paolo olsoufieff , a retired businessman , as he read a newspaper in a restaurant in downtown rome he is the only man capable of holding at bay the circus of ferocious beasts that is the italian parliament
moscow stepped up its efforts on monday to negotiate a resolution to the war in , with officials here receiving the president of south africa , who has offered his services as a mediator , and the secretary general of  at the same time , the president of the world chess federation , who is acting as moscow s informal gobetween with libya s embattled leader , col , made his second trip to tripoli on his last visit , the chess official , , played a game with colonel qaddafi while discussing whether he would consider stepping down and leaving libya during the match , mr ilyumzhinov said later , he maneuvered colonel qaddafi close to checkmate but then offered him a draw instead but in their conversation , mr qaddafi said he intended to die on libyan soil and would not consider any negotiated settlement that called for his departure from the country on monday , mr ilyumzhinov told russian news agencies that he had met with muhammad elqaddafi , the colonel s eldest son , and had again been told that colonel qaddafi would not leave libya but the libyan government acknowledged that its emissaries had met on numerous occasions in europe with representatives of the libyan opposition , and that the talks were continuing , reuters reported the russian diplomatic effort to open a channel of communication with the libyan leader , who has been a major buyer of russian weapons for years , began after president dmitri a medvedev met with president obama on the sidelines of a group of 8 gathering in france in may at that meeting , mr medvedev offered to serve as a mediator , and to use what leverage russia has in libya to persuade colonel qaddafi to cede power to date , with the colonel refusing the libyan rebels' demands that he leave the country , none of moscow s forays have borne fruit russia has sharply criticized the nato bombing campaign as overstepping the united nations' mandate to protect civilians , instead apparently aiming to oust colonel qaddafi russia s ministry of foreign affairs also condemned a recently confirmed french weapons airdrop to the libyan rebels , saying this , too , violated the united nations resolution mr medvedev has , however , said that colonel qaddafi must step down sergei a karaganov , dean of the department of international economics and foreign affairs at the higher school of economics in moscow , said russia is appealing to two constituencies its mediation efforts gains moscow points with the west , while its criticism of the nato campaign plays well in the developing world it might bring results , but nobody knows , mr karaganov said the game , of course , includes qaddafi and if he has proven one thing , it is that he is not an easy person to deal with he does n't respond to threats and by the way , mr karaganov added of colonel qaddafi and russia , he is profoundly distrusted here we know him better than others after monday s meeting with the nato secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , at a russian government retreat surrounded by palm trees in the black sea resort city of sochi , mr medvedev offered encouraging words but no specifics i think all of us are inspired with the results , he said , the interfax news agency reported the meeting was rather productive , and i hope we made progress mr medvedev also met monday with , the president of south africa , who has negotiated on behalf of the and proposed that an interim government take power in libya , russian state television reported at a meeting over the weekend , the african union called on its members to disregard an arrest warrant for colonel qaddafi issued by the international criminal court , saying the warrant could hinder any settlement that included mr qaddafi seeking asylum outside of libya
most attention on sea ice comes in early september , when the sheath of drifting , cracking floes cloaking the arctic ocean , warmed by nonstop sunlight and moved by summer winds , reaches its annual minimum for a reminder of just how dynamic the ice is , click on the video above , which i shot near the north pole in march , 2003 , while standing with tim stanton , an expert on ice and oceans at the naval postgraduate school , next to a developing ridge where two floes were colliding \( we were drifting around 400 yards an hour at the time all the sound is the crunching and huffing of the ice \) one research group , at the university of bremen , concluded last week that the ice this year retreated to a new record low for the era of satellite monitoring but other iceanalysis teams , including the national snow and ice data center , have not yet made their determinations here s the latest graph from the snow and ice center , in boulder , colo the latesummer ice watch , particularly when it results in debates over new records or shortterm trends , can distract from longterm patterns that best reflect the contribution of humandriven climate change in a guest post on the real climate blog last week , dirk notz from the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg provided a helpful reminder that the latesummer ice watch is a distraction from measurements in earlier months , which already showed the amount of open arctic ocean waters passing previous modern records i encourage you to read the post , the unnoticed melt  i got in touch with notz over the weekend and he provided some added insights on other arctic trends , including his assessment of the significance of ice thickness \( which has also seen big declines in recent years \) and the factors pointing to the influence of humandriven warming first , i asked about thickness , which has been a focus of some climate campaigners for quite awhile given that thin ice as you explained boosts heat transfer from ocean to air , is a focus on ice volume as an indicator of the health of the system \( for lack of a better word \) a distraction \? regarding the volume vs extent debate as with most things related to climate that are extensively debated , in my opinion the truth as to which one is more important lies very much in the middle in my opinion , both are crucial to assess the state of arctic sea ice extent , for once , is crucial in determining the amount of absorbed solar radiation , the area of polar bear \( and other animals \) habitat , the amount of snow that falls onto sea ice , etc thickness really matters for none of these things since , for example , polar bears are happy to walk on super thin , slushy ice volume , in contrast , is crucial in determining the vulnerability of arctic sea ice to rapid future reductions \( since thin ice is much more prone to react strongly to a single warm summer , making single verylow seaice summers more likely \) , and the thickness of the ice determines the exchange of heat between ocean and atmosphere hence , a healthy seaice state is a state with both large volume or large extent decreasing any of the two makes the other more vulnerable \( the volume affects the extent through the rapid melting of thin ice , while the extent affects the volume through an increased absorption of sun light for lower extent \) our tietsche , et al , 2011 paper basically shows that both extent and volume can recover on similar time scales after extreme loss events , in particular for the thin ice that we have around nowadays for the 1980 experiment , it took somewhat longer to recover the thick ice that used to be around in the model back then hence , in summary , i find that volume and extent both matter for the healthiness of the sea ice since , however , the latter can be determined much more reliably from direct observations , i focused solely on that quantity in my blog  ignatius rigor was among those who pointed me to a particularly important onetime flush \( my term \) of thick old ice around 198990 that had an enduring impact on the proportion of older ice from then on see this animation by rigor is that kind of nonlinear event replicated much by models \? also , given the short time scale of satellite observations , does such pulsestyle ice behavior add uncertainty to efforts to link greenhousedriven warming to recent \( post 2000 \) seaice behavior \? regarding your questions 1  the big flushing event in the early 1990s was related to unusual wind patterns related to a period of sustained , positive arctic oscillation index during periods of high aoindex , the transpolar drift is stronger , leading to more export of ice \( see , for example , http pscaplwashingtonedu switchyard overview pages freshwater syhtml \) in models , periods of high , sustained positive aoindex do occur see the three lower plots in attached figure however , their timing is primarily based on internal variability , hence the early 1990s event was not predicted by this particular model setup this is mostly caused by the fact that climate models are constructed to make projections on much longer time scales and cannot predict the precise timing of individual events for the future , data assimilation might help us to keep the state of a climate model closer to the real world s , allowing us to improve predictions on seasonal and decadal time scales 2 regarding the attribution as shown in fig 1 of my 2009 pnas paper , sea ice usually recovers within one year or so from extreme loss events \( same conclusion can be drawn from figure 3 of the realclimate post \) hence , the memory of sea ice is usually quite short , and it would normally recover also from bigger flushing events the only explanation that we have for the sustained downward trend in seaice extent is the increase in greenhousegas concentrations we are currently working on a geophysical research letters paper on these issues here s a useful aggregation of sea ice data sources norway s nansen center also tracks arctic ice extent and area for a look at global and southern hemisphere trends , go to cryosphere today   a graphic provided by notz was added after the initial post and some related language initially cut from his response has been restored
this thursday , a new class of college players will enter the brave , new uncertain world of professional basketball as the holds its draft in newark the annual dreamcometrue event is the culmination of years of sacrifice and hard work the rookies are entering a more sophisticated , more specialized world with new teammates , different challenges and different demands the tactics that worked only a few months ago are already obsolete the players will have more talented teammates and will face bigger , better defenders while many have had friends and even family go through the nba process , this is one dream you have to experience firsthand to truly grasp like their counterparts entering the nfl , the nba rookies go into a league under the threat of an impending collision between players and owners over labor issues that revolve around the distribution of revenue they enter the league as it is experiencing a surge in popularity this year s nba finals were a ratings victory , attracting an average of 173 million people over the six games , according to nielsen the three networks that televise nba games reported significant increases in viewers this season 42 percent for tnt , 38 percent for abc and 28 percent for espn , the nba said arena capacity was 903 percent , its seventh straight season of 90 or better , and the 17 , 306 average attendance , a 1 percent increase from last season , was the fifth highest in the league s history despite the prosperity , nba owners , like nfl owners , want more on tuesday , owners and players will gather for a doordie meeting to determine whether they should bother meeting again if no new labor deal is adopted by june 30 and you can bet that none will be there will be a lockout although this new world seems mysterious , the incoming rookies have just watched an nba season that in many ways provides insights into two useful truths nothing is promised fame is fleeting and fragile seventeen years ago , jason kidd walked across a stage and shook hands with david stern , who welcomed him into the nba four years later , dirk nowitzki heard called by the milwaukee bucks , who promptly traded him to the dallas mavericks it s unlikely that either player thought it would take 17 and 13 seasons to win a championship a more relevant lesson for these raw recruits is the extraordinary plummet of lebron james , the miami heat superstar james is or was the patron saint of this generation of players they watched james make the leap from high school to the nba and almost immediately reach a superstar status that seemed unshakable three weeks ago , james was an icon today , he is the butt of jokes \( someone asked lebron james to change a dollar bill he handed over only 75 cents because he did n't have a fourth quarter \) the young players ca n't do anything about winning championships that s simply the luck of the draw what the players can control are their actions they have seen how a statement , a gesture , an action can tarnish an image and even ruin a career in this era of instant technology of twitter and facebook and smartphones nothing is sacred all it takes is one misinterpreted deed , one careless night out on the town , one awful nba finals to send a superstar tumbling witness the tv show james used last july to announce his departure from cleveland , his performance during the finals and his poorly expressed , misinterpreted comments after last week s game 6 after thursday night s , decisionmaking and precision , on and off the court , will be more critical than ever kemba walker , connecticut s allamerican guard , has already learned an invaluable lesson in how the noblest intention , the greatest accomplishment , can be twisted around and used as cyberspace fodder walker was the star who led the university of connecticut to the national championship last spring his compelling back story is that he graduated after three years at uconn and enters the nba with a degree in the course of describing the rigors of graduating early , taking classes and playing division i basketball , walker said that while he had read a number of books , he read only one book cover to cover \( full disclosure it was my book that he referred to \) the statement triggered an unexpected onslaught of criticism and denunciation about the state of academics and intercollegiate athletics on thursday , walker will leave the minifirestorm behind and walk across the stage into the nba with a major lesson learned choose words carefully , speak from the heart selectively and remember that , like players , the news media are looking to make highlight reels , too in fact , this group of rookies may be the most astute group of young players yet they have had

we are covering the final season of friday night lights according to the nbc schedule we ask that readers who have already seen the season on directv or on dvd to please refrain from giving away future plot points in the comments section can this child be saved \? that was the underlying theme of the latest episode of friday night lights , as we watched epyck lash out , fight and get suspended and buddy s son roll into town with his quasiveganinduced anger and disillusionment who among us wouldn t become cranky if subjected to a stepparent mandated diet of seitan \? it seems to take buddy jr about 10 seconds of being in dillon to steal his father s credit card and break into the booze and another 20 for everyone to figure that the cure for what ails buddy is going to be twoadays i m already feeling too optimistic about buddy s future , and i don t want to feel optimistic i hope for more screeching engines and rebellion , a challenge to buddy s narrowly circumscribed gridiron view of the world it is fitting that friday night lights , which has been so entrenched in ideas of absent fathers would spend its final season in the territory of paternal healing while buddy is trying to get his son on track , vince s father is showing up at the football field and attempting to make up for lost time , though with none of the beseeching you might expect he doesn t feel convincingly sorry for the criminal past that landed him in prison or is it that he just doesn t feel he needs to be sorry \? he seems incapable of real guilt , and you had to wonder when vince made him promise that he d never let his mother get near drugs just how soon we could expect to see her strung out all over again it is stating the obvious to say that we should not trust this guy \? as it happens the caregiver of the week turns out to be mindy , perhaps the only strippermom in the history of pop culture who has not been a clich mindy , so worked up about becky s presence in the riggins household last week , decides that she and billy are the only ones who can save becky from her neglectful father and his cruel , chainsmoking wife the turning point cleary came when becky shared mindy s indignation about the nasty management at the landing strip mindy s bosses were going to demote her to the day shift because they felt she hadn t yet lost enough pregnancy weight to return to the big time by the time mindy witnesses the craziness at becky s house , she is feeling enough sisterinarms warmth toward her to insist on having her move back in indefinitely i wonder when we ll see the return of tim , to whom becky , as her glance at his photo indicated , is clearly grateful and what of the big news \? vince s recruitment at tmu \? and the backdoor methods the program used to snare him in \?
though ballet is no better than other forms of dancing , its capacity for largescale legibility have singular theatrical potency its shapes and lines beam far into space when those geometries meet music , their union occurs not only in the bodies of the dancers the music seems to animate the air around them paradoxically it is often felt more keenly by those in the uppermost rows of the theater than by those seated near the conductor ballet can turn music into physics the connection of time and space becomes full of mysterious significance when i came to ballet in the 1970s , i caught the end of a golden age of ballet musicality it was allabsorbing to compare the musical response of frederick ashton and george balanchine , and it was of consuming importance to register the ways in which anthony dowell , suzanne farrell , margot fonteyn , patricia mcbride , merle park and lynn seymour made music matter our era is not golden in that way yet the winter season at , which ended on sunday , brought more than a few moments when music mattered again the dancing of sara mearns in a number of roles \( in swan lake , balanchine s cort ge hongrois , spring in jerome robbins s four seasons \) has been a consistent source of this profound quality and though she has been preeminent , she has not been alone jared and tyler angle , ashley bouder , robert fairchild , tiler peck \( whose musical gift could match ms mearns s if only she were given worthier repertory \) and teresa reichlen have also led the way , and so those moments in which the emergent junior dancers ashly isaacs , lauren king , lauren lovette and others have seemed to beam music into space have seemed not incidental but part of a wave several dancers are inconsistent wendy whelan , though constant in her authority , seems to slide off the music in her balanchine roles but in alexei ratmansky s concerto dsch can meet the score as if conducting it and some dancers display single aspects of musicality but not others daniel ulbricht s timing is infallible the way he hits the beat , not to mention any punch line , is terrific and this , coupled with his very considerable speed , elevation and \( too facile \) cuteness make him a star but he does n't always make much of the varied dynamics and connections of a phrase anthony huxley \( absorbingly elegant in the astonishingly intricate slow solo in balanchine s square dance \) makes more than mr ulbricht does of gigue in mozartiana , and antonio carmena makes something less sensational but larger than mr ulbricht makes of fall in the four seasons over the last few years fay al karoui , the music director , has done important work in restoring the general quality of city ballet s orchestra in keeping with the company s distinguished track record with modern music , the season has included admirable performances of difficult but fascinating scores like the violin concertos of thomas ad s and esapekka salonen and since the choreography to those works \( wayne mcgregor s outlier and peter martins s mirage \) has been tedious , it s often been more rewarding to watch the orchestra than the stage in more standard repertory , however , mr karoui too often conducts as if the dancers had no other task than to keep up with his insistent pace when they can , magic sometimes occurs , as in most but not all of ms mearns s performance in swan lake but he seeks no special rapport with them of the orchestra s other conductors , andrews sill has recently emerged after the american ballet theater s david lamarche as the city s finest ballet accompanist , but the woodwind and brass sections play poorly for him clotilde otranto , though lacking the best virtues of mr sill and mr karoui , provides a welcome middle ground and the occasional performances of ryan mcadams have been excellent still , if musicality is to take wing again at city ballet , it must be prompted as much by music as by dancing and by casting at least three of balanchine s highestquality ballerina roles were inadequately cast this season mozartiana , la source and walpurgisnacht ballet sanguinic in the four temperaments is danced by jennie somogyi or abi stafford both are welcome performers in the right roles , but neither manage sanguinic s extreme challenges of topspeed definition or vast offbalance stretch though ana sophia scheller s rise throughout the season was impressive , the lead in cort ge hongrois requires a kind of grand authority she ca n't manage yet and while the revival of divertimento no 15 was a highlight of the season , the third of its five ballerina solos by janie taylor and rebecca krohn among the other dancers who also made real advances could be cast much more compellingly anyone can understand the problems facing the ballet master in chief , peter martins none of his 12 female principals were absent longterm with injury he has to distribute the roles fairly while giving opportunities to those below , and he ca n't afford to wield the ruthless favoritism of a balanchine but ms mearns danced only three balanchine roles while the less remarkable \( but more experienced \) megan fairchild danced four , at least two of which need more amplitude than is in her twinkling but smallscale gift what a difference repertory makes ! during the company s fall season i was often happy to go to performances elsewhere this season i wish i could have seen twice as many at city ballet the apportionment of balanchine roles matters particularly now , since the company s spring season starts in may with and includes 19 of his ballets , including the return to repertory of apollo , episodes , the fulllength jewels and la sonnambula i am impatient for it at the company s closing performance on sunday , ms fairchild and mr huxley were both at their best in square dance , while in the four seasons ms mearns danced spring with phrase endings of an exquisite freshness not seen since kyra nichols , the role s originator ms mearns s partner , tyler angle , mr fairchild \( summer \) and especially andrew veyette \( fall \) demonstrated how much they have grown as artists ms bouder , though her irksome archness tends to make her clip phrases too short , demonstrated that specialty of hers and ms peck s seeming to find time to linger within dazzling feats of speed and ms reichlen , that most mysterious of dancers , danced summer with a luscious expansiveness that i would have said was not her style until she proved me wrong actually i have no notion what character ms reichlen does or does not have in many roles the dance seems to pass through her like wine and change the entire color of her being the furious decisiveness of her choleric in the four temperaments is currently definitive , and her siren in prodigal son has an icecold sexual bluntness that astonishes ms mearns , though , goes further , lighting up the stage and infusing her colleagues with her passion for dance as one spring man hurled her to another , the burning line she cut in the air was the epitome of why we go to ballet but it s balanchine choreography that gives a ballerina her highest challenges just now it would do both company and audience good to see ms mearns tackling as large a spectrum of his ballets as can be managed onward ! upward !
washington washington last weekend , while the suzanne farrell ballet was performing at the kennedy center eisenhower theater here , i sometimes could n't help wishing that the company were on a larger stage this week , when in new york , it will be on a stage considerably smaller fortunately , the repertory will be almost entirely different the farrell company , which only dances for a few weeks each year , always tackles a challenging number of ballets , and the endeavor is invariably remarkable this season is the troupe s 10th anniversary i saw two programs in washington , both twice \( six ballets in all \) each performance was better than the one before currently the company numbers 21 dancers and 6 apprentices the eisenhower stage looked densest during the thrilling finale of balanchine s diamonds , which features 34 dancers , including additions from the sarasota ballet of florida diamonds was one of the first ballets in which balanchine successfully addressed the large scale of the new york state theater \( now the david h koch \) at lincoln center , to which his company , new york city ballet , had moved in 1964 , just when ms farrell herself was becoming a luminary among balanchine ballerinas last week her company also tackled three others he made for that stage pithoprakta \( 1968 \) , divertimento from le baiser de la f e' \( 1972 \) and sonatine \( 1975 \) none of these three are among the bestknown balanchine ballets pithoprakta , a production of the farrell company s balanchine preservation initiative , is a true rarity , not seen for decades until ms farrell revived it in 2007 by contrast , these allbalanchine programs also included serenade and concerto barocco , wellestablished classics that have been known the world over for decades familiar or unfamiliar , all these works were at most performances singingly alive the farrell dancers do n't have the technical strength of many other balanchine exponents if you go as a balletomane , looking mostly for star performers , you may well at first be disappointed it s better instead to begin by concentrating on the choreography , which is usually rendered singularly pointed and refreshingly dancey \( not least at corps level \) when in washington , i now take as my companion an old friend who had never watched dance until last year saturday evening s program of serenade , barocco and diamonds prompted him to say that he 'd never before understood just what choreography was whether the steps are simple \( walking , running , a transfer of weight \) or complex , they shone forth as fresh in the diamonds finale , the stage was all the more crowded because the dancing was so expansive but i'm inclined to think that the greatest virtue ms farrell brings out in her dancers is rhythm , with all its capacity for varied expression although i 've seen scores of diamonds , this was the first time i began to note just how balanchine sets a dance rhythm in counterpoint to the music s it s one way he keeps building excitement stravinsky once remarked to balanchine that the young ms farrell was the most musically intelligent dancer he had ever seen now she is passing that quality on hers is an exciting company to keep rewatching season after season , because , in true balanchine tradition , a number of dancers are given all kinds of fasttrack promotions eighteen months ago , the young matthew renko , new to the company , made an immediate impact in a supporting role in donizetti variations a few months later he made a burning impression in the lead role in la source this month he danced one of the greatest male roles in the balanchine repertory , the poetlover hero of the baiser' divertimento , as if his whole heart were alive in each gesture and step every dance became a chapter of spiritual highs and lows , of ardor , inspiration , doubt and loss elisabeth holowchuk is weak for the technical requirements of her lead roles \( the heroines of serenade , pithoprakta and the baiser' divertimento \) , and yet she s never blank or unmotivated she s uncommonly purposeful kirk henning makes a bright impression in barocco and pithoprakta and , like mr renko , as one of the four demisoloists in the diamonds finale he has a radiant manner \( just the way he turns his head to watch his partner move is affecting \) , but what s more seriously radiant is the stretch , depth and immediacy he finds in steps heather ogden , returning to the company after several years , plucked up her feet with wonderful elegance in diamonds there are more stellar ballerinas in the role today than either she or danielle brown of sarasota ballet , who led the alternate cast , but each gave an eloquent , intelligent performance , bringing out details passed over elsewhere violeta angelova danced the leads in both barocco and sonatine a clear , sure dancer , she brought a connectivity of phrasing and range of dynamics to the piece that made it suspenseful \( kara genevieve cooper , as the other barocco ballerina , was even fresher \) in sonatine ms angelova , who can sometimes seem flinty , made a breakthrough into a new level of momentbymoment immediacy , responding to her partner , momchil mladenov , and to the music with changing nuances there are other farrell dancers worthy of discussion not every piece of casting was successful courtney anderson , while firstrate in the fateful serenade role known as the dark angel , was bland in sonatine michael cook , a handsome presence and marvelous partner , does not bring out enough of the nuances in sonatine or the baiser' divertimento mr mladenov s partnering is so excellent and his phrasing so alive that i'm reluctant to point out that his presence is far from youthful but wherever you welcomed dancers , you welcomed choreography more though i bravoed mr renko s performance in the divertimento , what i came out talking about was his role he certainly does n't efface the memory of its creator , helgi tomasson , but he helps me understand anew the astonishing twists and suggestions of this ballet , which seem to contradict its own title there s no baiser \( kiss \) and no f e \( fairy \) , and by the end it has very much stopped being a divertimento no external fate separates the hero and heroine instead psychological impulses within each \( her elusiveness , his streaks of melancholy \) lead them into a love that always has its own breakup built in the ending , with the lovers headed forever away from each other on divergent paths , goes beyond heartbreak into tragic revelation a balanchine ballet exists on multiple levels rhythm , shape , drama here human energy is a matter of private voyage , there it s a whirling social ceremony , and there it s about the irrepressible brio of , it seems , the collective subconscious amid the many versions of the balanchine enterprise to be found today on the stages of this country , the huge range of the little farrell company renders balanchine s diversity at least as large as you 'll find with any larger troupe
he came in to the strains of sinatra singing new york , new york , yielded for traffic updates and plugged sleepy s mattresses yes , on tuesday , former gov david a paterson made his debut as an afternoon drivetime radio host , on woram \( 710 \) i am more excited right now , sitting here , than i was even the day i was sworn in as governor of the state of new york on march 17 , 2008 , mr paterson told listeners and the reason is , this time i had time to think about it since leaving office at the end of 2010 , mr paterson has been a frequent radio guest and guest host , and has made no secret of his desire to get his own show his first guest \? none other than his predecessor as governor , eliot spitzer , whose resignation led to governor paterson s swearingin mr paterson had been mr spitzer s lieutenant governor you 're going to be jerry seinfeld and dan rather , all put together in one , mr spitzer said , encouragingly then , prompted by mr paterson , mr spitzer threw himself into a whirlwind analysis of the stock market s volatility and the economic outlook , the kind of insightful but dry disquisition that may have contributed to the demise of mr spitzer s own shortlived talk show on cnn when the brief chat was over , mr paterson told mr spitzer , i finally got a job that you did n't have to give me there s lots of things i could say , mr spitzer responded , but we 're on live radio mr paterson s debut show was certainly more substantive than typical am radio fare in addition to mr spitzer on the markets , it featured a loose debate between the two candidates to replace anthony d weiner in the ninth congressional district and an interview with william j bratton , a former new york police commissioner , on recent crime problems in the city and in london among the politicians who called in to wish mr paterson well were representative charles b rangel , state senator malcolm a smith and assemblyman francisco p moya , all democrats and longtime acquaintances mr paterson s approach on the air as it was during his rocky tenure in office was largely unscripted hosting the two congressional candidates assemblyman david i weprin , a democrat , and bob turner , a republican he encouraged them to ask each other questions and tried not to get in the way after his talk with mr rangel , he joked with a listener about how the interview went he was on so many subjects , i felt like i was trying to stop a train , but it kept jumping on different tracks ! he also appeared to take a couple of swipes at president obama , whose administration pressured mr paterson not to seek election to a full term last year speaking to mr spitzer , mr paterson said the president seems to stay on the message of hope rather than the implementation of policy he also said of the president s forthcoming jobs speech , is this maybe too little , and maybe even too late \? the show was not all broccoli there was a fair amount of mets banter , and lamentations from mr paterson , a longsuffering met fan , who interviewed met first baseman nick evans mr paterson made a few gaffes , but he employed his most enduring political asset his wit after he repeatedly referred to the ninth congressional district as the eighth district , he told the two candidates the loser can represent the eighth as for the mets , mr paterson , who is legally blind , joked sometimes i do n't see the game as well as everyone else , and it s just the better for it this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo david a paterson in the wor studio for his radio program on tuesday mr paterson s first guest was eliot spitzer , his predecessor as new york governor \( photograph by fred r conrad the new york times \)
camp ashraf , iraq the more than 3 , 000 people living here once represented a powerful paramilitary organization bent on overthrowing the government in iran in the 1970s , the group killed americans in tehran , and after being given refuge by saddam hussein its members were suspected of serving as a mercenary unit that took part in his violent suppression of the kurds in the north of iraq and the shiites in the south now they are unwelcome in iraq but believe they should be given protection in the united states even though their group , known as the people s mujahedeen of iran , remains on the state department s list of terrorist organizations you probably have in mind hawaii , said ambassador lawrence e butler , the american diplomat who has been negotiating with the group in recent sessions here i suspect you do n't want to go to guant namo , he added for the last three months , mr butler , who is the foreign policy adviser to gen lloyd j austin iii , the top american military commander in iraq , has been shuttling back and forth almost every week on the american embassy s behalf between baghdad and camp ashraf , an outpost in diyala province near the iranian border offering humor and bluntness , he has sought to cajole the exiles to leave their camp and avert what will almost certainly be another violent confrontation with the iraqi security forces if they stay as the american military begins its final withdrawal from iraq , the situation at camp ashraf is among the most vexing of the unfinished chapters of the american war here the group adheres to an ideology that is a mix of devout shiism and marxism , and in the initial phase of the war the americans bombed the camp and killed several of its members before disarming the group , which had more than 2 , 000 tanks and armored personnel carriers but the americans later provided security for the camp as the iraqi government , which is friendly with iran , turned hostile to the group a raid on the camp in april by the iraqi army left dozens dead and hundreds wounded mr butler s mission has been to seek a solution that will save residents' lives by first moving them to another camp away from the iranian border , and then to other countries for resettlement his goal is humanitarian , he said he betrayed no sympathies for the group s politics or forgiveness for its misdeeds he wants them to move , he said , because he fears a slaughter at the hands of the iraqi army if they stay that solution has proved tricky , however , because the residents are refusing to leave , and no countries have come forward to welcome them but the clock is ticking , and several times mr butler has reminded members of the group that american forces will be leaving for mr butler , the former ambassador to macedonia whose diplomatic career has placed him across the negotiating table from members of the irish republican army and war criminals in the balkans , the current dealings have proved just as tough if i do n't get assurances that you will move to a new location in iraq , the next round of negotiations could be very short , he admonished the group near the end of the recent session after a halfdozen such sessions , he has made little progress in getting the group to agree to leave the camp before prime minister nuri kamal almaliki s government follows through on its promise to shut it down by the end of the year adding to his difficulties , the group has a formidable and wellfinanced communications machine it has attracted political figures like howard dean and , the retired army general , by paying them to make speeches in support of the group , fueling its resistance to a move and angering officials trying to bargain with it , like mr butler referring to general clark , mr butler asked the group , how much was he paid \? he added , he does n't get out of bed for less than 25 , 000 to this , one member replied that none of the group s famous advocates were doing it for the money i'm guessing about a million dollars was spent on this over the last six months , mr butler said , referring to the overall advocacy campaign if i was on your board of directors , i would n't be pleased with the results he continued , the bad news is , you only have me sitting across the table from you in an interview , general clark acknowledged having been paid by the group , but he said he gives speeches around the world and always offers his own personal opinion based on his many years of government service \( mr dean has previously said publicly that he took speaking fees from the group \) in a written statement , a representative for the group said it had not paid anyone for speeches that the group has access to money from the iranian dissident diaspora is evident in the modern , wellappointed conference room full of flatscreen monitors men in suits served beverages and snacks on silver platters during the recent talks mr butler is keen to puncture what he believes is the false narrative that has sprouted around the group since the american invasion , which has helped it secure such prominent support contrary to widespread belief , he says , the group never provided any valuable intelligence to the americans about mr hussein s government nor , he says , has it provided any useful information about the iranian government or its nuclear program he said that for six years the group provided unreliable information about iran to the defense intelligence agency , which he criticized as having taken years to discern that it was being fed what amounted to a slew of lies they are very good at telling stories , he said of the group through legal actions , the group has managed to get its name removed from terrorist watch lists in britain and the european union a federal lawsuit in the united states resulted in a judge ordering the state department to review its classification of the group the group has not carried out an attack in years , and says it renounced violence in 2001 the state department s public documents show a litany of violent crimes against americans in the 1970s , including the assassination of military officers and executives in tehran these people slaughtered americans , mr butler said out of earshot of the group s representatives during the recent negotiating session they have blood on their hands the americans have offered a plan in which the group s members would vacate this camp , which during mr hussein s tenure served as a military base , and relocate to another site in iraq , where they would disband , an essential step before the united nations would recognize the members as refugees to the outside world , you look like a paramilitary organization , he told them , before adding , as a group you are dangerous for now , mr butler is not optimistic about the prospects of getting the group to move , or disband after a helicopter flight back to the american embassy in baghdad after the session , he shared his worry of a lack of political will back home my prediction is washington is not going to give me any backup , he said it s just poison it s terrorism it s iran it s iraq
the nfl has apparently gotten early holiday shopping fever because instead of following the wisdom of the ages which says there is not much point in firing your head coach until the season ends because a \) your season is already lost and b \) almost everyone you want to interview is employed by another nfl team and ca n't talk to you early anyway teams are festively dumping their coaches because apparently they expect some black fridaylike deal on their next one so if you see bill cowher propped on a bargain table at walmart , please alert the jaguars , chiefs and dolphins on monday , kansas city and miami followed jacksonville s lead and sacked todd haley and tony sparano neither was a surprising move , considering sparano has had his house up for sale since october and the chiefs have spent most of their energies this season actively dousing their fans' high expectations sparano s departure comes with some ill feelings because , everybody else involved with the dolphins shares in the blame for the team s collapse in kansas city , however , the anger is more acute part of that is because , , haley and general manager scott pioli had an antagonistic relationship that poisoned their work as , pioli is hardly blameless for this considering that he hired haley and has yet to prove he is anything other than a poser who lived off the glow of bill belichick s star that haley was hired in a wave of young coaches getting head jobs and none of them have worked out terribly well josh mcdaniels already got the boot from denver and raheem morris is thinking twice about answering his phone these days in tampa bay \( you might have noticed there was also an nfl game monday night , but more likely you overlooked it entirely because it featured , providing more evidence that monday night football has just about hit the bottom rung of possible nfl entertainment go ahead and blame jon gruden , just for the fun of it \) but if you think the nfl has more than its share of ridiculousness , it has nothing on the nba , which has turned into a running punch line as it attempts to trade chris paul from its leagueoperated team , the hornets , to any team but the lakers or anywhere else that cavaliers owner dan gilbert is grumpy about today as , this has become nothing less than a fiasco with trades apparently now scuttled to both the lakers and clippers , that commissioner david stern has far overstepped his bounds , wrecked his credibility and managed to alienate an entire city it was quite a week s work in other nba corners , the magic and dwight howard are hinting they might kiss and make up , , instead of trying to hash out a trade that stern might squash hockey does n't have much in the warmandfuzzy department in college hockey news , boston university center after he was arrested and charged with indecent assault and battery for allegedly breaking into the room of a female student and groping her the nhl is continuing to do its best denydenydeny act on fighting , with the obvious contradiction pointed out by that the league has decided head injuries are worrisome enough to move toward banning hits to the head , except when they are intentionally inflicted by someone s fists all this while the league s most valuable head , sidney crosby s , while he continues to deal with concussion aftereffects all of that might make you wary of heading back out holiday shopping , which seems like a head injury waiting to happen but you never know when you 'll run into an nfl general manager prowling the aisles
the second of two excerpts from a new book , coedited by ferhat guven and mike leach , the former texas tech coach who was hired this week by washington state the book is an anthology of ideas by various experts on innovations taking place in college football the fourth option for judging football teams is to analyze statistical information in order to determine how one team won and the other team lost we assume that the voters in the polls examine the statistics and find the factors that determine the games outcomes the obvious place to look for statistics is in the traditional box score the typical football box score contains only a few basic bits of data that represent action on the field first downs , yards gained , penalty yardage , turnovers , and time of possession each of these statistical categories is subdivided to expose a bit more detail yards gained is subdivided into rushing yards and passing yards , turnovers are subdivided into fumbles and interceptions but basically , these five statistics are entrusted with the task of telling the story of a football game it would be logical to assume that playing performance , as measured by these five statistical categories , should determine the outcome of football games and the teams that performed better in these categories should win most games why else would these few statistics be the primary ones discussed by color analysts and widely reported in the press \? the author conducted an analysis of box score statistics for games played by twentyfour sample teams \( sample 24 teams \) , representing the best teams during the 2010 season , to find a correlation between eyepopping stat sheets and winning the analysis , which simply tracked the frequency with which the teams won without a statistical advantage or lost in spite of having an advantage , revealed that none of the five traditional statistics had a causal relationship with the outcome of the games an unambiguous causeandeffect relationship could be established if winning teams virtually always led in these statistical categories while losing teams virtually always trailed in these categories , but such is not the case these traditional statistics served more as descriptors , like your height , weight , and hair color describe your physical attributes , and failed to explain the game outcomes in the same way that your physical attributes fail to define you as a person the sample 24 teams evidenced a remarkable ability to win football games without an advantage in the traditional statistical categories and suffered a stunning number of losses when they enjoyed a statistical advantage , which means that good teams have capabilities not measured by traditional statistics not only was it impossible to discern a correlation between winning and the traditional statistics , it was nearly impossible to formulate a consistent interpretation of the traditional statistics for example , a team that enjoyed more time of possession may have forced its opponent into repeated threeandout possessions , garnering all the clock time for its own offense just as probably , the team with the dominant clock time might have plodded down the field three yards at a time only to be denied somewhere along the way to the end zone , or it may have been sliced up by an opponent that scored quickly certainly , oregon s quickstrike offense suffered little in 2010 despite trailing in time of possession in eight of its twelve victories first downs were weakly correlated with winning , but this fact defied consistent interpretation as well teams that enjoyed excellent field position naturally required fewer first downs to score than did teams hamstrung by poor field position teams that scored on long offensive plays weren t credited with a first down for the long play while other teams may have racked up six or seven first downs covering the same ground teams that scored with special teams or defensive plays sacrificed offensive possessions and the associated first downs , but used the bonus points to outscore their opponents alabama was the poster child for the firstdown statistic , recording more first downs than all thirteen opponents in 2010 , including against the three opponents that sent the tide to defeat as with first downs , total yardage is more a byproduct of field position than of quality play good field position produces more points but depresses total yardage while poor field position provides the necessary landscape to roll up big yardage if total yardage was a causal factor in winning , all teams would win a high percentage of the games in which they produce more yards , but they don t as a result , it can be said that yardage is often a byproduct of winning , but it cannot be said that yardage is a causal factor of winning and losing football games penalty yardage is usually considered a negative statistic , but its impact is situational an untimely penalty can have a devastating impact on the outcome of a football game , but no distinction is made in the box score between penalties that changed the course of a game and those that were merely irritants in fact , sample 24 teams won more frequently without an advantage in penalty yardage \( 816 percent \) than they did with an advantage \( 772 percent \) , suggesting that aggression is a necessary attribute of winners , even though the aggressive attitude prompts the occasional slap on the wrist the most common event leading to good field position is the turnover of the five traditional statistics , only turnovers had a correlation with winning strong enough to interpret as an influential element in the outcome of football games sample 24 teams won 94 percent of the games in which they committed fewer turnovers , but just 138 percent of the games in which they had more giveaways than takeaways the weaker opponents of sample teams won a mere 337 percent of the games in which they enjoyed an advantage , suggesting that turnovers are like a scalpel in the hands of a surgeon but a dull knife in the hands of a butcher however , highly ranked teams enjoyed a takeawaygiveaway advantage in less than half of their games \( 476 percent \) since turnovers don t necessarily produce victories for ordinary teams , and since even the best teams produce a takeaway advantage in less than half of their contests , turnovers can t be said to have a conclusive causeandeffect impact on winning any more than the other traditional statistics games that can t be explained by box score statistics are commonplace in college football the statistics that seem to explain one set of outcomes fail to produce the similar outcomes in other games teams strive to earn first downs , pile up yardage , dominate the clock , and avoid mistakes and yet the rewards for these achievements are inconsistent and unpredictable north carolina had more time of possession , more first downs , more total yards , fewer penalty yards , and one less turnover than lsu but still lost its season opener nevada had no statistical advantages in its game against fresno state yet managed a one point victory ohio state gained more yards , surrendered fewer penalty yards , ate more clock time , and committed the same number of turnovers as wisconsin and yet was knocked out of the no 1 ranking by the badgers in a 3118 rout while there is always the possibility that football is a silly game that can be won without the systematic application of any specific skills , a safer bet is that box score statistics were meant to explain the outcome of football games , but simply do a poor job of it michael nemeth is a senior executive for a global information technology firm who has guided the

cleveland derek jeter and joe girardi spoke sometime around 11 30 pm tuesday in the visiting manager s office at progressive field , and their conversation spilled over into a series of latenight text messages jeter tried to change his mind , lobbying girardi to play wednesday night against the indians , convincing him that he did not need a rest having determined that jeter would receive one of the next five games off before the allstar break , girardi wanted time to think he spoke to the head trainer gene monahan , who assured girardi that jeter was healthy , then told jeter that he would sleep on the decision a few hours later , he awoke with a different perspective i got a sense that he s thinking about it and he wants to get this done with so he can go on and be derek jeter , girardi said not derek jeter pursuing 3 , 000 hits at 2 , 996 after going 2 for 6 tuesday , jeter started and batted leadoff wednesday , something he will do every game until he reaches the milestone , however long it takes it occurred to girardi that sitting jeter on wednesday would increase the pressure on him to get the four remaining hits this weekend at yankee stadium , where the yankees open a fourgame series thursday against tampa bay after the allstar break , they embark on an eightgame trip , and girardi wanted to give jeter every opportunity to notch no 3 , 000 as soon as possible i would love to see it get done over this weekend , and if that s what we have to do , that s what we have to do , said girardi , who solicited input from general manager brian cashman the one thing in thinking about this overnight and this morning , what i realized is none of us know what it s like to be close to 3 , 000 hits , we don t know what s going through his mind i just started thinking , you know , maybe it s a lot worse , in a sense , if you re sitting around thinking about it to borrow a phrase from jeter , it is not as if he sits around thinking about it but it is very much a part of him now , as more members of the national news media have arrived every day , asking him dozens of questions about the chase he accommodates them all , looking reporters in the eye , but during a sevenandahalfminute interview wednesday , he came across as detached i always want to play , jeter said that doesn t change that s always been the case when you miss that much time , you want to play games and get back into a routine he added , if i had 500 , hits , i d still be wanting to play jeter has recorded at least four hits in a game 37 previous times , and has had success against cleveland s starter wednesday , the righthander justin masterson , going 5 for 12 off him he betrayed no signs of the pursuit weighing on him , though girardi sprinkled his thoughtful responses with phrases like get this out of the way or get over with and get through it , as if it has become a burden instead of a celebration of a superb career when asked whether he would rather hit no 3 , 000 at home or on the road , jeter played coy when i said i wanted to do it at home , that s when we were at home , jeter said if i say that i want to do it at home now , is that saying i don t want to get a hit every time up , you know what i mean \? really i take it atbat to atbat and try to do your job every atbat , and that doesn t change the yankees would prefer it happens at yankee stadium , and they might have some control over the situation girardi said he would have to consider pulling jeter if he had three hits wednesday night and the yankees were winning i m going to manage to win the game , that s the bottom line , girardi said i would love for him to be 3 for 3 and we have a big lead but i don t know what i would do i hope i would get in that situation , that he s 3 for 3 and we have a big lead that would be nice inside pitch mariano rivera said that it wouldn t be the worst to sit out a third consecutive game wednesday with a sore right triceps , but that he would definitely be available to pitch thursday night against the rays
stop me if you ve heard this one elected officials in southern states barring the schoolhouse door , shaking their fists at the federal government over civil rights , the constitution and their right to oppress minority groups without washington s meddling in our time , the great fight against racist policies is over immigration reform moderate americans want it to resolve the problem of tens of millions of illegal immigrants coming to do jobs americans don t want and do better themselves extremists do not want it , and they seem to be willing to do anything to stop it arizona has been one battleground now it is alabama , which has the most outrageous antiimmigration laws in the nation including the requirement that schools check the immigration status of students and their parents the justice department has sued alabama , just as it sued arizona over its antiimmigrant laws and after reports of bullying and harassment and of terrified parents keeping their children home from school , justice asked 39 school superintendents for data on absences and withdrawals alabama s attorney general , luther strange , responded with the absurd declaration that washington had no legal right to do that actually it does , under the civil rights act and the equal educational opportunities act the fair housing act , the safe streets act , the violent crime control and law enforcement act , and the fair labor standards act , also apply to aspects of alabama s crackdown on hispanic immigrants so senators jim demint of south carolina , david vitter of louisiana and jeff sessions of alabama decided to avoid all those annoying laws and introduce legislation barring the use of federal money to sue over a state s immigration policies lawrence downes , who covers immigration for the editorial board , said this is a bitter example of what has happened since federal immigration reform died during the administration of president george w bush , who supported reform , by the way lawrence said in the absence of federal immigration reform , states are going rogue , passing laws designed to terrorize vulnerable populations justice has already sued arizona , alabama , and south carolina , charging that their homegrown immigration schemes , designed to force undocumented immigrants out of state and underground , are an unconstitutional intrusion onto federal turf they are that but to mr vitter , mr demint and mr sessions , this is none of the federal government s business we re working to stop these politically driven lawsuits by cutting off the ability for the obama administration to use taxpayers money to pay for them , mr vitter said in a news release it s interesting isn t it \? republican politicians oppose states rights to provide marriage equality under the law for all americans and to investigate illegal gun trafficking from other states but oppress minorities , and they re suddenly all gung ho about states rights the times editorial board will continue monitoring the situation in alabama we wrote about the fight over the schools last sunday coming up , we ll examine the ways the crackdown is harming american citizens , and damaging the state s economy no state has the right to violate sacred constitutional guarantees of equality and due process our country settled that issue long ago , the hard way
greenburgh , ny after all the have endured the losing and the lawsuits , the infighting and the pettiness , the empty rhetoric and the false promises , the misguided trades , the bloated contracts and jerome james a little celebration would have been rightly justified sunday night at madison square garden a blueandorange confetti shower some glittery streamers or at least a raucous standing ovation yet a moment that was seven years in the making the knicks' return to the playoffs drew little more than polite applause no dancing , no whooping , just quiet relief like a weight s been taken off , coach mike d'antoni said monday afternoon already , the knicks are indulging the usual clich s about not being satisfied with the mere act of making the playoffs these are necessary disclaimers , but they ignore the franchise s recent history , a decadelong stretch of utter futility and dysfunction , when the most compelling drama was found in the courtroom and rarely on the garden hardwood amar'e stoudemire came to new york last summer to change all of that and chauncey billups arrived in late february to join the cause they have struggled mightily , losing 12 of 22 games together , but they met their first modest goal with sunday s 123107 rout of cleveland the knicks will be in the playoffs , probably as a sixth or seventhseeded team , possibly with a losing or 500 record , and with long odds of escaping the first round but they will no longer own the nba s longest playoff drought \( an ignominy they shared with the minnesota timberwolves \) stoudemire made this his mission last july when he became the first certified star to commit to the rebuilding effort when the moment arrived sunday , stoudemire said , it was extremely emotional but his tone conveyed more satisfaction than elation stoudemire has been this far before , making the playoffs in six of his eight seasons in phoenix , with three trips to the western conference finals anthony s denver nuggets made the playoffs seven times billups played in seven straight conference finals six in the east , one in the west none of the three were here for the isiah thomas trial , nor lived through the larry brownstephon marbury feud , the brownthomas feud , the marburythomas feud or the countless other moments of infamy and shame that shrouded the franchise for a halfdecade the three carry neither the scars nor the burdens of the isiah era i have n't , thank goodness , billups said of playing in such a dark environment i have n't been in anything like that before and while stoudemire has been living in manhattan long enough to appreciate the city s anguish , neither he nor billups nor anthony felt the weight that d'antoni did , of losing for two years while purposefully purged the old roster toney douglas \( drafted in 2009 \) is now the longest continuously tenured knick on monday , anthony paid tribute to the players who were traded for him wilson chandler , danilo gallinari and raymond felton the guys who established that foundation for us to be in this situation the statement was classy , but also accurate the pretrade knicks were two games over 500 , providing the buffer that the posttrade knicks needed to clinch the playoff bid now comes the awkward part for a franchise that at its core remains volatile and politically charged , the garden chairman , has until april 30 to pick up walsh s contract option for next season he has given no indication that he plans to do so d'antoni is under contract through 2012 , but his fate is likely tied to walsh s imagine the scene at the garden in two weeks if the chants of deefense are interspersed with chants of extend donnie while the knicks engage in their first playoff battle since 2004 with the postseason now assured and his agent attending monday s practice , d'antoni was asked jokingly if he was pushing for an extension of his own yeah , he said with a laugh , adding , through the end of the season dolan may be waiting to gauge the knicks' playoff success before extending anyone s deal but this is the team he wanted , having pushed through the anthony trade over walsh and d'antoni s welldocumented concerns there is nothing inspiring about the knicks' 3838 record , nor the threegame winning streak that got them to this point they needed overtime to beat a depleted orlando team , then slugged out a victory over the lowly nets before bullying the abysmal cavaliers the anthonyled knicks have yet to play with the sort of fluidity , selflessness and aesthetic joy that the stoudemireled knicks displayed before the trade that team was not dominant by any stretch , but it had an identifiable star , a willing supporting cast and a clearly defined mission the knicks kept the ball moving and the pace frantic at their best , they won 13 of 14 games and pushed seven games over 500 they were young and evolving , which made their triumphs all the more enjoyable for a longsuffering fan base when the knicks acquired anthony , they traded youth for experience and modest hopes for unreasonable expectations as if the mere appearance of two star players would ensure instant title contention in all likelihood , the stoudemireanthony knicks will lose in the first round , just as the pretrade knicks would have but one imagines that gallinari and chandler would have exulted a little upon clinching their first playoff berth and that the garden might have enjoyed a little exhilaration , rather than simple relief
joe girardi says he got to know dante bichette in 1993 , when both joined the colorado rockies , an expansion team the rockies lost 95 games and were outscored by more than 200 runs , and girardi and bichette were about as opposite as two players could get he s more of a free spirit , and everybody knows how i am , so we don t need to go into that , girardi , the rather intense manager of the yankees , said with a chuckle tuesday afternoon but girardi and bichette became lasting friends girardi remembered tuesday how dante and marianna bichette would stay at his house when the rockies played in chicago girardi recalled how he would take dante jr , their infant son , for car rides to get him to fall asleep on monday , the yankees drafted dante bichette jr , an 18yearold third baseman from maitland , fla , with their first selection , the 51st overall pick girardi said the yankees took bichette because he was the best player available but girardi also said , i m thrilled to death , because i ve known this little guy for a long time at 6 feet 1 inch , 215 pounds , bichette is no longer such a little guy , but he has a history with girardi the yankees and the boston red sox have a history , too , but that did not stop the red sox from stepping into bronx territory with their secondround draft pick with the 81st overall selection , the red sox drafted williams jerez , an outfielder from brooklyn , who played recently for an amateur team known as hank s yanks , which is sponsored in part by hank steinbrenner hank s yanks were assembled by ray negron , the yankees community adviser , and his friend herman hernandez ii as a way to give players ages 15 to 18 from varied socioeconomic backgrounds a chance to be seen by major league scouts in the summer negron was delighted with the boston pick he s a terrific player who will play in the major leagues , and a wonderful kid , negron said tuesday of jerez , who played scholastically at grand street campus in brooklyn when asked if it bothered him that the red sox , the yankees bitter rival , took a player who got attention because of a project started by a steinbrenner , negron said , we got kids off the street playing baseball that s what this was about in the fourth round , the yankees drafted another member of hank s yanks matt duran , a shortstop from new rochelle \( ny \) high school who hit 10 home runs and nearly 600 in the scholastic season negron said the yankees got the better player in duran bichette has committed to attend the university of georgia , but he said he planned to turn professional as soon as possible , and not just to play for a manager whom he still calls uncle joe \( bichette said , i think i m going to have to stop that \) it s the most prestigious club around , bichette said in a conference call i think there s nothing better than being a yankee you grow up as a little kid dreaming of being a yankee , of hitting a home run in yankee stadium bichette s father , now 47 , played 14 major league seasons , but none for the yankees dante bichette jr described his hitting style as pretty much the same as his father s dante jr hit 640 with 10 home runs in 30 games this year for orangewood christian school bichette also played in the 2005 little league world series for a team from maitland that also included tanner stanley , the son of the former major league catcher mike stanley i ve seen junior basically working at this his whole life , girardi said girardi said he awoke tuesday to text messages notifying him of the yankees pick before batting practice , he said he had talked to dante sr , but not to his son eighteen years seemed as if they had flown past you think , this is the kid we drafted today , and it s the kid i was trying to get to sleep in that car seat , girardi said , smiling again inside pitch derek jeter , who entered the day 14 hits shy of 3 , 000 , batted leadoff for the yankees against the red sox on tuesday , but joe girardi used him as a designated hitter for the fifth time this season instead of at shortstop eduardo nunez started at shortstop and batted ninth asked if he wanted to give jeter an opportunity to reach 3 , 000 hits on a 10game homestand , girardi said you can t physically wear him down or risk hurting him to do that we re going to have to be smart about doing this we re going to play it pretty much the same way we have all year long
san antonio jacquelyn f callanen was neither a plaintiff nor a defendant in the redistricting case that the decided to hear last week but her life and her office went from calm to chaos because of it ms callanen is the elections administrator for bexar county in southcentral texas , home to san antonio and 17 million residents the supreme court s decision temporarily blocked a set of district maps that ms callanen and other officials around the state were going to use in next year s elections less than 90 days before the scheduled march 6 primary , ms callanen has no electoral map in place for congressional and state house and senate districts in bexar county , and none are in effect in any other county either much of the political geography of the country s secondbiggest state , in other words , has essentially vanished a redistricting dispute between the state and minority groups has turned the legality of two sets of rival electoral maps into a question mark , creating uncertainty about the election schedule and what impact changing it will have on local elections , voter turnout , state party conventions in june , gov s presidential bid and county budgets lawyers , lawmakers and a san antonio panel of federal judges are now debating delaying the primary and splitting it into two elections because of the uncertainty after the supreme court s decision to hear the case on jan 9 but as they argue the political and legal consequences of maintaining , pushing back or splitting the primary , ms callanen has more practical worries adding an additional primary and a runoff next year would cost the county an extra 560 , 000 , not counting the roughly 150 , 000 it would cost for any second mailing of voter registration cards , she said meanwhile , none of the preparatory work for a march primary has been done , and her department on the third floor of a county building here is unusually quiet hundreds of variations of democratic and republican ballots would have already been programmed and proofed by each party the machines that count absentee ballots and electronic votes on election day would have completed , or be in the middle of , testing about 900 , 000 voter registration cards , each one identifying the district a voter lives in , would have been mailed , as required by state law up to 2 , 400 temporary election workers would be undergoing training now , the ballots have neither been programmed , proofed nor printed , the machines have not been tested , no cards have been printed or mailed and none of the training has been done all because there are no usable districts but at least 10 , 000 envelopes for absentee ballots for military service members have been organized and printed with the nowuncertain march 6 primary date everybody has to handle these 10 , 000 all over again , because i'm not going to throw them out , ms callanen said wednesday we have to have the jurisdictions to tie to the addresses before we can even think about holding an election we 're at a standstill we 're at an absolute standstill the day before , at a hearing that had been called by the threejudge panel here to figure out when to hold the primary , officials from several counties , including ms callanen , testified that splitting the primary into two elections would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and would probably confuse voters and hurt turnout the top elected official in maverick county in south texas , county judge david saucedo , told the panel that he did not know where the county would get the more than 170 , 000 needed to run an additional primary and runoff , adding that he would have to let go of a few employees we would have to downsize in other departments , judge saucedo said throughout the day , the activity in the courtroom resembled not so much a hearing as a brainstorming session during breaks , lawyers for the state democratic and republican parties huddled together , encouraged to do so by the three judges , who had as many questions as the lawyers did one set of maps , drawn by the republicancontrolled legislature , would help republicans maintain their power in congressional and state house and senate districts the other set , created by the three federal judges , would increase the power of democrats and hispanic and black voters , by giving them as many as four additional seats in congress and about a dozen in the state house the primaries had been scheduled for march 6 , with runoffs on may 22 and the general election on nov 6 democrats and lawyers for the texas democratic party are pushing for a single unified primary to be held , whether on march 6 or some later date the question has divided republicans many republican lawmakers including 15 of the state s 19 republican state senators want a single primary as well , but lawyers for the republican party of texas and its chairman have suggested holding the presidential and statewide primaries on march 6 as planned , and conducting the other elections at some later date lawyers for attorney general greg abbott said the state was not taking a position on whether to split the primary , and deferred the matter to the political parties republican party lawyers questioned whether the federal court had jurisdiction to move the dates of the presidential and statewide primaries , since none of those elections are part of the case before the judges republicans could benefit from having the presidential primary remain on march 6 , giving texas a voice on super tuesday and an early primary rather than a later one could also benefit mr perry , the republican governor , who has struggled in the presidential race recently by the time super tuesday rolls around , everyone is seeing on their tv screens delegate counts for each candidate , said james henson , the director of the texas politics project at the university of texas at austin and the perry campaign is clearly counting on texas being a big contributor to their count they 're trying to build momentum , and they 've got high expectations for texas the farther back that primary date goes the more it hurts them the threejudge panel extended the filing deadline for all candidates from thursday to monday and agreed to have the filing period reopen at a later date , so applications can be filed , amended or withdrawn when a set of legal maps is in place but the judges left unresolved the issue of what to do about the march primary it was left unsettled because lawyers for the two parties and the minority groups in the lawsuit failed to agree on a new election schedule the lawyers from the various sides , including the attorney general s office , are to meet thursday in austin the lawyers are trying to select a mediator to help produce an agreement on a new timetable
reykjavik , iceland the dust from iceland s spectacular financial disaster the failure of its three biggest banks and then the in the fall of 2008 had barely begun to settle when the country set about finding someone to blame the bankers , surely a governmentappointed special prosecutor has named more than 200 people as official suspects in a case that appears bound to result in criminal charges the politicians , certainly voters expressed their disgust with the longgoverning in the 2009 elections but the desire for justice and retribution is deep and complicated , and iceland has taken an unusual step in the strange annals of the world financial crisis it is pursuing criminal charges against a politician , , for his government s failure to avert the catastrophe the against mr haarde , delivered by a sharply divided parliament , charges him with violations committed from february 2008 through the beginning of october of the same year , by intent or gross neglect , mostly violations against the laws of ministerial responsibility he showed , it continues , serious nonfeasance of his duties as prime minister in the face of major danger looming over icelandic financial institutions and the state treasury his great sin was one of omission , said atli gislason , a member of parliament and the leader of the commission that prepared the case against mr haarde the wrong thing he did was to do nothing , mr gislason said he just did nothing if found guilty by a special court , mr haarde , a stalwart of the conservative independence party who served as prime minister from june 2006 until february 2009 , faces a maximum sentence of two years in prison in some ways , the case was meant to serve as a way for iceland to hold its leaders to account and then move on but if anything , even as iceland s economy is starting to , mr haarde s indictment has made a cynical population even more suspicious recent polls show that trust in parliament is at an alltime low there s been a change in atmosphere , said kristrun heimisdottir , an adviser to the minister of economic affairs there was so much anger and so much thirst to see someone hang , but now people are saying , is this really fair \? is this really all geir s fault \? ' the problem , said , a professor and dean of the law faculty at the university of iceland , is that questions of law and politics have gotten mixed up when you have a situation with lots of anger , decisions that should be taken objectively and carefully tend to be contaminated by politics and emotion , he said in an interview at a hearing on monday , mr haarde s lawyers will argue that the case should be dismissed on numerous procedural grounds , including that the charges have never been properly investigated and that the indictment is too vague to meet legal standards if their motion fails and mr haarde exhausts his pretrial appeals , the case would be heard early next year by a neverbeforeconvened court for cases involving government malfeasance mr haarde , 60 , said he had committed no crime , that the events that led to the crash were far too complicated to be distilled to a crude political prosecution of a single person , and that he was certain that he would be vindicated with hindsight , it s hard to disagree that we could have done some things differently , he said in an interview but this is a political trial cloaked as a criminal prosecution my political enemies are trying to go after and punish me and my party even some legislators who voted to indict mr haarde say they are troubled by the way the case has unfolded last fall , a special parliamentary commission investigating the crash dusted off an old law and identified four people , mr haarde and three of his ministers , who could be held criminally responsible but after a series of political maneuvers that left normally collegial lawmakers shouting furiously at one another on the floor of parliament , the lawmakers voted 3330 to indict only mr haarde this is parliament deciding that we 're going to punish one person who happens to be former head of the conservatives we 're not going to prosecute our people , said , an expert on iceland at the london school of economics so it becomes a political prosecution i think it s a major mistake either do all of them , or none many icelanders agree he was one of the architects of the collapse in iceland there s no doubt about that , said arnar thorisson , a 42yearold cinematographer who was strolling through downtown reykjavik the other day the party he came from ruined iceland but i would want to see more people prosecuted , not just him if any politician is more culpable than others , many people believe it is , mr haarde s old friend and mentor , who was prime minister from 1991 to 2004 during his tenure , iceland privatized its banks and liberalized the banking laws , paving the way for a brief period of prosperity and the banks' risky and ultimately selfdestructive behavior after mr oddsson left politics , he became chairman of the , in charge of overseeing the system he had helped create he was forced out of that job in 2009 and is now editor in chief of , one of iceland s largest newspapers and a champion of the independence party he is the king , and we are sort of hanging the prince , said eirikur bergmann , director of the in iceland this is also why people have ill feelings about this , because in many ways this is the wrong guy before this court but regardless of the outcome , a trial may do little to assuage iceland s anger we 're still far away from coming to terms with the events in a balanced manner , said gunnar helgi kristinsson , a political science professor at the university of iceland however it ends , i'm sure it will be a bad thing if he s not guilty , people will consider it typical of a system where nobody is held accountable on the other hand , if he is guilty , he 'll be standing there almost as if he s the only one who s responsible and everyone knows that s unfair
disco may have died , gone undercover or been lying in wait along with other 1970s fixtures like oil crises , economic malaise and widelegged pants in any case , it is being recalibrated for siriusxm , the satellite radio broadcaster , which is starting a fouronthefloor channel called studio 54 on aug 15 , the company will announce on wednesday studio 54 radio , available on channel 15 , will be a roundtheclock broadcast of dance and disco hits , rare remixes and deep cuts , many from the collection of djs and habitu s of studio 54 , the eradefining manhattan club run by steve rubell and ian schrager john jellybean benitez , the producer known for early madonna songs like borderline and holiday , who went from patron to dj at studio 54 , will serve as the channel s executive producer people are still dancing to these songs 30 years later , mr benitez , who is firmly in the disconeverdied camp , said by phone monday from ft lauderdale , where he was preparing for a club gig the music of the 1970s and early 80s , he added , still lifts today mr benitez is soliciting tracks from other djs from the disco era and will open his own vault of tens of thousands of cds , 45s , 8tracks and reeltoreels for the station , relishing the opportunity to play music that has not been heard on the radio before dance versions of songs that weren t even commercially available at the time none of these songs have music videos , or very few of them , so as soon as you hear the song , it really triggers an emotion rather than a visual , he said , before launching into a nostalgia reverie you could be in high school , in college , you could be dancing on a speaker in a nightclub it touches people in a way that current music doesn t along with the chance to brush up to bianca jagger and andy warhol , that was part of the appeal of studio 54 it was all emotion , mr benitez said it was all about dancing and having fun and being free , and being uninhibited and letting go most people went to clubs , they left their troubles at the door and went on the dance floor it was a very tribal , communal kind of feeling the station will milk all the feelings of studio 54 in its weekly interview program , the marc and myra show , hosted by marc benecke , studio 54 s former doorman , and myra scheer , the onetime executive assistant to rubell , who died in 1989 their guests will include seemingly everyone who still has a discoglitz story to tell , from the club s original head of security to its waiters and busboys no editing allowed it s the only place you ll be able to hear what actually happened there , said mr benitez , 53 , who first went to the club in the summer of 77 when the bronx was burning , he recalled i was with another dj named tony carrasco we d come down from the bronx and we were determined to get in there it was an eyeopening experience , for sure you had straight people and gay people , white people , black people , movie stars , sports stars and people from the bronx and queens everybody was a celebrity there , everybody just looked fabulous on their first attempt to get in , mr benitez and mr carrasco waited in line with the plebians dressed in probably the flyest thing i owned at the time , mr benitez said , i went right up to the front and just looked steve right in the eye and said , you gotta let me in and he said , who are you with \? they got in within a few years mr benitez was manning the decks inside the club as a dj at studio 54 , you got to take a lot of risks , he said wistfully those people had to act like they d been before , so they danced to everything studio 54 radio replaces bbc radio 1 , which broadcasts everything from american hiphop to european electronica and scottish indie rock that channel was eliminated on monday the switch which has been unpopular with some fans , who have taken to facebook , twitter and other outlets to voice their displeasure a get bbc radio 1 back on sirius xm page on facebook has garnered over 1000 likes in the brief time it has existed we routinely review our programming lineup to provide the best programming for subscribers , patrick reilly , senior vice president of communications for siriusxm said in a statement we are proud of our relationship with the bbc , whose bbc world service we also broadcast we will continue to explore programming opportunities to work with the bbc in the future
in the wake of the shootings in tucson , the familiar questions inevitably resurfaced are communities where more people carry guns safer or less safe \? does the availability of highcapacity magazines increase deaths \? do more rigorous background checks make a difference \? the reality is that even these and other basic questions cannot be fully answered , because not enough research has been done and there is a reason for that scientists in the field and former officials with the government agency that used to finance the great bulk of this research say the influence of the national rife association has all but choked off money for such work we 've been stopped from answering the basic questions , said mark rosenberg , former director of the , part of the federal , which was for about a decade the leading source of financing for firearms research chris cox , the s chief lobbyist , said his group had not tried to squelch genuine scientific inquiries , just politically slanted ones our concern is not with legitimate medical science , mr cox said our concern is they were promoting the idea that gun ownership was a disease that needed to be eradicated the amount of money available today for studying the impact of firearms is a fraction of what it was in the mid1990s , and the number of scientists toiling in the field has dwindled to just a handful as a result , researchers say the dearth of money can be traced in large measure to a clash between public health scientists and the nra in the mid1990s at the time , dr rosenberg and others at the cdc were becoming increasingly assertive about the importance of studying gunrelated injuries and deaths as a public health phenomenon , financing studies that found , for example , having a gun in the house , rather than conferring protection , significantly increased the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance alarmed , the nra and its allies on capitol hill fought back the injury center was guilty of putting out papers that were really political opinion masquerading as medical science , said mr cox , who also worked on this issue for the nra more than a decade ago initially , progun lawmakers sought to eliminate the injury center completely , arguing that its work was redundant and reflected a political agenda when that failed , they turned to the appropriations process in 1996 , representative jay dickey , republican of arkansas , succeeded in pushing through an amendment that stripped 26 million from the disease control centers' budget , the very amount it had spent on firearmsrelated research the year before it s really simple with me , mr dickey , 71 and now retired , said in a telephone interview we have the right to bear arms because of the threat of government taking over the freedoms that we have the senate later restored the money but designated it for research on traumatic brain injury language was also inserted into the centers' appropriations bill that remains in place today none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the centers for disease control and prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control the prohibition is striking , firearms researchers say , because there are already regulations that bar the use of cdc money for lobbying for or against legislation no other field of inquiry is singled out in this way in the end , researchers said , even though it is murky what exactly is allowed under this provision and what is not , the upshot is clear inside the centers the agency should tread in this area only at its own peril they had a neardeath experience , said dr arthur kellermann , whose on the risks versus the benefits of having guns in the home became a focal point of attack by the nra in the years since , the cdc has been exceedingly wary of financing research focused on firearms in its annual requests for proposals , for example , firearms research has been notably absent gail hayes , spokeswoman for the centers , confirmed that since 1996 , while the agency has issued requests for proposals that include the study of violence , which may include gun violence , it had not sent out any specifically on firearms for policy to be effective , it needs to be based on evidence , said , director of the violence prevention research program at the university of california , davis , who had his cdc financing cut in 1996 the national rifle association and its allies in congress have largely succeeded in choking off the development of evidence upon which that policy could be based private foundations initially stepped into the breach , but their attention tends to wax and wane , researchers said they are also much more interested in work that leads to immediate results and less willing to finance basic epidemiological research that scientists say is necessary to establishing a foundation of knowledge about the connection between guns and violence , or the lack thereof the national institute of justice , part of the justice department , also used to finance firearms research , researchers said , but that money has also petered out in recent years \( institute officials said they hoped to reinvigorate financing in this area \) , founding director of the johns hopkins center for gun policy and research , estimated that the amount of money available for firearms research was a quarter of what it used to be with so much uncertainty about financing , mr teret said , the circle of academics who study the phenomenon has fallen off significantly after the centers' clash with the nra , mr teret said he was asked by cdc officials to curtail some things i was saying about guns and gun policy mr teret objected , saying his public comments about gun policy did not come while he was on the cdc meter after he threatened to file a lawsuit against the agency , mr teret said , the officials backed down and gave him a little bit more leeway cdc financing for research on gun violence has not stopped completely , but it is now mostly limited to work in which firearms are only a component the centers also ask researchers it finances to give it a headsup anytime they are publishing studies that have anything to do with firearms the agency , in turn , relays this information to the nra as a courtesy , said thomas skinner , a spokesman for the centers invariably , researchers said , whenever their work touches upon firearms , the cdc becomes squeamish in the end , they said , it is often simply easier to avoid the topic if they want to continue to be in the agency s good graces , professor and chairman of emergency medicine at the medical college of wisconsin , used to direct a research center , financed by the cdc , that focused on gun violence , but he said he had now shifted his attention to other issues
when nic screws , the at esquire magazine , analyzed and , she saw more than two quarterbacks who will meet sunday in the playoffs from two men as at ease in suits as in shoulder pads , she saw comfort urban style \( brady \) compared with fancy sunglasses and shiny ties \( sanchez \) , along with good hair \( both \) screws called brady and sanchez the glamazons of quarterbacks her take on their styles is remarkably similar to the opinions of football insiders on their games sanchez is basically brady nine years , three super bowls , two children and one supermodel wife ago brady is pretty much the optimal career blueprint for sanchez both appreciate quality clothes and nice style , screws wrote in an email but they vary on execution and although they both look good in a threepiece suit , i prefer brady his fit trumps sanchez s flair in his , brady is football s fashionista he is married to gisele b ndchen , a brazilian model they often spend time in manhattan he wears , as linebacker bart scott noted , stylish pocket squares , a male model touch that prompted to label brady a style icon because he dares to mix traditional american blueblazer looks with european minimalism in his , sanchez has , well , none of that not yet , anyway he likes to say he is married to the jets but he is not a monk he has been linked to the actress jamielynn sigler he lives on a golf course in suburban new jersey with a practicesquad wide receiver , patrick turner despite his prenfl in gq magazine , sanchez eschews most photo shoots , for now at least brady s a lot closer to having that madison avenue connection , said nick sanchez , mark s older brother and adviser he s in that world people like to think of mark in that way , and i guess he cleans up all right but he s 24 he wears flipflops and shorts every day he s really just a kid who s growing up and evolving into something like that david carter , a professor at sanchez s alma mater , the university of southern california , and an , said that each quarterback had taken a similar and correct career approach athletes with shorter shelf lives , like olympians , must capitalize on their first brush with fame , carter said for those like brady and sanchez , stars in major markets who play for respected franchises , the ability to distinguish themselves off the field not only exists , but also comes with what carter called tremendous upside he added , sanchez , like brady , has been able to grow his brand methodically rather than risk making personal branding errors early that , carter said , along with championships , good health and avoidance of scandal would equate to substantial endorsement dollars over a long period the drafted brady in the sixth round in 2000 , and he spent his first season on the bench , his style closer to goofy than gucci sanchez was drafted fifth over all in 2008 , dropped into the nation s biggest newsmedia market and instructed to start and win immediately each surrounded himself with a small team of experts who waded through endorsements with great care , who said no dozens of times , even hundreds , for every yes brady arrived in the public eye almost by accident nick sanchez said his brother was dropped on a treadmill going full speed sanchez operates under the premise that he has not accomplished anything , and by brady s standards , he has not the jets' own style icon , quarterback joe namath , agreed with that approach these days , namath provides football analysis at his web site , , but in offfield pursuits , brady more closely resembles him than sanchez in namath s day , he said , quarterbacks and true superstars took commercial endorsements to augment their football income he called that important money but sanchez , with in jets history , with 28 million guaranteed , can take a more careful approach as far as commercials and extra jobs and all that , it will come , namath said sanchez has a great opportunity there as a football player , as long as he keeps his basic job first , which he has been doing in the spring of 2005 , brady posed for the cover of gq and an allamericantype photo spread , as an admiral and a cowboy and even , yes , a ranch hand cradling a baby goat michael hainey , the of gq , said that issue transformed brady from a mere superstar athlete to a real cultural force hainey added it certainly raised his awareness among marketers and fashion people it probably raised his profile in gisele s world hainey said he thought sanchez would reach a similar level , would have his own gq cover , someday soon hainey sees this playoff game as brady , the ceo with the stylish wardrobe and the model wife , against sanchez , the upandcomer who looks good but not that good , who has it good but not that good , not brady good , not yet to that end , hainey said sanchez came across as the more real , more likable quarterback , and brady as the more polished one michael kimmel , a sociologist at stony brook university manhood in america a cultural history , said such comparisons date back further than the rivalry between the jets and the patriots to illustrate his point , kimmel emailed a cartoon from the 1980s it depicted two overweight , workingclass new yorkers glaring at a welldressed boston beanpole whose bonsai course ran late kimmel said that other than the yankees and their corporate pinstripes , new york teams are portrayed as workingclass , joe lunchbucket types compared with their boston counterparts sanchez and brady illustrate that contrast , kimmel said brady is the archetype metrosexual in a funny way , he resembles joe namath more than any quarterback i can remember , with his long hair and fashion sanchez barely remembers how to shave he s an ethnic minority he leads a bunch of loudmouths they 're perfect for this contrast as if on cue , sanchez came through the jets' locker room thursday , unshaven , dressed in sweats two years ago , his first minicamp with the jets coincided with the publication of his gq spread , which ultimately proved misleading hainey said gq employees at the photo shoot found sanchez shy and reserved if anything , he has taken the same approach to his celebrity , confining most of his outside activity , the red carpets and such , to the offseason perhaps one day , sanchez will reach brady s level , as defined when gq named him one of 50 icons of cool perhaps because although sanchez shares with brady rugged good looks and heartthrob status , he does not yet match brady in the most important category , the one that makes all the outside interests , all the endorsements , possible to get there , he will need to win the whole thing , win the and get close consistently , kimmel said sanchez has done very well but you do n't reach cultural icon without a championship
as the bulls began the national basketball association playoffs against the indiana pacers on saturday , they were blithely unburdened by the legacy of failure that dogs their contemporaries on the chicago sports scene six championships in 45 years of existence will do that for a team , as will the indelible memory of the best there has ever been in hoops the blackhawks are only a year removed from winning hockey s grand prize , but so many missteps occurred during their 49 seasons between titles that last year s endless victory celebration evoked a surreal feeling , as if it were n't really happening not to this team sure enough , that team has scattered to the winds , a victim of salarycap miscalculation that makes a stanley cup defense thoroughly unlikely michael jordan was making his seventh run at it when the bulls achieved their first title in 1991 before that they had never been to the finals , a 24year stretch of futility that was almost cublike but when five more championships followed in the next seven years , m j and his supporting cast were appropriately hailed as a dynasty that simply does n't happen here not since the 1940s bears had a chicago team even hinted at domination jordan s transcendence changed the way the city felt about itself thirteen years have elapsed since the last grant park party , and the bulls have n't been within two playoff rounds of another championship since meanwhile , the blackhawks , the bears and the white sox have all either won a title or played for one yet the memory of jordan ruling the basketball world is so powerful that it sustains the image of a championshipcaliber franchise , even though some of the moves made since he left suggest a headscratching cluelessness think of ron mercer and eddie robinson as the jordan and scottie pippen of a parallel universe that was jerry krause s doing krause , the bulls' blustery former general manager , deserves hall of fame props for assembling two platoons of complementary talent that helped jordan collect those rings but his egodriven , unseemly haste to prove he could win without m j led to some inexplicably bad decisions putting tim floyd hopelessly overmatched as an nba coach in the seat that phil jackson had occupied was probably the worst of them , though the cheesy pursuit of the uninterested tracy mcgrady was a better metaphor for how far the franchise had fallen by the time he was moved aside in 2003 , krause had to go the climb back to respectability began with john paxson s elevation to basketball boss that move begat scott skiles , who as coach orchestrated the first two postjordan playoff trips , including a tentative foray into the second round in 2007 the paxsonskiles partnership ended badly , but there was an upside failure to salvage a playoff berth from the wreckage of the 20078 season sent the bulls into the draft lottery , and they emerged with derrick rose that is franchisealtering good fortune , akin to the portland trail blazers liking sam bowie more than jordan in the 1984 draft but it s one thing to catch a break and quite another to know what to do with it finding a coach who s comfortable in his own skin is a good start jackson , as tranquil as doug collins was hyperkinetic , brought out qualities in jordan that none of his other pro coaches could tap , most notably a teamfirst , sharetheball \( occasionally \) mentality rose , having survived two years of vinny del negro s deerintheheadlights tutelage , is flourishing under tom thibodeau , an old nba soul with a knack for maximizing a player s talents while neutralizing his shortcomings their relationship is likely to produce the league s most valuable player as well as its coach of the year skeptics maintain that the bulls are too young and untested to win the title , though they entered the playoffs as the eastern conference s top seed the nba is star powered , especially at playoff time , and the bulls have none besides rose \( but the thibodeau effect on luol deng s tidy allaround game ca n't be discounted deng , the 26yearold forward from duke , is playing the best basketball of his life \) and about all the bulls have done since the calendar turned to 2011 is win they are 4110 since jan 1 , including 80 against boston , miami and orlando their 62 wins are a 21game improvement over last season , with a new coach and eight new players still , doubt surrounds them carlos boozer does n't get it done every night keith bogans still ca n't hit a shot joakim noah s manic energy has gone missing kurt thomas somehow seems older than dick stockton we 'll see this team grows on you rose is terrific , and thibodeau is really good right now i see the bulls handling indiana before a tough sevengame series with the orlando magic in the second round then the miami heat unloads its guns and prevails in the conference finals enjoy the run , regardless of where it leads the nba is a mess , with several smallmarket outposts in financial distress , and an offseason of rancorous labor strife is a given pro basketball could be going away for a while , just as the bulls are getting something going maybe they could try out for the cubs
arizona established itself over the past year as the most aggressive state in cracking down on illegal immigrants , gaining so much momentum with its efforts that several other states vowed to follow suit but now the harsh realities of economics appear to have intruded , and arizona may be looking to shed the image of hardline anti pioneer in an abrupt change of course , arizona lawmakers rejected new antiimmigration measures on thursday , in what was widely seen as capitulation to pressure from business executives and an admission that the state s tough stance had resulted in a chilling of the normally robust tourism and convention industry the state senate voted down five bills that among other things sought to require hospitals to inform law enforcement officials when treating patients suspected of being in the country illegally and to prod the supreme court to rule against automatic citizenship for americanborn children of illegal immigrants the senate move was a victory for the arizona business lobby , which on many issues is more moderate than state lawmakers and it was a rebuke for the state senate president , , a republican and the driving force behind tough immigration measures , including the law passed last april requiring police to question the status of anyone they stop if they have a reasonable suspicion that the person might be an illegal immigrant opponents of the five bills said that the state s image had been hit hard , and that it did not make sense to pass new measures while the state had already put itself so far out in front of other states and the federal government on the issue at a cost to tourism and other industries they said that previous immigration bills were still being reviewed by the courts , and that it was not smart to pass new legislation that plainly conflicted with the of the constitution i do n't believe that anyone , including myself , foresaw the national and international reaction to april s bill , said glenn hamer , chief executive of the arizona chamber of commerce and industry , who said estimates of lost tourism business ranged from 15 million to 150 million now we have that experience under our belts we know these measures can cause economic damage it s just a matter of degree a this week blamed last year s bill for boycotts , canceled contracts , declining sales and other economic setbacks arizona s lawmakers and citizens are right to be concerned about illegal immigration , the letter said but we must acknowledge that when arizona goes it alone on this issue , unintended consequences inevitably occur while mr hamer said he doubted the bills could have been defeated on thursday without broadbased business opposition , he cautioned that support for tighter restrictions on immigration remained strong in a number of quarters but , he added , our hope is that these types of measures have crested and we could spend our time on efforts that could rebuild our economy indeed , state politicians and other officials interviewed after the bills' defeat said it was too soon to tell whether the turnabout represented a longterm change , or merely a breather until the economy rebounds concerns about illegal immigration remain a significant issue , and many state leaders are angry with what they describe as the federal government s unwillingness to take firm action but for now , enough is enough , said state senator john mccomish , a republican who voted no on all five bills gov jan brewer , a republican , did not take a position on the five bills that were voted down thursday her normal practice on legislation that has not reached her desk , a spokesman said on friday an aide said senator pearce was unavailable for comment crucial to changing the discussion was a clearly articulated and executed strategy by the state business lobby , which made concerns over negative economic effects a far more significant factor than in the debate last year state senator kyrsten sinema , a democrat , said business opposition in contrast to what she called the tepid and delayed efforts of its leaders last year gave republicans the political protection they needed to vote no they have been working since january to provide people cover against these bills , senator sinema said twentyone of 30 state senators are republicans , and none of the bills would have been defeated without many of them voting in opposition the effect on the state s convention and tourism industry after the april vote was immediate convention bookings plunged in phoenix , one of the top destinations in the united states , with large organizations citing the immigration bill when canceling their reservations it was definitely a drastic decline , said kristen jarnagin , vice president of communications for the arizona hotel and lodging association she and other business officials pointed to data on bookings showing phoenix s ranking , on some measures , had dropped from the top four destinations nationwide to 23rd so far , arizonastyle antiimmigration bills have not lived up to their advance billing in other states , which despite strengthened republican legislative

usually in this space , we get a lot of mileage out of diminishing the importance of any one day s events during a political campaign the math behind this is pretty simple presidential elections are incredibly long affairs they last for two years , give or take , counting the primaries and the invisible primary \( candidates jockeying for position among party elites \) that precedes them there is some sort of lead political story just about every day , but most of them can t possibly make all that much difference , in the same way that any one game does not make all that much difference during a 162game baseball season but this time is different tonight s republican debate is exceptionally important actually , let me qualify that slightly the debate itself is somewhat important but it s the reaction to the debate \( among the media and among party elites \) that will really matter rick perry s polling numbers actually did not decline much in the immediate aftermath of the sept 22 debate if everyone had turned off their televisions and ipads after the debate , it might not have made all that much difference but after a week or two of negative reviews of his performance from commentators across the political spectrum this is the sort of thing that begets the term echo chamber the debate s effect on mr perry was very much amplified , and he lost 10 or 15 points in the polls the central reason for the importance of tonight s debate is of course mr perry s predicament none of the fundamentals that propelled mr perry into the polling lead after his entry into the race have really changed all that much as the thriceelected governor of the nation s secondlargest state , he has very strong and very traditional qualifications he has raised plenty of money his policy positions , with one or two clear exceptions , are a reasonably good fit for that of the republican electorate he trails mitt romney in endorsements a gap made wider by gov chris christie s decision to endorse mr romney today but not by much he is a capable and experienced retail politician his regional strengths ought to match up in an advantageous way with the republican calendar rick perry s fundamentals are sound but he is also on the verge of being vetoed by the republican establishment , which was never particularly enamored with his candidacy and has justifiable concerns about his electability establishment support is certainly not a sufficient quality for a candidate to win his nomination otherwise the campaigns of tim pawlenty , fred thompson and phil gramm would have gone further but it may be fairly close to being a necessary one in the early years of the reformed primary process , which dates back to 1972 , you had a couple of candidates george mcgovern and jimmy carter who won without elite support but that hasn t happened recently as parties and candidates have come to a better understanding of the system so we should look toward how republican elites react to mr perry s performance a good early indicator of this might be how his performance is reviewed on fox news if you re a democrat not in the habit of watching fox news , you might want to do so tonight , at least in the 30 minutes or so after the debate i also suspect that there won t be a lot of middle ground in the reviews of his performance , given that the rick perry s campaign is imploding ! storyline and the rick perry is the comeback kid ! storyline both make for pretty good headlines imagine that you are grading mr perry s performance tonight , as objectively as you can , on a scale from 0 to 10 a debate that might ordinarily merit a 6 might well seem more like a 9 once it s been through the wash of the echo chamber in such a case , we might well be viewing mr romney and mr perry as cofrontrunners in another week s time but a performance that merited a 4 might instead be reviewed as a 1 or a 2 , in which case we might be treated to another round of speculation about whether a lastditch savior might enter the race \( never mind that filing deadlines are imminent this hasn t been a barrier to such speculation before \) or even speculation about whether mr perry might drop out of the race entirely
there are certain popular diversions television , video games , the internet that we pursue so deliriously we end up hating ourselves for loving them others we brightly recast as the duties of citizenship newspapers , public radio , sports all the while , cottage industries crop up to freak us out about our every last cultural pursuit in recent years , it s internet use that s been styled as potentially sick , and internet addiction a new reason for selfhatred if you 're inclined to worry about your habits , you may have already stumbled onto a strange and influential selfevaluation questionnaire by dr kimberly young , a professor of business at st bonaventure university though dr young developed the test in 1998 , early in web life , it still dominates the google returns for internet addiction and steadily stirs up anxiety dr young told me she believes the internet is addictive in part because it allows us to create new personalities and use them to fulfill unmet psychological needs which sounds worrying except that art , entertainment and communications systems are designed explicitly to permit selfexploration and satisfy psychological needs the way the test loads the cultural dice in favor of reality over fantasy should make hearts sink in the hierarchy of the test , any realworld task or interaction , no matter how mundane or tedious , is more important and , worse , ought to be more fulfilling than online fantasy , research or social life do you neglect household chores to use the internet \?

two weeks ago , i met a professed internet addict , a 20yearold college student in new york named gabriela \( like many addicts , she preferred that only her first name be used \) one of gabriela s professors had told me she slept with her laptop , and was wired in the extreme she told me she had taken dr young s test and was worried about her internet habits in email , gabriela struck a note between irony and concern as she described her symptoms she told me she keeps an extremely late bedtime , sometimes 4 am , because she s up noodling around online she then described a typical surfing session i 'll be on facebook and see a status update of song lyrics , and i 'll google them and find the band name , that i will subsequently wikipedia and discover that the lead singer is interesting and briefly look at his twitter and try his music on grooveshark a music search engine and streaming service while looking at pictures of him on tumblr the multimedia microblogging platform that will lead me to a meme i 've never heard of that i 'll explore until i find hilarious photos i will subsequently share with friends of mine on facebook gabriela , who sometimes dresses in the futuristic victoriana known as steampunk , also loves webcomics , a site for graphic novels and comic books , and neopets , a game that lets players care for virtual pets she indeed sleeps with her laptop in her bed , partly so i can have my itunes play my sleep playlist even on the sabbath , when she refrains from internet use for religious reasons , she talks and thinks about the internet she told me she considers surfing the web not so much a regimen but a state of being that , like a meditative state , took her years to achieve aha i'm no addiction expert , but gabriela strikes me as a bright , selfeffacing , religious young woman who keeps student hours and prefers logic games , jokes , graphic novels , trivia quizzes , music , victoriana and socializing on facebook to prefab pop bands this kind of internet use is n't usefully described as an addiction , even if there s some shirking of chores and insomnia to it fantasy life and real life should , ideally , be brought into balance but no student who s making decent grades needs to get off the internet just because it would look more respectable or comprehensible to be playing chess , throwing a frisbee or reading a george orwell paperback the internet as gabriela uses it simply is intellectual life , and play she s just the person i 'd want for a student , in fact or a friend , or a daughter it s no accident that search is the dominant metaphor of the internet and it s no accident that the internet attracts a certain kind of young , dreamy mind at some liberty to find itself the type that in earlier eras might have been drawn to novels or movies as binx bolling puts it in the movie goer what is the nature of the search \?

washington president obama , speaking two weeks after the military ended a ban on openly gay service members , told a prominent gayrights group here on saturday night that no one has to live a lie to serve the country they love mr obama received a jubilant reception from the audience at a dinner held by the group , the human rights campaign he was greeted with a standing ovation and was interrupted him several times with raucous applause , particularly when he declared that don t ask , don t tell is history the president strongly supported the repeal of that policy , which prevented openly gay and lesbian soldiers from serving in the military , and he signed the order ending it in december gay men and lesbians , he said , were proudly serving around the world the only difference being that they could now display their family photos in a sharp jab at the republican presidential field , mr obama noted that none of the candidates protested when members of the audience at a recent debate booed a gay soldier who had served in iraq you want to be commander in chief , the president said , drawing cheers , you can start by standing up for the men and women who wear the uniform of the united states , even when it s not politically convenient on saturday evening , at least , the audience seemed ready to overlook that mr obama had not declared his support for samesex marriage , a refusal that has rankled many gay men and lesbians every single american gay , bisexual and transgender deserves to be treated equally before the law , the president said , the closest he came on saturday to endorsing samesex marriage rights mr obama has said his views on samesex marriage are evolving but since june , when new york state passed a law legalizing such marriages , he has come under mounting pressure to take a stand at a gay pride reception at the white house shortly after the new york law was passed , one guest wore a button on his lapel that said , evolve already on saturday , the president drew attention to other measures he had taken , including legislation requiring hospitals to allow people access to samesex partners who are patients , an antihatecrime law and his order to the justice department not to defend the defense of marriage act , which defines marriage as being between a man and a woman mr obama managed to get in a plug for his 447 billion jobs bill , urging the human rights campaign s members to put pressure on congress to pass the bill he also reeled off a couple of jokes noting that he had just returned from california , mr obama said he had held some productive bilateral talks with your leader , lady gaga the pop diva , with skyhigh heels and hair , had towered over the president at a fundraiser in atherton , calif
in the us open s men s semifinals matches being played in arthur ashe today , the four best men s players will be on the court not simply the four best of this moment , which they surely are , and by no small measure andy murray , the tour s fourthranked player , is 2 , 300 points ahead of fifthranked david ferrer , 2 , 300 being more than half the points ferrer has accumulated in the past twelve months it could be argued , and , i think , without much difficulty , that novak djokovic , rafael nadal , roger federer and andy murray represent the best the most athletic and strongest and allaround skilled top four men s players to be competing against one another in the history of the game moreover , they have been tested these past days , as they have been tested since australia in january , by what is without doubt the deepest pool of talent ever to be amassed on the men s side david ferrer lost to andy roddick in a hardfought quarterfinal s match , before roddick lost in a beatdown to nadal friday in an era that did not include nadal , david ferrer would be a consistent claycourt champion you may be beginning to get my point today s first semifinal match , scheduled to begin at noon , is between the 1ranked djokovic and the 3ranked federer this will be the fourth straight year the two have met in a us open semifinal and that follows the year , 2007 , when they met in the final overall , they have met 23 times , with federer winning 14 times on hardcourts , federer also holds the advantage , 118 but federer built that advantage early on last year , in the best men s match of the open , on a gorgeous latesummer afternoon , djokovic beat federer in five sets , saving two match points and this year djokovic has beaten fed three times \( all on hard courts \) in the four times they have played federer s only win came at the french open , in the semifinals federer played extremely well , but it still had something of the aura of a fluke djokovic had not played in days \( the result of a walkover win \) , and he was under the psychological pressure of continuing an unbeaten streak and playing to become , for the first time , 1 federer could win again today he has had a terrific open run , and his victory over jowilfried tsonga thursday night was particularly impressive , having lost to tsonga at wimbledon to beat djokovic , fed will have to serve well that is , limit the number of second serves that djokovic , the game s best returner , can pounce on he will also have to get to the net frequently and shorten points \( as he did with tsonga the other night \) he might also study the first set of djokovic s match last monday against the young ukrainian dynamo , alexandr dolgopolov dolgopolov used a slice backhand to draw djokovic into noman s land , that area just behind the service line that can make many players uncomfortable djokovic for sure seemed uneasy should i hit an approach and continue to the net \? should i hit high and deep and retreat \? several times he softly pushed the ball and didn t do much of anything , and dolgopolov passed him but djokovic has had a way this year of outmuscling and outhustling federer on hard surfaces i read a study not long ago tennis has come to this that measured the stride angle of djokovic and federer that is , the opening between their front and back legs as they move toward a ball the bottom line is djokovic covers 10 more ground than federer watching today , you will see that federer will hit a fair number of balls that would be clean winners against a roddick , say , but which , against djokovic , he will find coming back at him with depth and pace this tends to frustrate fed and as his record over the years with nadal \( that other astonishing groundcoverer \) and with djokovic of late attests , this tends to send him home the loser nadal and murray , who meet in the second semi of the day , have met 16 times since 2007 , with nadal winning 12 of those matches including the three times they have met this year but murray has fared best on hardcourts , which is the only surface he has beaten nadal on for murray to win today , he is going to have to start fast and stay focused he cannot be in a position where he starts getting down on himself he has a terrific allaround game , but he does not have great psychological stamina the chances of him beating nadal if he gets down a set something he has never accomplished are two slim and none nadal , for his part , must serve well , for starters last year at the open , he tweaked his grip \( or so we were told \) and the result was about 10mph more on his first serve that new , harder serve seems to have disappeared on the tour this year moreover , nadal has shown signs of brooding doubt on court , muttering to himself and grimacing to the heavens something we have never seen from him before but that has tended to come in final matches against djokovic none of us should be surprised if we are watching still another of those monday afternoon
to start with , a confession i want to root for the oklahoma city thunder i like the players i like the team i like the way it plays the thunder is easily one of the most likable teams in pro basketball i get that but i cannot root for the oklahoma city thunder i refuse that feels wrong , feels like cheating , feels like taking 20plus years of rooting for the seattle supersonics and pretending they never happened i was born the year the sonics won seattle s first major professional sports championship , in 1979 i purchased season tickets with friends for two years in the 2000s , sat in the upper deck , remembered what i loved about the nba i covered what turned into the sonics' final playoff series , after the 20045 season , that ended in six games against tim duncan and the spurs , the eventual champions this week , as oklahoma city \( once the supersonics \) began a secondround series against memphis \( once the vancouver grizzlies \) in the playoffs , fans across the pacific northwest cringed i thought back to the games i watched with my father during childhood \( none worse than the eighthseeded nuggets' toppling of the no 1 sonics in 1994 \) , to my favorite supersonics \( jack sikma , gary payton , shawn kemp \) and to all those nights spent at keyarena then i flipped on the first round between the thunder and the grizzlies i wanted to root for the thunder i physically could not so i made a few phone calls to gauge if folks back home felt the same way first , i called danny o'neil , my former colleague at the seattle times and , once upon a time , a sonics beat reporter he said that when he praised russell westbrook and kevin durant on twitter during a recent oklahoma city game , sonics fans clearly a large portion of o'neil s followers told him to shut up sure , i understood that locals did not vote to build a new arena \( they had already helped pay for the new football and baseball palaces in south downtown \) but i never understood how that equated to a lack of passion for basketball in the city seattle and its surrounding area is filled with passionate basketball fans and regularly produces top nba talent yet that part of history tends to be rewritten the nba even made the thunder owner clay bennett , one of three people most responsible for moving the sonics to oklahoma city \( david stern and the former owner howard schultz were the others \) the chairman of its relocation committee it was so mindboggling that it defied an apt comparison next , i called lorin sandretzky , otherwise known as big lo , or seattle s biggest sports fan lo is the kind of guy who would arrive in the winter before the team plane to scrape the ice off the windshields of the players' cars nate mcmillan once paid for his season tickets these days , lo says he watches college basketball he keeps in touch with kobe bryant , whom he interacted with at keyarena he even traded text messages with nick collison , the thunder forward and sonics veteran , the other day yet when lo tried to watch the thunder s playoff games , he could not he saw one television graphic , which noted the thunder s last playoff appearance as 2005 and he thought , wait a minute stuff like that really , really irks you , he said it just brings back the hatred , which had dimmed we had a team for 41 years , and to have that just stripped away from you , like , boom i do n't want to be friends lo argues that if more fans had been more vocal , the sonics would not have left his reasoning the team would never have traded ray allen and rashard lewis , its two best players attendance would not have dipped the league would not have allowed bennett to move the franchise a local buyer would have been found i'm not so sure but i agreed with lo when he said the thought of the thunder s winning an nba title made him nauseous i 'd be so mad , he said so would an entire region because in this series , whether the thunder wins , or the grizzlies win , basketball fans in the pacific northwest will lose this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
house republican leaders friday rejected key elements of president obama s jobs plan , but told their rankandfile members they would support other components , from the wellpublicized like a extension of the current payroll tax holiday to the more obscure , such as continuing depreciation writeoffs for businesses in a letter to their members , speaker john a boehner and representative eric cantor , the majority leader , said , we believe there are areas of common agreement , and areas worthy of further conversation where agreement , assuming there are good faith discussions , may be possible the memo follows memorandum to house republicans fr speaker boehner , leader cantor , whip mccarthy , and chairman hensarling dt september 16 , 2011 re the president s jobs proposal in august , we released our fall legislative agenda focused on implementing two key aspects of our jobs agenda , the gop plan for america s job creators regulatory and tax relief for america s small businesses , entrepreneurs and employers this week , we completed action on the first of those items blocking the federal government s national labor relations board \( nlrb \) from unilaterally telling businesses in what states they can and cannot open up for business also , this week the president sent congress his proposed jobs bill having had a few days to review his proposal , we wanted to take this opportunity and provide you with some initial reaction last week , prior to his address to a joint session of congress , we wrote to president obama to discuss potential ways forward on job creation in addition to highlighting the numerous progrowth jobs bills passed by the house and awaiting action by the democratcontrolled senate , we told the president while it is important that we continue to debate and discuss our different approaches to job creation , it is also critical that our differences not preclude us from taking action in areas where there is common agreement we stressed that w e shouldn t approach this as an all or nothing situation we were hopeful that the president was interested in finding common ground as well however , the white house and the president s campaign demanded that the bill pass in its entirety david axelrod , the president s top campaign advisor , told abc s good morning america that we are not in negotiation to break up the package and it s not an a la carte menu meanwhile , the white house communications director , dan pfeiffer , said , the president said it 16 times , i ll say it a 17th time today he wants them to pass the american jobs act that s the piece of legislation he s sending up for the sake of 14 million americans who are currently unemployed and the more than 4 million who have been unemployed for more than a year , we are pleased that the white house has begun to back away from that extreme it is far more important that the focus be on delivering results for the american people rather than on the upcoming campaign as the president himself said , the next election is 14 months away and the people who sent us here the people who hired us to work for them they don t have the luxury of waiting 14 months we believe there are areas of common agreement , and areas worthy of further conversation where agreement assuming there are good faith discussions may be possible areas of potential common agreement and areas worthy of further discussion include  extension of 100 percent bonus depreciation the president has proposed extending through 2012 the ability of businesses to expense 100 of the cost of certain property they place in service bonus depreciation , which has historically been a bipartisan proposal , makes it easier for businesses to invest now in new machinery and equipment  addressing the pending application of withholding on government contractors under current law as of january 1 , 2013 , businesses that provide goods or services to federal , state , or local governments will have 3 of their payments for such goods or services withheld the president has proposed delaying this requirement until december 31 , 2013 in the house republican fall jobs agenda , we proposed repealing this onerous withholding requirement  small business capital formation the white house fact sheet accompanying the president s speech includes a proposal to reduce the regulatory burdens on small business capital formation in ways that are consistent with investor protection , including expanding crowdfunding opportunities and increasing miniofferings while the legislative proposal transmitted by the president failed to include any language to advance these goals , the house financial services committee is in the process of considering legislation that \( 1 \) increases the threshold at which small companies are subject to full sec regulation \( the current threshold is nearly twenty years old \) \( 2 \) increase the number of shareholders a company can have before triggering sec registration \( 3 \) remove the sec restrictions on crowdfunding so businesses can use marketing , such as social networks , to raise capital from a large pool of small investors who may or may not be sec accredited and \( 4 \) remove sec restrictions so businesses can use marketing to seek unlimited amounts of capital from sec accredited investors  incentives for hiring veterans current law includes employer tax credits for hiring disabled veterans \( up to 4 , 800 \) and unemployed veterans \( up to 2 , 400 \) these tax credits will expire at the end of 2011 the president has proposed expanding these credits the house veterans affairs committee is considering a more comprehensive effort to assist returning heroes , examining the range of challenges they face entering the workforce , including the need for education and training assistance and to address other barriers to employment we believe there is an opportunity to make meaningful and significant progress in this area  unemployment insurance system reforms the president has proposed a number of reforms to the unemployment insurance \( ui \) system , including bridge to work programs that allow the unemployed to pursue workbased training and enhanced reemployment assistance programs to target those most likely to be unemployed for an extended period of time house republicans recommended some of these very ideas to the president at the end of 2009 while the president links these reforms to a blanket extension of extended \( up to 99 weeks \) ui benefits and new federal spending , there is no reason we cannot move forward on these areas of agreement  free trade agreements the president stated in his speech that , now it s time to clear the way for a series of trade agreements that would make it easier for american companies to sell their products in panama and colombia and south korea he also characterized this as a step that , will require congressional action we agree we will take action but first , we need the president to take action and send us the agreements for our approval we have repeatedly called on the president to unlock these agreements and clear the way for the creation of hundreds of thousands of new american jobs , while ensuring that we do not lose any more ground in our global competitiveness in fact , last week we passed a bipartisan measure to extend the generalized system of preferences \( gsp \) we hope this action , and pending action in the senate , will allow us to move forward on all three agreements  infrastructure funding the president has proposed 50 billion in immediate surface transportation funding and the creation of a new 10 billion national infrastructure bank while spending to repair and improve infrastructure can play an important part in both short and longterm economic growth , adding more money to the same broken system is more likely to produce waste and inefficiency than meaningful results there are more than 100 federal surface transportation programs , many of which are duplicative or do not serve a federal purpose before spending new money , for example , we could act to end the mandatory set aside that diverts 10 of current surface transportation funds from roads and bridges to transportation museums and other enhancements and the money we do spend ought to get to the job site faster for example , of the highway funds provided over two and half years ago under the president s stimulus bill , over 18 is still unexpended in part , this is because of an overly complicated and bureaucratic approval process that everyone agrees ought to be fixed rather than adding more money to a broken system , congress and the president should spend the next few months working out a multiyear transportation authorization bill that fixes these problems  payroll tax relief the president has proposed an extension and a significant expansion of the current payroll tax holiday the president would more than double the amount of the holiday \( up from 110 billion this year to 240 billion in 2012 , including an expansion of this proposal to some of the employers share of these taxes \) , and would sunset the entire payroll tax holiday effective january 1 , 2013 so while employees would see an additional temporary benefit from this proposal in 2012 \( the president would modestly expand the current payroll holiday \) , they would experience a larger effective tax increase 12 months later when the payroll tax reverted back to its full level there may be significant unforeseen downsides to large temporary tax cuts immediately followed by large tax increases compounding this negative effect is the scheduled increase in all individual tax rates , capital gain and dividend rates , and the elimination reduction of various individual credits and deductions in short , we are creating significant new uncertainty in an already uncertain economy moreover , the proposal increases general fund transfers to social security , something that needs to be carefully considered given the longterm challenges facing that program and the implications of those challenges for taxpayers finally , the president proposes to pay for this oneyear expanded tax holiday by permanently limiting the ability of those earning more than 200 , 000 a year to take full advantage of their itemized deductions , including their charitable deductions with over 40 of charitable deductions being claimed by those impacted by this proposed policy , the practical effect is a tax on and a reduction in charitable giving this will negatively impact thousands of churches and nonprofits house republicans are supportive of tax relief for working families and small businesses , but the temporary relief proposed by the president must not cause unforeseen harm to the economy 15 months from now and it shouldn t be offset with permanent tax increases and it shouldn t come at the expense of the nation s charities that said , a commitment to honest and fruitful discussions between the white house and congressional leaders could lead to potential bipartisan agreement on a plan that avoids these downsides and provides tax relief for the middle class that encourages short and longterm economic growth and job creation there are also some aspects of the president s proposal where it will be harder to find common ground in addition to his proposed tax increases , we do not agree with the policies proposed by the president that are a repeat or continuation of spending from his 2009 stimulus bill for example , the president has proposed  payments to state and local governments the 2009 stimulus bill included 536 billion in state stabilization funds under the guise of preventing the layoff of teachers , law enforcement officers , and other municipal employees this bandaid approach masked over the true fiscal problems facing states and local governments some jurisdictions used the funds to provide onetime raises others retained employees for a shortperiod of time , only to lay them off later the president is proposing more of the same with an additional 30 billion in spending  federal school construction school construction has historically been a state and local function in his 2009 stimulus proposal , president obama proposed approximately 20 billion for school construction , but the democratcontrolled senate rejected the proposed funding  neighborhood stabilization grants the president has proposed a 15 billion initiative to rehabilitate and refurbish homes this proposal is strikingly similar to the neighborhood stabilization program which has already received 7 billion in funding there have been allegations of misuse of funds and little evidence that the program delivered the promised results five democrats actually joined with house republicans in voting to terminate the program earlier this year  tax increases as the president himself has said , you don t raise taxes in a recession with respect to the tax increases the president has proposed to pay for this package , many in his party seem to agree consider these quotes from just one news story this week terrible , sen jim webb \( dva \) told politico when asked about the president s ideas for how to pay for the 450 billion price tag we shouldn t increase taxes on ordinary income there are other ways to get there that offset is not going to fly , and he should know that , said democratic sen mary landrieu from the energyproducing louisiana , referring to obama s elimination of oil and gas subsidies maybe it s just for his election , which i hope isn t the case if we re going to change something , we got to be sure that we do it in the total tax reform package , that they know what the rules of the road are , said sen kay hagan \( dnc \) democratic sen mark begich , from the oilrich state of alaska , said it was frustrating to see the president single out the oil industry after calling on the congressional joint select committee in last week s address to congress to find savings when you start singling out certain industries , there s an unfairness to it , he said in an interview on the payfors , i have a problem  tax deductions and exclusions the president s largest proposed tax increase is , as he describes it , on the wealthiest americans perhaps it would more aptly be described as a tax increase on charitable contributions , mortgage interest deductions , and municipal bonds for states , etc the president proposes to limit the value of certain deductions and exclusions for those with income above 200 , 000 \( 250 , 000 for a couple \) all but three senators opposed an even more limited version this proposal when it was voted on in 2009 , hardly the type of bipartisan agreement the president has claimed is his goal it is understandable why this proposal is so vehemently rejected by the american people consider the impact of this proposal just on charities more than 40 of all tax deductible charitable contributions are made by families impacted by this tax increase raising taxes on charitable contributions will mean smaller contributions and fewer resources for churches , food banks , universities , and other nonprofits during a week when it was http newsyahoocom censususpovertyrateswellsnearly16142639972html reported that an astounding one in six americans are living in poverty , why would anyone want to essentially penalize soup kitchens , hospitals , and churches that provide essential services to those hurting the most \? finally , this tax increase is the linchpin of a nearly halftrillion dollar permanent tax increase to offset another round of temporary stimulus spending and other tax changes we actually changed the rules of the house this year to prevent the use of tax increases to pay for more spending , a standard this proposal would violate making progress we don t question the president s sincerity when he says he has crafted the right prescription for economic recovery we believe good people can have honest disagreements without having their morals or commitment to country being called into question to be clear , we don t agree with portions of president obama s proposal , and republicans have a different vision for the steps that need to be taken to help our economy get back to creating jobs we are , however , committed to passing legislation to implement the policies in the areas where agreement can be found to support job creation and longterm economic growth over the past several days , many of you have approached us with ideas for legislation that meets these goals we will be working with you and our committees in the coming days and weeks to schedule as many of these items as possible for consideration it is our hope that majority leader reid , the democratic majority in the senate and president obama will realize that while an all or nothing approach might make sense to some political advisors and communicators , it comes at the expense of making progress for millions of unemployed americans and that is a tradeoff none of us should make
milwaukee made amends , reclaimed his smile and his swagger and reasserted his place in a offense that remains intermittently ragged but badly needs him in it when he snarled on sunday , it was at the or the referees , not at his teammates when he shot the ball , he did so mostly within the system and within rhythm his head was clear , but everything else about the knicks was muddled  they were inept enough to fall behind by 23 points in the first quarter , resilient enough to rally back and cut the deficit to a point in the third , and still disjointed enough that they never took the lead in the second half as the season grows short , the remade knicks are facing the stark possibility that they may not get themselves coordinated by the time the playoffs arrive we 're a ways away from where we need to be , chauncey billups said we got a ways to go , on both ends , just getting familiar for the second straight game , the knicks \( 3534 \) sputtered down the stretch , leaving them with their fifth loss in six games and dropping them into , behind philadelphia for the first time since last month s franchisealtering trade for anthony , the knicks are below 500 \( 78 \) with him in the lineup anthony s demeanor improved since his sullen performance friday night in a loss at detroit he was engaged and effective , scoring 23 points and going 7 for 14 from the field but none of the knicks could produce when it mattered most in the final six minutes , anthony had two turnovers , two fouls , a technical foul \( his 11th \) and missed 3 of 4 shots he converted a 3pointer that cut the deficit to 9592 with 174 seconds left , but he fired a long air ball from the arc moments later , sealing the loss a controversial call again figured into the outcome with 4 minutes 6 seconds to play , anthony drove and hit a running jumper , but the points were wiped out by an offensive foul after he collided with carlos delfino on friday , anthony was upset when officials failed to call a foul on a late layup attempt i could argue that call the other night i could argue this call tonight , said anthony , who added , there s no need for me to even complain about that billups scored 21 points for the knicks but fouled out with 2 46 to play , the knicks trailing , 8582 he had difficulty all game with brandon jennings , who had 14 points , 11 rebounds and 9 assists anthony , similarly , was outshone by delfino , who hit six 3pointers and finished with a careerhigh 30 points amar'e stoudemire led the knicks with 25 points and 11 rebounds but was an inefficient 11 for 28 from the field and attempted just three free throws the knicks' morale seems ok , but their record is not the loss to the bucks \( 2841 \) left them 16 against teams with losing records since anthony arrived the competition is about to get stiffer , with the boston celtics \( monday \) and the orlando magic \( wednesday \) coming to madison square garden this week after evading the news media on friday , anthony took the initiative sunday and spent five minutes before the game  it was just one of them days , a rare day , that i allowed myself to get frustrated , anthony said that happens the causes , anthony left unspecific , though he alluded to his poor performance \( 2 for 12 \) , his lack of scoring chances and the loss it was anthony s sullen demeanor that was most alarming he snapped at toney douglas for failing to pass him the ball , avoided teammates in the huddle and generally seemed detached and distracted the knicks did not practice saturday , but they held a film session and anthony took the opportunity to allay any concerns just letting them know that , do n't get used to that , me getting frustrated out there he acknowledged that he was unhappy with the lack of touches , especially in the second half that happens , anthony said , adding it s nothing personal me and toney laughed about it after watching film despite his obvious consternation in the detroit game , anthony again insisted that he was willing to sacrifice shots and adapt his game for the good of the team i'm not really worried about getting 20 , 25 shots a game , scoring 30 points , he said that detroit game , a lot of people stepped up and at the end of the game , we lost and that just made me feel like i was n't a part of what was going on out there and us losing the game just made it that much worse as he worked his way through a checklist of disclaimers , anthony also addressed stoudemire s concern that anthony had not completely bought into coach mike d'antoni s system anthony praised the system and said he would find his place in it d'antoni , in turn , said that the knicks failed to get him enough shots friday there s no drama , d'antoni said this is still a work in progress after all of the handwringing over roles , the knicks nearly forgot how to score sunday they produced a seasonlow 9 points in the first quarter , missing 21 of 25 shots while falling behind by 23 billups brought them back , scoring 20 points in the second and third quarters anthony insisted , there s no need for nobody to panic , but said the knicks needed time they have 13 games left we 're almost there , anthony said for everybody to get 100 percent on the same page , it might take next season but right now , in this short period of time , we just got to come together as a unit and just figure out what we 're going to do and just do it rebounds shelden williams started at center for the first time as a knick , replacing the erratic jared jeffries he lasted just six minutes and did not play again the former knick latrell sprewell , who lives in milwaukee , sat courtside for the game
forward operating base andar , afghanistan midway through december , afghan police officers arrested a man who had hidden a fake bomb near a government office in miri , a village in eastern the man , who gave the name muhammad mir , confessed , saying he wanted to gauge the security force s reactions to a attack , according to american intelligence officials a paper found in his pocket , though , proved more significant than evidence of the taliban s reconnaissance it was handwritten in pashto , and when translated here , it revealed a taxcollection ledger of the islamic emirate of afghanistan the resurgent taliban muhammad alnabi , it showed , had paid the taliban 1 , 600 afghanis , or about 37 sergeant akbar had paid 700 afghanis , and abdulla kaka had remitted 6 , 500 , funds for a socalled shadow government to carry on its fight the scrap in mr mir s pocket , hinting at both boldness and organization , became one part of a gradually expanding portrait of how the taliban has organized and fought its guerrilla war in a corner of rural afghanistan the picture is of an underground government by local fighters , organized under the taliban s banner , who have established the rudiments of a civilian administration to complement their shadowy combat force they run schools , collect taxes and adjudicate civil disputes in islamic courts and when they fight , their gunmen and bomb makers are aided by an intelligence and support network that includes villagers , who signal for them and provide them shelter , and tunnels in which to elude capture or find medical care as part of the obama administration s campaign to subdue a sprawling insurgency and create a durable afghan government , the military sent thousands of soldiers last year into rural areas under the influence , if not outright control , of the taliban one of those task forces , the third battalion of the 187th infantry regiment , arrived in miri in september to help establish a government presence in a place though it is the official seat of the ghazni province s andar district where government had been sporadic for a decade almost five months later through prisoner interrogations , informants' reports , intercepted radio chatter , surveillance of fighters' funerals , taliban documents , nearly 200 gunfights , and captured photographs , equipment and bombs the americans have assembled an expanding portrait of how the latterday taliban functions here the battalion s sense of its enemies is far from complete officers say they do not have detailed profiles of most fighting cells important questions , including whether outside financing flows to the insurgents in this area , remain unanswered but its analysis , built nearly from scratch and revealed through interviews with commanders , soldiers and analysts , nonetheless sketches a tactical , social and visual map of an organization that is at once widespread but rarely seen by outsiders and it presents an implicit reminder of the difficulties facing the pentagon s plan to turn over areas like this one , with its determined and deeprooted insurgency , to afghan security forces by 2014 the analysis outlines two distinct elements of taliban structure a quasi government and the military arm that empowers it on one level , the taliban has firmly reestablished its hold over civilian life in rural ghazni even with an american battalion patrolling andar and the neighboring deh yak district each day , the taliban runs 28 known schools circulates public statements by leaflets at night adjudicates land , waterrights and property disputes through religious courts levies taxes on residents and punishes afghans labeled as collaborators there are tangible indicators that a shadow government does exist and has been strong for the past two or three years , said first lt michael d marietta , the task force s assistant intelligence officer american officers said the taliban s influence grew in a vacuum there had been an almost complete absence of governmentprovided services here since the taliban were unseated in the americanled invasion of 2001 the most common complaint we hear from afghans , said lt col david g fivecoat , the battalion s commander , is that we have n't seen the government in x' number of years on another level , the taliban fights task force analysts estimate that the taliban can field roughly 400 fighters in andar and deh yak , which have a combined population of perhaps 150 , 000 people the fighters harass afghan and american forces and pursue a campaign of intimidation against residents who cooperate with , or even acknowledge , the central government dressing as civilians , they battle western forces with a familiar script using small ambushes and makeshift bombs with minimal risk and conducting the occasional rocket or mortar attack they also have a support network , the officers said , of at least 4 , 000 civilians the supporters provide food , shelter and parttime help , like passing false information to the americans and signaling the movements of the battalion s patrols with mirrors or thick plumes of smoke local knowledge has often given the fighters the ability to seemingly disappear , slipping away in canals or village alleys on jan 20 , a squad from c company was watching escape routes from the village of maumud , where other soldiers and police officers were searching for weapons a check of the entrance to a karez , the traditional underground aqueduct system of the high afghan steppe , led to the discovery of a taliban battlefieldaid station deep underground inside the aqueduct s main tunnel , which continued for several hundred yards , the soldiers found soiled sheets , bloodied bandages and intravenous lines , syringes and penicillin signs that wounded fighters had recently been treated there unlike in some areas of afghanistan , the task force officers said , the taliban fighters of eastern ghazni appear to be entirely local men the battalion has not heard languages typical of foreign fighters in afghanistan arabic , uzbek and urdu , for example on intercepted radio messages surveillance of how the dead taliban fighters are treated has consistently pointed to local roots we have n't seen foreign fighters , colonel fivecoat said we know that because we 've killed fighters and followed it through to the funerals they are all being buried in local villages by their elders but external influences are evident in the fighters' command and control the vast majority of insurgents in andar and deh yak , the officers said , answer to the quetta shura the organization , led by mullah muhammad omar , that formerly governed afghanistan the intelligence officials also said that there was a small presence in easternmost ghazni province of fighters loyal to the haqqani network , the internationally designated terrorist organization , based in miramshah , pakistan , that is aligned with the taliban some improvised bombs bear signs of being assembled by haqqanis , or by people who have been trained or supplied by them , lieutenant marietta said with its local origins and connections , the ghazni taliban have been able to intimidate the government and exert influence over the population several american officers said taliban fighters were largely untroubled by the two districts' small contingent of afghan police officers , with whom , in some cases , they have brokered underthetable arrangements when the battalion arrived in deh yak , it discovered that a police post overlooking the village of salamanzi had been sold in july by its commander to the taliban , which had looted it of ammunition , including rocketpropelled grenades the outpost has since been reestablished as a government position but suspicions linger we have sixman police posts out there in bad areas that never get attacked , and almost every time we go there we get attacked , colonel fivecoat said so something is going on similarly , last fall , when the taliban ordered residents not to vote in the parliamentary elections , the officers said , the order had its intended effect there are 110 , 000 people in andar , said sgt first class jason s werts , the battalion s senior intelligence sergeant three people voted the organization s intelligence network has also been effective an american sweep of the village of bashi turned up a detailed terrain model of forward operating base andar , where the american battalion s headquarters are located the model , officers said , was accurate indicating that the taliban had informants on the base another sign of the intelligence network s effects emerged in remarks of afghan police officers working at the reestablished outpost in salamanzi in interviews , three police officers said that though they lived near the post , they were afraid to go home the taliban have spies everywhere , said one of the officers , abdul wasay the same spy network has identified local civilians who have helped american and afghan troops the guy we had who was willing to give us information about the taliban is the guy we found dead last week , said capt edward t peskie , who commands one of the battalion s companies that informant , abdul hamid , had been stopped on a dirt road , taken from his vehicle , and shot an american patrol to the nearby village of janabad produced no information several villagers acted as if they had not heard of the man the taliban s use of hitandrun tactics has often made it difficult for soldiers to see their foes clearly but late in december , in the village of alu khel , a platoon found dozens of taliban photographs while searching a compound the photos revealed the faces of the fighters , most of them young men they also included images of small boys , some of whom appeared to be 5 or younger , brandishing assault rifles , rocketpropelled grenade launchers or tactical radios these photos included signs of the taliban s logistical sources several images , for example , showed fighters with the distinctive rifle of the afghan police  nato began issuing amd65s to afghan police officers in 2006 their presence in taliban hands suggests that weapons purchased by the united states had escaped government custody similarly , an examination by the new york times of 15 captured taliban rifle magazines found they contained ammunition identical to that purchased by the pentagon for issue to the afghan police another sign of leakage the taliban s success at obtaining ammunition and weapons has not always been matched with an ability to use them well at times , the vaunted movement has appeared to be bungling they sometimes are not good at the basics , sergeant werts said in nearly 200 smallarms attacks against the americans in recent months , the insurgents' bullets have struck only six american soldiers , one fatally , according to the battalion s medical data early last fall , to cite another example , the taliban fired four 82millimeter mortar rounds at forward operating base andar all four landed within the perimeter walls , including one that crashed through the roof of a tent crowded with american soldiers but none exploded whoever fired them , the soldiers said , forgot to insert their fuses the taliban s hidden bombs have also  the officers said they took small comfort in signs of the taliban s marginal weapons skills both sides have spent months assessing each other when spring arrives , the officers said , the taliban in ghazni will continue the work of their shadow government , including collecting taxes but the fighters , they said , could follow patterns seen elsewhere when american forces have settled in , and shift toward more improvised bombs

washington the manager for s sleepy presidential campaign abruptly stepped down on thursday as his remaining operatives vowed to quickly reinvigorate his bid for the republican nomination the manager , susie wiles , left barely a month after mr huntsman formally kicked off his campaign a veteran of florida politics , ms wiles told the campaign she was ready to leave after helping to get things up and running but aides seized upon the departure to signal a shift for the candidacy of mr huntsman , a former utah governor who returned last spring from a twoyear tour as president obama s ambassador to china to challenge his former boss ms wiles will be succeeded as manager by matt david , the campaign s communication s director and a veteran of aggressive press strategies for candidates including arnold schwarzenegger , the former governor of california , president george w bush and senator john mccain of arizona in the coming weeks , our campaign needs to be and will be more aggressive from a message and a tactical standpoint , said tim miller , the campaign spokesman he said the campaign would do more to differentiate ourselves from the president and from our republican rivals since making his campaign official on june 21 in jersey city , in the shadow of the , mr huntsman has vowed to run a civil campaign but he has also been less visible than most other republican candidates he has held no public events for days at a time when he has campaigned , it sometimes amounted to making just one appearance a day campaign aides explained that mr huntsman has been busy raising money with mr david at the helm , the campaign is expected to begin drawing distinctions with republican rivals , particularly mitt romney and his record as governor of massachusetts it s a seamless transition to somebody who has been with this campaign from day 1 that the governor and all of us have tremendous faith in , said john weaver , the chief political strategist for the campaign there s not a matter of regrouping there s no outsider coming in there s none of that mr weaver said he and other top advisers would meet friday to discuss the path forward jim rappaport , a massachusetts lawyer and developer who serves as a regional chairman for mr huntsman s campaign , said the changes reflected a natural evolution and a decision to move into a new phase of the campaign he said supporters would welcome a new , tougher tone governor huntsman clearly articulating his attributes and why they are better than others is clearly a good thing , mr rappaport said richard quinn , a veteran republican strategist in south carolina who is backing mr huntsman , said the candidate had already become more aggressive he noted that mr huntsman recently compared his record of job creation as utah governor with mr romney s in massachusetts you have already started to see it , mr quinn said the records speak for themselves in a statement to the miami herald on thursday , ms wiles said she was leaving to resume my life and get home she said the fact of her resignation should not come as a surprise it was just time , she said we launched this thing and it s up and running our team is so good that we hired from within i continue to have a role here her departure was first reported by the washington post mr weaver , who was a top adviser to senator mccain during the early part of the 2008 presidential campaign , has been the driving force behind mr huntsman s presidential ambitions ms wiles joined mr weaver early this year as the executive director of the political action committee formed to support mr huntsman s presidential bid once the campaign began , ms wiles was largely overseeing politics and operations , not messaging like many young campaigns , there were tensions and diverging views over strategy mr weaver said that the resignation of ms wiles did not signify a shakeup or reorganization he said that she had only intended to get the campaign running smoothly lanny wiles , her husband , will continue as a key adviser to the campaign she wanted to resign , mr weaver said she felt like she accomplished what she wanted to accomplish susie has served the campaign well and was vital in getting it off the ground in such a short time frame ms wiles could not be reached thursday the departure of ms wiles is the first serious sign of concern for mr huntsman since he announced his presidential bid mr huntsman has trailed some of his rivals in fundraising , though because of his late start , he had less time to raise money before the last reporting period ended on june 30 he reported raising about 2 million and lending his campaign another 2 million from his personal fortune mr romney raised 18 million
on the night he beat to reach the final of the 1976 australian open , mark edmondson took the tram home , just like all the fans leaving the kooyong lawn tennis club his girlfriend , vicki , now his wife , still recalls the blunt commentary from one of their fellow straphangers nice job beating ken , ' the one bloke said , but you wo n't have much of a chance to beat newky in the final , will you \? ' edmondson , who was ranked no 212 at the time and had been mopping floors at a hospital just weeks before , seized his opportunity , beating in the final thirtyfive years later , he remains the lowestranked men s player to win a major and the last native son to win the australian open , which begins monday in melbourne in 1976 , the australian open was still considered the forgotten major , widely ignored in north america and europe and often skipped by the world s elite nonaustralian players few foreign stars wanted to travel around the world to play in a tournament that started the day after christmas and offered a first prize of only 7 , 500 perhaps even more daunting than the long flight , low pay and holiday schedule were the australians themselves in the 35 tournaments before edmondson s victory , australian men had taken the trophy 30 times and finished second the other five years in a country filled with tennis legends , edmondson was an unlikely hero weeks before the event , he was working odd jobs to save money to travel on the circuit the next year my sister was a nurse at the time , and she said , we 're always looking for cleaners and window washers at the hospital , ' edmondson said in a phone interview from his home near sydney i was doing some floor polishing and window cleaning , but then like seven days into it , i got the call from tennis australia he traded in his mop and bucket for the chance to play , and seized the opportunity by winning the tasmanian open , which catapulted him into the main draw of the australian open but money was still tight , so while most players stayed at the melbourne hilton , edmonson stayed at a friend s house , commuting nearly an hour in each direction the grass courts suited his game , which was built around a powerful serve , and edmondson steamrolled his way into the semifinals , knocking off four top50 players , including two finalists from previous opens , phil dent and dick crealy but with a semifinal matchup against rosewall looming , edmondson simply hoped to avoid embarrassment rosewall , then 41 , had won eight majors , the first the year before edmondson , 21 , was born despite his age , rosewall was still ranked no 2 in the world that australian summer edmondson s career highlights included winning a round at wimbledon and his victory in tasmania by his own admission , he was used to playing on court 27 in front of some guy and his dog rosewall was a slight figure , ironically nicknamed muscles , who sported a neat haircut and cleancut look edmondson looked more like an australian rules football player , with a stocky build , long and wild hair , and a handlebar mustache behind his booming serve , edmondson pulled off an unlikely fourset victory in stifling heat newspaper headlines around the world carried some variation on the theme of janitor beats rosewall despite the audacious victory , it still seemed unlikely that edmondson would come back the next day to beat newcombe , the defending champion who had dethroned jimmy connors the previous year aside from their mustaches , the finalists had little in common newcombe was a former world no 1 who had won seven majors and ran with an entirely different crowd than the circles edmondson traveled in three months before the final , he was in a vehicle with george w bush when bush was arrested in kennebunkport , me , for drunken driving before the match , newcombe predicted that edmondson would be nervous , and the comment inspired edmondson , who overcame ferocious winds , bouts of gamesmanship and a crowd that favored newcombe by winning , 67 , 63 , 76 , 61 he put his head in his towel after the match , and i think i knew what was happening , vicki edmondson said , recalling the emotional victory edmondson had lost his father to a brain tumor two years before , and the fact that his father did not get to see his bold win was the only disappointment on an otherwise perfect day edmondson dropped the trophy during the award presentation but managed to hang on to the winner s check , which was used to pay off an overdue bill and to finance another year of chasing his dreams after the final , the news media emphasized edmondson s brief janitorial experience , much to his chagrin they ended up getting out of me that i 'd been a cleaner , so , therefore , i was a janitor , edmondson said after i won , one writer gave me a mop and bucket and had me throw it away for a photo op so i 've been a janitor all my life edmondson became something of an antihero because of his lack of interest in charming the news media and his serious oncourt demeanor the win improved his ranking to no 56 , but before the ink on his check had dried , he was off to sudan , chasing another paycheck edmondson went on to enjoy a successful career he reached a careerhigh rank of no 25 in 1982 and won five major doubles titles in 13 years on the tour he never won another singles major , and he never became the next great australian star , but he managed to see the world and earned a living playing tennis , which suited him just fine the only thing that s annoying is how much money they get nowadays , edmondson said , referring to this year s recordsetting 22 million first prize , 500 , 000 more than he earned in his career this year , a firstround loser will make nearly three times what edmondson received for winning the tournament his win proved to be the last gasp of the golden age of australian tennis at the time , there were 10 australian men s players in the top 50 today there are none still , interest in celebrating a homegrown champion remains high in 2005 , when the australian star lleyton hewitt made it to the final , the telecast garnered the secondhighest rating of any program in the last decade , with more than four million australian households tuned in in 2007 , edmondson was elected into the australian tennis hall of fame , and a bust of his likeness was placed at melbourne park , the current site of the australian open no way will something like that happen again , bud collins , the journalist and tv commentator , said of edmondson s upset the guys at the top have separated themselves from the pack , and it s a different sport now
in an article on metropolitan s cover last week , after layoff , hope , fear and insomnia , jennifer gonnerman chronicled the months of efforts by a forklift driver , frederick deare , to find work after the old london snack company closed its factory in the bronx last summer and moved its operations to north carolina mr deare , 54 , finally landed a job , making less than he had collected in unemployment benefits following are some of the more than 180 reader comments posted over the labor day weekend on nytimescom i admire mr deare very much his spirit , his refusal to despair , gives us all hope joseph g anthony , lexington , ky i completely relate to this story i was laid off nearly two years ago , and then lost the parttime job i finally found that was keeping me afloat it paid less than unemployment , too the irony is that if i had not taken that parttime job , i would still be receiving unemployment benefits now i'm 60 , without a job , no unemployment , no health insurance and zero prospects i have a great r \? m \? which i 've sent to thousands of companies the few interviews i 've had were futile it s hard to compete with the hundreds who apply for every job , especially considering i'm twice the age of most applicants age discrimination might be illegal , but who s going to sue every company that does n't hire them \? i started out optimistic , but it s become pointless to even get up and look for a job the thing is , the unemployment rate could be 9 percent or 20 percent it makes no difference if you 're the one without a job soon to be homeless , nyc this story is exactly that of my 59yearold brother , who is now working at a call center for a fraction of what he made in the construction industry this is the tragedy of the current crisis we are workers now competing with the world and we are being forced to accept lower wages the only solution is for workers of the world to unite it does no good to demand higher wages in the us if a company can use lowwage workers somewhere else in the world it also does us no good if companies can move to lowwage states like texas janet , salt lake city , utah mr deare , your story hits painfully home for me my father has been in and out of manufacturing jobs throughout his employment history he has been unemployed from his last job for about two years now he s a shadow of the man i know him to be he had the option of relocating with his company , but with his family and friends already settled here , how is relocating to another state even a viable option \? i sincerely hope the job market changes in the near future because , needless to say , there are millions of others like my father and yourself who want nothing more than to show up to work each day and financially provide for their families psv , westchester , ny this man needs to pull himself up by his bootstraps he needs to start out at the low end , maybe stocking shelves at a grocery store , delivering food on a bike , washing dishes or maybe he can get a peanut cart and sell those delicious candycoated cashews either way , he has to want to improve his lot the time spent talking with the reporter for this article could have better been spent by applying for the jobs i listed above we all make our own luck , and this man is no different bruce goldensteinberg , ny good luck , mr deare i ca n't help but think of how much easier your job quest might be if you did n't have to compete against thousands of illegal immigrants in the area , who are willing to take much less pay and just think , many more are likely to start arriving , now that word of obama s order to deport only those with criminal backgrounds has surely spread throughout emigrant nations dhm , nj he was unemployed for 290 days , yet still found the money to have a smartphone \? i bet he had premium cable , too let s get our priorities straight , america ! jen l , cincinnati , ohio so the supposed tragedy here is that a high school dropout , felon , with a history of drug addiction and a lack of marketable skills had trouble finding a job \? and the problem here is the economy \? really \? knasky , kailua , hi i see a lot of people claiming that the problem is illegal immigrants it s not the immigrants do the work the businesses do the hiring and it s not just immigrants who are willing to take low wage jobs if you read the article , you would see that many americans take lowpaying jobs , as well consumers drive the market so stop buying your cheap chinamade wares at walmart and shop with your feet and your conscience many immigrants come to this country and work for themselves , as business owners nyc has thousands of immigrant entrepreneurs , so maybe take note and think about what type of business you could start while you 're waiting for the human resources department to call nix s mate , boston to sd third anniversary of my firing coming up on labor day of all ironies and while it may be cold comfort to mr deare , my three college degrees have not gotten me hired ged or phd , we 're all in this together parttime gig driving cars for a dealer pride rides in the trunk wish mr deare well there s little hope or comfort to be found , but like most americans , he soldiers on perhaps congress can find the same determination and dignity ddh , ct what about all the other employees laid off at old london \? as the article notes , none of the 25 former coworkers mr deare kept in touch with had found jobs by last spring unfortunately , those stories are far more common , but much less heartwarming when are our leaders going to do something about this national disaster \?

as the congressional committee charged with reining in the deficit nears its deadline for coming up with a way to cut it by at least 12 trillion over 10 years , the tea party or at least , a small group aiming to represent the tea party is presenting its own ideas the group , the tea party debt commission , has been soliciting ideas from tea party supporters over the past several months , and will release its final recommendations on thursday , at a hearing on capitol hill convened for it by conservative senators and house members when it was formed , its organizers said that the commission would prove that the tea party , which tends to like the idea of cutting deficits rather than actual cuts , could in fact come up with a specific plan one with far more ambitious goals than the joint congressional committee that is supposed to release its recommendations next week the tea party budget , as the group calls it , claims to balance the budget in four years , and reduce federal spending by 97 trillion over the next 10 years , all while making permanent the bushera tax cuts if this sounds too good to be true , many will argue it is some nonpartisan voices , such as the congressional budget office , have disputed the cost savings that the report estimates for things like repealing the health care legislation passed in 2010 , which the tea party refers to as obamacare among the group s recommendations are things that have long been favorites of conservatives and or libertarians it s a little bit ronald reagan , a little bit ron paul it would , for instance , eliminate four cabinet agencies the two that rick perry remembered \( education and commerce \) as well as energy and housing and urban development it would get rid of a host of other programs and agencies , including legal services , the small business administration , the americorps volunteer program and the national endowment for the arts it casts a wary eye at the federal reserve , too , suggesting it should be eliminated the report also endorses the idea of competing currencies , where people could opt out of using federal reserve notes and conduct business in goldbacked notes and precious metal coins instead not surprisingly , it would also repeal the health care legislation in toto the commission s report argues that this would save more than 1 trillion over 10 years but the congressional budget office has said that repealing the act would increase the deficit by 210 billion in that time another of the commission s ideas is to end all foreign aid to countries that don t support us , which it acknowledges is subjective commissioners began with the assumption of ending all foreign aid , but then decided that countries like israel might be deserving of it it also argues to reduce the number of troops deployed for certain overseas military operations to 45 , 000 by 2015 , but does not define which military operations it would end the commission also sets up a budgetingbypopularitycontest feature , where taxpayers could earmark 10 percent of their tax payments each year to three federal agencies of their choice the money would be a bonus for agencies that people like \( though none would get more than a 10 percent top up \) but cuts to foreign aid and even eliminating entire departments are just nibbling around the edges of deficit reduction the fastestgrowing share of the budget is in mandatory entitlement programs like medicare , social security and medicaid with those programs , the tea party budget would allow all new medicare beneficiaries to enroll in the federal employees health benefit program and it would turn medicaid into a block grant program states would get a certain amount of money to spend , forcing them to come up with ways to cut costs the commission also argues for allowing workers born after 1981 to invest half of their payroll taxes in a private account , an approach it calls the galveston or chilean plan after a county in texas and the country in south america , both of which allow similar private accounts rick perry and herman cain have endorsed similar plans on the campaign trail but the plan in galveston has actually cost more than social security , with the higher cost being borne by the county s taxpayers and workers do not rely solely on these plans for retirement income they are also enrolled in pension and 401 \( k \) type programs some of the commission s other recommendations are also subject to debate arguing to scrap the tax code , it says that massive overregulation is killing this economy but a survey by the national federation of small business , which has joined republicans and tea party supporters in fighting the health care legislation , says that the single biggest problem facing its members is low sales , not government regulation and labor department data shows that government regulation has accounted for less than 1 percent of layoffs in the last three quarters the commission was formed and largely run by freedomworks , the tea party incubator led by dick armey , the former republican leader in the house freedomworks named the commissioners , who are a dozen tea party activists from across the country , and organized field hearings across the country to take testimony it also sponsored a web site where people could choose between different potential cuts to the budget many of the final recommendations , especially those around energy policy and private savings accounts for health care , are ones that freedomworks was pushing even before the advent of the tea party movement in 2009 the hearing to be held thursday afternoon is being convened by several tea partyinclined legislators , including senators mike lee of utah and rand paul of kentucky , and representatives joe walsh of illinois , steve king of iowa and jeff flake of arizona adam brandon , a spokesman for freedomworks , said that while the commission has no power , it hopes that lawmakers will incorporate its recommendations into legislation
after 45 years as the spirited host of his annual labor day telethon to benefit the muscular dystrophy association , jerry lewis said this year s broadcast will be his last as a labor of love , i 've hosted the annual telethon since 1966 , mr lewis said in a statement reported by the associated press , and i 'll be making my final appearance on the show this year by performing my signature song , 'you 'll never walk alone mr lewis , 85 , will remain as national chairman of the muscular dystrophy association , a position he has held since the 1950s that organization said its telethons have raised more than 1 billion and that mr lewis has logged some 900 live hours of television as the program s master of ceremonies , going back to his inaugural hosting gig in 1966 , when the show was carried on one new york station and took in about 1 million in pledges over the years , the telethon grew in running time to nearly 22 hours , and moved to las vegas in 1973 , with occasional detours to los angeles before returning to las vegas , where mr lewis now resides more recently , mr lewis , who has suffered from pulmonary fibrosis as well as heart and back problems , has reduced his screen time on the telethons , but in his statement he said i 'll never desert mda and my kids mr lewis s telethons yielded many tearful appeals for donations from the host , often accompanied by the children he called jerry s kids the programs also generated their share of indelible showbusiness moments , perhaps none more memorable than mr lewis s surprise reunion with his longestranged partner , dean martin , in 1976 this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo \( photograph by ethan miller getty images \)
if you want to understand why the unemployment rate has been stubbornly lodged around 9 percent , a good place to start is with the eyepopping mortgage statistics released last week by the economic analysis firm corelogic 38 percent of homeowners with second mortgages are underwater they borrowed against the value of their homes , and they now owe more than their houses are worth the total number of underwater homeowners in america , with first and second mortgages , is a stunning 227 percent in nevada alone , 63 percent of all mortgaged properties are worth less than the owners paid in arizona 50 percent , florida 46 percent , michigan 36 percent and california 31 percent when people are so underwater , they find it hard to move to take new jobs , they find it hard to borrow or raise cash for education or startups , and banks become even more cautious about lending until we as a country figure out how to divvy up these losses on housing and let these markets clear and move on , they will be a serious drag on employment indeed , this mortgage mess just feeds the three other big problems undermining us job growth today weak aggregate demand , structural impediments and an epidemic of uncertainty about what the future holds for everything from health care to the rate of taxation to social security and medicare spending to the availability of credit to the general direction of the economy the sum of which has people holding back and thus undermining the government s stimulus we need to be working on all three at once , and urgently how \? others have focused on the aggregate demand problem , so i 'd like to address some of the structural impediments and uncertainty on friday , the mckinsey global institute released a long study of the structural issues ailing the us job market , entitled it begins only in the most optimistic scenario will the united states return to full employment before 2020 achieving this outcome will require sustained demand growth , rising us competitiveness in the global economy and better matching of us workers to jobs over the last 20 years , mckinsey notes , with each recession more employers have used the downturn to replace workers with machines and software , so it takes much longer for full employment to come back i 've been working on a book that required talking to a lot of entrepreneurs and have been struck by how many told me some version of i used the recession to downsize and get really efficient none of those jobs are coming back i am doing a little hiring now , but for people with more skills at the same time , you talk to us companies doing advanced manufacturing and many will tell you they struggle even now to find workers with the bluecollar skills they need to replace their retiring employees thanks to a credit bubble over the last decade , we created a lot of jobs for people in construction and retail who did not have globally competitive skills or posthigh school degrees those workers will need retooling mckinsey says its research found that too few americans who attend college and vocational schools choose fields of study that will give them specific skills that employers are seeking our interviews point to potential shortages in many occupations , such as nutritionists , welders , and nurse s aides in addition to the oftenpredicted shortfall in computer specialists and engineers the report concludes , progress on four dimensions is needed ensuring that the work force acquires skills needed for the jobs that will be in demand , finding ways for us workers to win share' in the global economy by encouraging more foreign investment in the us and by getting companies who have offshored jobs to take advantage of falling telecom prices to onshore them to lowcost american cities and towns instead encouraging innovation , new company creation , and scaling up of industries in the united states , and removing unnecessary impediments that slow business investment and job creation today , everything from patent delays to overlapping or conflicting land use regulations inhibit startups and factory creation according to the world economic forum , america now ranks 27th on the ease of getting a construction permit , behind saudi arabia but do not underestimate uncertainty as a silent jobs killer congress and the white house seem paralyzed in deciding the future of taxes and spending where are we going in these areas \? investors and companies who have to make hiring decisions have no clue the economy is paying a high uncertainty premium right now , says mohamed elerian , the ceo of the world s largest bond fund , pimco with such uncertainty , people delay as many decisions as possible any good news \? yes , us corporations are getting so productive and sitting on so much cash , just a few big , smart , bipartisan decisions by congress on taxes and spending \( and mortgages \) and i think this whole economy starts to improve again workers with skills will be the first to be hired
last month , the times s sunday review published an oped article by michael ellsberg called will dropouts save america \? in it , he argued that our school system tends to stifle rather than promote creativity and that students do not learn essential skills and habits of mind needed to start businesses he said that when it comes to job creation , he puts his faith in college dropouts who become entrepreneurs meet one of those dropout entrepreneurs dale j stephens after just a few months of college in which he enrolled after spending his middle and high school years unschooling mr stephens , 19 , left school based on his conviction that college is not necessary for success and fulfillment , he founded an organization called uncollege , which promotes ways that young people can hack their education by finding individualized paths to selfdirected learning a thiel fellowship recipient , he is currently writing a book for penguin called hacking your education and traveling extensively on speaking engagements in the guest post below , mr stephens explains his belief that any student at any level , even those in traditional education environments , can take charge of their learning please share your questions and comments in the comment box below by dale j stephens i am an elementary school dropout at the end of fifth grade i told my parents i was bored in school they could have told me to stick it out , that doing so would build character instead , although my mom was a public school teacher and my dad an engineer both products of the public school system they allowed to leave school and try unschooling , the selfdirected form of homeschooling while my peers sat in class through middle school and high school , i found mentors , took college classes , started businesses , lived in france , worked on political campaigns and helped build a library i created my education by taking these traditional extracurricular activities and turning them into a cohesive academic program although i never set foot in high school , i assumed college was the next step on my path to success after all , my peers were all going to college , my parents had gone to college and that s what society expected i chose a private liberal arts college , hendrix , which promised to change my life at college i saw professors researching , administrators building stateoftheart facilities and students partying i found smart people with good ideas , but they were mostly just writing papers , not changing the world college felt contrived , theoretical and irrelevant i started uncollegeorg early in my second semester to challenge the notion that college is the only path to success it spread like wildfire in late february , i told new york magazine that i would leave school whether or not i got the thiel fellowship two months later , i did why did i make trouble \? going along with the program seems pretty sweet i could have written papers , skipped class and partied until dawn after four years as a college student , i would have had many friends , a good job and letters after my name but i left college because i realized i couldn t rely on a university to give me an education to get a real education , i took matters into my own hands the way i accomplished this by leaving college was a bit drastic but directing your own education does not require dropping out while sat scores might predict your success in the classroom , beyond a basic level of intelligence your passion , motivation , initiative , networking and hustle matter more than your gradepoint average the reality is that school and dropping out are not the only two options you can hack your education that means breaking some rules it may also mean annoying some people but most important , it means creating options and opportunities for yourself where it seems none exist start by looking around you at the way things are done and paying attention to that little voice that starts asking questions when someone tells you this is just how it works most people , myself included , spend years convincing themselves that the drudgery of school is an essential part of life that you have to fill in those little bubbles on the scantron if you want to get a good job the student who challenges authority is often dismissed , but in the real world , the great leader is the one who asks the contrarian questions the first step to hacking your education is creating a life syllabus to start , you need to find the answers to three questions who am i \? what do i love \? where am i going \? first , answer these questions yourself , and then ask your friends , mentors , parents and teachers the same questions it is important to understand who other people believe you are , what other people believe you are good at and where other people think you should go , but do not let their answers sway your responses ultimately , you must answer these questions for yourself let s examine each one who am i \? it s normal to have difficulty coming up with an answer to this question for much of our lives we are defined by other people we are known as our parents child or our teachers student try to figure out who you are for yourself take inspiration from sixword stories instead of telling your life story in six words , define yourself in six words the six words can be independent or form a sentence here s me in six words logical unschooled changemaker reinventing learning globally  what do i love \? if you re in school you may have never been asked this question in the six years i was in school , no one ever asked me what i wanted or enjoyed here s your chance to tell the world what you love ask yourself what am i passionate about \? what do i enjoy doing \? what gives me energy \? what do i consider fun \? your answers to these questions may relate to school perhaps you love math but they don t have to you might love horses , traveling or talking it all counts where am i going \? it s easy to get caught up in the decisionmaking framework that school provides without thinking about the big picture your choice to take advanced math may send you down a certain scholarly route , and before you can blink you ll be studying something like cardiology you may not be too sure how you got there or whether you even want to be there to avoid this fate , it s helpful to write down your life goals take out a sheet of paper and write down 100 things you want to do in your lifetime this is your bucket list once you ve written down 100 items , break the list down into what you ll complete in one year , five years and 10 years next , break down your goals for the next year into what you ll complete in the next 30 , 60 and 90 days \( revisit your goal lists often because they can and will change \) share your goals for the next 30 days with a friend and have your friend share his or her goals with you you two are now accountability buddies , each responsible for making sure the other completes his or her goals in the next 30 days if answering these questions was hard , don t feel bad it s ridiculous to expect anyone to know what they want to do with their life this is why people have midlife crises but answering these questions now puts you on the path to directing your own education students who hack our educations will change the world you can tell these students apart because they have spark in their eyes , and if you ask them about their passion they won t stop talking these are the students that will have jobs waiting for them or , more likely , will create their own jobs before graduation even rolls around you can be one of these students your life is a field trip and you don t need a permission slip related learning network resources lesson plans independence day developing selfdirected learning projects lifechanging learning reading and writing about educational experiences taking ownership correlating individual learning to standards student opinion questions what s your personal learning plan \?

wisconsin residents on tuesday voted on whether to recall six republican state senators , whose backing of gov scott walker in the dispute over collective bargaining rights this year made them targets for democraticaligned groups two democratic state senators face a recall vote next tuesday \( a third democratic senator , dave hansen , easily survived a recall election on july 19 \) democrats will need to win three of the six republican seats without losing either of their own next week to take control of the state senate all of these seats can be classified as being in swing districts , having voted for mr walker , a republican , in 2010 but for president obama in 2008 most are a couple of points more republican than wisconsin as a whole the closest thing to an exception is the 32nd senate district in the western corner of the state , served by the republican incumbent dan kapanke it is more liberal than the others , having given mr walker only a narrow plurality in 2010 and mr obama 61 percent of its vote in 2008 there have been several polls of the recall efforts , but here is where i would urge some caution most of the polls have either been conducted by partisan groups , have unorthodox methodologies , or both the polls do seem to find that mr kapanke , being in the most liberal of the districts , is a favorite to lose otherwise , the margin of error on these polls is going to be very high the further you go down the ballot , the more the margin of error on polls increases , and a recall election is an inherently unusual circumstance virtually anything from a democratic sweep to their picking up none or just one seat is a plausible outcome i would also urge some caution in interpreting the results true , there are also other swing states , like florida , ohio and michigan , in which there are unpopular republican governors but to the extent this is a problem for republicans , the results in wisconsin on tuesday night will probably only provide us with a very fuzzy clue about that , in the same way that special elections to the house provide only the vaguest hints about elections fought under other circumstances and unlike some special house elections , this one is being contested on explicitly local issues the one thing it would be safe to say is that , if democrats have a strong night , mr walker will be in some jeopardy , as he could face his own recall election next year  if you are going to read into the results , it is probably best to compare them to mr walker s performance in 2010 rather than the margins that the state senators themselves achieved that year ordinarily , nobody pays much attention to state senate elections if some republican incumbent was reelected with 70 percent of the vote in 2010 , but survives the recall with 55 percent of the vote , it would be dubious to cite that as a sign of progress for democrats since the elections were contested under substantially different circumstances on the other hand , mr walker carried the six districts on tuesday s recall ballot by an average of 13 percentage points in 2010 better than his statewide margin of 6 percentage points if democrats were to split the vote across these districts about evenly , that would be a reasonably troubling sign for mr walker , however many of the seats democrats actually win
lorenzo charles , not to put it unkindly , was known for exactly one basketball play with the score tied and a few seconds left in the 1983 ncaa championship game against heavily favored houston , his teammate dereck whittenburg heaved a prayer at the rim charles recognized the arc of a 30foot air ball i just went up and , he said after the game charles , despite this heroic moment , was not the team s star , and other wolfpack players have earned far more professional success but he was probably the most famous sports figure to have come from the neighborhood where i grew up , starrett city in brooklyn every neighborhood of the city has its kiddonegood story , from flatbush to fame charles was ours but charles , after the sports drink equivalent of a cup of coffee in the nba , had to find other ways to pay the bills , including driving a bus that is what he was doing last monday when he on interstate 40 in north carolina he was 47 no one else was aboard but there is little doubt the death resonated with the residents of starrett city , those still there and those long gone for all its charms and controversies over the years , starrett city produced almost no athletic stars it is something of a surprising drought even among charles s contemporaries , and within a few miles , were betterknown figures like john salley from canarsie , mike tyson from brownsville and pearl washington from bedfordstuyvesant and , more than nearly any neighborhood in the city , it would seem to be a natural sports factory starrett city s 46 beige and brown monoliths rose up in the early 1970s out of the flatlands and landfill of fareastern brooklyn vertically , it was a daunting sight horizontally , especially for a young boy moving out from sheepshead bay , it was magical everywhere was grass , and almost none of it was off limits there were tended ball fields , basketball courts poured out throughout the complex , and if that were n't enough , an indoor basketball court , too for a modest fee , one could join the pool club , where youngsters would swim and parents would lay out in the sun on a concrete slab deck that had a view of the back of an 11story building little league and other organized sports were available , and because starrett city had its own security force , free play lasted into the evenings , long past the hour that other city kids were foxlocked into their homes no one needed to play in the street , though we practically could have , because starrett city s buildings were arranged around eight loops that kept traffic slow and evoked the culdesacs of nassau county we considered ourselves lucky charles s family was even luckier starrett city , reserved for low and moderateincome families , had to be mitercut into the geopolitics of new york city to tamp down objections from nearby neighborhoods , developers promised that it would remain mostly white so while our family had a relatively easy time getting an apartment on freeport loop , black families like charles s had a much longer wait , and apartments were sometimes left empty when there was no white family to fill it this quota system lasted until 1988 , when a federal lawsuit ended it the sports facilities , the loops , the ample parking and all that grass heavily supported by federal rent subsidies played into the plan by creating a stackedup version of suburbia , starrett city successfully appealed to white families who would otherwise be fleeing i wondered last week if all this effort to keep the city at bay the security force as well as the power plant that allowed us to sleep through the 1977 blackout unaffected might have something to do with the lack of athletic stardom with a safe , clean place to live , sports was seen more as a diversion than an escape route maybe we , black and white , just did n't want it bad enough , as the saying goes then again , staten island and new jersey keep cranking out pros starrett city is technically no longer , having been renamed in a clumsy attempt to soften its bunkerlike image the passage of time has softened it for me , as my memory has no doubt edited out aspects of what was still a tough time to live in brooklyn , new york but i still have a crystal recollection of the stunned look on the face of a 19yearold neighbor who , for a couple of seconds in the spring of 1983 , did not seem to believe what he had just done
recruited roughly 150 new elite donors , raising as much as a half a million dollars each , to help propel him to a large and early lead over his republican opponents in the race for campaign cash , according to campaign filings released last week the new fundraisers , including silicon valley executives , people active in gay rights causes and onetime supporters of hillary rodham clinton , dominate the list of top donors that mr obama s campaign released on friday , according to an analysis by the new york times known as bundlers , they are typically deeppocketed supporters who tap friends and business associates to raise money for candidates their presence , along with the names of more than 100 veterans of mr obama s formidable 2008 fundraising operation , suggests that the president and his aides have moved quickly to replenish the ranks of top fundraisers as he prepares for an onslaught of advertising next year mounted by independent groups in support of his republican opponent more than half a million people have donated to the president s campaign or his joint fund with the democratic national committee since mr obama formally entered the race in april , and the two accounts gained a combined recordbreaking 86 million for the campaign by the end of june but mr obama s bundlers 271 in all accounted for at least 40 percent of the total , according to the campaign s estimates mr obama s elite donor corps live in 26 states and the district of columbia , though a vast majority live in the traditional centers of political fundraising texas , florida , california and , above all , new york thirtyone of his bundlers collected in excess of 500 , 000 each in contributions , according to the campaign they included the hollywood mogul jeffrey katzenberg two hedge fund managers , orin kramer and blair effron and andr s w l pez , a wealthy puerto rico lawyer and law school classmate of mr obama others who have bundled large checks for mr obama include andy spahn , a close friend and consultant to steven spielberg anna wintour , the editor of vogue and jon s corzine , the former new jersey governor the newer generation of obama bundlers reflects the obama operation s gradual absorption of the democrats' traditional large donors , some of whom did not raise money for him during the 2008 campaign some were prominent supporters of mrs clinton , his primary opponent that year these are the traditional large donors to democratic candidates , said ellen s miller , executive director of the sunlight foundation , a government watchdog group they are giving a lot more than 69 , she added the size of the average contribution to mr obama s campaign , according to aides but mr obama , who pushed to end the do n't , ask , do n't tell policy , has also attracted new bundlers among gay rights activists , including wally brewster , a chicago real estate executive , and barry karas , a former board member of the human rights campaign , a gay rights group mr obama has also won over new bundlers and donors in silicon valley , a constituency he has cultivated aggressively as president mr obama is the only candidate so far to voluntarily disclose his bundlers , as he did in 2008 , along with the republican nominee , senator john mccain none of the other republican candidates this year have committed to doing so , leaving unclear just how much they are dependent on big donors president bush disclosed his bundlers , but the current field has not followed suit , raising questions about the extent to which special interests are funding their campaigns , said ben labolt , an obama campaign spokesman more than 552 , 000 americans have funded ours there is little doubt that mr obama has built a smalldonor operation that any of his rivals would envy the campaign has added about 260 , 000 new donors so far this year to the database of close to four million supporters listed in 2008 but mr obama s election filings suggest that the president s grassroots machinery is being financed by a relatively small group of bigticket donors the largest individual checks mr obama raised up to 30 , 800 per donor went to a joint account with the democratic national committee , which can accept contributions far in excess of the 5 , 000 mr obama may accept from any individual person over the course of his campaign those large checks fueled a 38 million haul that democrats are using to open field offices less than 2 percent of that total came from checks of less than 200 , according to mr obama s campaign filings the growth of mr obama s bundler network amid difficult economic conditions that republican candidates have blamed for their own relatively low fundraising numbers so far also reflects the tremendous institutional advantages that any incumbent president brings to raising campaign cash in march , for example , mr obama hosted about 30 supporters , many with ties to wall street , at an informal discussion in the blue room of the white house about and the economy no money was raised at the event , which was similar to receptions and events held by past presidents but 17 of those guests appeared on friday s list of bundlers for mr obama s reelection campaign , accounting for a minimum of 395 million of the 86 million he raised it s highpriced access to closed policy discussions with deeppocketed individuals , just like it s always been , ms miller said but incumbency can also complicate fundraising only about one in five of the supporters who bundled checks for mr obama last time appear on the list disclosed by his campaign friday one reason for the dropoff upon taking office , mr obama appointed dozens of his top fundraisers to ambassadorships , government advisory boards or jobs in his administration , perches from which they may be prohibited from raising campaign money for the president one such supporter , matthew barzun , resigned in april as the united states ambassador to sweden to become the obama campaign s national finance chairman mr obama , unlike his republican opponents , has made a point of swearing off contributions from registered lobbyists and corporate political action committees but the president s bundlers include business executives whose companies have substantial interests before the federal government marc benioff , who raised more than 500 , 000 , is also chairman of salesforcecom , a company whose software the obama administration has adopted for wide use in federal agencies another bundler , michael kempner , is president of the mww group , a national public affairs company that has a lobbying practice in washington
mitt romney has 23 days to confront any political damage from what may become the most memorable moment of saturday night s debate the image of him offering to wager 10 , 000 to settle a bet with rick perry over the contents of mr romney s latest book mr romney heads to new hampshire sunday evening and will campaign there , in iowa and in south carolina in the coming week as he battles newt gingrich and his other rivals before voting begins on jan 3 the seven remaining candidates will face each other one more time before then during a debate in western iowa on thursday night the rapidly closing window for campaigning puts new pressure on the candidates and their campaigns to respond quickly and aggressively to offer defenses against bad debate moments or to take maximum advantage of good ones mr gingrich faces the challenge of building on his lead in the polls and capitalizing on what early reviews suggested was another strong debate performance on saturday night his campaign quickly posted video of mr gingrich vowing to tell the truth like ronald reagan did for the other republican candidates , like michele bachmann , the trick will be to use the memorable debate moments to try and generate a new buzz around their candidacies that may be increasingly difficult to do as the media increasingly focuses on the new rivalry between mr gingrich and mr romney on monday , the one candidate who didn t participate in saturday s debate , jon m huntsman jr , will face off againt mr gingrich in a twoperson , lincolndouglass style debate in new hampshire , where mr huntsman is hoping to make a last stand in his bid for the nomination but until the next debate , much of the political conversation in the country and among the candidates fighting for the republican nomination will revolve around what was said at drake university in des moines last night here are five of the key moments that will fuel that conversation 1 10 , 000 \? it looked like a scripted moment one of those overly practiced lines that politicians love to have in their back pocket , ready to whip out at just the right time as soon as rick perry started his attack on a passage about health care in mr romney s book , mr romney lunged out his hand , offering a bet on whether he had changed his position 10 , 000 bucks \? 10 , 000 bet \? mr romney said mr perry demurred , saying that i m not in the bettin business the danger for mr romney is that the size of the bet was so large and so out of reach for many americans , for whom 10 , 000 amounts to a huge chunk of their annual salary the democratic national committee pounced , tweeting repeatedly on saturday night with the hashtag what10kbuys republicans seized on it too mr huntsman s campaign promised to launch the website www 10kbet com soon and representative michele bachmann s spokeswoman told reporters that 10 , 000 was three or four months salary for many voters in iowa the moment was similar to one earlier this year , when mr romney answered a heckler at the iowa state fair by saying that corporations are people , my friend democrats seized on the clip as evidence that mr romney was no friend of average americans like the corporations incident , the 10 , 000 bet may be most dangerous for mr romney if he becomes the nominee and has to explain it to a broader electorate aides to mr romney conceded it wasn t his best moment , but insisted that it does not fundamentally change the dynamic in the race people know that mr romney is rich , they said , and his opponents were always going to try and use that against him but the economic unease in the country could make the moment particularly dangerous for mr romney if his rivals are able to successfully paint him as out of touch with middle america it s particularly problematic given mr romney s recent attempts at populism by tailoring some of his economic proposals directly at the middle class instead of the wealthy in the debate , mr romney confronted the issue headon i didn t grow up poor , he said and if somebody is looking for someone who s grown up with that background , i m i m not the person but i but i grew up with a dad who d been poor , and my dad wanted to make sure i understood the lessons of hard work now , the question is whether that argument will win out over the political noise from his 10 , 000 bet 2 newt s humility \? if there s anything that s whispered about in washington , it s how vulnerable mr gingrich might be because of his personal life three marriages , one of them broken up because of his own infidelity with his current wife but mr gingrich now in the lead in most polls created one of the more memorable moments in the debate saturday night by handling the issue deftly when it was raised by the moderators he didn t object to the question or call it stupid , as he has so many times about other subjects in previous debates he waited patiently as the other candidates took their turns talking about their successful marriages and then he humbly accepted responsibility for the mistakes he has made in my case , i said upfront openly i ve made mistakes at times , mr gingrich said i ve had to go to god for forgiveness i ve had to seek reconciliation but i m also a 68yearold grandfather and i think people have to measure who i am now and whether i m a person they can trust it was an ungingrichlike answer to what began as a pretty direct assault on his character from mr perry , the governor of texas asked about the importance of marital vows and faith , mr perry took a barely veiled swipe at mr gingrich s marriages i think the voters are wise enough to figure that one out , he said i ve always kind of been of the opinion that if you cheat on your wife , you ll cheat on your business partner 3 mr newt romney if mrs bachmann was looking for a moment that could help her regain the spotlight in the days that are left , she may have found it by creating a new opponent newt romney mrs bachmann offered a catchy new slogan for conservatives who think that both men are not true believers in their causes if you look at newt romney , they were for obamacare principles , she said if you look at newt romney , they were for cap and trade if you look at newt romney , they for the illegal immigration problem and if you look at new romney , they were for the 700 billion bailout and you just heard newt romney is also with obama on the issue of the payroll extension the phrase recalls the success that tim pawlenty , the former governor of minnesota , briefly had by combining mr romney s name with obamacare and coming up with obamneycare his refusal to use the phrase during a debate made him look afraid to attack and contributed to his early departure from the race the question may be whether mrs bachmann can sustain the criticism of both mr gingrich and mr romney during the days ahead in ways that capture the imagination of voters and the attention of the media 4 \? if mr romney flubbed his prepared line , mr gingrich did not as soon as mr romney contrasted his experience in the business sector with mr gingrich s years of washington work , he was ready let s be candid , mr gingrich said to mr romney the only reason you didn t become a career politician is you lost to teddy kennedy in 1994 the audience booed but not at either man on the stage republicans just boo at the mention of the late mr kennedy , a liberal icon mr romney ran against mr kennedy in 1994 , but lost the race and did not make another attempt to get back into politics until 2002 i m a citizen , i ve served the country in many ways , you re a citizen , you served the country in many ways , mr gingrich added but it s a bit much you would have been a 17year career politician by now , if you d won that s , that s all i m saying on that one mr romney had a good comeback when it was his turn , noting that if i would ve been able to get in the nfl liked i hope when i was a kid , why , i would have been a football star all my life too taken together , the backandforth is likely to remain one of the most memorable moments , in part because it gets at the central question between the two leading candidates for the republican nomination what kind of experience is better \? mr romney and groups working on his behalf are already pressing that question with voters in appearances and television ads and mr gingrich is not shy about saying whenever he can that his experience as the speaker for four years is part of what he is selling to voters mr gingrich is trying to undermine mr romney s claim to have spent most of his adult life as a businessman there s very little time left for mr gingrich to get that message across to voters a debate moment like that can t hurt his cause 5 palestine and israel perhaps the only foreign policy moment to emerge from saturday s debate was the exchange over palestine , and especially mr gingrich s heated refusal to back down on his characterization that palestinians are an invented group of people mr gingrich sought to portray himself as a truthteller who was willing to stand up on behalf of israel somebody oughta have the courage to tell the truth these people are terrorists they teach terrorism in their schools , he said it s fundamentally time for somebody to have the guts to stand up and say , enough lying about the middle east' a few minutes later , mr gingrich summoned the memory of ronald reagan , saying that sometimes it is helpful to have a president of the united states with the courage to tell the truth , just as was ronald reagan who went around his entire national security apparatus to call the soviet union an evil empire and who overruled his entire state department in order to say , mr gorbachev , tear down this wall' but his rivals are just as certain to characterize his statements as the rantings of a hothead who does not have the temperament to be the commanderinchief mr romney began to make that argument during the debate , and it s likely he will continue on the trail i will exercise sobriety , care , stability , mr romney said , seeming to suggest that mr gingrich has none of those attributes and make sure that in a setting like this , anything i say that can affect a place with with rockets going in , with people dying , i don t do anything that would harm that that process rick santorum echoed mr romney , saying that i think you have to speak the truth , but you have to do so with prudence i mean , it s , it s a combination the question going forward , however , is whether mr romney and mr santorum and others can effectively raise serious doubts about how mr gingrich might handle foreign policy especially during a time when most voters are more concerned about their economic situation
the private equity giant carlyle group is in talks to acquire energy capital partners , a buyout shop focused on investments in power plants and gas pipelines , according to two people briefed on the talks carlyle s potential acquisition of energy capital underscores the relentless drive by the firm to gather more assets and broaden its product line as it gears up for an initial public offering

are now among the world s most powerful assetmanagement businesses a deal for energy capital would be among the first transactions in which one large private equity firm buys another negotiations are continuing and could still fall apart , said these people , who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly spokesmen for carlyle and energy capital declined to comment the firm has gone on a dizzying acquisition spree over the last year to diversify its business beyond its core private equity funds and make itself more attractive to its investors and public shareholders it recently took majority stakes in two hedge funds claren road asset management , a fixedincome hedge fund with 45 billion in assets , and the emerging sovereign group , an emergingmarkets manager partly owned by the billionaire investor julian robertson in january , it announced a deal to acquire 60 percent of alpinvest partners , a firm that manages about 43 billion

under management carlyle s acquisitions of new businesses is a departure from the firm s longtime strategy of developing products from within the firm cofounded in 1987 by david rubenstein , carlyle runs about 84 separate funds , including an asian real estate vehicle and a fund focused exclusively on buying mexican companies in its core buyout funds it owns businesses that include dunkin' brands , the hertz corporation and freescale semiconductor there are potential problems with carlyle s rapid expansion , private equity industry observers say by slapping its brand on a wider array of products and straying from its core competency , the firm runs a risk the main risk is that carlyle s diversification , if not wellmanaged , could hurt investment performance , said david teten , a partner at ff venture capital who has published research on privateequity investment management carlyle has already had problems with its diversification strategy during the financial crisis two of its homegrown hedge funds carlyle capital and carlyle blue wave collapsed after wrongway bets in the debt markets in some ways , carlyle s acquisition binge is an effort to replicate the broad set of businesses built by the blackstone group , one of its chief competitors and the first large private equity firm to go public back in 2007 blackstone , which is run by stephen a schwarzman , has established hedge fund , real estate investment and investment bank advisory units that diversify its revenues the other large publicly traded firms , kohlberg kravis roberts and apollo , have also

los angeles the stories were flying around eight years ago , when was in the midst of his unlikely attempt to unseat gray davis , the democratic governor mr schwarzenegger , married to , had fathered a child with a woman who worked at the couple s brentwood estate mr schwarzenegger s advisers had heard it so had top aides to mr davis , whom mr schwarzenegger would go on to unseat but in the closing days of what was a circus of a campaign , the rumors got pushed aside as mr schwarzenegger dealt with a barrage of seemingly more credible allegations that he had groped and molested women during his years as a movie star , charges that ms shriver battled back forcefully , contributing in large part to his victory in fact , mr schwarzenegger acknowledged on tuesday , he had fathered a child with a member of his household staff a few years before running for office , a secret that he said he hid from his wife and that aides said he kept from them through much of her pregnancy and for the eight years that mr schwarzenegger served as one of the highestprofile governors in the nation , the woman continued to work in the couple s home some of their friends , looking back , said they now believe the child was an occasional presence in the house in the gated community at the end of mandeville canyon road that deception by mr schwarzenegger ended monday night when the governor

kennedy family issued her own statement tuesday reflecting what her friends described as the devastating and utterly shocking collapse of a marriage that had captured national attention ms shriver had moved out of the house and into a beverly hills hotel earlier this year as a mother , my concern is for the children , she said i ask for compassion , respect and privacy as my children and i try to rebuild our lives and heal i will have no further comment on tuesday evening , ms shriver was among the guests onstage in chicago at a taping for the final episodes of the oprah winfrey show ,

web sites that have feasted on their marriage before tmz and gawker the schwarzenegger love child scandal has arrived , gawker announced associates of mr schwarzenegger and ms shriver , pointing to

ms shriver was pregnant with the youngest of the couple s four children , christopher , who is 13 the woman and the child did not live in the house by every account , mr schwarzenegger made no mention of the situation to ms shriver or to the team of political consultants he brought in during the 2003 recall election against mr davis , and in the reelection campaign in 2006 friends of both mr schwarzenegger and ms shriver expressed astonishment not only at his actions , but also that he had eluded detection by the public and his family over the course of his very public life mr schwarzenegger told his wife about the affair only late last year , at the end of his public service career , and shortly after the mother of his son left the job with severance after working for the family for 20 years after leaving the governor s office i told my wife about this event , which occurred over a decade ago , he said in a statement i understand and deserve the feelings of anger and disappointment among my friends and family there are no excuses , and i take full responsibility for the hurt i have caused i have apologized to maria , my children and my family i am truly sorry democrats who worked for mr davis during the recall election said they were not surprised at the revelation , noting that rumors about mr schwarzenegger s infidelity were a constant backdrop of the campaign in 2001 when he first came forward and indicated that he might run for governor there were rumors coming to us constantly about affairs and children , said garry south , a democratic consultant in los angeles that year , mr schwarzenegger threatened to sue mr south , who worked for mr davis at the time and sent reporters copies of premiere magazine detailing mr schwarzenegger s issues with women there were always stories about kids , how there was a son out there , some kid he had been supporting peter ragone , who was a senior adviser to mr davis at the time , said there were all sorts of rumors flying around like this voters knew what they needed to know on this topic with arnold schwarzenegger , and honestly they just did n't care none of mr schwarzenegger s political advisers agreed to speak on the record about the episode nor did ms shriver s friends or family members ms shriver has always benefited from careful image management , and keeping a close cadre of friends and confidants who circle the wagons in times of trouble one of the last public events ms shriver and mr schwarzenegger attended together was the funeral of her father , r sargent shriver , who died in january some who attended said that the two were polite to each other but in no way warm ms shriver gave a heartrending and pointed eulogy , as her husband looked on , praising her father for teaching her brothers how to properly treat women

you have to hand it to the nba and the nhl for producing conference finals with great psychodramatic subplots now , you do n't have to credit the actual leagues especially the nhl , which was too busy trying to figure out what to do with to concoct any actual strategy but feel free to enjoy the results first , you have the miami heat and the chicago bulls in the nba s eastern conference finals , a match made in morality play heaven that s because chicago recruited lebron james , dwyane wade and chris bosh in last year s free agency bonanza but instead the bulls signed none of them , built an eightmandeep lineup led by derrick rose , the team glue , and were the top team in the east now , everyone will consider the heat the favorite here , but that it s because people favor style over substance his writes that the free agents the bulls did sign are more valuable than their lack of star power suggests that rose refused to participate in the overthetop woo fest that was the free agency recruiting period last summer , which now becomes a delicious slice of irony in this series it also means the bulls are the natural rallying point for everyone who hated the decision and all of the other excesses of lebron mania that category includes , who predicts the bulls will win the morality play the bulls certainly painted quite a different picture when they toppled atlanta thursday night in game 6 there was no oncourt catharsis , heatstyle , just a hardworking victory , that s because the bulls were concerned only with the step right in front of them , , and did not look ahead at miami that if miami considered boston the highest mountain in the conference , does that mean it has taken beating the bulls for granted \? one thing the nba cannot take for granted is its supremacy , even in one of its own arenas game 1 of the eastern conference finals was initially supposed to be tuesday , but had to be moved all the way back to sunday because , and as we all know , oprah rules perhaps she could discuss the moral lessons of bulls versus heat the nhl s most riveting drama , meanwhile , is in the western conference , where san jose s game 7 escape from a potentially epic detroit comeback set up a conference finals against vancouver this pits two teams whose biggest opponents have historically been themselves vancouver had to beat back echoes of its cursed history just to get out of the first round against chicago , and san jose went to panic s edge against the red wings thursday night when the headlines and leads are all about how the sharks did n't choke , as with , you know there are real psychological issues there the red wings did play valiantly in trying to pull off the comeback from 03 down , but ran out of miracles , writes the game was the sixth onegoal game of the series , which made it in the midst of the sharks celebrated their advance with great relief , but quickly turned their sights on vancouver , , perhaps because it is comforting to contemplate an opponent with as many demons as them there are plenty of demons in golf , too , and right now they all seem to be attacking tiger woods his latest woe a knee injury forced him to withdraw from the players championship after nine holes thursday , which deepened the mystery about his future , it s too soon to say he s finished as a threat to catch jack nicklaus s record of 18 majors , , but the prospects are not looking good considering woods s body and game are a fivecart pileup these days , his instant struggles prompted the question of whether he was pressured to play in one of the sport s signature events , which  there may quickly be pressure brought to bear on the nfl lockout , as judge david doty considers the in the case involving the nfl s hoarding television revenues as a lockout slush fund as , the league having its fate in the hands of doty feels like wile e coyote having to wait on a decision by road runner wants someone to remind him why the nfl was so intent on cooking its golden goose that s a psychological study for another day
this week , bruce poch , a veteran of the admissions world who worked at wesleyan and connecticut college before serving , until recently , as dean of admissions at pomona college in california , has been answering questions submitted by readers of the choice the series concludes today readers may continue to submit comments using the comment box on the original post , or the one below questions , and answers , may have been edited jacques steinberg with regard to value what i discussed with my wife was the longterm costs while a state school may seem like a bargain on the front end , there s a better chance of that education dragging out \( more than 4 years \) than a smaller liberal arts college where the classes are smaller , with personal attention as well the ease of getting the classes you need i started out at a state school , and getting your classes was a course in itself after transferring to a smaller school , my path was clear and my goal easier to attain although more expensive per year , it was less expensive in the long run i m using this approach with my son , and he better not ruin my theory \( lol \) brian without wishing to duck the question , the different realities from state university to state university can be substantial your own experience certainly should be part of the family conversation one should consider the number of semesters or years that the average student takes to graduate from any institution unfortunately , most data shows this in the form of years elapsed rather than semesters or quarters actually enrolled if a student takes a year off to work or participate in a campaign or a church mission trip but graduates in eight semesters , isn t that really graduation on time \? graduating after 9 or 10 semesters because it took that long to attain the proper number of credits is a different situation ask students at the colleges what they and their classmates have experienced can students get most or all of the classes they want when they register \? are there caps causing many undergrads to sit on the sideline \? if some of those classes are introductory courses required for a long sequence to follow , how likely may it be to complete the program on time \? this is particularly important to know in the sciences and mathematics because of the relationships of courses to one another find out if the university refers to impacted majors \? pay particular note if that vocabulary is used casually know whether an upperclassman who declared a major will be assured a seat in a required class it is important to take a close look at the advising system at whatever size institution a good advising program may bring a large university down to human scale , and a poor advising system at a small college can be reflected of uneven progress rates or even grumbling from students who need counsel to navigate options how is advising handled \? who is responsible for following the students \? who notices if they are ok \? are there safety nets \? particularly because of the sharp cutting of state budgets across the country , there is uncertainty about how these reductions could affect faculty positions , teaching assistant support and course section availability obviously , this may affect students graduation timetables some and i emphasize some state universities may appear to be financial bargains but , as the question noted , when a family adds to the dollar total the extra year or two of tuition , room and board necessary because of closed courses and then calculates the year or two of lost income \( to say nothing of opportunity costs an economist would measure \) , the price gap looks very different if a large proportion of an entering class won t graduate from that institution , there are signals to notice put those choices side by side please comment on this scenario a student gets a fullscholarship offer from a small school that is not overly competitive to get into and that lacks a true honors college \( though it offers honors seminars to its best students \) he is an a student , with near perfect sats , and an enthusiastic learner who teachers love other schools with a highachieving student body have accepted him , but offered significantly less money \( note none of the schools are ivies name on carwindow sticker is not important to him nor us \) any advice on how to evaluate whether the student will be adequately challenged at the smaller , far less elite but more generous school \? he is sure to go onto grad school , but we fear his being understimulated and underprepared as an undergrad if he accepts the scholarship m these questions look to explore the balance of dollar value weighed against peers in an educational experience i am mindful that value is measured as much by emotion as pocketbook at this moment , and that understanding and balancing that tension is among the most fundamental struggles families are dealing with at the point of decision making at this moment , it isn t any longer about others suggesting what a student should do it is about what feels right and about students and families devising their own ranking system i read many transfer applications each year from students who wanted to leave their colleges after having accepted a merit scholarship and declining what they thought was a better academic and personal fit they wrote frequently about their frustration of finding few peers and being inadequately challenged merit scholarships and tuition discounting may make an institution a bit more attractive , but isn t likely to erase a student s strong desire for a different kind of collegiate experience or peers students should express their straightfromtheheart reactions the decision should not be turned over to the implied logic of magazine or guide rankings rankings are weighted according to editors decisions and perceptions about what matters the student and family may have different ideas about what matters , some of which was never considered even in the good instruments the editors quite properly acknowledge that students do intuitively know the best way they learn and from whom they react to what they read , see , hear and feel when they visit a campus or interact with other admitted students it is about their knowing the kind of experiences they will learn from , grow from and emerge from with a greater sense of self and the capacity to contribute to something bigger students happiest with their college choices find themselves with peers who typically are as bright or brighter and who could challenge their ideas and suppositions it is useful to note that what i describe may have some root in the selectivity of the college , but it is not the same measure quite often , there is a substantial difference between what a college guide suggests with the term most competitive , which refers to admission selection , and the nature of student interactions peer relationships are also colored by student drive , curiosity and the extent to which students tend to collaborate or instead work individually or perhaps competitively some students thrive on the race to the top to do their best work others prefer study groups and collaborative engagement it s worth understanding those differences or where there are multiple styles possible having real academic peers may be more important to the student experience in a college or university where seminar and discussion based classes or lab sections with collaborative expectations are the most common instructional methods it is also useful to explore the quality of lives and minds brought together , not solely by a selectivity index or sat gpa shorthand in the end , your child should ask what kind of conversation do i want to join \? who do i want to share that experience with \? what do i expect of other students \? if you speak with admissions officers before enrolling , ask what questions the admissions officers focused on in the application beyond the sat gpa learn what mattered as they selected your prospective peers while guides refer to undergraduate resources as buildings and endowments , families should also seriously consider the other undergraduate students and the mechanisms of learning that are at the core of a collegiate experience
st louis when sister mary jean ryan entered the convent as a young nurse in 1960 , virtually every department of every catholic hospital was run by a nun , from to dietary to billing after her retirement on july 31 as the chief executive of one of the country s largest networks of catholic hospitals , only 11 nuns remained among her company s more than 22 , 000 employees , and none were administrators for , a 42 billion enterprise that evolved from the work of five german nuns who arrived here in 1872 , sister mary jean s departure after 25 years as the company s first chief executive marks a poignant passing the gradual transition from religious to lay leadership , which has been changing the face of catholic health care for decades , is now nearly complete in 1968 , nuns or priests served as chief executives of 770 of the country s 796 catholic hospitals , according to the today , they preside over 8 of 636 hospitals with sister mary jean s departure , only 8 of 59 catholic health care systems are directed by religious executives ssm , which is now led by william p thompson , a catholic layman and longtime company executive , had been the largest catholic health system still managed by a nun formed in 1986 , the st louis firm consolidated the management of 15 catholic hospitals and two in missouri , illinois , oklahoma and wisconsin as with other healing orders that have ceded control , the franciscan sisters of mary prepared for their inevitable detachment from ssm with more planning than sentiment we ca n't be maudlin about this , said sister mary jean , 73 , who still presides over the company s board i mean , yes , we are a dying breed we are disappearing from the face of the earth and all of that that being said , perhaps this is a moment for people to acknowledge the contribution that has been made by women religious throughout our history in the united states the leadership shift has stirred angst in many catholic hospitals about whether the values imparted by the nuns , concerning the treatment of both patients and employees , can withstand bottomline forces without their daytoday vigilance although their influence is often described as intangible , the nuns kept their hospitals focused on serving the needy and brought a spiritual reassurance that healing would prevail over profit , authorities on catholic health care say in the case of ssm , that has meant turning away business arrangements with doctors who decline to accept it has meant discounting treatment for the poor and offering charity care to the uninsured , just as the order s founders did the st louis nuns' earliest ledgers denoted patients unable to pay as our dear lord s the near extinction of nuns from american hospitals stems largely from the drastic decline of religious orders that accompanied the women s movement , the sexual revolution , ethnic assimilation and the second council s opening of the church to lay leadership even as the country s roman catholic population surged by nearly 50 percent over the last halfcentury , the number of nuns dropped precipitously , to 56 , 000 today from 180 , 000 in 1965 , according to the at georgetown university in 2009 , 91 percent of all nuns were at least 60 years old sister mary jean s order has dwindled to about 100 from a peak of more than 500 most moved out of their convent last year and into a retirement and nursing home there has not been an initiate for 25 years , and several years ago the sisters reluctantly stopped looking it was painful , sister mary jean said in an interview in her modest apartment , but i think it was also courageous to say we 're just not going to recruit any more let s just live out the rest of our lives to the fullest that we possibly can and thank god for what we 've been able to do and when the time comes , as they say , the last person turn the lights out along with parochial education , health care has long been a central mission of nuns in this country , a natural outgrowth of the catholic insistence on the sacredness of life since 1727 , when the ursuline sisters landed in new orleans , they have built 12 of the country s 40 largest health care systems in 2009 , catholic hospitals accounted for one of every six admissions in the united states , according to the catholic health association other than crucifixes on the walls and marble madonnas in the lobby , catholic hospitals do not look particularly different from secular ones but their administrators say that what makes them distinct is a valuesdriven approach , reflected at ssm in a mission statement that pledges to use exceptional care to reveal the healing presence of god catholic health systems have been criticized , along with other nonprofit hospitals , as not dedicating enough resources to the community s benefit but surveys also show that , on average , they provide higherquality performance than other hospitals and are more likely to offer specialty services that are not profit centers sister mary jean , who was dispatched by her order to earn a master s degree in hospital administration , has managed her realm with ironwilled competence and unblinking compassion , ssm executives said she is both stern and goodhumored enough that the company s vice president for communications , suzy farren , felt comfortable writing a farewell tribute that depicted her as at times , gruff and demanding and stubborn michael r panicola , the company s vice president for ethics , remembered thinking during his job interview that he was facing the female version of mickey , the crusty trainer in rocky played by burgess meredith those who underestimated the nuns as managers made a mistake , sister mary jean said , volunteering that many hospital executives with multimilliondollar salaries were arrogant and overpaid having taken a vow of poverty , sister mary jean worked for free , although ssm paid the franciscan sisters of mary an annual fee 196 million in 2009 , according to tax forms as compensation for their labor operating revenues at ssm \( the initials honor the sisters of st mary , a predecessor order \) more than quintupled during sister mary jean s tenure , to 3 billion in 2010 the company produced net income that year of 2479 million and provided 1154 million in uncompensated care a decade ago , sister mary jean led ssm through a relentless campaign to improve performance that was recognized with the first given to a health care company but her legacy also extends to preaching about the dignity of patients , paying bluecollar workers above scale , making her hospitals smokefree , banning the use of foam cups and plastic water bottles , and insisting on genderneutral and nonviolent language there are no bullet points in ssm presentations , and photographs are enlarged , never blown up even sister mary jean can struggle to define precisely what the nuns brought to their hospitals there is this thing called presence , she said , explaining that she was trained to see jesus in the face of every patient , and i think that s the piece that is lost mr thompson , sister mary jean s handpicked successor , said he planned to hold fast to her commitment to patients , the environment and nonviolence but he also acknowledged that he would be trying to drive more efficiencies in the system i would hope , he said , that those two things never come into conflict , at least no more than they ever have in the past
riyadh , saudi arabia you know you are attending a saudi arabian comedy night when the sprawling performance tent is pitched 50 miles out into the desert to avoid the morals police and , astonishingly , the ushers are women , even if they remain shrouded by the standardissue black garments then the swirling disco lights and giant speakers thumping out i gotta feeling by the black eyed peas go still for evening prayer and sex determines the seating bachelors on the right , families including women on the left i love riyadh ! the master of ceremonies starts in arabic , eliciting a tepid response from the audience of about 1 , 000 people with his next line when you walk on the streets , you do n't see any women ! standup comedy in remains a somewhat clandestine affair , emerging from the raw local performers hired as warmup acts for the mostly arabamericans who began touring the middle east a few years ago but saudi comics are now coming into their own two have established wildly popular shows on youtube not least because the web has emerged as the one public space in the kingdom where it is ok to endorse the arab uprisings comedy nights have just switched to arabic from english , broadening their appeal , and comedians have even been asked to entertain at koran conferences it is really convenient for saudi society because it is one person on stage there is no acting , no women on stage , no men dressed as women , said ahmad fathaldin , a 25yearold medical student and one of six twentysomethings who write and perform the hit series on youtube socially it is accepted it helps that comedy s main competition for evening entertainment basically consists of cruising the gargantuan saudi malls movie theaters or places that might encourage the mingling of the sexes are all banned another factor that helped spawn the comedy phenomenon , and pushed it onto youtube in the first place , is the stifling sameness of most arab television networks tv is dying a slow and painful death in this region , said fahad albutairi , 26 , a geophysicist and selfdescribed skinny nerd who graduated from the university of texas at austin , where he first tried comedy at openmike nights last november he started the other hit saudi show on youtube , or zip it among the nearly 19 million saudis , about 70 percent are under 30 they cannot abide yet another 200 episodes of some turkish soap opera , mr albutairi said the programs do n't reflect things that matter to the average saudi , he said we broadcast out of saudi for saudi people by saudi people omar hussein , a wiry 25yearold , supervises a diaper production line for an american conglomerate and uses his free time to star as the main mocking newscaster in on the fly last year he and the other founders sought to create socially responsible comedy that riffs on the news and national chatter both shows exude a comedy central feel and have rejected television , fearful of being censored to avoid offending advertisers online , they can push the limits , although not too far the shows avoid mentioning the royal family and the absence of the arab spring in the kingdom nor have they noted that the deposed tunisian president , zine elabidine ben ali , received asylum here and they rarely touch on the judiciary system or other bastions of islamic puritanism it is a measure of the freer speech available on youtube that they can go even as far as they do the popular revolts rocking the arab world have horrified the saudi monarchy , to the point that saudi arabia deployed troops to smother the uprising in bahrain of the two shows , on the fly skates a little closer to the precipice on political and social taboos it ran with a sardonic news report , which the writers described as a gift , of a judge s defending himself publicly against accusations of graft by saying that the devil possessed him it also reported the news that a member of the religious police stabbed a man , possibly with nail clippers , after the two fought over a remark that the man s wife should cover her face the most popular episode , released in february amid the upheaval in egypt and elsewhere , received more than 635 , 000 hits we took a very clear position on the events , said dima ikhwan , 23 she and lama sabri , a 22yearold psychology major , are the two female writers on the show another departure from the saudi norm the episode cleverly took the form of an arabic grammar lesson to express the popular mood the model sentences went from i understand , your excellency the president to irhal ! or leave ! a sign often brandished by protesters to uff , you 're still here ! the show also mocked a private saudiowned satellite channel for sticking with programs like arabs got talent while most other networks broadcast live from the uprisings it also ridiculed state television for showing a cooking show while devastating flash floods inundated jidda in late january , leaving 13 people dead what , are we supposed to starve because it s raining \? mr hussein deadpanned the show is not overtly political , however , and tries to take on all sides , particularly since jidda , where the writers live , has a reputation among saudis for verging on the decadent on the fly has escaped the ire of the country s powerful religious lobby , perhaps in part because mr hussein subtly telegraphs his own faith through vocabulary and subject matter one religious viewer commented online , this show is great , but i wish you did it without the music and the women the show exudes wit creating short vignettes , for example , to explain the elastic uses of the word inshallah , or god willing , including be patient , scram and dream on and it endears itself by skewering reviled state institutions like saudia , the national airline , for having 29 vice presidents , including vice president for making sure people praying in the aisles do n't dawdle fans love that mr hussein cuts to the chase while the mainstream media dances around issues he captures the culture , he captures the attitude and he really highlights the ridiculous on issues that are blocking us , said fatin yousef bundagji , a business consultant and activist the youtube shows use humor to treat sensitive issues that result in riots elsewhere when terry jones , the florida pastor , burned korans , mr albutairi joked on zip it that mr jones had mistakenly ignited a few bibles and children s books because they were in arabic , and he suggested that saudi high school students send the pastor their biology textbooks his most popular episode , with more than 800 , 000 hits , was mostly about the illstarred saudi soccer team the majority of saudis are not political , and you have to take that into account , mr albutairi said at the standup comedy show outside riyadh , the jokes concentrated on foreign laborers and the differences between the sexes almost none referred to the regional turmoil young saudis said they enjoyed the show they were not cracking me up , but you can see the potential , said hassan mansouri , 27 , a banker who frequented comedy clubs while studying in boulder , colo it was nice to see a saudi flavor in saudi arabia , both religious tradition and political suppression hinder public gatherings so , with comedy suddenly all the rage , performers are bombarded with requests , many they consider oddly inappropriate everybody wants to do standup comedy everywhere and anywhere and they find any excuse , mr hussein said he added , imitating a caller , we have this workshop about the koran , omar , come do some standup comedy' i get invites like that
tokyo i looked at my coworkers and then dove for cover i thought that s what one did during an earthquake but no matter how i contorted my 6 3 frame , my legs jutted out from under my childsized desk the shaking lasted a long time i prayed it would end , hoped it wouldn t get worse to calm myself , i thought about my niece and nephew back in maryland when i finally emerged , a colleague told me that the earthquake was centered in northern japan peering at her computer screen , i fixated on a news report s color coded map of the country the north was red tokyo was orange \( may i never know what red feels like \) it was only about 3 pm , but i asked my colleagues if they were leaving they didn t know one asked me if i d heard the warning on the loudspeaker two minutes before the quake but as a foreigner who is struggling to learn japanese , i hadn t noticed it , or didn t understand i began to fear that i was missing the information i needed to make an educated decision on what to do no one else had a clear plan either then the ground shook again another colleague told me that it wasn t an aftershock , but another quake , closer to tokyo this time , but still not as bad as the 1923 quake that devastated the region after the ground settled , i was amazed to find that none of my coworkers were leaving the office i couldn t tell if it was dedication to work , fear or confidence that the worst was behind us i feared it was only indecision i left i walked down 11 flights of stairs , and entered the stream of hundreds of others in the streets they were all donning white construction hats , that appeared to have been issued to everyone but me the streets were teeming the giant ant nest of tokyo had been shaken and we were all hopelessly searching for stable ground i fortunately live a 20minute walk from work in a new apartment building that my real estate agent had assured me was quite sturdy others weren t so lucky most people who work here live more than an hour away by train but tokyo s trains had stopped running , and the highways were closed helicopters roared aimlessly above police sirens blared and lines of people waited for buses that never appeared to come normally empty taxis never had a better day although many people were armed with maps , it was not clear where they were going a lone man with a creaky prosthesis hobbled along i wanted to help , but didn t know how the sky was a deep , apocalyptic gray a fearsome mix of rain clouds and smoke from an oil refinery fire across the city but while i was walking , the sun began to penetrate through , albeit hesitantly , looking more like a moon than a determined winter sun within minutes , the sky turned clear , as if a light blue sheet had been pulled over the city an abnormally strong wind blew , and a precarious sense of normalcy returned construction crews were going back to work restaurants , still serving food at home , i belatedly prepared for the disaster that had already happened i filled my tub with water i went back out to the store to add tuna , nuts and ramen noodles to my food stash the shelves were surprisingly full more full than i d seen them before certain snow storms in new york but i worried the supplies wouldn t last long i kept trying to ask people if they had any news my attempts in broken japanese to find out from a vegetable street vendor if any government warnings had been issued were futile my beginner language lessons hadn t covered earthquake safety instead i bought some carrots back at home , i briefly watched the devastation play out live on television it was like some gruesome hollywood movie while the world occasionally rocked under my feet the aftershocks weren t strong enough to knock over bottles , but they were enough to remind me that we were still not in control as night fell , traffic stalled nothing was moving it was as if a billy joel concert had been let out at every corner of the city the people on the streets were no longer walking with such purpose some were now aimlessly wandering , resigned that they might not get home tonight at all civility still reigned though pedestrians waited for traffic lights to turn green before they crossed the road and no car horns blared despite some serious damage in tokyo , we were far more fortunate than those further north , who suffered a devastating tsunami in addition to the quake as i reflect on the day s events , i have an eerie feeling that this was some sort of a trial run those of us in tokyo , i fear , are still waiting for our big one david s abraham is a hitachi international affairs fellow at the council on foreign relations based in tokyo
new delhi prime minister , facing public anger over corruption scandals and the lagging performance of his government , shuffled his cabinet on wednesday , demoting if not firing several ministers who had been either brushed by scandal or criticized for poor work taken as a whole , the changes amounted to tinkering rather than the wholesale overhaul that many analysts had thought necessary to energize the national government speaking with indian reporters , mr singh described the moves as minor and predicted that a more expansive exercise would occur after the completion of the budgetary session of s parliament it is the entree before the main course , said mahesh rangarajan , a political analyst in new delhi the main course will only be served after the budget shahnawaz hussain , speaking for the opposition bharatiya janata party , said there is no political message in this reshuffle the government did not show any courage to remove those who are involved in corrupt practices for months , even as india s economy has grown at roughly 9 percent , the coalition national government , led by the indian national congress party , has often seemed adrift , battered by a litany of corruption scandals and criticized for failing to meet goals on road building , power generation and a host of other issues as the head of the government , if not the head of the congress party , mr singh has taken his share of blame as opposition leaders have blasted him as weak and ineffective his reputation for honesty , integrity and good management has taken a beating as critics have faulted him for failing to stop the graft and corruption in his administration even if he has not personally been accused of any wrongdoing indian commentators mostly seemed unimpressed with wednesday s changes , which culminated in a nationally televised swearingin ceremony for new ministers at the presidential palace in new delhi but the thrust of the changes seemed intended to signal to the public that mr singh and sonia gandhi , president of the congress party , were moving to tackle corruption the three most telling moves involved the ministries that oversee petroleum , aviation and roads and highways each involves lucrative contracts and has been brushed by allegations of scandal yet none of the incumbents were fired , only moved to arguably lesser positions kamal nath was moved from road transport to urban development praful patel , formerly responsible for aviation , was moved to the ministry of heavy industry and murli deora was shifted from the petroleum ministry to the lesser perch of corporate affairs in each case , their successors were figures with upright political reputations they are trying to respond to the season of scandals with clean r sum s , mr rangarajan , the analyst , said in addition , m s gill , whose sports ministry was strongly criticized for the poor handling of the commonwealth games , was demoted to the ministry overseeing statistics mr rangarajan also noted that sharad pawar , a key coalition partner in the government , had important pieces of his portfolio as agriculture minister taken away though mr singh leads the government , analysts say the cabinet changes reflect a joint decision by the prime minister , mrs gandhi and powerful leaders in the congress party and other parties in the coalition
san francisco , often america s most distinguished ballet company outside new york , regularly sets standards that match new york s no other american company covers an equal range of international ballet styles none surpass it for overall elegance and finesse of execution no other has a greater number of ballerinas worthy of the leading roles of its repertory its levels of orchestral playing are generally better than those of its new york peers the troupe s virtues , however , do n't always add up as they should too many of the dancers can show a certain polished blandness and over the years it s been easy to dismiss the offerings of the company s two home choreographers , helgi tomasson \( artistic director and principal choreographer \) and yuri possokhov \( choreographer in residence \) mr tomasson s work tends to be instantly forgettable mr possokhov s ballets have prompted keen loyalties in the bay area but have looked lightweight when danced in new york or london yet such dismissals should not be too readily made witness the i caught last week the programs included along with ballets by balanchine , kenneth macmillan and william forsythe mr tomasson s trio \( which had its premiere this season \) and revivals of both his nanna s lied and mr possokhov s classical symphony the premiere of classical symphony last year caused wild excitement here and this exhilarating and bold display of fullthrottle academic pure dance with modern accentuations does indeed appear to be a breakthrough on his part set to the prokofiev symphony of the same title , classical symphony is dedicated to peter pestov , a revered teacher of mr possokhov s \( mr pestov , who has taught at the stuttgart ballet s john cranko school of ballet since 1996 , also trained alexei ratmansky , now artist in residence at american ballet theater \) the most striking aspects of classical symphony , as seen on friday , are the sheer exuberance of its often unorthodox ballet virtuosity , its eagerness to tip and twist the torso vividly while dancing lowerbody movements , and its preparedness to make drastic but happy juxtapositions of contrasting ballet positions and steps it s hardly begun when a man lands from double air turns into a plunging grand pli a woman butts her head forward , following that through with a ripple that passes down her spine , and thus shows offbalance dancing as an adventure in progress a man spins in a conventional grande pirouette \( torso vertical , leg extended sideways \) , but ends it by diving into an arabesque pench e , his torso descending while his raised leg beams high behind him both men and women do pirouettes on their knees , the women with the men s support none of these peculiar step combinations are merely isolated stunts classical symphony creates a remarkably fulltilt style , with steps recurring as motifs , and many connections of movement whereas the choreographic effects of mr forsythe or wayne mcgregor tend to look coldly empty in their reaccentuation of body parts , almost all those in classical symphony are organically linked often it feels like a vital outpouring , and it shows strokes of wit it s weakest in its use of the music , sometimes paying only casual attention to the score and though its vision of ballet means an excitingly reinvigorated view of the academic vocabulary , it proposes no special vision of the ethos of classicism itself still , with limited means \( seven couples \) , it achieves much on friday maria kochetkova and hansuke yamamoto led the proceedings though i doubt classical symphony will prove a masterpiece , its sheer nerve and verve are hard to resist it was hard to believe mr tomasson s two ballets were by the same person his 1993 work nanna s lied , to music by kurt weill and friedrich hollaender , is dismaying in every way , notably in its tedious pace and , worse , in its presentation of its heroine as a glutton for punishment , inviting abuse of one kind or another from a series of men not even the remarkable sarah van patten could redeem its dreary masochism by contrast , trio showcases dancers handsomely , strikes new moods in the first three movements and builds the fourth effectively out of the third the music is tchaikovsky s souvenir de florence the main melody of the first movement arrives , several times , hauntingly out of nowhere , like the intoxicating continuation of something else each time mr tomasson catches that in some new way for vanessa zahorian this admirable ballerina has never looked so glamorous , so sumptuously glowing as here joan boada partners her excellently and casts plenty of light on his own ms van patten , in the second movement , is absorbingly suffused by emotion \( the situation shows her with loyalties powerfully but mysteriously divided between different men , tiit helimets and vito mazzeo \) ms kochetkova and gennadi nedvigin led the folkcolored third and fourth movements with lan though the choreography has no special complexities , the way it displays dancers and its range of strong colors are entirely pleasing the company has just acquired macmillan s winter dreams , his oneact 1991 adaptation of chekhov s three sisters no single reaction is possible the work manages to exhibit both macmillan s worst flaws of construction and his unmistakable gifts for dramatic seriousness it takes too long to guess how any man is connected to these three sisters at the end there s an onstage duel in which only those who know their chekhov can have a clue who s fighting whom , let alone why yet several of the dances combine depth with subtlety the entire cast rose to the challenges ms zahorian , scarcely recognizable as olga , and damian smith , as kulygin , were especially admirable i have no time for mr forsythe s artifact suite \( 2004 \) , a hollow work so ponderously schematic that it s more like a diagram than like a ballet by contrast , balanchine s theme and variations \( 1947 \) is endlessly rewarding in the ballerina role , frances chung is strong and lucid what she lacks as yet is a powerful dynamic range and the quality of elegant stretch that would turn her clarity into amplitude her partner here , vitor luiz , who joined san francisco ballet in 2009 , looks to be a real asset to the company this troupe s dancing in balanchine is not fully alert here , but its stylistic versatility throughout these performances is a great achievement
ezra klein has a generally reasonable analysis of the obama administration s failure to respond with sufficient force to the economic crisis broadly speaking , he s saying that the eurovenn applied an economically adequate response lay beyond the bounds of the politically feasible in general , i m trying not to do too much looking back the question is what to do now still , i guess this needs addressing there s certainly a lot to ezra s thesis yet i think he lets obama and company off the hook too much a few specific points 1 i think too much is being made of the fact that subsequent revisions have shown that the economy was in even worse shape in early 2009 than we knew at the time there was already plenty of evidence that it was in terrible shape and needed a much bigger boost than the administration proposed and as regular readers know , this isn t 2020 hindsight i was frantic about this at the time 2 the forecast that assumed rapid recovery even without stimulus has been a deep source of embarrassment , and remains inexplicable to me we had lots of reason to believe that this was going to be a prolonged slump not just reinhart rogoff , but also the evidence of the last two us business cycles again , i was warning about this at the time 3 this in turn means that the focus on fastacting policies was misplaced shovelready wasn t as important as it was made out to be and the stimulus would have been a lot closer to adequate if more of it had consisted of infrastructure spending rather than tax cuts 4 politically , the administration was wildly naive in believing that it could easily come back for more if the initial stimulus proved inadequate again , this isn t hindsight i was frantic about this too , right from the beginning if they thought this likely as they should have they should have laid the legislative groundwork for a second round , through reconciliation if necessary , right at the start 5 even without that groundwork , my sense is that there was a window for additional action in the fall of 2009 , and that the administration sheered off from even trying 6 relatedly , the insistence of the administration that the stimulus was just right , long after it was obvious that it had been too small , did a lot of political damage remember the summer of recovery \? 7 the political response to the new jobs bill has been pretty good which in turn strongly suggests that the pivot from jobs to deficit reduction in early 2010 was a big mistake maybe probably nothing could have passed but the white house might have been able to make a better case by accusing republicans of blocking job creation rather than adopting their rhetoric now , ezra may be right that none of this would have made much difference but the white house was weak and confused in the face of a political and economic debacle , when it should have gone all out and you know what \? it should still go all out the chances of success are lower than they would have been if it had taken a strong position two years ago , but it ain t over until it s over
the stone is featuring occasional posts by gary gutting , a professor of philosophy at the university of notre dame , that apply critical thinking to information and events that have appeared in the news the occupy wall street protest movement has raised serious questions about the role of capitalist institutions , particularly corporations , in our society well before the first protester set foot in zucotti park , a heckler urged mitt romney to tax corporations rather than people romney s response corporations are people stirred a brief but intense controversy now thousands of demonstrators have in effect joined the heckler , denouncing corporations as enemies of the people who s right \? thinking pedantically , we can see ways in which romney was literally correct for example , corporations are nothing other than the people who own , run and work for them , and they are recognized as persons in some technical legal sense but it is also obvious that corporations are not people in a full moral sense they cannot , for example , fall in love , write poetry or be depressed far more important than questions about what corporations are \( ontological questions , as philosophers say \) is the question of what attitude we should have toward them should we , as corporate public relations statements often suggest , think of them as friends \( if we buy and are satisfied with their products \) or as family \( if we work for them \) \? does it make sense to be loyal to a corporation as either a customer or as an employee \? more generally , even granted that corporations are not fully persons in the way that individuals are , do they have some important moral standing in our society \? my answer to all these questions is no , because corporations have no core dedication to fundamental human values \( to be clear , i am speaking primarily of large , forprofit , publicly owned corporations \) such corporations exist as instruments of profit for their shareholders this does not mean that they are inevitably evil or that they do not make essential economic contributions to society but it does mean that their moral and social value is entirely instrumental there are ways we can use corporations as means to achieve fundamental human values , but corporations do not of themselves work for these values in fact , left to themselves , they can be serious threats to human values that conflict with the goal of corporate profit corporations are a particular threat to truth , a value essential in a democracy , which places a premium on the informed decisions of individual citizens the corporate threat is most apparent in advertising , which explicitly aims at convincing us to prefer a product regardless of its actual merit but even more important is the role of corporations in debates over public policy here their immense financial resources give them a privileged position especially through lobbying to argue not for what they think is the truth but for what promises to promote their profits it s a sign of corporations power that their views are often treated on a par with those of advocacy groups \( from the aclu to the nra \) that are , at least to some serious extent , arguing for what their members actually believe in debates on any issue affecting them , the arguments that corporations advance receive extraordinary consideration , even though we know full well that corporate views express not convictions but selfinterest but , you may object , what s wrong with selfinterest \? aren t all parties to political debate moved by some sort of selfinterest \? in fact , isn t the point of our political process to make a decision that somehow balances these conflicting interests \? actually , no many participants in policy debates hold strong convictions , independent or even opposed to their selfinterest liberals support higher taxes for themselves , conservatives reject government programs that would assist them , those advantaged by racial and gender discrimination vote to end it our democracy depends on our willingness to support decisions we see as right even if they work to our disadvantage corporations , however , are typically immune to such considerations since their defining goal is to generate profit individuals running corporations may well be civicminded and altruistic and may try to make company policies work for the public good they may also be motivated by excellence making a good product or providing a service useful to many people but ultimately profit is king the very nature of a corporation makes profits essential those that lose money will not survive there are cases when telling the truth is the best means to advance corporate profits in 1982 , when seven people in chicago died from poisoned tylenol , johnson johnson appealed to its credo , which makes concern for its customers a primary corporate goal , and told the entire truth about what had happened this honesty turned a potential publicrelations disaster into a triumph it s not , however , unfair to ask what johnson johnson or any other company would have done if there were a deceptive response that seemed likely to prove more profitable in the long run even johnson johnson s impressive corporate credo ends by saying , our final responsibility is to our stockholders and business must make a solid profit the credo is unclear about what happens when there is a conflict between responsible action and longterm profit given their raison d tre , when push comes to shove corporations will honor their commitments to shareholders profit moreover , from the profit standpoint that defines a corporation , it is clear that the appearance of social responsibility is worth far more than the thing itself truth is not a primary corporate value none of this means that corporations are evil or that socialism should replace the freeenterprise system as michel foucault said of all power structures , it s not that corporations are bad but that they are dangerous the selfserving corporate speech that fills our media and halls of government is particularly dangerous for our democracy at least for this reason , the occupy wall street protesters are right to distrust corporations
london prime minister set a modest target for early british troop withdrawals from afghanistan on wednesday , deferring to british military commanders who had cautioned publicly against an accelerated schedule more closely paralleled on the announced two weeks ago by president obama as part of what he called a hardheaded approach to the war , mr cameron told the house of commons that the british pullout would be limited to 500 troops in 2012 , on top of 460 being withdrawn this year the 2012 number is about half of what mr cameron and his downing street security team were previously considering moreover , none of the 500 soldiers to be pulled out next year will be combat troops the british plan will leave a force of 9 , 000 , still the secondlargest foreign troop presence in afghanistan , after the united states by announcing the cautious scale of the 2012 pullout , mr cameron balanced popular unrest about the war against the advice of british military commanders they had cautioned against a larger 2012 withdrawal , saying it would deny them the combat troops they needed for two more full fighting seasons this year and next to consolidate recent gains against the taliban similar arguments were made unsuccessfully by american military officials , including gen david h petraeus , the united states commander in afghanistan , when president obama was reviewing his own plan earlier this summer in his announcement on june 22 , mr obama said american troop levels would be cut by 10 , 000 this year and 23 , 000 by september 2012 , effectively reversing the surge ordered by mr obama in 2009 that has been credited with blunting the momentum of the taliban mr obama s decision prompted critics on both sides of the atlantic to say that he was putting the recent war gains at risk , particularly in helmand province , the most active center of the taliban insurgency , where the bulk of the american surge troops have been fighting alongside british units while general petraeus and other american commanders have limited their public demurrals to saying the american cuts were more aggressive than they would have liked , some critics in , including the recently retired top military officer , air chief marshal jock stirrup , have suggested that mr obama s schedule was set less by military realities than with an eye to next year s presidential election in the commons , mr cameron , comparing the british withdrawal plan to mr obama s , cited the american leader s avowal that the mission in afghanistan was changing from combat to support , as afghan s forces ready themselves to take the lead in the war but the prime minister cautioned against direct comparisons , noting the large disproportion in the two countries' troop commitments american withdrawals over the next 14 months will leave about 70 , 000 american troops in afghanistan , still more than half the total force deployed by the 48 nations that make up the international force still , mr obama s decision to reduce the american deployment by a third , with combat troops accounting for most of that figure , gave fresh momentum to the longrunning and increasingly fractious debate across europe about the prospects for military success in afghanistan that has been especially true in those countries that contribute the bulk of the nonamerican forces deployed there in britain , as elsewhere in europe , public opinion has been running strongly against the war , fueled in large part by the 375 british troops that have been killed there , a number that , proportional to the number of troops deployed , is higher than the 1 , 651 american troops who have lost their lives the costs , too , have been heavy , with british officials saying the expense since 2001 has now exceeded 14 billion pounds , equivalent to more than 22 billion mr cameron s preparation for wednesday s withdrawal announcement , centering on a trip to helmand earlier this week , was jarred when a 20yearold british soldier from a scottish regiment was found dead 14 hours after he left his remote helmand base alone after a stint of sentry duty at the base s gates his body was found three miles away , with a shot to the back of his head the taliban , who displayed the body publicly before dumping it in the canal , acknowledged killing him mr cameron s announcement means that british combat withdrawals will now be concentrated in 2013 and 2014 , ahead of the december 2014 deadline he has set for an end to british combat operations mr obama has left the date for an end to all american combat operations vague , saying the process of transition to afghan troops and police will come at the end of 2014 mr cameron signaled that a significant british force , estimated by commanders at about 2 , 000 , would remain past 2015 for noncombat duties , including running a new officer s training academy that britain has agreed to establish called sandhurst in the sand by officers , after the military academy in britain but mr cameron , who faces a general election in 2015 , told questioners in the commons that the deadline for an end to british combat operations would not be altered , even if progress in the war with the taliban falters he said , the country needs to know that there is an end point
washington the iranian president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , is being sidelined by religious fundamentalists , and it s bad news for american officials seeking to halt iran s nuclear program the same iranian leader who dabbled in holocaust denial and messianic fantasies was , paradoxically , also the theocracy s most ardent advocate of direct nuclear negotiations with washington as mr ahmadinejad with iran s hardline religious leaders , the prospect of a nuclear deal between tehran and washington is diminishing once the darling of clerical conservatives , who only two years ago rigged the system to ensure his reelection , mr ahmadinejad is now clinging to his post amid furious recriminations from his erstwhile allies his fall from grace has been fierce and fast in what is only the latest in a series of humiliating comedowns , mr ahmadinejad was at a service commemorating the leader of the 1979 islamic revolution the most devastating blow came in may from iran s supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , who his handpicked prot g in a clash over presidential powers iran s islamist clerics deliberately made the presidency a weak office , due to their enduring suspicion of central authority and popular elections , and each of mr ahmadinejad s predecessors plainly chafed at its limitations the brash mr ahmadinejad persistently sought to transcend these constraints by deftly exploiting nationalist impulses and economic grievances , the president used every opportunity to build a power base and assert his influence these same shrewd political instincts drove him to embrace the notion of negotiations with washington , a proposition fundamentally at odds with the clerics' official ideology of antiamericanism mr ahmadinejad s interest in dialogue was not motivated by any appreciation of american civilization or an impulse to reconcile rather , the provocative president saw talks as a means of boosting his stature at home and abroad while touting his vision of a strong nucleararmed iran for a politician with delusions of his own grandeur , the idea of highprofile negotiations with washington offered an opportunity to strut on the world stage as the champion of a new , antiamerican world order iran s conservative establishment has long recognized mr ahmadinejad s ambitions as a threat , both to their political domination and to their ideology however , for as long as mr ahmadinejad s rabblerousing served the purposes of the regime , mr khamenei indulged and even encouraged him until the president s pretensions began to infringe on mr khamenei s authority having finally kneecapped the unruly mr ahmadinejad , the supreme leader is now more firmly in control of iran than ever before none of the relevant decisionmakers are willing or able to push back against mr khamenei s hostile and suspicious stance toward the west and as turmoil spreads through the region , iran is seeking to expand its influence across the greater middle east and beyond an increasingly confident and aggressive iran is unlikely to accept meaningful limitations on its nuclear ambitions or sever its ties to militant groups like hamas and hezbollah this poses a real conundrum for policy makers in the united states and europe , who have been relying almost exclusively on economic sanctions to impede iran s nuclear progress while hoping that factional infighting might eventually lead the regime to collapse both strategies are likely to fall short after all , iran s nuclear program was revived by the clerics during a period of isolation and wartime austerity as iran fought iraq in the 1980s , and fierce debate among iranian elites is hardly new still , the current political upheaval in the region does make the iranian regime vulnerable moreover , mr khamenei s increasing absolutism has alienated not just iran s citizenry but even his loyal foot soldiers , from the revolution s founding fathers , like the former president ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani , to its zealous children , like mr ahmadinejad a regime riven by internal conflicts , leery of its constituents , under economic duress , and surrounded by burgeoning antiauthoritarian protest movements offers its own share of pressure points and a more creative american approach could pay dividends , as shifting alignments among iran s political class offer opportunities to reshape iran s priorities washington must appreciate that it is locked in a prolonged struggle for regional influence with one of its least predictable foes to prevail in this conflict , washington must abandon any expectation that tehran can be seduced or coerced to the negotiating table american policy should seek to maximize financial and technological constraints on the iranian nuclear program , strengthen iran s opposition , exacerbate the many fissures within its political class and insulate iran s neighbors from its nefarious activities the leaders of a revolution that has once again devoured its own can surely be thwarted by the united states and its allies
one coach doused a heckling fan with water the other became famous for inserting the same profanity in each clause of a long , supposedtobeinspirational dressingroom speech the firstround series between the and the that helps kick off the 2011 stanley cup playoffs on wednesday does not lack for color sixteen teams will clash in eight series as the longest , most physically taxing postseason tournament in professional sports gets under way the defending champions , the chicago blackhawks , backed into the playoffs on the last night of the season and are not expected to repeat hockey s biggest star , sidney crosby of the pittsburgh penguins , is still recovering from an early january concussion and may not play in the first round , or at all this postseason the capitals , led by their star , , are among several teams considered legitimate contenders for the stanley cup , but washington will first have to overcome the rangers , a team that beat them by 70 and 60 en route to taking the season series , 6 points to 3 two years ago , when the teams met in a memorable openinground series , the new york rangers' coach , john tortorella , was suspended for a playoff game after he squirted water between panes of plexiglass at a washington fan he then threw the plastic bottle into the crowd that prompted capitals fans to show up for the next home game in rain gear capitals coach bruce boudreau had his own colorful or offcolor moment this season when his profanitylaced intermission speech to his slumping players was captured on hbo s 24 7 series and became a youtube sensation there is reason to believe the rangers , seeded eighth in the eastern conference , can go the distance against the no 1 capitals washington finished strong , winning 15 of its last 20 but so did the rangers , winning 11 of 16 ovechkin is coming off his lowestscoring season 32 goals and 53 assists but the rangers' top sniper , marian gaborik , had 22 goals and 26 assists , his least productive season since 20034 i hope gabby realizes the slate is clean , so let s go to work , tortorella said monday washington s goaltending situation is unsettled it is unclear whether boudreau will turn to semyon varlamov , michal neuvirth or even braden holtby rangers goalie , coming off another brilliant stretch run and the best regular season of his career , has yet to carry his team deep into the postseason it may come down to how well the rangers' defense can hold off ovechkin and washington s other top forwards , nicklas backstrom and alexander semin the rangers' best defensive pair in terms of plusminus , michael sauer and ryan mcdonagh , are rookies , and mcdonagh said he had never played in a long playoff series in other east matchups the sabres have won 16 of 24 since their new owner , terry pegula , took over in february and sparked a return to optimism goaltender ryan miller seems recovered from a lateseason injury the flyers won just 3 of their last 11 , but they are essentially the same club that rallied from a threegamestonone deficit to beat the bruins last spring en route to the stanley cup finals this matchup already had more than 80 years of history behind it , and new chapters were added the last two months , first by a fullscale line brawl , then by the bruins' zdeno chara s shouldering the canadiens' max pacioretty into a glasssupport stanchion at full speed the bruins have the league s best goalie , tim thomas , who set a record with a 938 save percentage but last year , the canadiens eliminated the capitals in the first round and the penguins in the second in upsets , and their fans would love to see them bounce boston the penguins have been without their stars sidney crosby and evgeni malkin for months yet they finished just 3 points off the conference lead because of the coaching of dan bylsma and the goalkeeping of marcandre fleury but martin st louis , steven stamkos and vincent lecavalier combined goal total 101 give the lightning plenty of firepower it may come down to whether tampa bay s 41yearold goalie , dwayne roloson , can improve on his 912 save percentage against what remains of the penguins' attack the western conference matchups the blackhawks beat the canucks in six games in last season s second round , but this year vancouver ran away with the regularseason championship behind the combined 198 points of the sedin twins , while the blackhawks sneaked in when the dallas stars lost their finale the hawks' experience goes to show that no stanley cup team can lose nine regulars for salarycap reasons and expect to thrive the following season the kings are given little hope now that their top scorer , anze kopitar , is lost to an ankle injury the sharks , who have struggled in the playoffs , seemed to get the monkey off their backs last season by making it to the third round , but they were then swept by the blackhawks a repeat of last season s opening round , won by the red wings in seven as with last year , the main question is whether the coyotes will still be in arizona once next fall rolls around detroit s 41yearold defenseman , nicklas lidstrom , is in the running for his seventh norris trophy the coyotes are trying to win a playoff series for the first time since moving from winnipeg in 1996 this series pits the league s top scorer , the ducks' 50goal man , corey perry \( including 19 in his last 16 games \) , against the predators' underrated goalie , pekka rinne the ducks' attack includes teemu selanne , who with 80 points in 73 games became the third player

forget , for a moment , what you know about surfing the professional sport , the multipurpose verb and online metaphor put aside the beach boys , the baggies , the huarache sandals , too surfing s all that but those bushy bushy blond hairdos have dark brown roots two new books and a documentary film , all out this year , are reclaiming the story of surfing as hawaiians once knew it they are telling the neglected tale of one little world , on eight little islands surfing before outsiders took it to california and far beyond hawaiian surfing traditions from the past is the most startling of the three john clark , a surfer who was once deputy chief of the honolulu fire department , draws deeply from hawaiianlanguage newspapers from the 1800s , after europeans arrived but before the stark eclipse of hawaii s population , tradition and culture , a loss that native descendants have been striving for generations to reverse tracing every reference he can find to surfing , beaches and waves in the hawaiian language , mr clark shows surfing as a social sport played on a scale unimaginable anywhere today in old hawaii , everyone surfed , children to grandparents they surfed with long boards and short boards and no boards they surfed big winter waves and lazy shore breaks they surfed the mouths of rivers they surfed the beach , skimming on sheets of water left by receding foam they surfed with banana stalks after hotels came to waikiki , they surfed with wet pillowcases they 'd fill them with air , run , flop and fly when the surf was good , the whole village got up and moved to the beach and everybody jumped in the water , mr clark said in a phone interview from honolulu this amazed the europeans , who watched children play in the zone that to them meant shipwrecks and broken necks none but natives ever master the art of surfbathing , mark twain wrote in 1866 , after wiping out surfing required not just grace but strength , since the old boards were heavy , finless slabs of wood you could n't paddle out while lying on one you 'd have to swim behind , pushing like a tugboat rides were tricky but then , as now , they were exhilarating in the old stories and news accounts , mr clark finds frequent comparisons of surfers to ocean birds , and references to surfing as a sexual dance soon enough , though , the missionaries made everyone put on pants and muumuus they discouraged idling and sensuous pastimes like surfing and hula the young princess kaiulani kept surfing in waikiki , a pointed act of rebellion but surfing declined steeply in the early 20th century hawaiians kept at it , though , as surfing evolved into an individual sport , with athletes like duke kahanamoku , the waikiki beach boy and olympic star kahanamoku and other legends , like buffalo keaulana and wally froiseth , appear in a deeper shade of blue , a documentary by jack mccoy , which uses stunning footage to show that hawaiians remain great innovators and keepers of the soul of surfing and in waves of resistance surfing and history in twentiethcentury hawaii , isaiah helekunihi walker , a history professor at brigham young universityhawaii , takes the story to the present day he argues that the surf zone is one place where native hawaiians have successfully resisted the encroachments of outsiders hawaiians lost their kingdom in 1893 , but surfers , he said , have been leaders in a struggle for environmental and cultural renewal they may have been pushed off the land , but have not yet lost the waves
not long after his mother was murdered , 3 1 2yearold eric morton began to tell his grandmother what he had seen that terrible day mommy s crying she s stop it go away , his grandmother said he told her she asked why his mother was crying 'cause the monster s there , he said gingerly , she pressed for more details he hit mommy he broke the bed , her grandson said is mommy still crying \? no , mommy stopped finally , his grandmother asked the question she was most dreading was daddy there \? no , he said mommy and eric was there the next day , she called the lead sheriff s investigator to tell him what the boy had said and that she no longer suspected that her soninlaw , michael morton , had killed her daughter , christine she urged the investigator to abandon the domestic thing now and look for the monster days after mrs morton s badly beaten body was found in her bed in august 1986 , someone used her credit card in another city and a check was cashed with her forged signature the sheriff s investigators who saw mr morton as the prime suspect had that information and a transcript of the grandmother s call but when he was on trial facing a life sentence for murder , his defense lawyers knew none of it a quartercentury later , after six years of fighting for dna tests that now almost certainly will result in the reversal of mr morton s conviction , his lawyers say prosecutors withheld this and other exculpatory evidence from his original defense lawyers and from the trial judge despite orders to turn it over in court filings , the prosecutors have denied accusations of wrongdoing since 1994 , dna tests have exonerated 44 texas inmates , according to the innocence project of texas , based in lubbock in the wake of those cases , texas lawmakers have made significant reforms to criminal justice procedures to help prevent but defense lawyers and mr morton s advocates argue that under antiquated texas discovery laws , the alleged injustices that robbed him of 25 years could still happen michael s struggle would be in vain if we did n't think soberly about what went wrong in his case and how it can be fixed , said nina morrison , senior staff lawyer for the innocence project , which worked on mr morton s case and which is based in new york the landmark 1963 united states supreme court decision brady v maryland requires prosecutors to provide defendants with exculpatory evidence information that could prove their innocence but texas law does not define exculpatory evidence , and there is no statewide standard prosecutors or trial judges typically decide what qualifies state law does not require prosecutors to automatically share with defense lawyers even basic information like police reports and witness statements many prosecutors , including district attorneys in dallas , houston , fort worth and austin , have adopted openfile policies that require their lawyers to share all their evidence with the defense tarrant county adopted its policy in the 1970s , said jack strickland , a former defense lawyer who is deputy chief in the district attorney s criminal division the more serious the case , the more serious the potential consequences , mr strickland said we wanted to have as much transparency as we could because of the stakes involved in 2010 , the timothy cole advisory panel , a committee created to recommend new laws that might prevent wrongful convictions , urged legislators to adopt a mandatory statewide discovery policy seven of texas' first 39 dna exonerations involved evidence suppression or other prosecutorial misconduct , according to the panel s report the panel named after a lubbock man charged with rape who died in prison before exonerated him told lawmakers that texas should follow the example of other states that require lawyers on both sides to share information in criminal cases we have 254 counties in this state , and potentially 254 ways of deciding what the defense will see prior to trial , said kathryn kase , executive director of the texas defender service and a member of the tim cole panel since 2007 , lawmakers have proposed more than a halfdozen measures that would have expanded access to discovery none have passed senator rodney ellis , democrat of houston , who is also chairman of the innocence project , said prosecutors had worked to stymie the measures the opposition , he said , reflects an attitude among many texas prosecutors that a conviction equals a win the role of the prosecutor is to discover the truth , said mr ellis , who is also a lawyer but oftentimes there s more interest in getting a conviction he pointed to a recent decision of the texas district and county attorneys association to honor a prosecutor who had intervened to stop a court hearing meant to examine whether cameron todd willingham was innocent mr willingham was executed in 2004 for the 1991 arson fire that killed his three young daughters numerous scientists have since discredited the evidence used to convict him i think the morton case is going to be a catalyst for moving some of those reforms forward , mr ellis said john bradley , the williamson county district attorney , whom gov rick perry appointed in 2009 to lead an independent panel charged with reviewing forensic evidence in criminal cases , was an ardent opponent of reexamining the willingham case mr bradley has also most recently been in charge of the morton prosecution for more than six years he opposed the dna testing that led to mr morton s release from prison last week and an agreement by prosecutors to seek to have his conviction overturned he also resisted efforts by mr morton s lawyers to use publicinformation laws to gain access to evidence in the original prosecutors' files mr bradley publicly derided the lawyers' efforts to prove that a mystery killer killed christine morton mr bradley said last week that he had resisted efforts to test the dna for goodfaith reasons that he could not discuss because of the continuing investigation prosecutors , though , have not been the only ones to object to expanding discovery , said rob kepple , executive director of the texas district and county attorneys association defense lawyers , he said , have objected to legislation that would also require them to turn over evidence to prosecutors what is more , mr kepple said , a new discovery law would not have prevented the kind of misconduct alleged in the morton case if a prosecutor or investigator decides to withhold key information even in the face of the brady rules that already require its release , he said , a new state law will not spur their compliance if somebody did n't play fair back then , he said , i'm not sure exactly what law we change today to address it indeed , in tarrant county , where the openfile policy has long been in place , mr strickland said there had been two instances in which a prosecutor suppressed evidence to help secure death penalty convictions the same lawyer worked on both cases and is no longer employed at the tarrant county district attorney s office , he said you ca n't discount the possibility that somebody is going to come in and make a conscious decision to do something wrong , mr strickland said despite that aberration , he said , the openfile policy has only helped tarrant county it is an advantage for defense lawyers , since they can quickly access information they need to represent their clients , he said , and it helps prosecutors because they do not have to spend time and money fighting in court over access to evidence it s a downside only if you think winning is everything , mr strickland said and winning is not everything
at last , there was a dignified moment in the decline and fall of anthony weiner certainly there had been none in the new york democrat s personal behavior , his stalling and lying to his constituents , or the way he seemed to have misused his position to promote his online sex life neither was there any in the undisguised glee of his opponents , or the expediency that drove the reaction by his democratic colleagues but mr weiner was clear and direct at a thursday afternoon news conference , packed with reporters and one exceedingly creepy heckler he did not offer tedious mistakes were made evasions i'm here today to again apologize for the personal mistakes i have made and the embarrassment i have caused , he said i make this apology to my neighbors and my constituents , but i make it particularly to my wife , huma \( she wisely avoided the excruciating loyalwifebyhisside appearance \) there is no excuse for mr weiner s behavior , but it is worth noting the cynical way lawmakers from both houses and both parties piled on to demand his resignation there were reports before thursday that the democrats might deprive him of his committee assignments in hopes of pushing him out of the house altogether senator david vitter was not pressured by fellow republicans to resign after he was identified as a patron of a prostitution service house speaker nancy pelosi did n't immediately take away representative charles rangel s chairmanship of the taxwriting committee after allegations of misuse of campaign donations and tax evasion that eventually led to his censure we would like to think lawmakers have learned something from those episodes we fear it was just that mr weiner s offenses were particularly tabloidworthy , his abrasive manner never won him many friends and the democrats worried about losing his seat

detroit as the ball flew over his head on a trajectory that he recognized was true , the ' michael young knew his team would survive , at least for another inning the ball came screaming out of the hand of texas right fielder nelson cruz , landed in the glove of catcher mike napoli and was used to apply the tag on the lumbering 240pound frame of the ' miguel cabrera in the bottom of the eighth inning wednesday night  , said young , the rangers' first baseman as soon as i saw it go over my head , i knew we had him but the throw that connected cruz and napoli to complete an inningending double play and preserve a tie score was only a prelude to the offensive heroics they would perform three innings later in the top of the 11th , napoli hit a runscoring single off jose valverde that broke the tie , and as the , to take a threegamestoone lead in the american league championships series the rangers can earn a spot in their second consecutive world series with a victory in game 5 on thursday afternoon standing in their way will be the tigers' ace , justin verlander , who pitches against c j wilson and may be under strict orders not to pitch to cruz late in the game the home run to leftcenter was cruz s fourth homer of the series and his 10th in the last two postseasons it provided a margin of victory so large that even the scrappy tigers could not come back it was a good pitch , valverde said everybody knows the guy is a monster he got it and it was not the first time that he did , either cruz , who made the final out of the world series last year against the san francisco giants , also hit the gamewinning grand slam in the 11th inning of game 2 in texas he has 9 runs batted in and 18 total bases in just the first four games it s not easy , he said like , people ask me if it s that easy i guess if you can swing good , results are going to come but even if he had never hit the blast , cruz would still have played a crucial role with a onehop throw to savor that s a humongous play , rangers second baseman ian kinsler said just a humongous play the throw , the catch , the tag on a 290pound guy barreling down on you it s a perfect baseball play this thrilling backandforth game was accented throughout by other perfect and nearperfect plays , like napoli s throw to kinsler to nail austin jackson attempting to steal second base in the bottom of the 10th , or tigers third baseman brandon inge s twoout , twostrike home run off the previously impenetrable alexi ogando that tied the score , 33 , in the seventh inning with rain spitting onto the field all afternoon , the game began 2 hours 13 minutes late with rick porcello of the tigers and matt harrison of the rangers as the starting pitchers in front of 42 , 234 wet and patient fans at comerica park the tigers seized an early lead with a tworun double from cabrera in the third , but the rangers went ahead with three runs in the sixth on rbi hits from kinsler , elvis andrus and young but with two outs in the seventh , inge s home run on a 98mileperhour fastball from ogando , who had not been scored upon in his first five games of the postseason , drew the tigers even with one out and none on in the eighth , the rangers walked cabrera intentionally , electing to face the injured victor martinez , who had strained an oblique muscle tuesday on a home run swing in game 3 martinez bounced a single to right , sending cabrera lumbering into third base the tension mounted when delmon young , also playing with a strained oblique , lifted a fly ball into right field , moderately deep under the direction of the thirdbase coach , gene lamont , cabrera tagged at third and then ran , but cruz and napoli were up to the task napoli , fearless in the face of the charging cabrera , had enough time to get low on the play so that he was not crushed cabrera was out without dispute if i'm on that team and my thirdbase coach does n't send him , i 'd be upset , kinsler said he had to send him three innings later , josh hamilton led off with a double to rightcenter valverde struck out young , then walked adrian beltre intentionally to get to napoli napoli s single to center scored hamilton , then cruz did what he has been doing with such amazing frequency for you guys that have n't seen nelson every day , he s capable of doing exactly what he s doing , texas manager ron washington said i'm just happy that we as the texas rangers are reaping the benefit of it he added i do n't judge nelson just because he can hit balls out of the park he takes pride in every part of the game tonight , it was thank you , nelson cruz
when thinking about the candidates for the 2012 republican nomination , we can divide them into basically three groups first are candidates in a group i 'd call the fairfax five , fairfax being the name of a wealthy washington suburb in northern virginia these are the candidates who have the seal of approval of the republican establishment thinkers in washington more specifically , they 're the candidates endorsed by george f will in his march 5 column there are at most five plausible republican presidents on the horizon indiana gov mitch daniels , mississippi gov haley barbour , former utah governor and departing ambassador to china jon huntsman , former massachusetts governor mitt romney and former minnesota governor tim pawlentythese candidates are playing it by the book , hiring staff and developing campaign infrastructures they get more attention in the mainstream media than in the blogosphere they are perceived as being electable and holding some reasonable appeal to independent voters although i think haley barbour , with his track record as a lobbyist and a history of having made what are perceived to be racially insensitive remarks is a questionable case the counterpart to the fairfax five are the factional five they are unpopular with independent voters and , instead , are competing mostly for tea party voters and other conservatives that vote within the republican primary they tend to be good at drawing attention to themselves , especially on blogs and cable television shows these candidates are sarah palin , newt gingrich , michele bachmann , donald trump and ron paul that leaves a few uncategorized candidates , the most prominent of whom is mike huckabee who does not get much love from the beltway even though he polls reasonably well against president obama along with a couple of other odd cases like rudolph w giuliani and rick santorum when i think about mr trump , whose share of the republican primary vote is rising in some polls \( in fact , he s tied for first in one of them \) , i think about the fairfax five and the factional five if mr trump were going to run for president , it might have been more natural for him to do so as a social moderate but fiscal conservative , touting his executive experience and the virtues of freemarket capitalism instead , he has run far to his right , giving voice to false and misleading claims about mr obama s birth certificate , and reversing his prior , more moderate positions on gay rights and abortion while mr trump , a creature of new york rather than of washington and one who carries his share of personal baggage , might never have been the first choice of establishment republicans , he now threatens to become a problem for them mr trump was n't all that popular to begin with talking points memo s poll tracker has him with ratings of 32 percent favorable against 44 percent unfavorable among the general public and those numbers are more likely than not to worsen as he is viewed less as a celebrity and more as a politician with some outsidethemainstream views the opportunity for mr trump may have been created by the demise of the candidate who might be thought of as the founding member of the factional five sarah palin , whose numbers have declined among republican voters as she has received more criticism from the establishment for the establishment republicans , it must feel like a game of whacamole just as ms palin s numbers decline , candidates like mr trump and ms bachmann who could be nearly as problematic next november pop up in her place as a result , the fairfax five are gaining no ground at all on the factional five in fact , the opposite is true in an average of four polls of republican voters conducted in november and december , just after the midterm elections , the fairfax five collectively held 27 percent of the vote , to 31 percent for the factional five in the three most recent polls , however , the fairfax five s share has declined to 22 percent , while the factional five s mostly because of mr trump has risen to 44 percent betting markets take a more optimistic view of the fairfax five the political futures market intrade collectively has them with a 60 percent chance of winning the nomination , versus 24 percent for the factional five i'm not convinced that these markets are underrating the factional five , each one of whom has some significant liabilities as a candidate and several of whom may not run i do wonder , however , whether the sorts of candidates that mr will likes will ultimately have enough main street charisma and tea party bona fides to win over republican primary voters , especially in conservative states like iowa and south carolina there is plenty of time left , but at some point , for a candidate like mr pawlenty to prevail he has to at least begin to poll in the high single digits rather than the low single digits , which would suggest he has some fleshandblood appeal that mr trump , with such a cynical strategy , can rocket up in the polls so quickly suggests that the fairfax five and the factional five are both flawed in their own way instead , i suspect the value bets in markets like intrade and by extension , relative to conventional wisdom are those candidates who belong to neither group mr huckabee , who is given just a 1in20 chance of winning the nomination by intrade , seems woefully underrated , even in consideration of the fact that he might not run but there are other candidates deserving serious consideration who , up to this point , have entirely denied their interest in the presidency chris christie , if he generates a little bit too much fascination here in new york , does quite well in straw polls of republican activists while also having some appeal to the establishment paul ryan and marco rubio , although more likely to run in 2016 or 2020 , might take a look at this year s field and perceive a unique opportunity rick perry , who can raise oodles of money down in texas , is a plausible late entrant it s usually a mug s game to bet on candidates who have declined their interest in an election , and who may have all sorts of personal and professional reasons for doing so but if you could place a bet on none of the above as a group , you might get a good return on your investment this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo donald trump \( photograph by timothy a clary agence francepresse getty images \)
there are 101 ncaa trophies sitting in the stanford athletic hall of fame room , none of them for women s soccer that is something that the cardinal \( 2401 \) are looking to change in its fourth consecutive trip to the final four now the team is just one win away from its first college cup after a 30 victory over florida state \( 1871 \) in kennesaw , ga , on friday night stanford s first two goals were sparked by forward chioma ubogagu , a freshman who has struggled at times in her first ncaa tournament florida state controlled much of the action and generated several scoring chances , but stanford s execution in the final third sent it to the sunday final for the third straight season they like to play our kind of soccer , which is great because that s the way the game should be played , ubogagu said at the end of the day , it s all about what you do with your possession and your chances maybe we weren t possessing it as much as against past teams , but when we had opportunities , we put them away emily oliver was brilliant between the posts for the cardinal , turning away all four seminoles corners and fending off six shots on goal florida state came out strong , forcing a closerange save by oliver in the 16th minute and taking advantage of poor passing from the cardinal to control play early on stanford s opening tally ended the push by the seminoles a 21stminute corner by florida state defender tiana brockway was headed straight to ubogagu , who raced upfield and forced mccarty to slip at the center line after a giveandgo with midfielder teresa noyola , ubogagu made another defender lose her footing with some fancy dribbling in the box and sneaked a shot through the legs of goaltender kelsey wys to open the scoring at 21 18 assistant coach jay cooney pulled me aside and told me that defending on corners , they send a lot of people up , ubogagu said i had a lot of space , and teresa made a great run just two minutes later , ubogagu took a pass from lindsay taylor and made a strong run down the left side barely outracing a florida state defender , ubogagu found enough space to slip a pass to a sliding kristy zurmuhlen , whose pinpoint redirection to the near post gave the cardinal a twogoal lead chi was awesome tonight , oliver said it s not easy as a freshman to come in on a big stage , but i think she did great tonight she was her normal self she was just taking people on and making things happen the shellshocked seminoles eventually responded to threaten several times late in the half , but failed to take advantage of a series of opportunities frustrated most of all was their star forward tiffany mccarty a 18goalscorer , she left the field in the final minute of the opening half , blood pouring from her nose , only seconds after missing an open look just over the crossbar , her only shot of the match oliver kept stanford ahead with a pair of fingertip saves in a 46second span early in the second half , tipping a brockway free kick over the crossbar before diving to her left for another lastsecond stop on the ensuing corner emily is an incredible keeper i can speak for the team in saying that we feel so confident and comfortable having her in the back of the goal , ubogagu said there were some exchanges that could have been gamechangers , but she helped us settle down and pick up right where we left off and for the second time friday night , the cardinal responded in front of the sophomore goalkeeper s heroics defender madeline thompson collected a stray corner kick near midfield and fed a ball into the box for alina garciamendez a defender for the mexican world cup squad last summer alongside noyola who beat out two seminoles to head in her first goal of the season the 64thminute tally ended any hope of a comeback for possessionoriented florida state , whose season was ended by the cardinal in a 50 quarterfinal rout a year ago stanford now advances to play the winner of dukewake forest in the college cup final at 1 pm sunday , hoping that it can win the national title after losing by 10 in the final in both 2009 and 2010 at this point , we have so much experience here in these big games that it s just a matter of taking care of business , oliver said i think our nerves are under control , we ve been here a number of times and we ve done a good job of giving the freshmen that have not been here an idea of what it s going to be like we re all ready to go , we just can t wait for sunday joseph beyda is a sports desk editor for the stanford daily , the independent student daily at stanford university
san francisco will walk into united states district court here on monday ready for a contest likely to be tougher than any baseball game or home run race he ever took part in nearly four years after his , bonds will be tried on charges that he lied to a federal grand jury in 2003 when he testified that he had never knowingly used steroids his legacy as baseball s home run king is at stake , as is his freedom the government , though , has just as much on the line , if not more bonds s case is the culmination of nearly a decadelong , multimillion dollar investigation into the bay area laboratory cooperative steroids case it is a very important case because they 've had the whole nation watching and they 've invested so much into it , said laurie levenson , a former federal prosecutor who is a professor at loyola law school in los angeles they want to send a message that even barry bonds has to tell the truth to a grand jury , but it s more than that the only reason they cared that he lied is that they care about steroid use among professional athletes since the balco inquiry began in 2002 , 10 people including the olympic track star marion jones and her former coach trevor graham have been convicted of federal crimes in connection with steroid use or distribution , or for lying to the government or a grand jury but none are as well known or as important for the government as bonds and none had his allstar team of lawyers bonds , who is 46 and last played for the in 2007 , has seven lawyers , and legal experts say he has easily spent more than 1 million on his defense only three of the lawyers , though , are likely to sit with bonds at the defense table during the trial , which begins with jury selection monday those lawyers allen ruby , cris arguedas and dennis riordan are regarded as some of the nation s best ruby , a partner at skadden , arps , meagher , slate flom who has represented highprofile clients including the nfl in a billion dollar suit brought by the raiders' owner , al davis will give the opening statement for the defense with a barry white baritone , the 6foot3 ruby , a former professional wrestler who spent time as a carnival barker , can captivate a jury arguedas is slightly built and unassuming but a master at crossexamination in preparation for o j simpson s murder trial , she grilled him to see how he would hold up under questioning based on his responses , he was not called to the stand riordan , who is understated , is a brilliant appellate lawyer and a whiz at legal theories is the prosecution overmatched \? said rory little , a professor at the uc hastings college of law in san francisco and a former federal prosecutor the bottom line is yeah , they are overmatched in the sense of how much money and how much celebrity trial experience they have but they are not overmatched in two areas their familiarity with the criminal justice system and the evidence you can fool a jury for one day , but you ca n't fool them for two weeks if the other side has the evidence to prove its case the trial was postponed in 2009 because the government appealed evidentiary rulings the case dragged on mainly because bonds s former trainer greg anderson went to jail for more than a year rather than testify against bonds if he refuses to testify once again , as he has said he will , anderson is expected to be jailed for contempt of court for the duration of the trial the absence of his testimony has weakened the government s case because the judge has excluded some evidence , including drug test results linked to bonds but the prosecutors matthew parrella and jeffrey nedrow would not have proceeded this far if there was not enough evidence , particularly when so much is at stake , say some legal experts who are familiar with the matter and know both prosecutors i know that jeff would not have participated in bringing a case he did n't think was absolutely winnable , said leo cunningham , a former federal prosecutor who knows nedrow well and is a partner at wilson sonsini goodrich rosati in palo alto he s not a guy who would be ambitious or craven he s a career prosecutor who is committed to doing the right thing nedrow is known for his willingness to mediate cases , rather than take them to trial quickly in the courtroom , he is not as flashy as ruby or arguedas might be , but his colleagues say his amiability is his way of winning over a jury little , who worked at the united states attorney s office in san francisco when nedrow was an intern there , said nedrow has the andy from mayberry thing going for him nedrow comes from a family with government ties he grew up mostly in the bay area and his father , roy d nedrow , was a secret service agent and the first civilian director of the naval criminal investigative service at stanford university , jeffrey nedrow played the trombone in the band and later shared giants season tickets with a group of friends after law school at ucla , nedrow became a clerk at for the united states attorney s office in san francisco and moved up the ranks he now is the bureau chief of san jose office , where parrella runs the computer hacking and intellectual property unit when he tries cases or talks to judges , he s that same genuine guy he is outside of the courtroom , cunningham said of nedrow but he s also supersmart , and that s not something he flaunts parrella , though , will deliver the government s opening statement , and his approach is nothing like nedrow s would be a new yorker with the accent to prove it , parella is known to be gruff and hard around the edges parrella , who is from long island , took an unconventional route to albany law school several of his colleagues said he worked on fishing boats in alaska and was a roughneck on rigs in the gulf of mexico , losing a fingertip in an accident asked about that last week , parrella only grumbled he started his legal career in 1986 at the suffolk county district attorney s office on long island , prosecuting grisly homicides , then moved to the united states attorney s office in las vegas before transferring to san jose he s book smart , but also street smart , and that helps him connect to a jury on many levels , said sgt edward fandrey of the suffolk county police department now nedrow and parrella are charged with proving that bonds lied they need to convince the jury that bonds knew he was taking steroids when he used the substances anderson gave him travis tygart , chief executive of the united states antidoping agency , said that the outcome of the case would not make or break the government s balco efforts you ca n't measure how many parents have sat down with their kids to talk about the dangers of performanceenhancing drugs and why cheating is wrong , he said and look at all of the changes in baseball s drugtesting program none of that would have happened if nedrow and parrella had n't been committed to this but little , who knows both prosecutors , said the pressure would still be on them to deliver a conviction too much time has been invested and the public s expectations have been raised too high to accept anything else whenever you have a trial in a very highprofile case , it s a careerdefining moment , little said people will remember parrella and nedrow as the barry bonds prosecutors and i'm sure they understand exactly what is at stake they know all eyes are on them
green bay , wis \( ap \) a forced fumble one week , a quarterback sack the next mike neal gave the green bay packers a glimpse of a disruptive player at defensive end before his rookie season ended abruptly because of a shoulder injury but the extent of his productivity for the packers started and stopped with the only two games he played in 2010 he tore the rotator cuff and labrum in his right shoulder in early october and had seasonending surgery before the end of the month when you get hurt your rookie year with high expectations and they give you all of this money and then you ca n't contribute to the team , you go through so many emotions from depression to beating up yourself and everybody trying to tell you , well , it s not your fault , ' and you feel like it s your fault , said healthy and motivated this preseason , neal is battling to replace cullen jenkins , who left the team in free agency , as a playmaker on the defensive line neal , the team s 2010 secondround draft pick , said the disappointment he felt last season when he was sidelined during the packers' run to the had him feeling like he has something to prove and a job to win all over again i'm hungry , neal said i feel like i'm an undrafted free agent neal spent the last three and a half months of green bay s season on injured reserve my whole last year is erased i do n't even want to remember that , neal said honestly , i'm happy that we won the super bowl i would never put that on the back burner but i do n't remember none of it a rejuvenated neal spent the offseason intensely working out to regain the brute strength he once had in his surgically repaired shoulder barred from entering the team s training center because of the long work stoppage , neal split time between sports performance centers in tampa , fla , and in green bay and neal , who gained a reputation in college at purdue as a workout warrior who benchpressed as much as 500 pounds , rarely took a break from his workouts i went crazy , man , neal said it s just me that s just what i like to do i'm not a person that likes to take vacations i like to work neal reported to training camp last week a little lighter than he was accustomed but he expects to be stout enough at 295 pounds to withstand the rigors of playing defensive end and still has the burst about which his coaches rave after easing him in the first few days of training camp , the packers cleared neal to participate in team drills last thursday night for the first time the coaches are tempering their expectations for neal until they see him play at full strength on a consistent basis he shows what he is , the packers defensive line coach mike trgovac said afterward he s a strong kid he s got quick feet he s got good movement i'm sure he was a little bit rusty on some of his techniques i'm not sure he s throwing that right arm as much he s throwing the left , but that s understandable he s probably testing it out as it went along neal missed the first three games of last season with an abdomen injury he made his debut oct 3 at home against detroit , forcing a fumble by jahvid best in lions territory to set up a packers touchdown in a close victory the next week , neal sacked washington quarterback donovan mcnabb but later left the overtime game green bay lost with the injured shoulder neal would appear to be the logical choice to replace jenkins after the veteran pass rusher signed a fiveyear deal with the philadelphia eagles last week , but trgovac said the competition was wide open two other young players c j wilson and jarius wynn also are drawing consideration there s no doubt about it that cullen was a great player and will continue to be , the thirdyear linebacker clay matthews said but it s time for these young guys to step up now , just as they expected me to do when i came in
it was the best of times , it was the worst of times ok , maybe that s overdramatizing but dickensian oppositions of incredulity and belief , darkness and light , surely applied when the music of gently swelled once again at bargemusic in brooklyn on thursday evening at hand was a performance of feldman s longest solo piano work , triadic memories \( 1981 \) , by , a terrific young pianist and a prominent ambassador for new music the piece , described by feldman as a conscious attempt at formalizing a disorientation of memory , is meant to evoke in more than 1 , 100 measures of crystalline single notes and mildly dissonant chords that recur in erratic repose the slight irregularities in oriental rugs under close examination feldman leaves the tempo to the performer s discretion most accounts clock in somewhere between 60 and 90 minutes mr mcmillen s fell just shy of 80 no performance of feldman s music , particularly the vast , placid expanses of his later pieces , is a task undertaken lightly mr mcmillen , who , had the measure of his surroundings he brought a commendably tender touch to a score marked at extrapianissimo and quieter applied just the right amount of gauzy pedaled resonance and coaxed an almost jazzy sway from some of the work s repeating gestures hearing feldman s music played live is the optimal way to be drawn into his softly tremulous sound world bargemusic , with its intimate scale and clear acoustics , is ideally suited in nearly every respect and adds the unusual benefit of the barge s gentle liquid wobble , which seems to complement the music but any extraneous rustle or twitch can seem like a seismic disturbance during a feldman performance here , the few dozen hardy audience members were confronted with a dim but constant mechanical rattle , the rumble of highspeed ferries pulling in and out across the dock , and the squeals and laughter of merrymakers outside if you concentrated enough to lose yourself within feldman s slowly wheeling , twinkling celestial mobile , none of the disturbances detracted from mr mcmillen s patient , insightful and luminous account in remarks before the concert , mr mcmillen dedicated the performance to olga bloom , the bargemusic founder , who  the music of bach , as every bargemusic regular knows , was ms bloom s greatest passion still , you could hardly imagine a eulogy more transcendent than this one
kabul , afghanistan a pakistanbased extremist group claimed responsibility for a series of coordinated bombings aimed at afghan shiites on tuesday , in what many feared was an attempt to further destabilize afghanistan by adding a new dimension of strife to a country that , though battered by a decade of war , has been free of sectarian conflict the attacks , among the war s deadliest , struck three afghan cities kabul , kandahar and mazarisharif almost simultaneously and killed at least 63 shiite worshipers on ashura , which marks the death of shiite islam s holiest martyr one of the dead in kabul was an american man , according to the public health ministry the american embassy confirmed that there had been an american fatality but declined to identify the victim targeted strikes by sunnis against the minority shiites are alien to afghanistan so it was no surprise to afghans when responsibility was claimed by a sunni extremist group from pakistan , where sunnis and shiites have been energetically killing one another for decades the group , , had not previously claimed or carried out attacks in afghanistan , however , and its emergence fueled suspicions that al qaeda , the or pakistan s spy agency or some combination of those three had teamed up with the group to send the message that afghanistan s future stability remained deeply tenuous and indeed dependent on the cooperation of outside forces never in our history have there been such cruel attacks on religious observances , said president hamid karzai , in a statement released by his office the enemies of afghanistan do not want us to live under one roof with peace and harmony the timing of the attacks was especially pointed , coming a day after an international conference on afghanistan in bonn , germany , that had been viewed as an opportunity for afghanistan to cement longterm support from the west but the conference fell considerably short of the objectives that officials had envisioned because taliban insurgents and pakistani diplomats did not attend pakistan pulled out of the conference as a protest over the deaths of 24 of its soldiers in , carried out from afghan territory , which american officials have depicted as the result of a misunderstanding critics of pakistan were quick to read monday s boycott and tuesday s bombings as a signal from the pakistanis , delivered by lashkarejhangvi , that afghanistan could not ignore pakistan pakistan is our historical enemy and wants us to never live in peace , said noor mohammad , one of the wounded worshipers , who was covered in blood minutes after the attack in kabul what should we do , where should we go \? the terrorists are not even letting us carry on our religious practices abdul qayou sajadi , a hazara member of parliament , made similar assumptions , though he did not mention pakistan by name as you know , the peace efforts by our government and the international community are going on , but some of our neighboring countries failed in this regard , he said now they are trying to divide our people along religious lines , and create another war among afghans as they did in the past while members of afghanistan s shiite minority , mostly ethnic hazaras , faced savage discrimination during the years of taliban rule , they had not been singled out for attacks during the current insurgency the actual intentions of those behind tuesday s attacks remained murky , however , not least because of the tangled history of lashkarejhangvi , which once operated openly in pakistan with the support of its spy service , the directorate for interservices intelligence , or isi , but has since been outlawed in recent years it has struck up alliances with al qaeda and the pakistani taliban , an umbrella group of pakistani militants that has attacked pakistan s cities and security forces numerous times lashkarejhangvi is inspired by a fundamentalist deobandi philosophy that justifies killing shiites because of their beliefs , and it has on several occasions attacked americans , christians and other muslim minorities as well there is no record of previous operations by the group in afghanistan , however , so no one seriously thought lashkarejhangvi could carry out a coordinated series of bombings in three afghan cities without substantial support from other sources tuesday s bombings aroused fears that extremists were trying to provoke a reaction like the one after the in samarra , iraq , which ignited two years of titfortat sectarian violence that attack was carried out by militants aligned with al qaeda , which also has an antishiite philosophy shiite religious and political leaders in afghanistan were quick to call for calm , warning that a violent response was just what the killers were trying to provoke our hazara people should be coolheaded and not react because our enemies will take advantage of that to divide our country , said a prominent hazara leader and shiite cleric , mohammad husain mohaqiq the three bombings all took place around midday as shiite devotees marched in processions to honor the martyrdom of imam hussein , the holiest of specifically shiite holidays in the southern city of kandahar a bomb on a parked motorcycle exploded and narrowly missed an ashura procession , wounding two police officers and three passersby , said abdul razaq , the kandahar police chief in the northern city of mazarisharif , a suicide bomber , apparently on foot , killed four worshipers and wounded more than 20 , said sirjan durani , a police spokesman the deadliest attack occurred in kabul s crowded murad khani neighborhood , when a suicide bomber infiltrated a procession in front of the abul fazal abbas shrine the powerful blast killed scores of worshipers and damaged the mosque many people , terrified of another attack , jumped into a nearby river , which is choked with sewage in the processional , men had been beating their bared chests to show their sorrow at imam hussein s martyrdom some also whipped their backs with barbed chains the explosion took place inside the crowd , said a wounded man , said zaki , 18 , whose face and clothes were covered in blood we did n't see who the bomber was , but he was definitely on foot we saw 30 or 40 people on the ground missing arms and legs throughout the day , the official count of the dead climbed as more and more of the nearly 200 wounded people died of horrific injuries in one hospital , 5 infants were among 14 victims declared dead on arrival every hospital in kabul , the capital , took in victims at the emergency hospital , when corridors filled up with the wounded , doctors put the overflow patients in a laundry room and the dead on stretchers in the courtyard outside , angry and sometimes hysterical relatives tried to climb over the hospital walls , then forced their way in when doors were opened to bring in blood donors for urgently needed transfusions kabul s police chief , gen mohammad ayoub salangi , was aware of the lashkarejhangvi claim , which was reported by the bbc and radio free europe quoting the group s spokesman , qari abubakar but he said none of the pakistanbased extremists could carry out operations without taliban support all the militant groups have very good cooperation with the taliban in afghanistan , so i am sure they were aware of it , he said an email sent to news organizations from the spokesman for the , zabiullah mujahid , denied responsibility we strongly condemn this wild and inhuman act by our enemies , who are trying to blame us and trying to divide afghans by doing such attacks on muslims , the message said
the baseball hall of fame should be a place to celebrate the best players of each era that s it , a nice simple criteria the nuances of that definition are what we get to argue about the golden era ballot of players from 1947 to 1972 that is under consideration by the veterans committee includes three starting pitchers jim kaat , who won 283 games luis tiant , with 229 victories and allie reynolds , with 182 all three were quality starters and made memorable contributions to the game \( kaat s gold gloves , tiant s mustache and motion , reynolds s nohitters \) but none belong in the hall of fame they don t have to be bob gibson or juan marichal to deserve election , but they need to have been among the game s top starters in their prime if you were a general manager , or a fantasy team owner , creating an ideal rotation from that era , would any of these guys have been on your staff \? \( it s impossible to compare across eras think not only of the impact of steroids on earned run averages but also of bullpens on completegame and shutout totals , and it s obvious why that doesn t work \) in the early 1990s , clearcut choices were inducted almost yearly tom seaver , jim palmer , steve carlton , fergie jenkins and gaylord perry make an impressive staff \( yes , i know they all pitched in an era of fourman rotations , but five is a nice round number \) in the late 1990s , there was a second wave nolan ryan headlined a rotation with jim bunning , don sutton and phil niekro i don t think sutton belongs in the hall , but the others , while clearly not peers of seaver or palmer , were valid candidates it seems as if those elections either dried up the well or prompted a backlash for more than a decade not a single starting pitcher was deemed hallworthy but last year bert blyleven , who seemed to attract almost equal numbers of supporters and detractors for his candidacy , finally made the grade blyleven was woefully underrated , and his numbers are superior to at least half of those 1990s inductees but i wonder if , on the surface , voters will see kaat as comparable and elect him too both men played for many years in minnesota , and their records are remarkably similar at first glance blyleven was 287250 with a 331 era kaat was 283237 with a 345 era but they had their differences kaat notched 44 hanging around wins in his dotage when he was a lousy starter or middling reliever blyleven finished fourth in the cy young award voting at age 38 , then added only 16 hanging around wins in his final two years and kaat in his prime was never prime cut he finished in the top five in cy young voting just once , he never reached that upper echelon in earned run average or strikeouts per nine innings , and did it just once in shutouts and once in walks and hits per innings pitched by contrast , blyleven was among the top five in cy young votes three times more significant , he was in that rarefied company seven times in era and whip , and nine times in strikeouts per nine innings and shutouts if blyleven is the current standard for hall of fame entry , then kaat falls well short modern metrics are no kinder according to baseball reference s wins above replacement for pitchers which measures each starter compared to what a minor leaguer would provide in his stead kaat was in the top five just four times blyleven crossed that threshold nine times , finishing first twice outside of wins , which are more the mark of longevity , kaat doesn t even hold up favorably with tiant , who inspired a generation of backyard imitations with his windup tiant had more seasons in the top five in era , whip , strikeouts per nine innings and shutouts than kaat , leading the league in each of those categories at least once tiant can build a case because he was a very good pitcher from 1964 to 1968 and again from 1972 to 1978 , with spurts of greatness but he was erratic in 1968 he won 21 games and led the league in era and shutouts , but the next year he lost 20 games and led the league in home runs and walks allowed he then had two injuryplagued seasons before leading the league again in era still , if you compare tiant with bunning , tiant falls short despite superficial similarities tiant had 229 wins and a 330 era while bunning won 224 with a 327 era , but bunning was among the five best pitchers in his league six times in era , shutouts and strikeouts per nine innings and seven times in whip tiant doesn t come close in any category reynolds made his name by throwing two nohitters in one season in 1951 and serving as the steady ace of the 19491953 yankees dynasty but outside of the 1952 season , when he led the league in era and finished fifth in war for pitchers , he was very good without being great consistency is an admirable trait , and it got sutton , who was consistent much longer , into the hall but sutton won 324 games kaat , tiant and reynolds have a great deal to celebrate when looking back on their careers but the hall of fame should remain just beyond their grasp stuart miller is author of good wood the story of the baseball bat
charleston harbor , sc , april 12 , 1861 among the private papers of maj robert anderson , commander of the union garrison at fort sumter , is a single elegant sheet of faded lavenderblue notepaper , neatly creased where it was once folded between the gloved fingers of a confederate adjutant the note , preserved today in the library of congress , reads fort sumter , sc april 12 , 1861 3 20 am major robert anderson us army comdg fort sumter sir by authority of brig general beauregard commanding the provisional forces of the confederate states we have the honor to notify you that he will open the fire of his batteries on fort sumter in one hour from this time we have the honor to be very respectfully yrobtservts , james chesnut jr , aide de camp stephen d lee , capt , sc army , aide de camp the two aides handed this note to anderson with a gentlemanly bow he escorted them hospitably to sumter s wharf , where their longboat awaited with its slave oarsmen before the confederates stepped into the launch , anderson shook each man s hand and bade them all farewell if we never meet in this world again , god grant that we may meet in the next returning to his officers and men , anderson hinted that all except the sentries should return to their bunks and try to get some sleep it was clear that sumter s defenders could accomplish little until sunrise , since the garrison had no lights the fort s lamp oil and candles had long since run out , along with all provisions save a little hardtack and some halfrancid pork after breakfast , such as it might be , they would begin to return fire the only other order he gave was to raise the fort s flag , which was duly run up its staff , disappearing into the blackness above but most of the officers and soldiers waited expectantly to see the war begin one of those on the ramparts peering out into the night was a blueeyed , darkhaired young irishman named john thompson , a private , who left what may be the only surviving description of the battle by a rankandfile soldier a long letter that he sent two weeks later to his father back in county derry , ireland even though he planned to return home to the old country as soon as his enlistment expired in a few months time , thompson felt a surge of pride as we hoisted our colors the glorious star spangled banner and quietly awaited the enemies fire as an immigrant who , on his enlistment form , described his occupation as laborer , thompson was typical of the men who were now about to risk their lives in defense of fort sumter some twothirds of the men in the union army in the antebellum years were foreigners , mostly german and irish officers often complained of soldiers who could not understand commands in english , and a significant share of recruits were unable to sign their own names to the enlistment form , let alone pen a letter \( thompson s missive to his father may well have been dictated to a bettereducated superior \) sumter s garrison was even more heavily foreignborn than average of the 73 enlisted men whose birthplaces are known , just 13 were from the united states the roster of privates reads like the roll call in an old world war ii movie murphy , schmidt , onorato , klein , wishnowski their names , unlike those of sumter s officers , are almost forgotten today a simple bronze tablet at the site records them and were equally unknown to most americans in 1861 , despite the intense public interest in sumter and the exhaustive newspaper coverage of every new development at the fort such men were considered mere ciphers , certainly not likely to become heroes at those rare moments when the entire nation went to war 1775 , 1812 , 1846 soldiering suddenly became a noble calling for patriotic americans of every class and condition so it would become again soon in 1861 but the peacetime army that garrisoned sumter and other forts as the war began was a different matter service in its ranks was considered a last resort for men who couldn t get by otherwise in the merciless economy of 19thcentury america or the first resort of immigrants with no resources or connections uncle sam a figure known even to those newcomers provided a roof over their heads \( even if it was often one made of canvas \) , shoddy woolen uniforms and food consisting mainly of bread and coffee , with occasional salt pork a british traveler , while expressing his esteem for the american officer corps , disdained common soldiers as a ragtagandbobtail herd the scum of the population of the older states , or the worthless german , english , or irish immigrants enlisted men existed in a different world than their superiors , even in such unusually close confines as sumter s the officers letters and memoirs almost never mention soldiers as individuals , much less by name , and as provisions dwindled , everyone took it for granted that officers would get the last of the salt pork , while privates enjoyed their one daily biscuit apiece enlisted men even looked physically different from their superiors although several of sumter s officers including capt abner doubleday and surgeon samuel w crawford were over six feet tall , not a single private was , according to their enlistment records the average height of the garrison s foreignborn privates was only 5 feet 5andthreequarters inches tall , fully three inches shorter than the average nativeborn male of the mid19th century this was almost certainly a result of poor nutrition in childhood the average age of sumter s enlisted men was 29 four years older than the typical later civil war serviceman with several of the men in their 40s it might seem inevitable that the months of tension and uncertainty , crowded and makeshift quarters , and sparse rations , these enlisted men would have been driven to quarrels , brawls or worse throughout the winter of 1861 , newspapers in both the north and south buzzed with rumors of soldiers at sumter being shot for mutiny yet the reports from inside the fort show quite the opposite case the longer the siege lasted , the more tightly the group knit itself together thompson told his father of his fellow privates scorn for the rash folly of the rebels they no doubt expected that we would surrender without a blow , but they were never more mistaken in their lives even the snobbish crawford wrote often in his diary and letters of the men s high spirits , and said that when the final battle loomed , it increased their enthusiasm to the highest pitch if anything , the common soldiers morale was higher than their officers although it is often said today that half the army resigned in 1861 to join the confederacy , this is untrue only 26 privates out of all 15 , 000 ended up defecting to the rebels compared to more than 300 out of the 1 , 000 or so men in the officer corps \( indeed , one of sumter s union lieutenants would end up fighting , and dying , for the confederacy \) very few , if any , of the enlisted men who stood on the battlements at sumter awaiting the first shot of the war had ever been on the receiving end of an artillery barrage until just days earlier , all of them had fully expected to be evacuated to safety at any moment by orders of president abraham lincoln \( so had their officers sumter s chief engineer had busied himself making arrangements to return a borrowed mustard spoon to a charleston friend now serving with the rebels \) it must have seemed surreal that they now had to defend themselves against fire from what had just recently been friendly territory including even from their own former fort they knew that militarily , sumter was almost worthless to the union they were being asked to die for a symbolyet they were ready to do so at 4 1 2 am , the first shell came hissing through the air and burst right over our heads , thompson would tell his father the thrill that ran through our veins at this time was indescribable , none were afraid , the stern defiant look on each man s countenance plainly told that fear was no part of his constitution , but something like an expression of awe crept over the features of everyone out across the water , all around the harbor , unseen cannons were being carefully adjusted and aimed and then the full barrage began join sources robert anderson papers , library of congress abner doubleday , reminiscences

tucson kansas state coach frank martin clearly does not like the word panic he did not like it when it was applied to him when he was hired as bob huggins s replacement in 2008 and many skeptics deemed his hiring as a nongenetic form of nepotism and it is obvious he does not like it now , when he is asked about his team s unexpected struggles leading to the ncaa tournament , and whether he reached for that dreaded red panic button at midseason , 44 , a burly man with an unmistakable stare , is nowhere near a bench , a ball or even a player , but he is being heard loud and clear nonetheless as always if i panic , what do you think our kids are going to do \? martin said on friday before his fifthseeded \( 2310 \) faced fourthseeded wisconsin \( 248 \) in the round of 32 on saturday my job is to teach them my job is to get them ready for the next day , make them understand how lucky they are they have an opportunity to play basketball and then take advantage of that day and become the best we can be on this day this is one of the many passionfilled teaching moments that tend to happen throughout his day our kids acted this season like i wish our society would act , he said that means that when things get hard , they do n't pass blame they do n't run away from it they do n't roll their eyes they do n't quit an oftcited comparison to bob knight does not do martin justice yes , he is fiery and occasionally controversial yes , he is known for his public eviscerations of players who do not consistently fit his form and yes , as the freshman guard will spradling noted , if he could throw chairs in a game he probably would but the better gauge of martin came long before he headed for manhattan , kan , when he was the son of cuban immigrant parents growing up in miami everyone around him worked , so it seemed only natural that martin would also he was the first member of his family to be born in the united states after they left fidel castro s reign for northern new jersey in 1960 his father was long gone before martin s formative years arrived , but the tireless ways of his mother , grandmother and uncle , with whom he and his sister lived , were enough to inspire a grittiness and stubborn style that remain the same coach whose team s showing in the round of 8 in last year s tournament earned him a contract extension through 2015 that averages 15 million annually once worked at dairy queen near his home in little havana , after his family s move from new jersey to miami , before he could drive a car he was , quite predictably , considering his linebacker physique , a bouncer during his days as a student at florida international university it was not long before life s arrows pointed him in a different direction , starting with the night when he drew gunfire from men who were angered because he had removed one of them during his latest shift he is a respected coach , a husband and a father of three now , one who spent more than a decade coaching in high school and leveraged three florida state championships at miami senior high school in the late 1990s into a college career and is among the hottest of young coaches his overall record at kansas state is 9542 yet this has been his most trying campaign , with the no 21 wildcats going from a preseason no 3 national ranking to a team seemingly in shambles at the midway point , before rediscovering a the path to a possible national title the senior guard jacob pullen and the junior forward curtis kelly , two of the team s most vital players , were from a department store two players quit and another transferred more important to the boosters and growing skeptics , kansas state lost five of its first seven big 12 conference games after starting 123 the panic might have grown around him but inside a locker room in which his players espouse his virtues and praise the merits of his abrasive style , they swear there was none that s what frank does he keeps people together , kelly said he s loyal he s a dude who do n't give up on us , so if he does n't give up on me , then why should i give up on him \? he kept us together throughout the whole process i appreciate frank for that frank is a great guy , and i love him to death
el paso according to many of the leading republican presidential candidates , including my governor , rick perry , the border between texas and mexico is among the most dangerous in the world all of them insist that securing the border has to come before any sort of comprehensive immigration reform , but mr perry has been particularly aggressive about it it is not safe on that border , he said recently , and he for suggesting otherwise he s even said he was open to into mexico to counter the violence those of us who actually live along the border know otherwise el paso , the largest city along the united statesmexico border , is also one of the country s and the heart of a vibrant binational community the region has its problems our sister city across the border , ciudad ju rez , has been ravaged by mexico s drug war but a focus on a quasimilitary approach ignores the need for real solutions to our economic and social challenges as a lifelong resident of el paso , i find it disheartening to see our city , and the border region in general , misrepresented for political advantage texas border cities are as safe or safer than other cities their size in texas yet despite the facts , mr perry continues to cast el paso and our neighbors as poster cities for border violence last year he claimed , without evidence , that bombs were exploding in our streets and that was the most dangerous city in america \( even though it s in mexico \) mr perry is far from alone many republican politicians and not a few democrats , too use the bogeyman of border violence to justify exorbitant security measures , like the everlengthening border fence that costs 28 million per mile \( for a total of 65 billion , including maintenance , over the 20year lifetime of the fence \) mr perry s brainchild , security cameras , have so far cost 4 million to put in place and maintain these measures do little besides waste money tunnels already run below the border fence during their first two years in operation , mr perry s cameras led to the arrest of a whopping 26 people that s 154 , 000 per arrest and once undocumented immigrants are apprehended , costs continue to mount in this fiscal year alone , the federal government is budgeting 2 billion just for detention but there s a bigger cost to my community claims about our supposedly dangerous border would be laughable if they did n't damage our image and our ability to recruit talent , investment and events el paso is home to an emerging national research university , a new cuttingedge medical school , one of the nation s largest military installations and a vibrant business community it is also an important trade corridor , and our busy land ports through which 70 billion worth of commerce passed last year are critical to the american economy the factories across the rio grande provide products for the american homebuilding and automobile industries , as well as hightech electronics none of that seems to matter , however , when el paso is made the symbol of our supposedly broken border true , there are challenges along the border we need jobs and investment , as well as improvements to the trade infrastructure on which our economy depends while billions have been expended for walls , cameras and detention , we 've seen little investment in our ports during an era of shrinking budgets , our nation s resources should be spent more wisely in el paso , for every four customs and border protection agent positions , there are three vacancies as a result , commerce waits as trucks idle for hours in long lines such congestion frustrates business , and it certainly does n't make us safer or assist our economy a recent study commissioned by the texas department of transportation warned that if our ports receive no investment , including additional personnel , el paso s economy will contract by 54 billion over the next 25 years , driving up unemployment and hurting trade and what harms our economy harms the state and national economies while the onedimensional security discussion continues , candidates continue to avoid dealing with the complex border reality it would be in the candidates' and the country s best interest to present the truth about the cities on the border we are safe , dynamic economic engines that need strategic investment so while candidates talk about getting tougher , border cities like mine will continue to talk about becoming smarter let s just hope they join our conversation soon
bell , calif for residents here who have spent the last nine months railing against for 55 million in inflated salaries and illegal loans , tuesday s election felt like a celebration , complete with dancing through the streets the entire fivemember city council was replaced , with a historic turnout and a whopping 95 percent of voters approving the recall but for the five newly elected officials , from a field of 17 candidates , the challenges have barely started they will take office in this small city facing a budget gap somewhere around 4 million more than 20 percent of its current budget the city has defaulted on a 35 million bond , and interim city officials have warned that bell faces insolvency and might not be able to pay its bills come may last summer , the los angeles times revealed that top bell officials were earning salaries of nearly 800 , 000 and giving themselves lucrative perks like interestfree loans from city coffers robert rizzo , the city administrator , all but one of five city council members and other city officials were indicted on charges of the misuse of public money some of the new council members are longtime activists in this community southeast of los angeles others became interested in local politics when the scandal erupted last summer but none have experience running a city i expect it will be a fulltime job just to figure it all out , said danny harber , 66 , a retired baker who won a council spot you want to know what we are facing \? let me tell you something of a secret your guess is as good as mine and when they take office in april some of their problems will be pretty basic what will be the fate , for example , of the acting city administrator , pedro carrillo , who has handled daytoday operations for months \? mr carrillo has been praised for keeping the city afloat for the past several months , but many criticize him for his ties to the previous administration the existing city council has not met since december when a judge ordered council members , accused of for paying themselves for meetings that never happened , to stand trial , he prohibited them from running the city in any shape or form mr carrillo has floated the possibility of dismantling the city s police department and entering into a contract with the los angeles county sheriff , as other cashstrapped cities have done but that plan has been met with scorn from at least three of the incoming council members , who received the support of the police officers' union instead , they say , the city should renegotiate the contract with the union and eliminate some of the department s top brass violeta alvarez , a social services worker who also won tuesday night , said she suspected there were scores of highly paid workers inside city hall there is no way for her to know for certain just yet she does not even know how large the staff is we have a lot of questions that have to get answered really quick , ms alvarez said each of the council members had a different answer to the question of mr carrillo s future one councilmanelect said that mr carrillo had promised to leave 30 days after a new council was elected others said that they simply had to give him ample notice , though they could not recall whether the law required that they give 30 or 60 days' notice ali saleh , 35 , a business owner , first ran unsuccessfully for the council two years ago after winning tuesday night , he said , there was no way he was going to let administrators with ties to the old regime stay in power absolutely , he has to go , mr saleh said mr carrillo said that he had never agreed to a firm timeline and that the city would be well served by a smooth transition with him working with the new council we said we were going to do our best to perform triage , and there is not a day we have n't done that , mr carrillo said sometimes campaign rhetoric is just that , and when they actually take office they might be very surprised by what they think then more details about the case against the former city manager , mr rizzo , and other officials have emerged in the past three weeks , as prosecutors have argued in court that they should stand trial for misappropriation of funds only one of the current council members fought the recall teresa jacobo , who faces charges of misappropriating funds , got only 5 percent of the vote lorenzo velez , the only current councilman not charged in the scandal , ran for reelection but received just 613 votes the final stretch of the campaign was tinged with tragedy when miguel sanchez , a teacher and candidate , died suddenly on friday while he was running with two other candidates one of them , nestor valencia , was elected tuesday mr valencia said he urged the replacement council to move slowly rather than suddenly dismiss longtime city workers but he said that he would move to cut high salaries and generous pensions we cannot take this stuff lightly , mr valencia said i think anybody who is in bell knows what is at stake here we are talking about getting back the trust of the city that s going to take a lot mr valencia ran on a slate that opposed three of the winners , and he criticized ana maria quintana , another winner in tuesday s election , as a newcomer ms quintana grew up in neighboring town and moved into bell last year on wednesday , she said she hoped the council could move quickly past the campaign if we do n't all start this and work together , we 're going to be right back where we started , she said each winner repeatedly said he was eager to take the city back to the unified mood that was pervasive when mr rizzo and other city officials were arrested last summer but when mr valencia was asked if he was worried whether that kind of unity could be sustained , he paused i did n't say i'm not worried , he said i have a lot to worry about
saratoga springs , ny she grew up around saratoga race course , watching runners thunder off the final turn and learning to put them through their paces in the misty predawn mornings for terri pompay , a lifetime invested in thoroughbred racing first as a youthful fan , then as an exercise rider , briefly as a jockey , and finally as the head of an established stable reached its finest moment monday her horse currency swap dashed across the finish line in the 107th running of the hopeful stakes , back at saratoga , where it all began i do n't even know how to describe it , said a breathless pompay , greeting her horse in the winner s circle on a rainy closing day of the saratoga meeting i'm so excited this is my hometown i was at the track as much as i could get here when i could sneak out and get here , i was here it was the first grade 1 victory for pompay , a 50yearold trainer who joins a small group of women who have won toplevel stakes at saratoga \( linda rice won the 2000 hopeful with city zip \) it was the second victory in two starts for currency swap , who made his debut with an impressive eightlength score aug 6 here that win earned him a 98 beyer speed figure , tied for fourth among juveniles this year he s so special , this horse i'm just so proud that he came through , pompay said of monday s race it s always a jump when you break your maiden and then go in a stake , and it was a really nice group of horses i went through the past performances dozens more than that hundreds of times during the past few days you could make a case for any one of them moving up but none of the nine other runners did currency swap was taken in hand on the outside by rajiv maragh behind early fractions set by the 681 shot trinniberg of 2191 and 4514 seconds still five lengths behind at the head of the stretch , currency swap closed rapidly , fought to overhaul the tenacious leader , and prevailed by threequarters of a length to return 580 on a 2 bet to win big blue nation was three and threequarter lengths back in third the final time was 1 minute 2616 seconds for seven furlongs over the sloppy track pompay stabled with the trainer bob barbara when she shipped in from monmouth park last weekend barbara s own hopeful contender , jc s pride , was pulled up by jockey jose lezcano and taken off in a van , although the trainer reported he showed no signs of injury and was moving around fine once he returned from the racetrack so the firstplace finisher and the lastplace finisher of the season s final stakes race returned to the same barn together , where it was all systems go with plans for currency swap s future seth klarman , a coowner , said the oct 8 champagne stakes at park might be a logical next step according to pompay , resting until the breeders' cup juvenile at churchill downs on nov 5 is also a possibility along with the 150 , 000 winner s share of the 250 , 000 hopeful purse , currency swap earned a guaranteed spot in the juvenile this is just the start we can go forward from here , pompay said we 'll make sure he comes back good , then decide if we need another race or extra time i definitely think he s just going to get better he s got scope , and when added distance comes , i think he s going to love that , too
the white house on wednesday declined to challenge an account in a new book that suggests that , in his campaign to overhaul american health care , mischaracterized a central anecdote about his mother s deathbed dispute with her insurance company during his presidential campaign and subsequent battle over a health care law , mr obama quieted crowds with the story of his mother s fight with her insurer over whether her was a preexisting condition that disqualified her from coverage in offering the story as an argument for ending preexisting condition exclusions by health insurers , the president left the clear impression that his mother s fight was over health benefits for medical expenses but in a singular woman the untold story of s mother , author janny scott quotes from correspondence from the president s mother to assert that the 1995 dispute concerned a cigna disability insurance policy and that her actual health insurer had apparently reimbursed most of her medical expenses without argument ms scott took a leave from her job as a reporter for the new york times to write the book and has not returned to the staff on wednesday , in response to repeated requests for comment that the times first made in midjune , shortly after the book s release , a white house spokesman chose not to dispute either ms scott s account or mr obama s memory , while arguing that mr obama s broader point remained salient we have not reviewed the letters or other material on which the author bases her account , said nicholas papas , the spokesman the president has told this story based on his recollection of events that took place more than 15 years ago in her book , published in may by riverhead books , ms scott writes that mr obama s mother , ann dunham , had an employerprovided policy that paid her hospital bills directly , leaving her to pay only the deductible and any uncovered expenses , which , she said , came to several hundred dollars a month mr papas suggested that even if ms scott was correct , mr obama had not mischaracterized the facts because his mother needed her disability insurance payments to cover unreimbursed medical costs as ms scott s account makes clear , the president s mother incurred several hundred dollars in monthly uncovered medical expenses that she was relying on insurance to pay , mr papas said she first could not get a response from the insurance company , then was refused coverage this personal history of the president s speaks powerfully to the impact of preexisting condition limits on insurance protection from health care costs disability insurance , which primarily replaces wages lost to illness , was never at issue in the legislative debate over the affordable care act ms scott said in an interview that her reporting relied on copies of letters from ms dunham to cigna that were made available by friends the book concludes that although mr obama often suggested that ms dunham was denied health coverage because of a preexisting condition , it appears from her correspondence that she was only denied disability coverage ms dunham , an anthropologist who worked on development projects in indonesia , died in 1995 , less than a year after her diagnosis during the 2008 campaign , mr obama used several rhetorical formulations to relate the anecdote , stressing , in his words , that this issue is personal for me in his second with senator john mccain of arizona , in october 2008 , he said for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they 're saying that this may be a preexisting condition and they do n't have to pay her treatment , there s something fundamentally wrong about that he put it similarly as president in a in portsmouth , nh , in august 2009 i will never forget my own mother , as she fought cancer in her final months , having to worry about whether her insurance would refuse to pay for her treatment , mr obama said the health care act , which mr obama signed in march 2010 , outlawed preexisting condition exclusions for children under 19 starting last september the ban extends to adults in 2014 robert j blendon , a professor of health policy and political analysis at harvard , said that if an alternate narrative about ms dunham s dispute had been discovered during the 2008 campaign people would have considered it a significant error he added i just took for granted that it was a preexisting condition health insurance issue according to ms scott s book , ms dunham s problem with cigna started after she left jakarta , indonesia , where she had recently taken a consulting job with an american firm , and returned to honolulu for treatment of that had been diagnosed as after being told she had uterine and , she underwent a in february 1995 and then six months of , according to the book the cigna disability policy , according to ms scott , allowed the company to deny a claim if a patient had seen a doctor about the condition that caused the disability in the three months before employment during that period , ms dunham visited a new york gynecologist when cigna obtained the doctor s notes , it learned that she had formed a working hypothesis that ms dunham might have , ms scott wrote the doctor ordered up a series of tests , and ms dunham submitted to most of them none of these tests indicated that i had cancer , ms dunham wrote to cigna , according to the book after several months , cigna denied the claim ms dunham then requested a review , writing to cigna that she had turned the case over to my son and attorney , barack obama , ms scott wrote ms scott said in the interview that she did not turn up documents to suggest that ms dunham had a similar dispute with her health insurer , which she did not name she said she could not determine from the documents she viewed whether mr obama , then a lawyer in chicago , had in fact petitioned cigna on his mother s behalf
milwaukee load everybody s statistics into a computer game , and the manager and coaches of the mostly baseball swells from the 1980s and '90s might crush their players that s impressive , given that the actual playing diamondbacks bounced back from a 97loss season to outdistance the defending world series champion san francisco giants and win the national league west one of those swells , the bench coach , a sixtime allstar shortstop and the 1984 world series most valuable player for detroit , rolled baseballs down the first and thirdbase lines friday to gauge the slope for possible bunts during a predivision series workout he kidded the grounds crew about the milwaukee brewers closing miller park s retractable roof just before arizona took the field , on a partly cloudy day with temperatures in the 50s it s colder now than it was when it was open , said trammell , who wore short sleeves center fielder chris young , one of three holdovers from arizona s last playoff qualifier in 2007 , concedes that most baseball fans are more familiar with the coaches trammell , and all former allstars and manager than with himself and his teammates they may not be unknowns for long arizona s game 1 starter , ian kennedy , the exyankee dealt in the threeteam trade that sent curtis granderson to the bronx in 2009 , went 214 , more than doubling his career victory total daniel hudson , a white sox draftee , won 16 both were acquired by the former general manager josh byrnes , who was fired in july 2010 arizona finished fourth in the nl with 731 runs , 10 more than the brewers , with only one player hitting more than 20 homers and none with 90 runs batted in justin upton s 31 homers and 88 rbi led the team , and he stole 21 bases people were talking about the pirates and the indians early on , and i think we kind of snuck up on some people , said general manager kevin towers , who was hired to replace byrnes we were an underachieving ball club the last couple of years there was always talent here after consecutive lastplace finishes , the diamondbacks rose with significantly better pitching and a penchant for coming from behind arizona won 14 games when trailing by at least three runs , most recently last tuesday , when the diamondbacks overcame a 61 deficit in the 10th inning against the los angeles dodgers to win , 76 once in front , the diamondbacks hold on closer j j putz \( 45 saves \) converted 24 consecutive chances after july 27 as the diamondbacks finished 840 when leading after eight innings towers said the players adopted the fiery , resilient style of gibson , best known for off oakland s dennis eckersley in game 1 of the 1988 world series gibson took over as interim manager last year for the fired a j hinch , and towers gave him the job permanently the last couple of seasons , we were down , chris young said we changed everything , especially our character that was probably the biggest thing and our desire to win if you have a tough year , you get to the point where you 've lost so many games , it s tough to expect yourself to come back this year we 've been able to overcome a lot of games where we were losing , or hold the lead when we were only winning by one run do that over and over , you start to trust your teammates a lot more and enjoy everything a lot more that trust does not extend much beyond the arizona clubhouse newspaper clippings ranking the diamondbacks eighth in the eightteam postseason field were posted at both ends of the clubhouse , with the number 8 highlighted in red the brewers finished with the best home record in baseball at 5724 , but arizona won twice in a threegame series in milwaukee on july 46 as dire as things seem during a game , we know we have the ability to come back , gibson said we 're probably as good as anyone in the game at that that s something i saw in myself as a player , and fortunately this team is much the same

of course , he could working the winter baseball meetings as the mets' general manager \? no problem when neither st john s nor the mets came calling , however , repole found a job in the beverage industry and remade himself into a coach of a different kind of team , a moneymaking marketing machine he has put up some significant victories in 1999 he and darius bikoff took a bottled water company with 100 , 000 in sales and transformed it into a multimilliondollar enterprise behind the vitaminwater and smartwater brands by concentrating on the health conscious and employing en vogue spokesmen like the rapper 50 cent and mets third baseman david wright in 2007 cocacola bought their company , glac au , for 41 billion repole , the coach , took care of his players glac au s 600 employees all had stock options 50 of them cashed out with more than 1 million , another 150 with 500 , 000 , and 200 with more than 100 , 000 repole could have retired to a beach , an island or a bank vault but that would mean no more 14hour days so he became the key investor in the healthfood chain energy kitchen and the chairman and majority owner of pirate brands , maker of the snack food pirate s booty but he also cut out some time and money for st john s , where he earned a degree in sports management repole took five years to graduate from st john s with a 22 gradepoint average , and he is grateful that the university patiently stood by him so much so that repole is a member of the university s founders society , the top tier of donors who have given , or committed to give , more than 1 million at home basketball games , he is never far from the st john s bench , and last month when the red storm upset duke , repole was courtside on the bench a privilege he bought at a university fundraiser st john s is important to him , said chris monasch , the red storm s athletic director he grew up around here , and the university gave him an opportunity to get an education and he s gone on to have success he s really a great role model for our students he also has spent a few bucks chasing fast horses , a pastime repole fell for as a 13yearold along the rail at aqueduct over the past four years , he has spent nearly 7 million on more than 65 horses at north american auctions , according to  none , however , have paid more dividends than uncle mo , whom repole bought for 220 , 000 at the keeneland september yearling sale in 2009 uncle mo is undefeated in three starts , has earned nearly 13 million and was named last year s champion 2yearold he s my 41 billionto1 shot , said repole , equating the thrills uncle mo has given him to selling his business to cocacola but i'm a realist 95 percent of the people in the horse business lose money , and the other 5 percent lie about it what repole does best is build brands , and he is doing that in thoroughbred racing he writes an uncle mo diary and produces podcasts for he oversees uncle mo s facebook page and twitter account , and preaches the gospel of horse racing at every chance mike is used to competing at the highest level , and he understands what it takes to do that successfully in our game , said greg avioli , president of the breeders' cup it takes a combination of energy , passion , savvy and competitive spirit then , there are the mets repole can go off into a soliloquy on the virtues of mookie wilson he cherishes his season tickets behind third base his racing silks are mets blue and orange he is exploring the possibility of , whose owners , fred wilpon and saul katz , are embroiled in a lawsuit filed against them by the trustee representing the victims of bernard l madoff s multibilliondollar  in the meantime , repole has plenty on his plate he shuttles between his home on long island and pirate booty s office in sea cliff , also on long island , and energy kitchen s headquarters in manhattan , trying to build the next billiondollar brand pirate s booty has doubled its sales to 100 million in the past two years , but repole believes it can take on the snack giant fritolay energy kitchen has 12 stores in new york and has signed franchise deals for 78 more from miami to boston by 2018 , his goal is to have 1 , 000 of them repole thinks st john s can make some noise in the ncaa tournament and uncle mo can sweep the in other words , he is looking at having a pretty good spring think big , he said , beginning one of his signature mantras dream bigger
perhaps the first clue of the approaching revolution came at the end of last season in a between two oldschool franchises , the green bay packers and the pittsburgh steelers combined for 36 running plays , a super bowl low it was football for the new age , devoid of balance , an aerial highwire act from the shoulderpad set the nfl s long offseason lockout , during which players spent time on courthouse steps rather than on practice fields , was supposed to push the pause button on a part of the game that relies so heavily on the kind of precision that can be honed only by repetition instead , the super bowl has proved to be mere prologue , and one with a comparatively middling output , to the first quarter of the 2011 season blistering passing games have overwhelmed the league , raising eyebrows even among longtime observers for years , the nfl has inexorably shifted toward the pass , with a sometimes nonetoosubtle shove from rules changes that protect quarterbacks and insulate receivers from downfield hits but with nohuddle offenses , spread formations and shotgun snaps inching closer to the norm rather than an exception executed by a handful of elite quarterbacks , the first four weeks constitute the top four weeks in nfl history in terms of combined passing yards , indications that a sea change may be afoot it was an offseason for players , but it was n't an offseason for the coaches , said buffalo bills coach chan gailey , a longtime offensive coach in the nfl i think everybody realized where this thing was heading and where it needs to go defensive players are so big and fast and strong , but the field has remained the same size , so really the field has shrunk for offenses so the next step for offenses was to spread it out and try to create more seams to better run and throw the football you 're going to see that happening as time goes on the running game usually reemerges in the second half of the season , when foul weather makes passing more treacherous but the pass may be so dominant by then that several longstanding records could fall six quarterbacks including the carolina panthers rookie cam newton , , and aaron rodgers are on pace to break s record for passing yards in a season \( 5 , 084 \) , which he set 27 years ago rodgers , whose green bay packers are 40 , is completing 73 percent of his passes , which would shatter the singleseason record of 706 set by brees in 2009 rodgers s accuracy is coming in conjunction with longer passes he is averaging 94 yards per attempt brees averaged 85 in 2009 net passing yards \( 31 , 446 \) are at a record level the previous high was 27 , 272 , at this point last year , although two fewer games were played then since the 1970 merger , the nfl has never had a season in which it had more individual 300yard passing games once a line of demarcation for great passing performances than 100yard rushing games but there have already been 44 individual 300yard passing games this season that is not just the most through the first four weeks of a season , it is also the most through the first seven weeks of any season last year there were 96 individual 300yard games in the entire season in 2006 there were 65 in the meantime , there have been 26 individual 100yard rushing games , a figure that reflects in part the trend of teams dividing carries between two backs there have also been eight individual 400yard passing games , just five short of the record for a full season the outpouring of passing delights offensive coordinators as well as television executives , who know that highscoring games produce good ratings but it also raises the question of what combination of forces converged to produce such a sharp spike there are several answers , say those who watch and shape the game the most obvious is that when something works for one team green bay last season was forced to go passheavy because of injuries everyone tries to copy it more teams are spreading the field to create better offensive matchups , particularly in the middle of the field , where most of the action and mismatches take place in the short and intermediate passing game it is no accident that new england s wes welker , who toils in the middle of the field , is the league s leading receiver most coaches think their third receiver is better than the opponent s third cornerback , that the tight end think new england s aaron hernandez and rob gronkowski is a brutal matchup for a linebacker , that a running back sent out for a pass is better than the linebacker forced to cover him once you extend a linebacker and get him out of the box , that s not his world , said herm edwards , the former jets and chiefs coach who is now an espn analyst you make somebody miss in space corners and safeties are used to running at angles , but linebackers' angles are different before , these formations were more prevalent in twominute situations , when teams were behind , but maybe you saw it 15 times a game now you might see it 30 times that certainly contributes to the terrible tackling that has plagued many defenses this season , compounding a problem that edwards said was created in large part by rules that limited practices in full pads , which in turn limited how much tackling could be worked on during training camp and the regular season with so few blockers staying in to pick up pass rushers , more quarterbacks are operating out of the shotgun , which gives them a little extra time to see where the pressure is coming from and to release the ball according to , 409 percent of all offensive snaps this season have been in the shotgun , a jump from 376 percent in 2010 and a huge spike from five years ago , when 195 percent of snaps were from the shotgun and more teams are at least occasionally using nohuddle offenses to stunt the defense s ability to substitute and , after fatigue sets in , rush the quarterback college quarterbacks are also better prepared to play in the nfl than ever before because of the offenses used in college we 're seeing more shotgun in college , so those quarterbacks transitioning into our league are familiar with it , new orleans saints coach sean payton said there was a stretch in the '90s or the early 2000s where there was concern about where all the great quarterbacks were i think it s as good as it s ever been right now even with the explosion of passing this season , the interception rate has remained constant , at around 3 percent of all pass attempts , and the sack rate has been steady at just over two per team per game defenses , then , must figure out how to counteract offenses that are dictating play that might be a difficult task , even though there are those who worry that if the nfl tilts too much to the pass , it will lose the physicality that is a major part of its appeal the only way i can think to address it is to loosen up the restrictions on defensive backs a little bit extend the 5yard bump area to 10 yards , to allow a little more contact downfield , said the former ravens coach brian billick , an analyst for fox and the nfl network that is unlikely , say members of the nfl s competition committee , which scrutinizes play at the end of every season to determine if rules changes are necessary the nfl has no desire to return to the style of the 1970s , when defenders had more freedom and the running game still dominated i certainly think we will discuss this trend , if in fact it continues , said john mara , the president of the giants and a member of the committee we always pay close attention to changes in how the game is played but i do not sense that there is any movement to change the rules on contact with receivers certainly not yet anyway , and i would be very surprised if that changes in the future the passes will continue to fly then and the records will fall

the dire state of the world economy reflects destructive actions on the part of many players still , the fact that so many have behaved badly should n't stop us from holding individual bad actors to account and that s what senate leaders will be doing this week , as they take up legislation that would threaten sanctions against china and other currency manipulators respectable opinion is aghast but respectable opinion has been consistently wrong lately , and the currency issue is no exception ask yourself why is it so hard to restore full employment \? it s true that the housing bubble has popped , and consumers are saving more than they did a few years ago but once upon a time america was able to achieve full employment without a housing bubble and with savings rates even higher than we have now what changed \? the answer is that we used to run much smaller trade deficits a return to economic health would look much more achievable if we were n't spending 500 billion more each year on imported goods and services than foreigners spent on our exports to get our trade deficit down , however , we need to make american products more competitive , which in practice means that we need the dollar s value to fall in terms of other currencies yes , some people will shriek about debasing the dollar but sensible policy makers have long known that sometimes a weaker currency means a stronger economy , and have acted on that knowledge switzerland , for example , has intervened massively to keep the franc from getting too strong against the euro israel has intervened even more forcefully to weaken the shekel the united states , given its special global role , ca n't and should n't be equally aggressive but given our economy s desperate need for more jobs , a weaker dollar is very much in our national interest and we can and should take action against countries that are keeping their currencies undervalued , and thereby standing in the way of a muchneeded decline in our trade deficit that , above all , means china and none of the arguments against holding china accountable can stand serious scrutiny some observers question whether we really know that china s currency is undervalued but they 're kidding , right \? the flip side of the manipulation that keeps china s currency undervalued is the accumulation of dollar reserves and those reserves now amount to a cool 32 trillion others warn of bad consequences if the chinese stop buying united states bonds but our problem right now is precisely that too many people want to park their money in american debt instead of buying goods and services which is why the interest rate on longterm us bonds is only 2 percent yet another objection is the claim that with usproduced goods the rebuttal is fairly technical let me just say that those making this argument both overstate the case and fail to take the indirect effects of chinese currency policy into account in the last few days a new objection to action on the china issue has surfaced rightwing pressure groups , notably the influential club for growth , oppose tariffs on chinese goods because , you guessed it , they 're a form of taxation and we must never , ever raise taxes under any circumstances all i can say is that democrats should welcome this demonstration that antitax fanaticism has reached the point where it trumps standing up for our national interests to be fair , there are some arguments against action on china that would carry some weight if the times were different one is the undoubted fact that inflation in china , which is raising labor costs in particular , is gradually eliminating that nation s currency undervaluation the operative word , however , is gradually something that brings the united states trade deficit down over four or five years is n't good enough when unemployment is at disastrous levels right now and the reality of the unemployment disaster is also my answer to those who warn that getting tough with china might unleash a trade war or damage world commercial diplomacy those are real risks , although i think they 're exaggerated but they need to be set against the fact not the mere possibility that high unemployment is inflicting tremendous cumulative damage as we speak ben bernanke , the chairman of the federal reserve , said it clearly last week unemployment is a national crisis , with so many workers now among the longterm unemployed that the economy is at risk of suffering longrun as well as shortrun damage and we ca n't afford to neglect any important means of alleviating that national crisis holding china accountable wo n't solve our economic problems on its own , but it can contribute to a solution and it s an action that s long overdue
kabul , afghanistan have carried out an extraordinary number of night raids over the past year , turning them into one of their most effective tools against the insurgents even as they stir accusations of abuse , resentment among afghans and divisions with the government last year s influx of coalition forces brought with it the kind of intelligence and surveillance that have enhanced the military s ability to conduct the night raids , which now average 300 a month , nato and afghan officials said hundreds of people have been killed and thousands detained in the raids over the past 18 months , they said there is no doubt that the raids have been devastating to the insurgency afghan officials and community elders in almost every frontline province say that known taliban commanders and even whole groups of fighters have been killed or captured , and that the raids have forced the taliban to operate in smaller cells and have shrunk their capacity military officials say the campaign has disrupted whole insurgent networks in rural districts and along infiltration routes , thereby reducing largescale attacks in the cities those night raids have broken the back of the taliban , said abdul satar mirzokhel , deputy governor of helmand province for three years until this spring most of their targets were very precise , aimed at the right people in the right places if there were mistakes , they were very few yet complaints from afghans persist about the raids , which are almost invariably carried out under a veil of secrecy by special operations forces , often accompanied by afghan commandos the raids remain one of the greatest sources of contention with president , who has shown growing signs of distress over their use and has repeatedly called for them to end gen , the commander of coalition forces in , has defended the raids in sometimes heated exchanges with mr karzai in may , apparently in recognition of the anger the raids had provoked , general petraeus ordered reviews of all tactical guidance for coalition troops and the causes of civilian casualties , and later of the conduct of night operations but neither general petraeus , who has overseen a steep increase in the use of the raids since taking command about a year ago , nor his successor is unlikely to slow the pace of the raids if anything , the military s dependence on the night raids , which use relatively small teams of special forces , may only increase as the united states reduces its troops over the next three years accounts of the raids from the military and afghan civilians often differ widely in one example , family members and an afghan investigator said that two clerics were among eight civilians killed in a raid last november by american special operations forces in mian , a village in a remote district of the southern province of kandahar muhammad younus , 60 , said in an interview that he was so badly beaten by american soldiers that he could not walk for 20 days villagers carried him out in a wheelbarrow and took him the next morning to see the bodies of his two brothers , the clerics maulavi abdul kabir , 72 , and maulavi abdul rauf , 65 they had been burned so badly , they were barely recognizable , and they bore bullet wounds , he said lt cmdr ron flesvig , a spokesman for the international security assistance force , confirmed the raid and that eight people had been killed he forwarded comments from the special operations public affairs office , dismissing the allegations as unfounded and without merit an investigation was unable to locate anyone who could or would provide a name of any civilian alleged to have been wounded or killed during the operation , the public affairs office statement said the american forces' actions in mian over a 24hour period nonetheless incensed the wider community and raised questions about the veracity of the military s reporting military officials say that they get their target 80 percent of the time , and that less than 1 percent of the raids lead to civilian casualties yet there is no way to independently verify those figures , since the raids are conducted in great secrecy and are underreported any investigations by the military into the raids are not made public the united nations examined a number of night raids from 2010 in four districts in kandahar , where the insurgency was intense elders and local afghans said the raids were generally precise and caused fewer civilian casualties than before , according to georgette gagnon , director of the human rights unit of the  but the mission also noted in its 2010 annual report that excessive use of force , ill treatment , death and injury to civilians and damage to property has occurred in some cases involving special forces the method of the raids , especially the forced entry of houses and invasion of women s quarters , let alone killing of women , is deeply offensive culturally to afghans although coalition forces say most raids are conducted using a soft knock calling by loudspeaker for people to come out there are still numerous accounts of forced entry and cases of men being shot in their beds next to their wives the raids and attendant sweeping arrests have become the primary complaint of rural communities , human rights officials say when lt col aziz ahmad took up a new job as police chief of shah joy district in the southeastern province of zabul , townspeople asked immediately what he could do to stop the night raids just two weeks earlier american forces had raided the house of a taliban member at night and killed him and his wife , leaving four small children alone we are trying to find relatives to take care of them , the police chief said it turns people against the government and the foreign forces , he said erica gaston of the open society institute , who is compiling a new report on night raids , said that while in general night raids had become more accurate , and that the conduct of forces had improved , she still encountered cases of unarmed people being shot in the head , or being shot when doing things like picking up a cellphone , running away or rushing to help a wounded relative people in the villages are more scared of the americans than of the taliban because of these raids , said gul badshah majidi , a legislator from the eastern province of paktia in zabul province , to the south , the afghan army commander , gen jamaluddin sayed , said that one of the reasons villagers were joining the local police program was not just to keep the taliban out , but also to prevent raids on their houses nato officials have dismissed many of the allegations from afghans as taliban propaganda they cite cases of taliban members ordering local elders to call officials and even president karzai with fictitious reports of civilian casualties but the military is intent on mitigating political fallout and training afghans to take over leadership of the raids the task of reviewing the raids and civilian casualties was given to maj gen john w nicholson , deputy chief of staff for operations in afghanistan , who said that coalition forces were already revising procedures and retraining troops on night operations they are now using afghan soldiers to call people out of their homes , and female soldiers to safeguard women and children , he said there was no sign of such practices during the raid by special operations forces and afghan forces in late november in mian the american and afghan forces arrived by helicopters at 11 pm and stayed for 24 hours , detaining all the men in one house and interrogating and beating a number of them , people in the village said before they asked me a question , they started kicking and beating me , mr younus , the 60yearold , said , adding that americans did the beating and interrogation mr younus , a diabetic who walks with a cane , said he was beaten on and off through the night and fainted four times do n't tell us about your sickness , we are going to kill you and your brothers and destroy your houses , he recalls being told through a translator an adviser minister to president karzai on tribal affairs , muhammad siddique aziz , who headed the afghan investigation into the episode , said that none of those killed had been taliban and that he had had bitter discussions with an american special forces general over his findings we told him that the activities you are doing are not in the interest of you nor of the karzai government , he said whoever did this raid , why do they have to kill people \? why did they not just arrest them \?

the republican presidential debates of 2011 have served as highstakes introductions for several of the party s oval office hopefuls as the republican field slowly expanded this summer now , it s rick perry s turn on wednesday evening , mr perry , the governor of texas , will face off against seven other candidates michele bachmann , herman cain , newt gingrich , jon m huntsman jr , ron paul , mitt romney and rick santorum during a debate at the reagan library in simi valley , calif but none of his rivals will be under the microscope or wearing as large a target as mr perry in three short weeks since becoming a candidate , mr perry has become the new frontrunner and the media focus on his record and his comments has robbed the other candidates of political oxygen as a result , mr perry enters the debate , which begins at 8 pm on wednesday , with a lot to gain from a solid performance , but also a lot to lose among donors , activists , the republican establishment if he stumbles or seems out of the mainstream the governor s aides have spent several days trying to lower expectations by arguing that mr perry has not had that much experience on a highstakes debate stage despite his decade as his state s chief executive ray sullivan , the governor s communications director , said on msnbc s daily rundown on wednesday morning that mr perry had participated in only four bigtime debates mr sullivan said the governor is better at speeches and smallgroup retail politics the need for mr perry to prove himself and for his rivals to elbow for attention and stop his momentum could spell a more spirited debate on wednesday here are five things to watch for during the twohour show 1 how does perry perform \? a veteran politician , mr perry s stump speech is polished and his manner is easygoing after just weeks on the campaign trail if that rick perry shows up at the debate , he may have a good night but beyond style , mr perry is likely to be confronted with a series of substantive questions that could affect the public s early perception of his candidacy his writings about social security , gays , guns , religion and abortion are likely to be prime targets for the nbc and politico journalists who are hosting the forum and his rivals may decide that the best way to get the camera to swing in their direction is to attack mr perry that could come from mrs bachmann , whose struggling campaign has lost momentum and a campaign manager since mr perry entered the race or it could come from mr huntsman , whose poll numbers are in the basement part of mr perry s challenge during the debate is to send a message to the republican party s mainstream establishment that he can be a standardbearer for the entire party , not just a conservative wing that is appealing in the deep south if wealthy donors and republican insiders conclude that mr perry s politics are too narrow to win an election against president obama , that could be a problem as the governor competes against mr romney but the early polls suggest that mr perry is already beginning to satisfy a broader constituency a survey by abc and the washington post this week showed mr perry beating mr romney on what has been perceived as perhaps mr romney s greatest strength the idea that he is the most electable of the republican candidates seeking to replace mr obama mr perry now leads mr romney on that question , by a margin of 30 percent to 20 percent that result comes as mr perry is still not very well known , however , which makes his performance on wednesday night that much more important a shaky showing could turn those electability numbers around quickly 2 romneyperry smackdown \? the most watchedfor clash of the night is the one that might materialize between mr perry and mr romney with mrs bachmann fading in the polls \( and with sarah palin still on the sidelines \) , attention is increasingly focused on the possibility of a twoperson race between the two men after weeks of completely ignoring his rivals , mr romney has altered his stump speech to question mr perry s qualifications his new line attacks mr perry s decade as governor of texas by saying that career politicians got us into this mess career politicians aren t going to get us out that line is almost sure to escape mr romney s lips , perhaps during an opening statement but will he get tougher than that and attack mr perry directly \? that may depend on how mr perry acts the brash , texas politician has shown less hesitance to focus his commentary directly at mr romney , saying that while he was the governor of massachusetts he didn t create many jobs 3 jobs , jobs , jobs the president s looming jobs speech all but ensures that the topic of jobs will play a central role in wednesday s debate , even though the speech was moved to thursday night the moderators of the debate are sure to ask all of the candidates about their plans to create jobs and turn the economy around that will give each one an opportunity to spell out what they are for , and another opportunity to bash mr obama s economic policies mr romney on tuesday announced a 59point plan that he said would generate jobs and help the economy recover it is almost a certainty that he will try to mention at least some of the 59 on wednesday \( mr romney is a fan of powerpoint presentations , but the rules of the debate probably do not allow any multimedia props \) all of the candidates recognize that confronting the jobs crisis is an opportunity for the republicans as anger and frustration over the issue has helped drive down mr obama s poll numbers in recent months but the issue is not one that provides much contrast between the candidates one exception is ron paul , whose libertarian views on the best economic path forward often make him the outlier on the stage 4 reagan s legacy it has almost become a clich for leading republican politicians to claim reagan s mantle but it is especially true at a debate hosted at a library dedicated to reagan s presidency and nancy reagan , his widow , is expected to be at the debate , probably in the front row but even reagan is not a subject that is free from division , as was proved on tuesday by a spat between the two texans , mr paul and mr perry mr paul ran a television ad in iowa and new hampshire that compared him to reagan , saying both men were considered unelectable he notes his own support for reagan s campaign and accuses mr perry of supporting the early campaigns of al gore  al gore found a cheerleader in texas named rick perry rick perry helped lead al gore s campaign to undo the reagan revolution , mr paul s ad says mr perry s campaign shot back quickly , unearthing a letter that mr paul wrote in 1987 in which he resigns from the republican party ronald reagan and the republican party have given us skyrocketing deficits , and astoundingly a doubled national debt , mr paul wrote in 1987 a spokesman for mr perry said that rep paul s letter is a broadside attack on every element of president reagan s record and philosophy with that as a backdrop , expect a bit of talk about reagan at the debate 5  if the labor day weekend proved anything , it is that the republican candidates for president are still eager to woo the tea party movement that proved to be a force in politics during the 2010 midterm elections mr romney , who had not embraced the movement as openly as many of his rivals , spent the weekend at a new hampshire rally for a tea party group and attended a forum in south carolina sponsored by the state s leading tea party politicians ms palin also spoke at tea party rallies in iowa and new hampshire over the weekend the question may be how much the candidates put that effort on hold wednesday night in front of an audience on msnbc that might not have much in common with tea party advocates \( just a few days later , in florida , cnn is cohosting another debate with a national tea party group \) question for readers what part of mr perry s record do you think needs exploration by the journalists and his rivals on wednesday night \?

dallas it was all happening for a little past the halfway point of the fourth quarter of what he had called the biggest game of his 26 years on the fast break , a quick look meant a layup for udonis haslem , a 1point lead for miami and for james a 10th assist and a tripledouble , the measure of allaround excellence inside the american airlines center , of the finals seemed to be in james s gifted hands , and all he had to do to quiet the legion of king s critics was hold on but a little more than five game minutes later , he was back where he started , starring as the alleged perpetrator in a harsh nba championship series reality show , basketball crimes and misdemeanors tripledouble means absolutely nothing in a loss , james admitted after another endgame shrinkage in the spotlight that follows him everywhere , from one network to another , television to twitter at the end of the day , all it s about is a win or a loss at the end of another riveting nba finals night , it was dallas 112 , miami 103 for a 32 series lead , with the next biggest game of james s life scheduled for sunday night in miami now or never , he posted on twitter early thursday morning if anything , the distortion served to magnify how much weight james must feel upon the back that years ago was branded with the chosen 1 burden of incalculable expectation in fairness to james , he was a news media phenomenon as far back as high school and he did n't create himself now the onslaught of inspection has become as awkward and distasteful as last summer s decision on espn , which in recent days has taken to running a continuous reel of james s fourthquarter failures in the finals that s some thanks from the worldwide leader for the ratings bonanza provided by james everyone but the people in the black road uniforms seems to have turned on him now , and maybe his teammates are next in news conferences , with dwyane wade or without , the accusatory questions are posed with the gravity more befitting a congressman caught with his pants down than a ballplayer who merely divorced his home territory for a sexier basketball hotbed really now , james s abandonment of northern ohio was n't even the worstexecuted or worsttimed exit in the modern freeagent history of the nba in 1996 , shaquille o'neal chose the day before the summer olympics in atlanta and the day after twa flight 800 exploded off the new york coast to announce he was leaving landlocked orlando for los angeles o'neal retired recently to a universal ovation , but that was a reflection of his four championships including one in miami five years ago with wade over and the mavericks and our unquenchable thirst for winners in that series , the mavericks were ahead , two games to none , and had a substantial lead in game 3 before dropping four straight is this amazing series , in which miami blew a 15point fourthquarter edge in game 2 , a rerun of 2006 in reverse \? not that it s over the mavericks know that goes home now , or to his adopted home , miami probably being the only city on earth that is n't thrilled to watch him and stumble to the finish of the playoff marathon after three brilliant rounds , of fourthquarter heroics that had all heat haters bracing for a south beach parade , james has lost confidence in his jump shot when that happens , the few holes in his game lack of a left hand to use in the post and an uncertain midrange game are magnified i could have made more plays for my team , he said in an acknowledgement that 17 points , 10 rebounds and 10 assists in game 5 were n't enough considering the hip injury that slowed wade and james s inability to shine as the mavericks closed with a 174 burst with the score tied , 100100 , he missed a leftside jumper over 38yearold with the mavericks leading , 102100 , he ran over the defensively inspiring tyson chandler on the left baseline after a nifty setup by wade with the same score , he settled for and misfired on a 3pointer early in the shot clock as in game 4 , jason terry got the better of james at the other end of the floor when it mattered most kidd and a little pest named j j barea hit the big shots from beyond the arc that james did not as compelling a story as he has become , dallas is evolving into a better one , the perfect foil for the microwave heat , whose leveraged stars promised not to chill until they produced a multitude of titles the aging mavericks , who remind us that there is no i or chosen 1 in team , seem ruthlessly locked on the here and now we 're not a team that you can pencil in for six or seven deep runs in the playoffs , said donnie nelson , the general manager and president of basketball operations because of that , there s a feeling of desperation so , too , with james , but for different reasons given his youth , he does n't need these next two games to establish a legacy as much as he does to spare himself the ordeal of having to go through this all over again the daily dissection the public pressure the horde of reporters pushing into the miami locker room after game 5 just to watch him sit with both feet in a bucket of ice while he fooled with his blackberry as did wade , directly across the small dressing area , but it was n't him that twitter was mocking in the way it was already abuzz about james s morning declaration and the spoiled outcome wade has his title fair or not , and it is reaching the point where it is not , this noring circus of scrutiny and scorn continues until or if james gets at least one , too
something far more notable happened tuesday night in detroit than simply a playoff baseball game sure , the tigers' 52 victory over the rangers in game 3 of the american league championship series was riveting enough , even if all you did was contemplate the personal expansion of the tigers' miguel cabrera dude , little caesars pizza does n't need another mascot and what on earth the rangers' colby lewis was thinking by throwing the ball anywhere near cabrera s bat in the fifth inning no , the real eyeopener was watching the tigers delmon young has been trying to play through an oblique injury victor martinez strained an intercostal muscle hitting a home run magglio ordonez might start feeling kind of wimpy sitting out with a fractured ankle they have triage set up in their dugout jim leyland is sizing up the bat boys' potential to go from first to third on a single ok , so maybe they 're not impressing hockey players , but this is baseball , where a blister can sit a guy down for two weeks and no one blinks so , yes , people are impressed with this gritty band of tigers , , and best of all , , they are n't whining about their run of bad fortune instead , , they are embracing their image as resilient tough guys you can almost picture them coming out of the dugout doing the monty python we 're not dead yet ! routine not that they did n't get a little help from the rangers on tuesday night there is the baffling matter of lewis pitching to cabrera in the fifth inning with a base open , which is still marveling at , and that it was the rangers' undoing other rangers fans are wondering just where michael young s swing disappeared to , detroit also got a nice lift from starter doug fister , whose acquisition in a trade keeps rising on the genius meter , the national league championship series shifts to st louis on wednesday night , which means that all eyes will be watching for the rally squirrel unfortunately , the only place you are likely to see him is on the to their fans , as four of the furry fellows have been caught in the traps set by busch stadium groundskeepers if the rally squirrel does not make an appearance on the field , it might be because he has taken to \( at least in milwaukee \) mixed in with the rodent watch and injury updates , baseball also offers the great theo epstein drama , as the red sox general manager to flee for the chicago cubs that other media outlets are reporting that his deal could be worth 15 million over five years , with cursebreaking an apparently lucrative field these days the job of nfl head coach is also increasingly lucrative , and jim harbaugh is making an argument that he is worth every penny for the 49ers , for one , he can get people talking about something else other than tim tebow the great tebow watch took its anticipated turn tuesday with coach john fox declaring him the starter for the broncos' next game it was , , the only move fox could make because the broncos are going nowhere this season and they have to find out if tebow can play his success , though , also rests with the coaches preparing him for the job ,  college football coaches are getting their fair share of attention , whether they want it or not that one of them is none other than ron zook , who has lodged illinois in the national conversation at 60 and steve spurrier has people casting sideways glances at him in south carolina the , as necessary and probably inevitable as it was , is , with spurrier launching at a local columnist at the news conference a college coaching story with real sadness in it comes from valparaiso , where the retired coach homer drew revealed that , have cancer now that is a real medical crisis the tigers' one falls in the baseballonly variety and it s a rare one that s fun to watch
about a month ago , i published a pair of articles \( see part i and part ii \) that focused on the predictive value of polls conducted in the early stage of the presidential primary process specifically , it looked at national polls conducted in january through june of the year before the primaries for example , polls taken in january through june 1987 for the 1988 nomination races the articles were mainly descriptive , commenting on each primary cycle individually now it s time to look at the data in a more holistic way but first , some housekeeping since originally publishing the articles , micah cohen and i have done some additional quality control on our polling database one significant ambiguity concerned cases where a pollster tested multiple scenarios within the same poll for instance , versions of the 2008 democratic primary field with and without al gore running we had been handling these cases inconsistently so instead , when these situations arise , we re now including each of the different scenarios in the averages , but assigning them a fractional weight for instance , if a pollster tested four different versions of primary matchups with different sets of candidates running , we d count them each at onequarter weight in addition , we ve combed through various online and offline resources and identified quite a few polls that we had been missing originally and we ve dropped the 1992 republican primary from the analysis , because there were no polls conducted of that race until just a couple of months before the iowa caucus the revisions to the database don t affect the big picture much \( that is , the relative standing of the different candidates hasn t changed materially \) nevertheless , you can find a table containing the updated data here or download a spreadsheet version here \( xls file \) ok , now for the fun part one way we can visualize this data is to compare a candidate s standing in the early polls to the share of the popular vote he eventually received throughout the primary process the correlation is far from perfect there are candidates like rudolph w giuliani who polled strongly but got no traction at all once voters began to cast their ballots , and there are candidates like jimmy carter who won their nominations despite having almost no early popular support but the correlation is also far from zero \( in fact , it s a moderately strong 072 \) we can also place the candidates into different tiers based on how they placed in the early polling average there is a fairly strong relationship between the candidates polling and the number of states and votes they won during the primary process as well as their chances of winning the nomination of the seven candidates to poll at 35 percent or higher in the early polling average , five \( or 71 percent \) won their nominations , the exceptions being hillary rodham clinton in 2008 and ted kennedy in 1980 meanwhile , 31 percent of the candidates polling at 20 to 35 percent won their nominations , as did 13 percent of those polling at 10 to 20 percent , 4 percent of those polling at 5 to 10 percent , and so forth this relationship can be generalized by means of a logistic regression analysis a candidate polling at 1 percent at this stage of the primary race has about a 2 percent chance of winning his party s nomination , other factors being equal a candidate polling at 10 percent , meanwhile , has only a 6 percent chance but the probability begins to accelerate more rapidly once a candidate hits about 25 percent in the polling average and once he reaches the low 30s , he becomes more likely than not to win the nomination one could take a variety of more sophisticated approaches with this data for instance , by accounting in some way for the relative standing of the candidates in addition to their raw numbers nevertheless , this underscores that it s simply quite wrong to suggest \( as some smart people have \) that early primary polls are meaningless instead , they have a reasonable amount of predictive power a more defensible hypothesis might be that one should account for any number of objective and subjective factors in addition to the national polls it also might be the case that an expert could reliably identify candidates who were considerably stronger or weaker than suggested by their polling alone i m more dogmatic than most analysts about sticking to objective approaches , but i certainly would not argue that donald j trump is more likely to win the republican nomination than tim pawlenty , despite the fact that mr trump now places well ahead of him in national surveys one factor that probably can improve one s predictions is accounting for name recognition in addition to collecting the polling averages for past primary candidates , we also developed estimates of how widely a candidate s name was recognized in the early stages of a primary campaign \( organizations like gallup frequently publish this data \) suppose , for example , that we divide the candidates into two cohorts a high name recognition group \( everyone with name recognition of 60 percent or higher at the beginning of the primary process \) and a low name recognition one \( everyone else \) the highrecognition candidates performed better on the whole 10 percent of them won their nomination , as compared to 4 percent for the lowrecognition group however , the lowrecognition candidates performed better relative to their polling average  a highly recognized candidate who finds himself in an inferior position in the polls is in a great deal of trouble of the 67 highrecognition candidates who were polling in the single digits , none won their nomination in fact , only three of them won so much as a single state , and they averaged just 09 percent of the popular vote the odds are also against a lowrecognition candidate who is polling in the single digits but those candidates at least have a fighting chance 4 percent of them won their nominations and more than a dozen won at least one state , and they averaged 38 percent of the popular vote we can also run separate regression
